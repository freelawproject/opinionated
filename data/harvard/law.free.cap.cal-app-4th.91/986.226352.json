J.</author>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">This case involves a postpayment audit of a Medi-Cal provider\u2019s claims. Such audits are required under both federal and state law. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 447.45(f)(2), 456.3 (2000); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14170, subd. (a)(1).) No Medi-Cal payments were withheld from the provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">The California Department of Health Services (DHS) administers MediCal, the federal Medicaid program in California. The DHS contracted with the California State Controller\u2019s office (the Controller) to audit Medi-Cal payments to providers. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, is the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicaid program. On December 17, 1999, the HCFA, a federal agency, specifically approved in writing the DHS\u2019s delegation of audit authority to the Controller.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">This appeal is from a judgment granting a peremptory writ of administrative mandate directed at defendant, the Director of the DHS. The peremptory writ of mandate requires the DHS to set aside its final decision in the administrative appeal of RCJ Medical Services, Inc. (RCJ), \u201cinsofar as it relies upon the audit findings of the State Controller . . . .\u201d RCJ contends federal Medicaid law, and specifically the single state agency requirement, precludes the DHS\u2019s delegation of audit authority to the Controller.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question in this case is whether the HCFA\u2019s December 17, 1999, written approval of the DHS\u2019s delegation of audit responsibility to the Controller is based on a reasonable construction of the federal statutory single state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>agency provision and the implementing regulation. We defer to the HCFA\u2019s construction of the federal law that it administers as reflected in its action of December 17, 1999. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">II. Federal Medicaid Law</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">In 1965, Congress enacted title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Medicaid Act) to provide medical assistance to needy persons. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.) The purpose of the act was to provide a nationwide program of medical assistance for low-income families and individuals. <em>(Schweiker v. Hogan </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 569, 571 [102 S.Ct. 2597, 2600, 73 L.Ed.2d 227]; <em>West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey </em>(3d Cir. 1989) 885 F.2d 11, 15, affd. (1991) 499 U.S. 83 [111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68].)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">A. <em>The Medi-Cal Program and the Single State Agency Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals described the joint federal-state operation of the Medicaid program and the single state agency requirement in <em>Bethphage Lutheran Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Weicker </em>(2d Cir. 1992) 965 F.2d 1239, 1240 as follows: \u201cMedicaid, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq., </em>is a cooperative federal-state program through which the federal government provides financial assistance to the states so that the states may furnish medical, rehabilitation, and other services to certain low-income persons. Participation in Medicaid is voluntary, but participating states must comply with certain requirements imposed by the Medicaid Act and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u2018the Secretary\u2019). For a state to qualify for federal assistance, the Secretary, customarily acting through the Health Care Finance Administration (\u2018HCFA\u2019), must approve a State Plan for medical assistance, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a), that contains a comprehensive statement describing the nature and the scope of the state\u2019s program. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.10 (1989). The plan must designate a single state agency to supervise or administer the State Plan. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(5).\u201d (Accord, <em>West Virginia University Hospitals., Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey, supra, </em>885 F.2d at p. 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">1. <em>The Federal Single State Agency Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">The single state agency requirement is set forth in a federal statute. Pursuant to title 42 of the United States Code section 1396a(a)(5)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, a state participating in the federal Medicaid program must establish a state plan that meets stated requirements. Among other things, the state plan must \u201cprovide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>for the establishment or designation of a <em>single State agency </em>to administer or to supervise the administration of the plan . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The single state agency requirement originally appeared in the Social Security Act of 1935 with reference to the Title I Old-Age Assistance Program. (Act of Aug. 14, 1935, ch. 531, \u00a7 2, 49 Stat. 620.) The single state agency language was incorporated into title XIX when the Medicaid program was enacted in 1965. (Pub.L. No. 89-97, 1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at pp. 305, 371; <em>Sobky </em>v. <em>Smoley </em>(E.D.Cal. 1994) 855 F.Supp. 1123, 1145.) The purposes of the single state agency requirement have been described in various ways. In <em>Rolland v. Cellucci </em>(D.Mass. 1999) 52 F.Supp.2d 231, 243, the district court held: \u201cThe single state agency mandate arose out of Congress\u2019 desire to minimize the improper denial of benefits and to ensure a certain level of services and quality of care. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>665 F.Supp. 1164, 1177 (E.D.Pa. 1987). The mandate accomplishes these goals by limiting the authority to make administrative decisions to a single state agency. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(l)(ii). . . . [T]he \u2018single state agency\u2019 requirement derives from a desire to focus accountability for plan operation, <em>Hillburn by Hillburn v. Maher, </em>795 F.2d 252, 261 (2d Cir. 1986); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(5); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 431.1 and 431.10 . . . .\u201d In <em>Sobky v. Smoley, supra, </em>855 F.Supp. at page 1145, Judge David F. Levi wrote, \u201cThe legislative history of the 1965 Medicaid Act\u2019s single state agency requirement\u201442 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(5)\u2014maintains this concentration on administrative efficiency.\u201d (Accord, <em>Hillburn by Hillburn </em>v. <em>Maher, supra, </em>795 F.2d at pp. 260-261.) Judge Levi concluded after House and Senate amendments were factored into the competing evidence of legislative intent that Congress\u2019s adoption of the single state agency was because, \u201cadministrative efficiency appears to have been the overriding purpose . . . .\u201d <em>(Sobky </em>v. <em>Smoley, supra, </em>855 F.Supp. at p. 1145.) In <em>Fulkerson v. Com\u2019r, Maine Dept. of Human Services </em>(D.Me. 1992) 802 F.Supp. 529, 538, the district court held: \u201cIt appears that the reason for this requirement was to assure \u2018that the States will not administer the provisions for services in a way which adversely affects the availability or the quality of the care to be provided\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>and \u2018to avoid a lack of accountability for the appropriate operation of the program.\u2019 <em>Hillburn v. Maher[, supra,] </em>795 F.2d [at p.] 261 . . . (quoting in part S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess.

(36 Fed.Reg. 3861-3862 (Feb. 27, 1971).) It was originally promulgated, however, in a supplement to a federal handbook issued upon enactment of the Medicaid Act\u2014the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Welfare Administration, Bureau of Family Services, Handbook of Public Assistance Administration (Handbook), Supplement D\u2014Medical Assistance Programs Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, D-2130 (June 17, 1966) (Supplement D). The purpose of the Handbook was described as follows: \u201cThe Handbook of Public Assistance Administration is issued by the Bureau of Family Services and is the official medium for issuance of interpretations and instructions concerning requirements of the public assistance titles of the Social Security Act and recommendations for the administration of State public assistance programs. The Handbook is prepared for use by State agencies and staff of the Federal agency in carrying out their responsibilities for administering the public assistance programs in accordance with the Federal Act.\u201d (Handbook, <em>supra, </em>Introduction (June 12, 1963).)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>Supplement D stated in part: \u201c[^\u00a1] 2. In relationships with other departments of State government, the single State agency interprets its role in such a way that it does not delegate to other than its own officials its requisite ultimate authority for exercising administrative judgment in the State-wide administration or supervision of the plan. [^] 3. In the event that any rules and regulations or decisions of the single State agency are subject to review, clearance, or other action by other offices or agencies of the State government, the requisite authority of the single State agency is not impaired. flQ 4. In the event that any services are performed for the single State agency by other State or local agencies or offices, such other agencies or offices are not authorized to, and do not, change, disapprove, or delay action on any administrative decision of the single State agency, or otherwise substitute their judgment for that of the agency as to the application of policies, rules, and regulations promulgated by the State agency. fl[] 5. Any agreements with other public agencies or private organizations to act as the single State agency\u2019s agent include provisions for the single State agency obtaining from the agent the data needed for program planning, evaluation, reporting, and accounting purposes and do not in any way impair the <em>ultimate authority </em>of the single State agency. . . .\u201d (Handbook, <em>supra, </em>Supp. D, D-2130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The foregoing Supplement D provisions were transferred to the Code of Federal Regulations in 1971. (36 Fed.Reg. 3860, 3861-3862.) The 1971 regulation stated in pertinent part: \u201c(c) <em>Conditions for implementing the requirements of paragraph (a) [state plan </em>requirements] <em>of this section. </em>(1) The State agency will not delegate to other than its own officials its authority for exercising administrative discretion in the administration or supervision of the plan, including the issuance of policies, rules, and regulations on program matters, [ftl (2) In the event that any rules and regulations or decisions of the single State agency are subject to review, clearance, or other action by other offices or agencies of the State government, the requisite authority of the single State agency will not be impaired. [H] (3) In the event that any services are preformed for the single State agency by other State or local agencies or offices, such agencies and offices must not have authority to review, change, or disapprove any administrative decision of the single State agency, or otherwise substitute their judgment for that of the agency as. to the application of policies, rules, and regulations promulgated by the State agency.\u201d (36 Fed.Reg. 3861-3862 (Feb. 27, 1971.) The current regulation, quoted above, mirrors the language of both Supplement D and the 1971 regulation without substantive change.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">In addition to the above quoted language ultimately transferred to the Code of Federal Regulations, Supplement D contained a lengthy discussion of the single state agency requirement. There has been no showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>discussion was ever published in the Code of Federal Regulations or the Federal Register. Therefore, that discussion does not rise to the level of a federal rule or regulation carrying the force and effect of law. <em>(Western Radio Services Co., Inc. v.

Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has frequently cited to the Handbook as a source of federal agency interpretation of the Medicaid Act and other Social Security Act public assistance programs. (See, e.g., <em>Lukhard v.

It is the agency of the State government responsible for: obtaining the statutory authority necessary to submit a plan meeting all Federal requirements; preparing the State plan and establishing policies for the operation of the program; assuring that it can carry out the plan in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>political subdivisions; obtaining the State funds or the State-local funds (as the case may be); meeting all audit requirements; and <em>being accountable to the [Federal </em>agency] <em>for the proper and efficient administration of the program. </em>flf] The provision for a \u2018single State agency\u2019 is not designed to set aside the relationships with the Governor and other officers of the State or with other departments of the State government that are normal and proper within the State. The agency designated as the \u2018single State agency\u2019 is still subject to the ordinary legislative processes, executive supervision, and budget and audit procedures in the State. <em>Other agencies and offices of State government, such as the State fiscal officer and the State civil service agency, may perform services for the single State agency that are essential to the operation of the plan. Another agency or authority of government in the State, however, may not be authorized in the plan, or permitted in practice, to substitute its judgment for that of the \u2018single State agency\u2019 in administrative decisions involving the application of the policies, rules, and regulations promulgated by the State agency. </em>Similarly, if local agencies administer the plan, the \u2018single State agency\u2019 must see that the authority of such agencies to make administrative decisions under the medical assistance law is not impaired by the action of other agencies or officials of State or local governments, [f] . . . [U] <em>The \u2018single State agency\u2019 is responsible for any services that are preformed by other agencies in the program under the plan. This does not mean that the State agency takes over or directs such services.

The HCFA regional administrator has the authority to approve state plans and plan amendments. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 430.15(b) (2000).) Pursuant to title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 430.15(a)(1) (2000), \u201cDeterminations as to whether State plans (including plan amendments and administrative practice under plans) originally meet or continue to meet the requirements for approval are based on relevant Federal statutes and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">III. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">The underlying facts are undisputed. California submitted its state Medicaid plan to the HCFA in 1993. The state plan identified the DHS as the single state Medicaid agency for all purposes including auditing payments to providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">On July 1, 1997, the DHS and the Controller entered into an interagency agreement \u201cfor the purpose of increasing the State\u2019s auditing ability to identify and recover California Medical Assistance Program (Medi-Cal Program) overpayments . . . .\u201d The interagency agreement authorized the Controller \u201cto perform audit services relating to the Medi-Cal Program,\u201d including, in the event of an overpayment, to send a repayment demand to the provider together with a copy of the audit report. The Controller was <em>not </em>authorized <em>as DHS\u2019s representative </em>to withhold payments to providers. However, if the Controller initiated a withhold \u201cunder its own [state law] authority,\u201d it was required to notify the DHS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Acting under the interagency agreement, the Controller conducted a review of RCJ\u2019s Medi-Cal claims for the period from January 9, 1997, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>October 9, 1997, and a subsequent review for the period from October 10, 1997, to March 26, 1998. The Controller issued final audit <em>overpayment </em>findings in reports dated March 10, 1998, and May 4, 1998. RCJ requested an administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">On July 1, 1998, the DHS and the Controller entered into an amended interagency agreement. Under the amended interagency agreement, the Controller retained authority to audit Medi-Cal claims by providers and to send repayment demands. However, with respect to the power to <em>withhold </em>payments from a provider, the July 1, 1998, amended interagency agreement provided, \u201cOnly DHS may initiate a withhold of a provider\u2019s Medi-Cal funds during a review, audit, or investigation.\u201d The present case involves only an overpayment determination. The Controller did not withhold any funds from RCJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">On February 1, 1999, Division Seven of the Court of Appeal for this appellate district issued its opinion in <em>Doctor\u2019s Medical Laboratory, Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number><em>Connell </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 891, 896-898 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 829]. In <em>Doctor\u2019s, </em>the Controller withheld payments to a provider. Our Division Seven colleagues held the Controller could not lawfully exercise the power to audit or to withhold Medi-Cal payments to providers. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The California Supreme Court denied review. The remittitur issued on May 26, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">By letter dated March 19, 1999, after the <em>Doctor\u2019s </em>decision was filed, the DHS asked the HCFA to review the July 1, 1998, amended interagency agreement and to \u201cconfirm our opinion about the allowability of the [inter-agency agreement] activities under the Medicaid program.\u201d By letter dated on or about March 24, 1999, Sally Richardson, Director, Center for Medicaid and State Operations, HCFA, responded to the DHS\u2019s request. Ms. Richardson\u2019s letter, written on behalf of the HCFA, concluded that the amended interagency agreement was \u201cfully compliant with federal single State agency requirements.\u201d Further, Ms. Richardson concluded, \u201c[W]e see nothing in [the interagency agreement] that gives [the Controller] discretionary authority that would violate the single State agency requirements at 42 CFR 431.10.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>On April 1, 1999, an administrative law judge issued a proposed decision in RCJ\u2019s appeal. On June 7, 1999, the DHS rejected the proposed decision. On August 5, 1999, following a review of the administrative record, the DHS issued its final decision. On October 28, 1999, RCJ filed its writ petition in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">On December 17, 1999, the DHS submitted a state plan amendment to the HCFA. The amended state plan provided in relevant part, \u201cThe State Controller\u2019s Office will perform audits of Medi-Cal expenditures on behalf of DHS and will submit its findings and recommendations to DHS for appropriate action.\u201d The DHS requested an effective date of July 1, 1998. Also on December 17, 1999, the HCFA approved the state plan amendment with an effective date of July 1, 1998, as requested. The HCFA\u2019s letter, signed by Karen Fuller, stated in relevant part: \u201c[The state plan amendment] amends the State plan to reflect the fact that the State Controller\u2019s Office performs audits of Medi-Cal expenditures on behalf of the Department of Health Services (DHS). [1[] Our review of [the state plan amendment] was conducted in accordance with the requirements of section 1902(a)(5) of the Social Security Act (the Act) and the regulatory provisions at 42 CFR 431.10 and 431.11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">On May 19, 2000, the trial court issued the peremptory writ of mandate in this case.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">A. <em>Private Right of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The DHS contends RCJ has no \u201cprivate right of action\u201d to enforce the single state agency requirement embodied in the federal statute (\u00a7 1396a(a)(5)) and its implementing regulation (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e) (2000)). The DHS discusses federal decisional authority concerning whether a health care provider may bring an action under title 42 of the United States Code section 1983, to challenge state practices under the Medicaid Act. (See <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Virginia Hospital Assn., supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 501 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2513]; <em>Sobky v. Smoley, supra, </em>855 F.Supp. at pp. 1130-1133.) Those decisions are inapposite. RCJ does not seek to enforce a private right of action under title 42 of the United States Code section 1983, or otherwise. Rather, RCJ seeks judicial review of a final administrative decision arising from a Medi-Cal audit pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Welfare and Institutions Code section 14171, subdivision (j), specifically authorizes such review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> RCJ\u2019s writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 is the proper means by which a Medi-Cal provider may challenge an individual audit decision. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14171, subd. (j); <em>Florence Western Medical Clinic </em>v. <em>Bonta' </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 493, 502-503, fn. 8 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 609]; <em>Frankel </em>v. <em>Kizer </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 743, 750 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 268].) The DHS does <em>not </em>contend the issue presented here is beyond the scope of the issues that may be raised upon judicial review pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 14171, subdivision (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">B. <em>Doctor\u2019s Medical Laboratory, Inc. v. Connell Is Not Controlling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">RCJ, by its writ petition, sought to set aside the DHS\u2019s final decision in this case, as \u201crefusing to abide by\u201d the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Doctor\u2019s Medical Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connell, supra, </em>69 Cal.App.4th at pages 896-898 <em>(Doctor\u2019s). </em>RCJ contends <em>Doctor\u2019s </em>controls the resolution of this case. We respectfully disagree. In <em>Doctor\u2019s, </em>a Medi-Cal provider sought a writ of mandate to compel the Controller to release approximately $3 million in payments that had been withheld. <em>(Doctor\u2019s, supra, 69 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 893.) The provider alleged the Controller\u2019s refusal to pay the claims had led to its insolvency. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 895.) The Court of Appeal found the 1997 interagency agreement improperly authorized the Controller \u201cto perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>audits to identify overpayments to providers, and to take corrective action, presumably withholding sums believed to constitute overpayment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">We need not address the DHS\u2019s disagreement with our Division Seven colleagues\u2019 conclusions. The <em>Doctor\u2019s </em>opinion was filed on February 1, 1999. On March 24, 1999, the HCFA, by process of Ms. Richardson\u2019s letter, expressed approval of the Controller\u2019s audit authority. On December 17, 1999, well after the <em>Doctor\u2019s </em>opinion was filed, the HCFA approved the use of the Controller as the audit agency effective July 1, 1998. In <em>Doctor\u2019s, </em>the Court of Appeal did not confront, nor could our Division Seven colleagues have confronted, the subsequent December 17, 1999, federal agency approval of the Controller\u2019s contractual authority to audit Medi-Cal payments to providers. The December 17, 1999, HCFA approval happened entirely after the <em>Doctor\u2019s </em>opinion was filed. The HCFA\u2019s approval of the delegated audit authority is squarely presented in this case. Moreover, as discussed below, we conclude we must defer to the HCFA\u2019s construction of the federal statutory and regulatory law that it administers as reflected in its December 17, 1999, action.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">RCJ contends the HCFA\u2019s action is immaterial because the Controller audited it <em>before </em>the HCFA expressed its approval. We disagree. By its writ petition, RCJ sought to set aside the DHS\u2019s final decision because it relied on the Controller\u2019s audit. At the time the DHS issued its final decision, the HCFA had by letter expressed its opinion that the delegation of audit authority to the Controller was fully compliant with federal single state agency requirements. Moreover, at the time the trial court issued its order directing the DHS to set aside its final decision to the extent it relied on the Controller\u2019s audit, the HCFA had in addition approved the state plan amendment effective July 1, 1998. Under these circumstances, we conclude, the federal agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation was squarely presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">C. <em>The HCFA\u2019s Construction of the Federal Law That It Administers Is Entitled to Deference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">1. <em>Congress Has Not Specifically Addressed the Precise Question at Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">RCJ does not specifically contend nor do we conclude that the HCFA\u2019s regulation is an impermissible construction of the federal statutory single state agency requirement. RCJ asserts in general terms that the language of the federal statute and regulation is clear, unambiguous, and mandatory. RCJ contends the plain language and \u201cobvious\u201d meaning of the federal statute (\u00a7 1396a(a)(5)) and the implementing regulation (42 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>\u00a7 431.10(e) (2000)) prohibit the DHS from delegating audit authority to the Controller; further, the HCFA\u2019s conclusion to the contrary contradicts the federal law and therefore is not entitled to any deference. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The United States Supreme Court explained the standard to be applied on review of an administrative agency\u2019s construction of a statute which it administers in <em>Chevron, U.S.A. </em>v. <em>Natural Res. Def. Council </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 837, 842-845 [104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-2783, 81 L.Ed.2d 694]: \u201cWhen a court reviews an agency\u2019s construction of [a] statute which it administers, it is confronted with two questions. First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. <em>Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. </em>HQ \u2018The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created . . . program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u2019 [Citation.] If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation. Such legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. Sometimes, the legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency. HQ We have long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department\u2019s construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, and the principle of deference to administrative interpretations \u2018has been consistently followed by this Court whenever decision as to the meaning or reach of a statute has involved reconciling conflicting policies, and a full understanding of the force of the statutory policy in the given situation has depended upon more than ordinary knowledge respecting the matters subjected to agency regulations. [Citations.] ... If this choice represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency\u2019s care by the statute, we should not disturb it unless it appears from the statute or legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have sanctioned.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Fns. omitted, italics added; accord, <em>Garfield Medical Center </em>v. <em>Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 798, 807-808 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>527].) Simply stated, once a court determines, after reviewing the legislation, that Congress did not directly address the precise question at issue, the pertinent question is whether the administrative construction in the form of a regulation is reasonable. <em>(Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 845 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2783]; accord, <em>Alexander v.

A., </em>\u201cThe court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction, or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 843, fn. 11 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2782]; <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 443, 450 [98 S.Ct. 2441, 2445, 57 L.Ed.2d 337].)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">We consider the language of the federal statute. We find Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue; however, the statutory language plainly suggests that a state Medicaid agency may delegate functions to another state agency.  Because we are considering a federal statute, we follow rules of statutory construction enunciated by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Bonjorno </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 827, 835 [110 S.Ct. 1570, 1575, 108 L.Ed.2d 842], quoting from <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 102, 108 [100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766], the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cThe starting point for interpretation of a statute \u2018is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u2019 \u201d The United States Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthe statutory language controls its construction\u201d <em>(Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Cenance </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 155, 158, fn. 3 [101 S.Ct. 2239, 2241, 68 L.Ed.2d 744]) and that \u201c \u2018[t]here is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc. </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 564, 571 [102 S.Ct. 3245, 3250, 73 L.Ed.2d 973].) In interpreting a statute, the United States Supreme Court has noted: \u201c \u2018In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u2019 [Citations.] Our objective in a case such as this is to ascertain the congressional intent and give effect to the legislative will.\u201d <em>(Philbrook v. Glodgett </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 707, 713 [95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44 L.Ed.2d 525].) On another occasion, the court stated, \u201cWe do not, however, construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.\u201d <em>(United States v. Morton </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 822, 828 [104 S.Ct. 2769, 2773, 81 L.Ed.2d 680], fn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>omitted.) Further, in interpreting a statute, the Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of avoiding: \u201cabsurd results\u201d <em>(United States v. Turkette </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 576, 580 [101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246]); \u201c \u2018an odd result\u2019\u201d <em>(Public Citizen v. Department of Justice </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 440, 454 [109 S.Ct. 2558, 2567, 105 L.Ed.2d 377]); or \u201cunreasonable results whenever possible.\u201d <em>(American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 63, 71 [102 S.Ct. 1534, 1538, 71 L.Ed.2d 748].) Moreover, the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cJudicial perception that a particular result would be unreasonable may enter into the construction of ambiguous provisions, but cannot justify disregard of what Congress has plainly and intentionally provided.\u201d <em>(Commissioner v. Asphalt Products Co., Inc. </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 117, 121 [107 S.Ct. 2275, 2278, 96 L.Ed.2d 97].) In <em>Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., supra, </em>458 U.S. at page 571 [102 S.Ct. at page 3250], the court stated: \u201cNevertheless, in rare cases the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters, and those intentions must be controlling .... [Citations.]\u201d When a statute is unambiguous, its language cannot \u201cbe expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the [legislative] process.\u201d <em>(West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey, supra, </em>499 U.S. at pp. 98-99 [111 S.Ct. at p. 1147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">As noted above, section 1396a(a)(5) requires that a state Medicaid plan \u201cprovide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency <em>to administer or to supervise the administration </em>o/the plan . . . .\u201d It is clear the federal statute does not specifically address the question whether a state Medicaid agency can delegate audit responsibility to another state agency. It does expressly provide, however, that the designated single state agency will <em>administer or supervise </em>the administration of the state plan. The use of the disjunctive means the terms \u201cadminister\u201d and \u201csupervise\u201d must be given separate meanings except where the context dictates otherwise. <em>(Reiter v. Sonotone Corp. </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 330, 339 [99 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 60 L.Ed.2d 931]; <em>FCC </em>v. <em>Pacifica Foundation </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 726, 739-740 [98 S.Ct. 3026, 3035-3036, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073].)  To \u201cadminister\u201d means \u201cto manage the affairs of\u2019 the state Medicaid program. (Oxford English Diet. (2d ed. CD-ROM 1994).) To \u201csupervise\u201d means \u201c[t]o oversee,\u201d \u201cto have the oversight of, superintend the execution or performance of (a thing) . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> Here, under the plain language of section 1396a(a)(5), the DHS is authorized to <em>supervise </em>the administration of the state Medicaid program; that is, to oversee the execution or performance of the program. The federal statute\u2019s use of the word \u201csupervise,\u201d which means something other than administer, plainly suggests that entities other than the single state agency may be involved in the administration of the program under the Medicaid agency\u2019s supervision. Further, as discussed above, the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>purpose of the single state agency requirement was both to avoid a diversity of operating standards within a state and to ensure that one agency would be accountable to the federal government for the operation of Medicaid program and compliance with federal law. <em>(Sobky v. Smoley, supra, </em>855 F.Supp. at pp. 145-1146; <em>Hillburn by Hillburn v. Maher, supra, </em>795 F.2d at p. 261.) The language of section 1396a(a)(5) is consistent with that purpose; it requires a Medicaid agency to administer or supervise the administration of the state program (\u00a7 1396a(a)(5)), thereby ensuring consistent operating standards and accountability to the federal government. We conclude, therefore, that although Congress did not speak to the precise question at issue in this case, the statutory language does plainly suggest that a state. Medicaid agency may delegate functions to another state agency. As the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island held in <em>King by King v. Sullivan </em>(D.R.I. 1991) 776 F.Supp. 645, 656-657, \u201cSection 1396a(a)(5) requires that a State Plan provide for a single state agency \u2018to administer <em>or to supervise the administration of </em>the plan.\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(5) (1988) (emphasis added). The statute does not require states to use only one agency to carry out every task that is part of the State Plan. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(3) (1990)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">2. <em>The HCFA\u2019s Regulation Is a Permissible Construction of the Federal Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">We turn to the HCFA\u2019s implementing regulation. As discussed above, where, as here, Congress has not directly addressed the precise issue, the question for a state court is whether the federal agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Morton, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 834 [104 S.Ct. at p. 2776]; <em>Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, supra, </em>467 U.S. at p. 843 [104 S.Ct. at pp. 2781-2782].) We conclude the implementing regulation is a permissible construction of the federal statute. '</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">As noted above, the HCFA interpreted the federal statutory single state agency requirement in title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 431.10 (2000) as follows: \u201c(e) Authority of the single State agency. In order for an agency to qualify as the Medicaid agency\u2014 RQ (1) The agency must not delegate, to other than its own officials, authority to\u2014 fl[] (i) Exercise administrative discretion in the administration or supervision of the plan, or [H] (ii) Issue policies, rules, and regulations on program matters, [f] (2) The authority of the agency must not be impaired if any of its rules, regulations, or decisions are subject to review, clearance, or similar action by other offices or agencies of the State. [H] (3) If other State or local agencies or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>offices perform services for the Medicaid agency, they must not have the authority to change or disapprove any administrative decision of that agency, or otherwise substitute their judgment for that of the Medicaid agency with respect to the application of policies, rules, and regulations issued by the Medicaid agency.\u201d The HCFA\u2019s regulation is consistent with both the language and legislative purpose of the federal statute. The implementing regulation requires that the state Medicaid agency retain, and not delegate, <em>its </em>ultimate authority to <em>\u201c[e]xercise administrative discretion in the </em>administration or <em>supervision of the {state] plan.\u201d </em>(42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(l)(i) (2000), italics added.) It further requires that the state Medicaid agency retain, and not delegate, it authority to \u201c[ijssue policies, rules, and regulations on program matters.\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(l)(ii) (2000).) Under the regulation, if another entity performs services for a single Medicaid agency, it \u201cmust not have the authority to change or disapprove any administrative decision of that agency, or otherwise substitute [its] judgment for that of the Medicaid agency with respect to the application of policies, rules, and regulations issued by the Medicaid agency.\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(3) (2000).). The regulation ensures that the single state agency will retain administrative discretion in the supervision of the Medicaid program and will remain accountable to the government of the United States for the state\u2019s administration of the program and compliance with federal Medicaid law. We conclude the HCFA\u2019s construction of the federal statutory single state agency requirement in title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 430.10(e) (2000), is a permissible and reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">3. <em>Application of the Regulation to the Circumstances of This Case Was Not Plainly Erroneous or Inconsistent with the Regulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">RCJ contends that the HCFA\u2019s application of its own regulation to the circumstances of this case is plainly erroneous or its reasoning is inconsistent with the regulation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The United States Supreme Court has held that a federal agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is controlling unless it is \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Robertson v.

RCJ contends the single state agency regulation (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(3) (2000)) specifically prohibits the DHS from delegating <em>any </em>administrative discretion to another state agency <em>unless </em>expressly authorized to do so by another regulation as, for example, with respect to eligibility determinations (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(c) (2000)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. The HCFA has, from the inception of Medicaid until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>the present time, interpreted the regulation at issue as allowing a single state Medicaid agency to delegate responsibilities to another state agency. The HCFA has permitted such delegation so long as the single state Medicaid agency: supervises the other agency; remains responsible for that agency\u2019s actions; and remains accountable to the federal government for the administration of the state Medicaid plan. (Handbook, <em>supra, </em>Supp. D.) In the HCFA\u2019s view, a regulation expressly authorizing a state Medicaid agency to delegate <em>audit </em>authority to another state agency is not required. As noted above, the current single state agency regulation (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e) (2000)) states that the state Medicaid agency may rely on other state agencies\u2019 services provided that it does not delegate <em>its </em>authority, i.e., its ultimate authority: to \u201c[ejxercise administrative discretion in the administration or supervision of the plan\u201d; or to \u201c[i]ssue policies, rules, and regulations on program matters.\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(l)(i) &amp; (e)(l)(ii) (2000).) In addition, title 42 Code of Federal Regulations, part 431.10(e)(2) (2000) states, \u201cThe authority of the [state Medicaid] agency must not be impaired if any of its rules, regulations, or decisions are subject to review, clearance, or similar action by other offices or agencies of the State.\u201d Another state entity performing services for the state Medicaid agency must not have the authority: \u201cto change or disapprove\u201d the state Medicaid agency\u2019s administrative decisions. (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.10(e)(3) (2000).) Further, the other entity must not have the authority to substitute its judgment for that of the state Medicaid agency \u201cwith respect to the application of policies, rules, and regulations issued by the Medicaid agency.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Moreover, it is undisputed the DHS has not delegated to the Controller any authority to issue policies, rules, or regulations on Medi-Cal program matters. Nor do we find that the Controller reviews or takes similar action with respect to the DHS\u2019s rules, regulations, or decisions. Further, RCJ has not pointed to, and we have not found, <em>any </em>evidence in the record that the Controller has been given authority to change or disapprove any administrative decision by the DHS. Instead, the Controller undertakes, on DHS\u2019s behalf, required postpayment reviews of provider claims. RCJ also has not pointed to, and we have not found, <em>any </em>evidence in the record that the Controller\u2019s office has the authority to substitute its judgment for that of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>DHS with respect to the application of policies, rules, and regulations issued by the DHS. Nor has the DHS delegated to the Controller any authority to exercise discretion in the administration or supervision of the statewide Medicaid plan. The interagency agreement does not have any bearing on the ultimate authority of the DHS to exercise administrative judgment in the statewide administration or supervision of the Medi-Cal program as conducted under the state plan. What the DHS <em>has </em>delegated to the Controller is only the authority to conduct postpayment audits of Medi-Cal provider claims. The DHS has authorized the Controller to: perform audit services, including audits designed to identify overpayments to providers; \u201ctarget its audits for [specified] program issues using trend analysis based on Medi-Cal expenditures and historical patterns\u201d; document results in \u201cclear, accurate\u201d audit reports meeting \u201call of the statutory and regulatory requirements of an audit of Medi-Cal providers\u201d; abide by specified state codes and regulations; \u201ccollect and retain sufficient evidence to substantiate all audit findings and recommendations\u201d; issue repayment demands; send repayment demands to providers with a copy of the audit report; provide information to the provider regarding appeal rights; and take responsibility for the resolution of audit findings through and including the administrative appeal process. The DHS remains ultimately responsible for postpayment audits of Medi-Cal providers. The DHS supervises the Controller\u2019s services. The Controller must notify the DHS\u2019s Audits and Investigations Division \u201cprior to onsite reviews of Medi-Cal providers.\u201d The Controller must provide draft audit reports to the DHS at least 15 days prior to issuance. The Controller must send copies of an audit report and demand for repayment to the DHS Audits and Investigations Division and Office of Administrative Hearings and Appeals. Given these circumstances, the HCFA could reasonably conclude that, as authorized by title 42 Code of Federal Regulations, part 431.10(e)(3) (2000), the DHS has simply contracted with the Controller to perform required postpayment audits. The HCFA\u2019s conclusion that the delegation of audit responsibilities to the Controller is fully compliant with federal single state agency requirements is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. Therefore, it is entitled to and will be accorded controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">V.

You enclosed a copy of that IA, and asked that we advise whether the specific [Controller] functions performed under it in fact are consistent with DHS\u2019 responsibilities as CalifoMa\u2019s single State agency for purposes of Medicaid program administration. [U] The Medicaid program\u2019s single State agency requirements are found in section 1902(a)(5) of the Social Security Act, and at 42 CFR 431.10. The requirement that each State designate a single State agency to administer or supervise the administration of the program dates to enactment of the Social Security Act in 1935, where it appears with reference to the Title I Old-Age Assistance Program. The same wording was incorporated into Title XIX when the Medicaid program was enacted in 1965. The intent in both instances was to ensure that there be a single agency in each State accountable to the federal government for administration of the program in compliance with federal law and policy, ffl] Regulations at 42 CFR 431.10 require that: \u2018. . . .\u2019 [quoting the regulation] [H] California\u2019s approved Title XIX State Plan designates the DHS as the single State agency responsible for administering that Plan. The DHS organization chart vests responsibility for fraud and abuse, internal and external audits, and quality control in the Audits and Investigations Division. The Chief of the Medical Review Branch, Audits and Investigations, is the DHS contact point for purposes of the subject IA. Under the IA, the [Controller] is to perform audits on behalf of DHS to identify overpayments made to providers under the Medi-Cal program. The Scope of Work states that the IA is \u2018for the purpose of increasing the State\u2019s auditing ability to identify and recover California Medical Assistance Program (Medi-Cal Program) overpayments and to provide federal matching funds for [the Controller] audit services to the Medi-Cal Program.\u2019 The [Controller] must notify DHS Audits and Investigations when it initiates a review, audit or investigation of a Medi-Cal provider. If the [Controller] identifies an overpayment, it is to write the provider describing the overpayment, request repayment, and describe the provider\u2019s administrative appeal rights. We understand that such letters instruct the provider to either make payment to the DHS Payment Systems Division, Recovery Section for repayment purposes, if the provider agrees with the overpayment determination or, in the event the provider disagrees with the [Control<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>ler\u2019s] determination, file an appeal with the DHS Office of Administrative Hearings and Appeals. The IA requires the [Controller] to transmit to DHS Audits and Investigations a copy of each audit report and demand letter, and make all related working papers available to DHS for review upon request. In addition, the IA specifies that the [Controller] will make referrals only to Audits and Investigations, and not directly to DHS Recovery, DHS Office of Administrative Hearings and Appeals, or any law enforcement or other agency. [1\u00a1] With respect to the fraud referral process, the IA specifies that the [Controller] may recommend to the DHS that it initiate a withhold action when the [Controller] \u2018collects evidence of potential fraud or willful misrepresentation during an investigation\u2019 (Scope of Work, paragraph 10). Federal regulations at 42 CFR 455.23 authorize such withholds by the State Medicaid agency. The IA stipulates that the [Controller] will not make independent fraud referrals to law enforcement agencies, and that DHS will exercise its discretion as the Medicaid single State agency when making such referrals. [U] Based upon our review of the IA, the pertinent section of the California State Plan, and the applicable federal regulations, we conclude that the IA is fully compliant with federal single State agency requirements. The fact that DHS vests Medi-Cal audit functions in Audits and Investigations does not preclude DHS from augmenting its own audit resources through an appropriate arrangement with the [Controller], The IA itself states that \u2018DHS will exercise its authority as the Medicaid single state agency,\u2019 and we see nothing in it that gives the [Controller] discretionary authority that would violate the single State agency requirements at 42 CFR 431.10.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b949-9\"> Welfare and Institutions Code section 14171 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) The director shall establish administrative appeal processes to review grievances or complaints arising from the findings of an audit....
