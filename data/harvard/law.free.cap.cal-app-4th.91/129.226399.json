Plaintiffs Glendale Memorial Hospital &amp; Health Center, Long Beach Community Hospital, Northridge Hospital Medical Center, and Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital (Hospitals) sought a writ of mandate in superior court challenging decisions made by defendant state Department of Mental Health (DMH) that Hospitals were not entitled to reimbursement for certain days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>psychiatric care provided to a number of patients. The trial court found that many of DMH\u2019s decisions were not supported by substantial evidence and entered judgment ordering DMH to reimburse Hospitals. Real party in interest County of Los Angeles (County), which under the 1995 regulations is immediately liable for the reimbursement payments, appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">DMH\u2019s decisions denying reimbursement were set forth in terse statements that, based on a clinical review of information submitted, DMH had decided that medical necessity for the requested charges had not been established. We conclude that these decisions fail to contain requisite \u201cfindings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence\u201d presented at the administrative level and DMH\u2019s \u201cultimate decision[s],\u201d as required by <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [113 Cal.Rptr. 836, 522 P.2d 12]. Accordingly, we remand with instructions for the trial court to enter an order directing DMH to make adequate findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">1. <em>Reimbursement Regulations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Medi-Cal is the program by which the State of California provides medical services to its indigent population. <em>(Memorial Hospital-Ceres v. Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 233, 235 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 824].) To facilitate the provision of indigent mental health services at the local level in a manner consistent with federal law, the Legislature has authorized the development of \u201cmental health plans,\u201d which are required to operate within guidelines established by DMH. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14680, added by Stats. 1994, ch. 633, \u00a7 2, p. 3078.) DMH\u2019s guidelines for psychiatric inpatient hospital services appear in title 9 of the California Code of Regulations at section 1700 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">Under the guidelines, a mental health plan (MHP) is an entity that contracts with DMH to provide psychiatric inpatient hospital services. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 9, \u00a7 1713; unless otherwise specified, further section references are to tit. 9 of the Cal. Code Regs.) Counties have the right of first refusal to serve as an MHP. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14685.) In Los Angeles, County is the MHP. Various hospitals have obtained certification from DMH to provide psychiatric inpatient hospital services. (Cal. Code regs., tit. 9, \u00a7 1718.) The hospitals are required to provide emergency care for Medi-Cal patients, regardless of the amount of payment they ultimately receive. (See <em>Orthopaedic Hosp. v. Belsh\u00e9 </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 103 F.3d 1491, 1498.) The hospitals request reimbursement for services they have provided by submitting treatment authorization requests (TAR\u2019s) to County. (See Cal. Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Regs., tit. 9, \u00a7 1777.) In its capacity as an MHP, County receives a fixed amount of funding from DMH. If County spends more than the funded amount in making payment on the TAR\u2019s, County alone must bear the additional cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The criteria for reimbursement of psychiatric hospital admissions and continued services are set forth in section 1774, subdivisions (a) and (b), respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In summary, section 1774 provides that for a patient\u2019s admission to be reimbursable, it must meet the following tests: The patient must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>have a covered psychiatric diagnosis (\u00a7 1774, subd. (a)(1)); the patient\u2019s condition must not be safely treatable at a lower level of care (\u00a7 1774, subd. (a)(2)(A)); and the patient must need psychiatric inpatient services based on either specified symptoms or behaviors due to a mental disorder (\u00a7 1774, subd. (a)(2)(B)!), or need the inpatient services for further psychiatric evaluation (\u00a7 1774, subd. (a)(2)(B)2.a), medication treatment (\u00a7 1774, subd. (a)(2)(B)2.b), or other treatment that can be provided only if the patient is hospitalized (\u00a7 1774, subd. (a)(2)(B)2.c). For continued stay services following admission, the patient must exhibit the continued presence of indications or new indications of a covered diagnosis specified in section 1774, subdivision (a) (\u00a7 1774, subd. (b)(1), (3)), serious adverse reactions to medications or procedures (\u00a7 1774, subd. (b)(2)), or the need for continued medical evaluation and treatment that can be provided only in a psychiatric inpatient hospital (\u00a7 1774, subd. (b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">If a TAR seeking reimbursement under section 1774 is reduced or denied by an MHP, the hospital may appeal pursuant to procedure set forth in section 1798.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A first level appeal goes to the MHP, which has 60 days to inform the hospital of the \u201cdecision and its basis.\u201d (\u00a7 1798, subd. (b).) If the MHP does not respond or denies the appeal, the hospital may take a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>level appeal to DMH. DMH may allow the hospital and the MHP to present oral argument (\u00a7 1798, subd. (f)(1)), and has 60 days from receipt of the hospital\u2019s supporting documentation to notify the hospital of the \u201cdecision and its basis.\u201d (\u00a7 1798, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">2. <em>Administrative and Trial Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In July and October 1997, Hospitals filed three separate petitions for writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, challenging DMH\u2019s reduction or denial of TAR\u2019s. In December, the cases were deemed related under local rules. In April 1998, County filed a response in which it observed that the combined administrative record was over 3,900 pages and involved 35 patients and 348 contested days of inpatient hospital or administrative day services. (\u201cAdministrative day services\u201d (\u00a7 1701) are provided to a patient who no longer needs psychiatric inpatient services but cannot be placed in a nonacute facility because none is available.) County also noted that its own administrative decisions as the MHP and the decisions of DMH were lacking in detail. It therefore requested to supplement the record with expert declarations that would explain the decisions. Hospitals also submitted briefing on the merits. DMH filed a \u201cnotice of position\u201d in which it stated that it had acted as a neutral arbiter in determining the second level appeals and believed that its decisions were just and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">At a hearing on August 6, 1998, the petitions were consolidated upon stipulation of the parties. The trial court noted that the parties had not specified what common issues of law and fact existed with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>TAR\u2019s being challenged and that the parties referred to the patients in different order in their briefing. The court continued the hearing, ordering that the parties jointly prepare notebooks summarizing their contentions and citing supporting documentation as to each patient involved. The court did not rule on County\u2019s request to submit supplemental declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The continued hearing was held on September 10, 1998. The administrative record presented to the trial court did not include the TAR\u2019s or documentation of County\u2019s initial rejection of the TAR\u2019s. What the record most often included was, for each patient involved, a copy of the patient\u2019s medical records; a letter constituting the hospital\u2019s first level appeal to County asking for reconsideration of County\u2019s denial of the TAR; a form letter from County\u2019s mental health department, signed by the medical director for managed care, containing boxes checked specifying why the first level appeal had been denied (and occasionally a comment next to a box designated \u201cother\u201d); a letter from the hospital to DMH, appealing all or part of County\u2019s denial of the first level appeal (including denials based on County\u2019s failure to respond) and specifying reasons for the appeal; what appears to be a worksheet prepared by DMH on its review of the second level appeal; and DMH\u2019s administrative decision, which typically denied the hospital\u2019s appeal in boilerplate language that, \u201c[bjased on a clinical team review of the information submitted by you and MHP,\u201d DMH has \u201cconcluded that you failed to substantiate that this patient met the medical necessity requirements found in Section 1774. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The administrative record of patient R.D., which was one of the first presented to the trial court, is representative of the records involved in this proceeding. R.D. was described as a 78-year-old man with lung cancer and a history of psychiatric hospitalizations. He arrived at Glendale Memorial Hospital on December 14, 1995, stating that he did not want to live anymore. He was an inpatient from December 14 through December 29, 1995, a total of 15 days. (For reimbursement purposes, the first day of hospitalization is counted, the last day is not.) County denied Glendale Memorial\u2019s TAR for December 22 through December 28. Glendale Memorial appealed the denial of three of the days, December 22, 26, and 27, on the ground that the medical records of R.D.\u2019s hospitalization on those dates demonstrated that R.D. was a danger to himself in light of his continued suicidal ideation and needed medication adjustments. The first level appeal was denied by County, with a box on a form letter checked stating that \u201cMedical Necessity Criteria has not been documented\u201d because \u201cDanger to self was not established.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In its second level appeal to DMH, Glendale Memorial stated that R.D. was admitted for recurrent major depression and suicidal ideation and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>placed on medication. Glendale Memorial relied on, among other things, medical chart entries that on December 22, 1995, R.D. continued to be severely depressed and refused to attend a group session, on December 26, RJD.\u2019s depression persisted and his medication was adjusted, and on December 27, R.D. reported feeling anxious and was sad about not visiting relatives over the holidays. The DMH worksheet contains summaries of \u201cPsychiatrist,\u201d \u201cPsychology,\u201d \u201cGroup Therapy,\u201d and \u201cNurses\u201d notes, as well as a summary of the case and notes on \u201cMedical Review.\u201d Highlighted in the notes are summaries of entries that on December 22 R.D. had \u201cvague ideas of death,\u201d that he had \u201cvague thoughts of death\u201d on December 26, and that his \u201csuicidal thoughts [were] lessening\u201d on December 27. The medical review portion of the worksheet contains the notation that there is insufficient documentation to justify acute care for the days pertaining to the appeal. DMH denied the second level appeal in a letter containing the stock language, quoted above, that Glendale Memorial had failed to substantiate medical necessity requirements for patient R.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Glendale Memorial\u2019s petition for writ of mandate challenged the denial of TAR\u2019s involving R.D. (In its petition, Glendale Memorial abandoned its claim with respect to services provided to R.D. on December 27, 1995.) In its response, County asserted that on December 22, R.D.\u2019s \u201c[s]evere depression cited by [Glendale Memorial\u2019s] attorney and physician do not meet acute days medical necessity criteria. Thus, documentary evidence is not provided that patient is a danger to himself or unmanageable at a lower level of care, as required.\u201d With respect to December 26, County argued that \u201c[n]ursing note [citation] states patient has suicidal ideation but evidences neither plan nor intent. Physician note [citation] . . . states patient has \u2018vague thoughts of death\u2019 but not suicidal ideation. Danger to self is not established. Patient\u2019s behavior is manageable at a lower level of care.\u201d Glendale Memorial countered that DMH \u201cfails to appreciate that the patient was admitted with Major Depression and Suicidal Ideation with a plan to kill himself. [Citation.] Because the patient\u2019s admitting symptoms had not diminished, the patient remained at potential risk of harm to himself. [Citation.] Accordingly, the patient required adjustments in medication to stabilize his condition which meets the criteria set forth in Title 9, [California Code of Regulations] \u00a7 1774. [Citation.] Therefore, continued acute care was medically necessary. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">At oral argument at the continued hearing on the consolidated petitions, County referred to its earlier request to submit expert declarations. The request was denied from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The trial court ruled on Hospitals\u2019 petitions by minute order dated September 10, 1998. As to 15 of the patient claims involved (including two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>separate claims for R.D.), the court stated that the patients had been \u201cproperly admitted by [Hospitals] because they were suicidal, had threatened others, or had been found wandering around unable to care for themselves. They were severely psychotic and many of them had been brought to [Hospitals] precisely because they could not safely be kept in a setting with a lower level of care. Many of them had been repeatedly hospitalized in the past for the same mental disorder. [Hospitals] kept these patients while various medications were tried and the dosages were regulated to provide effective treatment. In each case [DMH] decided that at some point during the patient\u2019s stay he or she could have been managed [at] some lower level of care, the nature and availability of which [DMH] does not specify. There is no substantial evidence in the administrative record to support those findings, which appear to be entirely . . . arbitrary and speculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The trial court also granted Hospitals\u2019 reimbursement requests with respect to three patients that County did not oppose. It further granted relief as to two additional patients notwithstanding County\u2019s contention that Hospitals\u2019 reimbursement requests were untimely. Reimbursement for less than all days claimed by Hospitals was ordered as to three other patients, and reimbursement was denied entirely as to five patients. Full reimbursement was ordered for the remaining patients. In all, the court overturned the denial of TAR\u2019s as to approximately 225 days of inpatient hospital care and one day of administrative services.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Judgment was filed on October 2, 1998. County filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that under <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 506, the matter should be remanded for further findings. The motion was apparently deemed moot after County filed its notice of appeal. The notice stated that the appeal was being taken \u201cfrom the portions of the judgment\u201d granting relief with respect to services provided on specified days to the 15 patients covered in the portion of the minute order quoted above, and an additional three patients, for a total of 208 inpatient hospital days (one for initial hospitalization and the remainder for continued stay services) and one administrative services day.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (b), the superior court\u2019s inquiry in this case \u201cextend[ed] to the questions whether [DMH] has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if [DMH] has not proceeded in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence.\u201d Where, as here, the administrative decision being reviewed does not involve a fundamental vested right, the inquiry is limited to a determination of whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence in light of the record as a whole. <em>(Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 32 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29]; cf. <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242] [when administrative decision substantially affects fundamental vested rights, trial court exercises independent judgment upon the evidence in a limited trial de novo].) \u201cThe scope of our review of the [DMH\u2019s actions] in this case is identical with that of the superior court. The same substantial evidence standard applies, and the issue is whether the findings of the [DMH] were based on substantial evidence in light of the entire administrative record. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Desmond v. County of Contra Costa </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 330, 334-335 [25 Cal.Rptr .2d 842].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">County contends that the decisions of DMH on the second level appeal should be upheld because they reflect a proper interpretation of DMH regulations for payment of TAR\u2019s and are therefore supported by substantial evidence. In making this contention, County faults the trial court for ruling on the majority of the patients as a group, and proceeds to discuss five of those patients (including R.D.) in greater detail. County argues in the alternative that the matter should be remanded and DMH ordered to make findings that are sufficiently specific to permit meaningful judicial review. DMH, which has filed a three-page respondent\u2019s brief, contends that its findings were adequate. DMH further argues that if we do not agree that its findings were adequate, it is County, not DMH, which should make any further findings that may be required. Hospitals contend that DMH\u2019s decisions were not supported by substantial evidence. In making this argument, Hospitals do not discuss any of the patients individually. Rather, they assert, in essence, that the trial court\u2019s ruling reflected the proper interpretation of the DMH guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We find merit in County\u2019s alternate position and conclude that the absence of specific findings prevents us from fulfilling our duty under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 to conduct a meaningful judicial review of the challenged administrative decisions. We further determine that DMH, not County, is the agency required to make the specific findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at page 515, the Supreme Court held that \u201cimplicit in [Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of Civil Procedure] section 1094.5 is a requirement that the agency which renders the challenged decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.\u201d The court explained that \u201c[a]mong other functions, a findings requirement serves to conduce the administrative body to draw legally relevant sub-conclusions supportive of its ultimate decision; the intended effect is to facilitate orderly analysis and minimize the likelihood that the agency will randomly leap from evidence to conclusions. [Citations.] In addition, findings enable the reviewing court to trace and examine the agency\u2019s mode of analysis. [Citations.] fl[] Absent such roadsigns, a reviewing court would be forced into unguided and resource-consuming explorations; it would have to grope through the record to determine whether some combination of credible evidentiary items which supported some line of factual and legal conclusions supported the ultimate order or decision of the agency. Moreover, properly constituted findings enable the parties to the agency proceeding to determine whether and on what basis they should seek review. [Citations.] They also serve a public relations function by helping to persuade the parties that administrative decision-making is careful, reasoned, and equitable.\u201d (11 Cal.3d at pp. 516-517, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">When the administrative agency\u2019s findings are not adequate, an appropriate remedy is to remand the matter so that proper findings can be made. (See, e.g., <em>Saleeby </em>v. <em>State Bar </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 547, 566-567, 575 [216 Cal.Rptr. 367, 702 P.2d 525]; <em>Eureka Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 353, 367-369 [244 Cal.Rptr. 240]; see also <em>McMillan v. American Gen. Fin. Corp. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 175, 183 [131 Cal.Rptr. 462] [adequacy of administrative findings considered on appeal even though not raised in proceedings below].)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">This case cries out for findings that contain far greater detail than DMH\u2019s boilerplate rejections of Hospitals\u2019 appeals for failure to \u201csubstantiate that [a] patient met the medical necessity requirements found in Section 1774. . . .\u201d For example, we can glean from the administrative record on patient R.D. that County and DMH differ in their assessment of the type of suicidality that is required to demonstrate danger to self under section 1774, subdivision (a)(2)(B)(l). What the record and counsel fail to address is that no standard has been provided for resolving this difference that would create a benchmark by which Hospitals could make informed decisions about what services they may reasonably expect to be covered by the MHP, and by which we could conduct meaningful judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We appreciate the trial court\u2019s attempt in a commonsense manner to conduct a sufficiency-of-the-evidence review of each of the patient-days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>with the information presented to it. Yet we think that the law requires us to be better informed of the bases of the many administrative decisions under review in order to determine whether they were supported by substantial evidence. Our \u201cgrop[ing] through the record\u201d is not suitable. <em>(Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 516.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The parties\u2019 appellate briefs also fail to help us evaluate the administrative record. In its opening brief and without citation to the record, County asserts that \u201cthoughts of suicide, by themselves, do not demonstrate that a patient is suicidal or a danger to himself. A patient is not \u2018suicidal\u2019 unless he poses an imminent danger to himself; such imminent danger is not present unless the patient has recently threatened or attempted to take his own life and continues to present an imminent danger to himself. See e.g.. Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7\u00a7 5260, 5264. Even if the patient thinks of death or suicide many times a day for many days in a row, a medical doctor will not consider the patient truly suicidal unless the patient has both a concrete plan about how he will kill himself and the available means to accomplish his suicidal plan. Thus, a patient who has thoughts of killing himself for several days is not an imminent danger to himself if he has no suicidal plan. Further, if a patient with suicidal thoughts can be adequately treated at a lower level of care, the provider hospital may not recover reimbursement for acute psychiatric inpatient services under $1774.\u201d (Underscoring in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">But nothing in law or the administrative record tells us when a doctor will consider a patient \u201ctruly suicidal.\u201d Welfare and Institutions Code sections 5260 and 5264, which are the only authorities cited by County, do not resolve the question. These statutes, which are part of the Lanterman-PetrisShort Act (EPS), provide for the continued involuntary confinement of persons whom professional staff at a designated facility have found to present an \u201cimminent\u201d threat of suicide. Imminence of a suicidal threat, however, is a concept on which reasonable minds could differ. Indeed, it is this difference that is at the core of much of the controversy in this case. County has not argued that some definition of imminence which may have been developed under EPS must be applied here, or even attempted to show what that definition might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Similarly, Hospitals\u2019 brief, without citation to the record, asserts that in denying TAR\u2019s, County and DMH \u201cappear reluctant to accept or consider the overall condition of these mentally ill patients on each day, choosing instead to focus on mere isolated moments in a single day as a means to deny several days of service Hospitals rendered to these patients. However, this ignores the fact the behavior and conduct of a severely mentally ill patient is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>unpredictable, erratic, inconsistent, deceptive, and varies throughout the day. . . . [H] Further, [County] and DMH complain that as soon as a mentally ill patient is transferred from a \u2018locked\u2019 psychiatric unit to an \u2018open\u2019 psychiatric unit that said patient no longer requires acute care. As evidenced by the administrative record, the contrary is true. In fact, it is standard medical practice to observe a patient transferred from the locked psychiatric unit in the open psychiatric unit for at least 24 hours regarding their ability to function prior to discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">But nothing in the administrative record informs us of the type of variation in a patient\u2019s behavior on a given day that will establish, rather than disprove, medical necessity for acute care. Nor have Hospitals cited authority to establish what constitutes \u201cstandard medical practice\u201d for discharging a patient from a psychiatric facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The instant record offers little to no guidance on evaluating administrative decisions that are based on such critical medical issues as how much weight to give a psychiatrist\u2019s notes vis-\u00e1-vis a nurse\u2019s notes or group therapy notes; the importance of a patient\u2019s condition on the day(s) preceding or following day(s) for which reimbursement is contested; and the nature of the \u201clower level of care\u201d to which a patient will be relegated if acute care is denied. As it now stands, we face the daunting task of attempting to pick through a lengthy record replete with raw medical information in an effort to distinguish meaningfully between a patient\u2019s mental condition on different days of hospitalization. Without further, specific findings, we have no basis upon which to make those distinctions. We therefore conclude that such findings must be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Finally, we agree with DMH that it would be helpful if County would explain the basis of its denials of Hospitals\u2019 TAR\u2019s (either initially or on the first level appeals). Indeed, County\u2019s unsuccessful request to supplement the administrative record in the trial court with expert declarations appears to be a recognition of this deficiency. Nonetheless, we find no legal basis for requiring County, rather than DMH, to make the findings required under <em>Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at page 515. Accordingly, we reject DMH\u2019s position that DMH should be excused from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The judgment is reversed, insofar as appealed from, and the cases are remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter an order directing the State Department of Mental Health to make new decisions containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>specific supportive findings regarding the claims that are identified in the notice of appeal filed by the County of Los Angeles on November 13, 1998. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Spencer, P.
