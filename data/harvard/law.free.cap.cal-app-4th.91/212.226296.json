Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a).) Defendant was also found to have served two prior prison terms. (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) Defense counsel waived defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial on the prior prison term allegations. Defendant was not asked to nor did he waive his right to a jury trial on prior prison term allegations. After the court trial on the prior prison term allegations, the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466, 490 [120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-2363, 147 L.Ed.2d 435], which held that, other than the fact of prior conviction, sentencing enhancements must be determined by a jury. In the published portion of this opinion, we discuss whether the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause guarantees an accused the right to a jury trial on section 667.5 prior prison term allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>.......<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Defendant argues that he was denied a right to a jury trial regarding the two prior prison term allegations. He reaches this conclusion because the trial court failed to obtain his express personal waiver of his jury trial right. Through defense counsel, defendant agreed to bifurcate the trial on his prior convictions. Prior to the commencement of trial, the following occurred: \u201cThe Court: We also have the priors that are alleged, and it\u2019s my understanding that it\u2019s the defendant\u2019s desire to bifurcate the priors; is that correct? [Defense Counsel]: Can I have one moment, Your Honor. [^\u00a1] The Court: Yes ft[] (Sotto voce conference between [defense counsel] and the defendant.) [Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor. That is <em>his </em>wish.\u201d (Italics added.) The jury was excused after it rendered its guilty verdict on the evading an officer charge. Thereafter, the trial court noted, \u201cWith reference to the proof of the priors, I believe in chambers we had indicated that there was going to be a jury waiver as far as their proof was concerned.\u201d Defense counsel answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defendant argues that he has been denied his right to a jury trial because he never personally agreed to allow the trial judge to decide the issue of validity of the two prior prison term allegations. The first question is whether there has been a state constitutional violation. That issue is controlled by the decision of the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Vera </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 269, 277 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 754, 934 P.2d 1279]. In <em>Vera </em>the Supreme Court held: \u201cWhen the defendant seeks to bifurcate the determination of the truth of the prior conviction allegation from determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the charged crimes, however, only the statutory right to jury trial is implicated in the trial of the sentencing allegations. Since there is no constitutional right to have the jury determine the truth of a prior conviction allegation [citation], it follows that the failure to obtain an express, personal waiver of the right to jury trial of prior conviction allegations does not constitute a violation of the state constitutional mandate.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Epps </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 19, 23 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 18 P.3d 2], the California Supreme Court held: \u201cThe right, if any, to a jury trial of prior conviction allegations derives from sections 1025 and 1158, not from the state or federal Constitution. <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey[, supra,] </em>530 U.S. [at p.] _ . . . ; <em>[People </em>v.] <em>Wiley </em>[(1995)] 9 Cal.4th [580,] 585 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347,889 P.2d 541].)\u201d No state constitutional violation has occurred because defendant failed to personally waive his statutory jury trial right on the prior prison term allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The second question is whether the failure to secure a personal agreement on defendant\u2019s part to have the trial judge determine the truth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the two prior prison term allegations was violative of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments jury trial right. Defendant\u2019s argument that the failure to have secured a personal waiver of his jury trial right was federal constitutional error is premised upon language in <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at page 490 [120 S.Ct. at pages 2362-2363]. Defendant relies upon the following language in Apprendi: \u201cOther than the <em>fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics .added.) A year prior to <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that as to \u201cany fact (other than prior conviction)\u201d that increased the maximum penalty for the crime charged, the Fifth Amendment due process clause required a jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1999) 526 U.S. 227, 243, fn. 6 [119 S.Ct. 1215, 1224, 143 L.Ed.2d 311].) Defendant accepts that if the two section 667.5 enhancements involved merely \u201cprior convictions,\u201d there would be no federal jury trial right and no corresponding duty to secure a personal waiver of that privilege. Recognizing the controlling nature of <em>Apprendi, </em>defendant reasons that a prior prison term allegation involves more elements than the mere \u201cfact of a prior conviction.\u201d Defendant correctly notes that a section 667.5 enhancement requires more than a mere conviction. The accused must have served a prison term as defined in the statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 946, 951 [210 Cal.Rptr. 56]; 3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Punishment, \u00a7 335, p. 432.) Therefore, defendant contends that all of the other elements of a prior prison term enhancement beyond the mere fact of the conviction are subject to a jury trial right under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a corollary of that argument, defendant argues that since he never personally waived his jury trial right, he is entitled to a new trial on the two prior prison term enhancement allegations. For the following reasons, we respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Defendant\u2019s narrow reading of the words \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d in <em>Apprendi </em>is without merit because his analysis takes that language out of its context. In <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1998) 523 U.S. 224, 226, 228 [118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 1223, 140 L.Ed.2d 350], a decision which preceded <em>Apprendi, </em>the United States Supreme Court examined the due process ramifications of a sentence enhanced in part by reason of a prior conviction. In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the accused was alleged to be an alien who had illegally returned to the United States after having previously been deported following conviction of an' \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Accordingly, the accused was subject to an enhanced sentence of up to 20 years in federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>prison pursuant to title 8 United States Code section 1326(b)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Speaking for the majority, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer framed the question to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>decided in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as follows: \u201cThe question before us is whether this latter provision defines a separate crime or simply authorizes an enhanced penalty. If the former, <em>i.e., </em>if it constitutes a separate crime, then the Government must write an indictment that mentions the additional element, namely, a prior aggravated felony conviction. If the latter, <em>i.e., </em>if the provision simply authorizes an enhanced sentence when an offender also has an earlier conviction, then the indictment need not mention that fact, for the fact of an earlier conviction is not an element of the present crime. ftQ We conclude that the subsection is a penalty provision, which simply authorizes a court to increase the sentence for a recidivist. It does not define a separate crime. Consequently, neither the statute nor the Constitution requires the Government to charge the factor that it mentions, an earlier conviction, in the indictment.\u201d <em>(Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>523 U.S. at pp. 226-227 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1222].)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the prior conviction constituted an element of the crime which the Fifth Amendment due process clause required to be alleged in the indictment. Justice Breyer stated: \u201c[T]he sentencing factor at issue here\u2014recidivism\u2014is a traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court\u2019s increasing an offender\u2019s sentence. See, <em>e.g., Parke </em>v. <em>Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 26 [113 S.Ct. 517, 521-522, 121 L.Ed.2d 391] (1992) (Recidivism laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u2018have a long tradition in this country that dates back to colonial times\u2019 and currently are in effect in all 50 States); U.S. Dept, of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Statutes Requiring the Use of Criminal History Record Information 17-41 (June 1991) (50-state survey); USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1, 4A1.2 (Nov. 1997) (requiring sentencing court to consider defendant\u2019s prior record in every case). Consistent with this tradition, the Court said long ago that a State need <em>not </em>allege a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the indictment or information that alleges the elements of an underlying crime, even though the conviction was \u2018necessary to bring the case within the statute.\u2019 <em>Graham </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>224 U.S. 616, 624 [32 S.Ct. 583, 585-586, 56 L.Ed. 917] (1912). That conclusion followed, the Court said, from <em>\u2018the distinct nature of the issue,' </em>and the fact that recidivism \u2018does not relate to the commission of the offense, <em>but goes to the punishment only, </em>and therefore . . . may be subsequently decided.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 629 [32 S.Ct. at 588] (emphasis added). The Court has not deviated from this view. See <em>Oyler </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 452 [82 S.Ct. 501, 503-504, 7 L.Ed.2d 446] (1962) (due process does not require advance notice that trial for substantive offense will be followed by accusation that the defendant is a habitual offender); <em>Parke, supra, </em>at 27 [113 S.Ct. at 522] (\u2018[A] charge under a recidivism statute does not state a separate offense, but goes to punishment only\u2019). And, as we said before, . . . , Congress, reflecting this tradition, has never, to our knowledge, made a defendant\u2019s recidivism an element of an offense where the conduct proscribed is otherwise unlawful. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>824 F. 2d 21, 25, and n. 6 (CADC 1987) (opinion of R. Ginsburg, J.) (referring to fact that few, if any, federal statutes make \u2018prior criminal convictions . . . elements of another criminal offense to be proved before the jury\u2019). Although these precedents do not foreclose petitioner\u2019s claim (because, for example, the state statute at issue in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Oyler </em>provided for a jury determination of disputed prior convictions), to hold that the Constitution requires that recidivism be deemed an \u2018element\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s offense would mark an abrupt departure from a longstanding tradition of treating recidivism as \u2018go[ing] to the punishment only.\u2019 <em>Graham, supra, </em>at 629 [32 S.Ct. at 587-588].\u201d <em>(Almendarez-Torres </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>523 U.S. at pp. 243-244 [118 S.Ct. at pp. 1230-1231].)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>preceded <em>Apprendi. </em>In <em>Apprendi, </em>the court decided whether the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required that the factual determination as to whether the defendant\u2019s mens rea was to intimidate the victim based upon \u201c \u2018race, color, gender, handicapped, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity\u2019 \u201d be made utilizing the beyond a reasonable doubt standard by a jury. <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 469 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2351].) The <em>Apprendi </em>majority held the accused\u2019s mental state, which resulted in an enhanced sentence, in committing the charged crime was an element of the offense that required juror <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>evaluation utilizing the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490 [120 S.Ct. at pp. 2362-2363].) The <em>Apprendi </em>majority distinguished <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in part as follows: \u201c[A]s <em>Jones </em>[v. <em>United States, supra, </em>526 U.S. at pages 248-249 [119 S.Ct. at pages 1226-1227]] made crystal clear, . . . , our conclusion in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>turned heavily upon the fact that the additional sentence to which the defendant was subject was \u2018the prior commission of a serious crime.\u2019 523 U.S., at 230 [118 S.Ct. at 1224]; see also <em>id., </em>at 243 [118 S.Ct. at 1230] (explaining that \u2018recidivism . . . is a traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court\u2019s increasing an offender\u2019s sentence\u2019); <em>id., </em>at 244 [118 S.Ct. at 1231] (emphasizing \u2018the fact that recidivism \u201cdoes not relate to the commission of the offense . . .\u2019\u201d); <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S., at 249-250, n. 10 [119 S.Ct. at 1227] (\u2018The majority and the dissenters in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>disagreed over the legitimacy of the Court\u2019s decision to restrict its holding to recidivism, but both sides agreed that the Court had done just that\u2019). Both the certainty that procedural safeguards attached to any \u2018fact\u2019 of prior conviction, and the reality that Almendarez-Torres did not challenge the accuracy of that \u2018fact\u2019 in his case, mitigated the due process and Sixth Amendment concerns otherwise implicated in allowing a judge to determine a \u2018fact\u2019 increasing punishment beyond the maximum of the statutory range.\u201d <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 488 [120 S.Ct. at pp. 2361-2362], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The <em>Apprendi </em>majority recognized that its holding could be construed as being in conflict with <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Nonetheless, the majority emphasize that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remained the law of land when it noted: \u201cEven though it is arguable that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided, and that a logical application of our reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were contested, <em>Apprendi </em>does not contest the decision\u2019s validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rule we recalled at the outset. Given its unique facts, it surely does not warrant rejection of the otherwise uniform course of decision during the entire history of our jurisprudence.\u201d <em>(Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at pp. 489-490 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2362], fn. omitted.) It was in this context that the <em>Apprendi </em>majority then, in the very next paragraph, utilized the \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction\u201d language which requires that a fact which increases the sentence beyond the statutory maximum for an offense be submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt findings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2362].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Of further consequence is the manner in which United States Supreme Court has described its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>In <em>Jones v. United States, supra, </em>526 U.S. at page 249 [119 S.Ct. at page 2227], a case decided before <em>Apprendi, </em>the United States Supreme Court emphasized that its prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was premised upon the distinctive issue of recidivism as distinguished from an element of an offense and other matters which are entitled to full due process treatment. In <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court described <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as involving \u201cthe tradition of regarding recidivism as a sentencing factor, not as an element to be set out in indictment.\u201d <em>(Jones v. United States, supra, </em>526 U.S. at p. 249 [119 S.Ct. at p. 2227].) In <em>Castillo v. United States </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 120, 126 [120 S.Ct. 2090, 2094, 147 L.Ed.2d 94], decided several weeks <em>before Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court confronted the question of whether an enhanced sentence for machine gun use during a crime of violence created a separate offense or was merely a sentencing factor. In <em>Castillo, </em>Justice Breyer described the issue before the court like this: \u201cIn this case we once again decide whether words in a federal criminal statute create offense elements (determined by a jury) or sentencing factors (determined by a judge). See <em>Jones v. United States, [supra,] </em>526 U.S. 227 . . . ; <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, [supra,] </em>523 U.S. 224 . . . .\u201d <em>(Castillo v. United States, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 121 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2091].) Further, in <em>Castillo, </em>Justice Breyer described the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>opinion as one as involving issues of recidivism and noted, \u201c[R]ecidivism \u2018is as typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Castillo v. United States, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 126 [120 S.Ct. at p. 2094].)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Other courts in evaluating this question have reached several pertinent conclusions. Other courts have uniformly concluded that <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. (U.S. v. Skidmore </em>(7th Cir. 2001) 254 F.3d 635, 642; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Moreno-Arredondo </em>(5th Cir. 2001) 255 F.3d. 198, 203; <em>U.S. v. Arellano-Rivera </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 244 F.3d 1119, 1126; <em>U.S. v.

Further, other courts have construed <em>Apprendi </em>as requiring a jury trial except as to matters relating to \u201crecidivism.\u201d Courts have not described <em>Apprendi </em>as requiring jury trials on matters other than the precise \u201cfact\u201d of a prior conviction. Rather, courts have held that no jury trial right exists on matters involving the more broadly framed issue of \u201crecidivism.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Skidmore, supra, </em>254 F.3d at p. 642; <em>U.S. v. Brough, supra, </em>243 F.3d at pp. 1079-1081; <em>U.S. v. Rogers </em>(11th Cir. 2000) 228 F.3d 1318, 1324; <em>People v.

Appellate courts have held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not require full due process treatment to recidivism allegations which involved elements merely beyond the fact of conviction itself. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Palomino-Rivera </em>(7th Cir. 2001) 258 F.3d 656, 661 <em>[Apprendi </em>does not apply to prior conviction allegation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326] (see fn. 2, <em>ante)]; U.S. v. Johnstone </em>(1st Cir. 2001) 251 F.3d 281, 286, fn. 6 [\u201cMoreover, by its express terms, <em>Apprendi </em>concerns only sentencing facts \u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction . . .\u2019 530 U.S. at 490 [120 S.Ct. at 2362], Here, Johnstone\u2019s maximum sentence for his offense increased to twenty years solely because of his deportation following his prior conviction in Colorado. Therefore, although we need not decide this issue today, we doubt that <em>Apprendi </em>applies to Johnstone\u2019s case for the additional reason that the increase in his maximum sentence was due to a prior conviction. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 415 (9th Cir. 2000)\u201d]; <em>Wright v. State, supra, </em>780 So.2d at p. 217 [\u201cNothing in <em>Apprendi </em>overrules the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Eutsey v. State, </em>383 So.2d 219 (Fla. 1980) that the determination that a defendant could be sentenced as an habitual felony offender was independent of the question of guilt in the underlying substantive offense and did not require the full panoply of rights afforded a defendant in the trial of the offense.\u201d]; <em>Jones v. Maryland </em>(2001) 138 Md.App. 12 [769 A.2d 1015, 1023] <em>[\u201cApprendi </em>does not require a jury determination of prior convictions or incarceration resulting from those convictions.\u201d].) Further, under the New York habitual offender law a qualifying prior conviction must be one where the defendant served more than one year in prison. The Court of Appeals of New York has held that under <em>Apprendi </em>there is no jury trial right to determine whether that state\u2019s habitual offender law applies to the accused. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rosen </em>(2001) 96 N.Y.2d 329 [752 N.E.2d 844, 846]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conyers </em>(2001) 727 N.Y.S.2d 545, 546 [2001 WL 812333].) Finally, the Florida Supreme Court has recently held that the question of whether a recidivist committed a new offense within three years of being released from a state correctional facility was not an element of a sentencing enhancement that had to be submitted to the jury under <em>Apprendi. (McGregor v. State, supra, </em>789 So.2d at p. 977; <em>Parker v. State </em>(Fla. 2001) 790 So.2d 1033, 1035; <em>Robinson v. State </em>(Fla. 2001) 793 So.2d 891, 892.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">With the foregoing legal analysis in mind, we reach the following conclusions. In terms of recidivism findings that enhance a sentence and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>unrelated to the elements of a crime, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is the controlling due process authority. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>does not require full due process treatment of an issue of recidivism which enhances a sentence and is unrelated to an element of a crime. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres. </em>The language relied upon by defendant in <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,\u201d refers broadly to recidivism enhancements which include section 667.5 prior prison term allegations. Notably, the recidivism enhancement in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>had elements apart from the mere fact of a prior conviction. As noted previously, the prior conviction had to involve an \u201caggravated felony\u201d which occurred before the alien accused\u2019s removal from this country. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>As has been noted, the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>involved the commission of specific enumerated felonies, not merely the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d as that term was utilized in <em>Apprendi. </em>Also, the same reliability factors identified in <em>Apprendi </em>are applicable here. <em>(Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 488 [120 S.Ct. at pp. 2361-2362].) The evidence in the present case consisted of documents which, without dispute, demonstrated defendant had on two separate occasions been sentenced to and completed prison terms. The written evidence which included abstracts of judgment, fingerprint records, and Department of Corrections documents have the constitutional requisite level of reliability so as to meet any pertinent due process concerns. Therefore, <em>Apprendi </em>does not stand for the proposition that full due process treatment should have been accorded to the two prior prison term enhancement allegations. No federal constitutional violation occurred because defense counsel waived defendant\u2019s state statutory right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Grignon, J., and Willhite, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">On August 8, 2001, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
