Under <em>Trope </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 277 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 902 P.2d 259], a pro se lawyer <em>cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees </em>under Civil Code section 1717. Under <em>Abandonato v. Coldren </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 264, 268 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 429], a pro se lawyer <em>can be awarded attorney\u2019s fees as sanctions </em>under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. Under <em>Argaman v. Ratan </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1175 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 917], a pro se lawyer <em>cannot be awarded attorney\u2019s fees as a discovery sanction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">From these inconsistent rules, we distill this wholly inadequate solution for all pro se litigants\u2014including pro se lawyers\u2014who have prevailed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents: A pro se litigant cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees as a discovery sanction, but he can recover the \u201creasonable expenses\u201d he has \u201cincurred,\u201d including photocopying, computer-assisted legal research, and other identifiable and allocable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Michelle Kravitz sued Timothy V. Milner for legal malpractice. Kravitz was represented by counsel (Sheldon Rosenfield), Milner was not (he answered and has thereafter appeared in propria persona). Milner served Kravitz with a request for the production of documents, and granted an extension when Rosenfield asked for more time to respond. When Kravitz still did not respond, Milner moved for an order compelling production and for sanctions in the amount of $1,673. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 2031, 2023.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his supporting declaration, Milner explained how he calculated the $1,673:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-7\">\u201cI charge my clients $300 per hour for litigation of this nature. Reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees for preparation of this Motion and for the time involved in the appearance before this Court to present and argue the Motion are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-8\">\u201ca. 3.5 Hours of attorney time for motion preparation/dictation at $300.00/hr. $1,050.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADE\">\u201cb. 2.00 hours of attorney time at $300.00/hr for travel and Court appearance. $ 600.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJZ\">\u201cc. the Court\u2019s Motion Filing Fee $ 23.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5i\">\u201cTotal: $1,673.00\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Kravitz opposed Milner\u2019s motion to compel on the merits, and opposed Milner\u2019s request for sanctions on the ground that an attorney representing himself is not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees as discovery sanctions. The trial court granted Milner\u2019s motion to compel and also granted his request for sanctions (payable by Kravitz and Rosenfield), noting in its minute order only that Kravitz had \u201cfailed to timely comply with a properly noticed request [for production].\u201d Kravitz and Rosenfield then filed a petition for a writ of mandate, asking us to command the trial court to vacate its sanction award (except for the $23 filing fee). We issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing. Milner has not filed opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">In <em>Trope v. Katz, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th 274, 277, a breach of contract action, our Supreme Court held that \u201can attorney who chooses to litigate in propria persona rather than retain another attorney to represent him in an action to enforce a contract containing an attorney fee provision\u201d cannot recover \u201c \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 under Civil Code section 1717 ... as compensation for the time and effort expended . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Why? Because \u201cthe usual and ordinary meaning of the words \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 is the consideration that a litigant pays or becomes liable to pay in exchange for legal representation [and] the words \u2018attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 and \u2018counsel fees,\u2019 whether used in a contract or in a statute, had an established legal meaning at the time the Legislature enacted [Civil Code] section 1717. <em>In the absence of some indication either on the face of that statute or in its legislative history that the Legislature intended its words to convey something other than their established legal definition, the presumption is almost irresistible that the Legislature intended them to have that meaning. \u201d (Trope </em>v. <em>Katz, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 282, italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">In <em>Abandonato v. Coldren, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 264, 268, a tort case, Division Three of the Fourth District held that the \u201cconsiderations which powered <em>Trope </em>are not present when a court awards sanctions under . . . section 128.5\u201d to a pro se attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Why? Because sanctions under section 128.5 \u201care not limited to court costs and attorney fees but include those</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">_t_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>reasonable expenses \u2018directly related to and in furtherance of the litigation\u2019 . . . which are \u2018incurred as a result of bad faith actions\u2019 \u201d (such as compensation for time spent by the party\u2019s employees or as compensation for airfare and reimbursement for lost vacation time). In addition, says <em>Abandonato, </em>section 128.5 differs from Civil Code section 1717 because judgments for sanctions are not routine and are not necessarily related to the size of the recovery or the amount of time billed by the attorney. Finally, says <em>Abandonato, </em>section 128.5 was enacted to make it easier to get rid of patently meritless lawsuits and to permit the imposition of sanctions for frivolous or delaying conduct. To hold \u201cthat the attorney in that situation could not be compensated for reasonable expenses would create a separate and artificial category of litigants who would be inadequately protected against another party\u2019s bad faith tactics.\u201d <em>(Abandonato v. Coldren, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at pp. 268-269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">In <em>Argaman v. Ratan, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1175, Division Five of our court held that, in \u201caccord with the rationale of <em>Trope, </em>... an attorney who litigates in propria persona may not be awarded a monetary discovery sanction under . . . sections 2030, subdivision (Z) and 2023, subdivision (b)(1), based on compensation for the time and effort expended as a result of a misuse of the discovery process.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Why? Because the rationale for an award to a pro se lawyer of attorney\u2019s fees as discovery sanctions fails for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>the same reasons an award of Civil Code section 1717 attorney\u2019s fees fails. <em>(Argaman </em>v. <em>Ratan, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1177-1180.) <em>Argaman </em>expressly rejects <em>Abandonato\u2019s </em>post-Trope analysis of sanction awards to pro se lawyers. Why? Because \u201c[sjection 128.5 utilizes language similar to section 2023, subdivision (b)(1) in describing the basis of a monetary sanction award: \u2018reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Argaman </em>v. <em>Ratan, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">We agree with <em>Argaman </em>that a pro se lawyer cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees as a discovery sanction. But we think that some of the costs that pro se litigants incur, if reasonably identifiable and allocable, are recoverable as sanctions\u2014even though those costs are ones that lawyers ordinarily include in their hourly rates or other fee structures. (Cf. <em>PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1090-1091 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511] [\u201cCivil Code section 1717 was originally enacted to establish mutuality of remedy when a contract makes recovery of attorney fees available only for one party and to prevent the oppressive use of one-sided attorney fees provisions\u201d]; <em>Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Law Offices of Conrado Sayas </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 250 F.3d 1234, 1238 [California \u201ccourts have indicated that the rule in <em>Trope </em>restricting in propria persona attorneys from recovering fees ... is narrow\u201d but that \u201cthe meaning of the term \u2018incur\u2019 is fairly broad\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Any other interpretation of section 2023, subdivision (b)(1), not only penalizes pro se litigants but also defeats the primary purpose of the Discovery Act\u2019s provisions for sanctions. (\u00a7 2017, subd. (d) [absent justification, the court <em>shall impose a monetary sanction </em>under Section 2023 <em>against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for </em>discovery].) As one text puts it, one of the main reasons for the enactment of the Discovery Act of 1986 (\u00a7 2016 et seq.) was to remedy \u201cperceived abuses in the discovery process\u201d that \u201csubverted] the purposes of discovery and g[a]ve wealthy litigants an unfair advantage over less wealthy adversaries.\u201d (Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2001) \u00a7\u00a7 S.2-8.3, pp. 8A-2 - 8A-3.) That purpose isn\u2019t served when a pro se litigant\u2019s pro se status makes an award of monetary sanction meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>When one party attempts to use the discovery process as a financial bludgeon or an obfuscation tool, the most readily identifiable cost to the other party is the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in response to the abuser\u2019s acts or omissions. Where no fees are incurred, the abuser gets one free bite\u2014 because issue, evidence, and terminating sanctions must all be preceded by the abuser\u2019s disobedience of an order compelling him to do that which he should have done in the first instance. (\u00a7\u00a7 2030, subd. (1) [interrogatories], 2031, subd. (m) [production of documents and other things]; Weil &amp; Brown, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8:1489, p. 8H-22 [if \u201cthe motion to compel is granted and the party <em>disobeys </em>the court\u2019s order to respond, additional sanctions may <em>then </em>be imposed\u201d]; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 8:1498, p. 8H-27 [the \u201conly sanction that can be imposed on a motion to compel further responses is a monetary sanction against the losing party\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">We don\u2019t think the Legislature meant to give litigants opposing pro se parties a license to abuse the discovery process, and we think that the Legislature ought to consider special provisions for the situation that arises in a case such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Until then, there are at least some costs that can be recovered. As <em>Argaman v. Ratan, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at page 1180 recognizes, a pro se litigant, including' a lawyer, is entitled to recover reasonable expenses actually incurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If pro se litigants (including pro se lawyers) actually incur expenses for computer-assisted legal research, or photocopying, or transportation to and from court, or any other identifiable item, there is no reason those expenses cannot be recovered as discovery sanctions. It bears noting, we think, that even if a pro se lawyer could recover his \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d that would not necessarily mean that he could recover the usual hourly rate (including both profit and overhead) at which he bills his clients for similar services or calculates his fees for other purposes, or that he could recover for all of the time he devoted to his own case. A client who had anyone other than himself for a lawyer might question the reasonableness of three and one-half hours spent on a boilerplate motion to compel production of documents, or the propriety of two hours charged for his appearance at a hearing held at the same time as other unrelated motions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>a status conference. But legitimate costs that can be identified ought to be recoverable by all litigants, including those who appear pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">The petition is granted, and a peremptory writ will issue to direct the trial court (1) to vacate its award of sanctions except as to the $23 in costs included in the $1,673 award; (2) to afford Milner an opportunity to submit a declaration itemizing his other costs, if any; (3) to afford Kravitz and Rosenfield an opportunity to respond; and (4) to make such other orders as may be appropriate. Michelle Kravitz is to pay her own costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Ortega, Acting P. J., and Mallano, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-10\"> Undesignated section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b964-9\"> As relevant, subdivision (a) of Civil Code section 1717 provides: \u201cIn any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to other costs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b964-10\"> In addition, the Supreme Court explained that any other construction of Civil Code section 1717 would in effect create two separate classes of pro se litigants\u2014those who are attorneys and those who are not\u2014and grant different rights and remedies to each. \u201cThe time that a doctor, for example, spends litigating a case on his own behalf also has value, both to the doctor himself and to society generally . . . ; an architect\u2019s time could otherwise be spent designing or building houses; a painter\u2019s time could be spent creating works of art ... . However, it is clear that when it enacted [Civil Code] section 1717 the Legislature did not intend to allow doctors, architects, painters, or any other nonattomeys to receive compensation for the valuable time <em>they </em>spend litigating a contract matter on their own behalf.\u201d <em>(Trope </em>v. <em>Katz, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 285.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b964-11\"> As relevant, subdivision (a) of section 128.5 provides: \u201cEvery trial court may order a party, the party\u2019s attorney, or both to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b965-9\"> As relevant, subdivision (1) of section 2030 provides (with regard to interrogatories): \u201cThe court <em>shall impose a monetary sanction </em>under Section 2023 against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. [H] <em>If a party then fails to obey an order </em>compelling further response to interrogatories, <em>the court may make those orders that are just, </em>including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Section 2023. In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Section 2023.\u201d (Italics added.) Subdivision (m) of section 2031 has a virtually identical provision with regard to requests for inspection: \u201cThe court <em>shall impose a monetary sanction </em>under Section 2023 against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to an inspection demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust, <em>If a party fails to obey an order </em>compelling further response, <em>the court may make those orders that are just, </em>including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Section 2023. In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Section 2023.\u201d (Italics added.) As relevant, subdivision (b)(1) of section 2023 provides: \u201cTo the extent authorized by the section governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this article, the court . . . may impose the following sanctions <em>against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number><em>of the discovery process, </em>[f] The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process . . . <em>pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. ... If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this article, the court shall impose that sanction </em>unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.\u201d (Italics added.) Argaman\u2019s analysis of section 2030 necessarily applies with equal force to section 2031.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b967-8\"><em> Argaman </em>says that, had \u201cthe Legislature intended for all litigants to be compensated for time and effort expended in connection with discovery abuses, it could have so provided.\u201d <em>(Argaman </em>v. <em>Ratan, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.4th at p. 1180.) That\u2019s true, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite that simple\u2014since the Legislature <em>did </em>provide that everyone who abuses the discovery process with regard to interrogatories and requests for production shall <em>pay </em>the other party\u2019s reasonable expenses. The problem is that there is nothing of significance to pay when the abused party has not incurred attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
