J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY1\">The trial court permits the prosecution to call as its witness defendant\u2019s Spanish interpreter. The interpreter testifies she saw defendant commit an ambiguous act at counsel table which arguably could be incriminating. Here we conclude that admission of such evidence is prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Juan Chavez Leon appeals the judgment following his conviction of committing a forcible lewd act upon a child (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 288, subd. (b)(1), count 1), with a finding that he committed the offense during a residential burglary with intent to commit said lewd act (\u00a7 667.61, subds. (a) &amp; (d)(4)); residential burglary (\u00a7 459, count 2); false imprisonment by violence (\u00a7 236, count 3); and dissuading a witness from making an arrest (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (b)(3), count 4). We conclude that the court committed prejudicial error by admitting testimony from Leon\u2019s interpreter that she saw him moving his hands over his groin while the child testified.[[/]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment on counts 1, 3 and 4. We reverse the finding under section 667.61, subdivisions (a) and (d)(4), and the conviction on count 2 (residential burglary).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">Yomayra, a 12-year-old girl, was home alone on a school day because she had an ear infection. Leon, the gardener, knocked on the door and asked her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>if her mother had left a check for him on the stereo. She said, \u201c[L]et me look. Can you please wait outside.\u201d She closed the door, leaving an opening of about an inch.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">While Yomayra was looking for the check in the kitchen, Leon entered the house, closed the front door, and locked it. Then he went to the sliding glass door and locked it. He stated, \u201cI found the check.\u201d As Yomayra entered the living room, he grabbed her and pushed her into the sofa and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna hurt.\u201d He got on top of her, pulled his pants down, and pulled her pants and panties down. He attempted to insert his penis in her vagina, but she fought him off. He ejaculated on her thigh and clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Yomayra screamed, pushed Leon off her, and ran to the door. He grabbed her by her hair, dragged her to the living room, and threw her on the couch. He gave her $10 and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">During the trial, Rebecca Rubenstein, a court interpreter employed by the County of Ventura, interpreted for Leon and sat next to him at the defense table. She saw him opening and closing his fingers over the crotch area of his pants and reported this to the bailiff during a recess. The prosecutor, who was at her table near the bailiff\u2019s desk, overheard the statement, but did not mention it to defense counsel because she did not intend to use it. The next day she notified defense counsel that she decided to call Rubenstein as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The trial court denied Leon\u2019s motion to exclude Rubenstein\u2019s testimony, pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. It stated, \u201cthe act committed, if it be an act, is subject to interpretation and argument by counsel, and the nature of the charge itself is grievous enough that I don\u2019t think that this creates undue prejudice.\u201d Rubenstein testified that Leon had his hands on his lap when Yomayra was testifying. He was opening and closing his fingers. Rubenstein did not know if he was touching his penis and did not see an erection. Leon never opened his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">The prosecutor told the jury, Leon \u201cis so turned on by the mere sight of [Yomayra] in court that he\u2019s masturbating.\u201d After the guilty verdicts, Leon moved for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct. In denying the motion the court stated, \u201cthe fact that the district attorney was present when [Rubenstein] did it ... is unfortunate from the standpoint of your client. But I don\u2019t think that was the intent of the interpreter .... When she was told that she might have to testify, she was furious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">I. <em>Exclusion Under Evidence Code Section 352</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Leon contends the trial court erred by not excluding Rubenstein\u2019s testimony under Evidence Code section 352. He argues that the undue prejudice caused by Rubenstein\u2019s testimony outweighed any probative value. The trial court assumed that, because the charged offenses were so serious, Rubenstein\u2019s evidence would not be prejudicial. Instead, the opposite is the case. The court was obligated to decide whether the probative value of this evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial impact. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leonard </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 183, 188 [193 Cal.Rptr. 171, 666 P.2d 28].) The court did not weigh those factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Moreover, the prosecution did not show how Leon\u2019s actions in court were relevant to his intent when he entered the house. The court could not articulate what act Leon did, or whether it was an act. Rubenstein testified that Leon had his hands on his lap when Yomayra was testifying. He was opening and closing his fingers over his groin area. But Rubenstein did not know if he was touching his penis and did not see an erection. Leon never opened his pants. The court told the jury that, \u201cThere was no evidence that [Leon] touched his penis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Because the evidence was so ambiguous, it likely confused the jury. Because it was unclear what Leon did with his hands, the probative value, at best, was weak. The court\u2019s ruling that counsel could argue their interpretation of Leon\u2019s actions to the jury opened Pandora\u2019s box.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The prosecution told the jury that Leon was masturbating in the courtroom while Yomayra was testifying. \u201cHe\u2019s so turned on by the mere sight of her in court that he\u2019s masturbating.\u201d This was inflammatory argument in a child molestation case. One juror wrote a note suggesting that Leon be deported. The risk was high that jurors would focus more on Leon\u2019s conduct in court than on the elements of the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Casting Rubenstein as a witness against Leon might lead jurors to conclude she was an integral part of the defense team whose members thought Leon was guilty. <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 239 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) Compelling Rubenstein to testify to conduct that may have been innocuous, or at best, could possibly lead to an inference of criminality lightened the prosecution\u2019s burden to establish Leon\u2019s intent at the time he entered the premises. The prejudicial impact of testimony is increased where it confuses the issues or inflames the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>(People v. Falsetta </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 916 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 847, 986 P.2d 182].) The admission of this testimony did both.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">We conclude and Leon concedes that the evidence of lewd conduct, dissuading a witness, and false imprisonment was so substantial that error in the admission of Rubenstein\u2019s testimony was harmless on those counts. But he contends that the admission of her testimony on the burglary and the section 667.61 enhancement was unduly prejudicial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">For the section 667.61 enhancement to apply, the jury must find that Leon entered Yomayra\u2019s home with the intent to commit a forcible lewd act on her. (\u00a7\u00a7 288, subd. (b)(1), 667.61, subds. (a) &amp; (d)(4).) Leon contends that he did not enter the house with such intent; he only went in to look for his check, and his actions inside were spontaneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The evidence involving his intent at the time of entry is largely circumstantial. Lourdes P., Yomayra\u2019s mother, testified that Leon\u2019s check was due on the 12th day of the month. Leon came to the house on the 14th. Ms. P. testified that Leon normally came to the house to pick up his check. There was nothing unusual about Leon asking Yomayra to find it because he had previously done that. Yomayra testified Leon was not wearing gloves and from another room she heard him lock the front and sliding glass doors. A police fingerprint expert, however, testified he could not find Leon\u2019s prints on those areas. Yomayra also testified that shortly before the attack she heard Leon digging inside papers as if he were looking for something. This was consistent with Leon\u2019s position he did not form the intent to commit the crime until after he entered the house to look for his check. Moreover, no evidence suggests that Leon knew Yomayra would be home.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The prosecution used Leon\u2019s conduct in court as a critical link to establish his intent to attack Yomayra before he entered the house. The prosecution characterized an ambiguous act at defense table as a crime and told the jury, \u201che\u2019s so turned on by the mere sight of her even in a courtroom that, when she opened up that door, you know what he was thinking, you know what . . . his intent was.\u201d The emotional impact of that statement would overshadow a rational discussion in Leon\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Rubenstein\u2019s testimony presented a powerful picture. Jurors could conclude Leon\u2019s defense team collapsed because they thought he was guilty. The trial court reasoned that the interpreter\u2019s testimony was not unduly prejudicial because the offenses were so serious. This rationale for admitting the testimony was the very reason for not admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>II. <em>The Prosecution Did Not \u201cInvade the Defense Team\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Leon contends the prosecution secretly obtained damaging information from Rubenstein and withheld it from his counsel. The trial court denied his motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">A prosecutor\u2019s deliberate attempt to obtain confidential information from the defense is an invasion of the \u201cdefense camp.\u201d <em>(Morrow v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1259-1261 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 210] [prosecutor sent investigator to eavesdrop on defendant\u2019s conversation with his counsel].) Such prosecutorial misconduct compromises the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and may justify dismissal of the case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1263.) But, as we stated in <em>Morrow, </em>\u201cWe can, of course, envision the situation where a prosecutor . . . seated at counsel table inadvertently overhears a defendant conferring with his or her attorney. Our holding would not apply in this situation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1261, fn. 3.) That is what we have here. When Ruben-stein made the remark to the bailiff, the prosecutor was at her table near the bailiff\u2019s desk. She overheard the statement in the courtroom, where she had a right to be. Here, unlike <em>Morrow, </em>there was no attempt to obtain information from the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">[[HI. <em>CAUICNo. 17.41.1]]</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The judgment on counts 1, 3 and 4 is affirmed; in all other respects it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Yegan, J., and Coffee, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 6, 2001, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-13\"> A11 statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-14\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 812.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 812.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
