J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANO\">The respondent superior court held petitioner, Steven G. Hanson, an attorney, in contempt for comments he made while representing a client in a criminal proceeding. Petitioner primarily argues the respondent\u2019s court order should be annulled because it fails to set out facts in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>support. Because we conclude the respondent\u2019s court order of contempt constitutes an order in a case of indirect contempt, we shall deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On November 6, 2000, petitioner was presenting the closing argument to the jury on behalf of the defendant in <em>People v. Delgadillo </em>(Super. Ct. Siskiyou County, No. CRF 00-931). Judge Charles N. Henry was presiding. Petitioner argued the prosecutor did not want the jury to see the defendant\u2019s wife and young son because he wanted the jury to perceive the defendant as \u201csome sort of drug dealer, gun-toting, evil person [who] deserves to be locked up in prison.\u201d After Judge Henry sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection, petitioner asserted the jury would be instructed to return a \u201cjust and lawful\u201d verdict, but \u201cjust\u201d means \u201ca fair trial,\u201d and \u201cMr. Delgadillo has not received a fair trial in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">After excusing the jury, Judge Henry admonished petitioner that his statement was contemptuous. The judge informed petitioner that he would consider imposing sanctions at the conclusion of the trial depending on how the rest of the trial unfolded. The judge also warned petitioner that if he continued to act contemptuously, he would be sanctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Upon the jury\u2019s return, petitioner argued the police and the prosecutor had exaggerated the amount of marijuana seized from the defendant. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">. \u201c[Mr. Hanson]: Mr. Larson wants you to see Mr. Delgadillo as less than a person, as an evil, drug-dealing person, a gun-toting, rotten character. But I know he\u2019s not. That is the goal of the prosecution, to misrepresent facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">\u201cMr. Larson: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">\u201cThe Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">\u201cMr. Hanson: The goal of the prosecution is to represent facts in a way to their side. Defense attorneys do it. I do it in this case. We all do it. That is our job. You should never trust any attorney for what they say. Because they\u2019re paid, just like I\u2019m paid to misrepresent the truth to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-13\">\u201cMr. Larson: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Sustained. [^] Counsel, any reference to misrepresentation by any attorney is stricken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cMr. Hanson: Excuse me, I should have said to bend the facts to their case, that is what we get paid to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Petitioner went on to assert the defendant was the only person who had been completely honest: \u201cHe\u2019s been more honest than Mr. Larson and myself in this case. We have tried to bend the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">After the jury retired to consider its verdict, Judge Henry indicated he was holding petitioner in direct contempt and would conduct a contempt proceeding after a 10-minute recess. Thereafter, the judge explained he was citing petitioner for contempt for arguing: (1) that his client could not receive a fair trial; and (2) that it was the job of the prosecutor and defense attorney to misrepresent the facts. However, the judge then granted petitioner\u2019s request for a continuance because of the delicate nature of the contempt proceedings and to allow the court time to review transcripts of petitioner\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The next day, November 7, 2000, Judge Henry filed an order to show cause why petitioner should not be held in contempt. The judge also filed an affidavit, which recited petitioner\u2019s statements that his client had not received a fair trial and that the job of the prosecution and defense was to misrepresent the facts. The affidavit asserted these statements \u201cwere contemptuous on their face in that judge, prosecutor, defense counsel and the entire judicial process were held out to be a sham and a misrepresentation of the truth to a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">After a series of delays, the matter eventually came on for hearing before Judge Larry L. Dier of the respondent superior court on January 22, 2001. During the hearing, the respondent court took judicial notice of the reporter\u2019s transcript of the November 6, 2000, proceedings. Petitioner stipulated that, if called to testify, Judge Henry would verify the statements contained in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The next day, January 23, 2001, the respondent court found petitioner in contempt, ordered him either to pay a $200 fine or to serve four days in the county jail and stayed payment of the fine until February 1, 2001. The court then explained: \u201cI find that although the precise word, the misrepresenting or the bending words, were not the subject of a warning by the Court, the whole tenor of the argument it seems to me was that your client couldn\u2019t get a fair trial and that lawyers are there to misrepresent and to bend facts. And that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>not a factually true or a legally true statement. Lawyers are there to advocate certainly for their clients, and there often may be a tension between what you can legitimately say and what you can\u2019t say. But I think when you make the statement that it\u2019s your job to misrepresent or to bend facts, that is well beyond the boundary line. The Court\u2014dignity of the Court and the respect of the Court needs to be maintained, and I think that even [though] those precise words weren\u2019t the subject of a warning, that the general tenor of a fair trial issue was continued after the warnings, and so for those reasons I have decided that it was a contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">On January 23, 2001, the respondent court signed and filed an order which provides: \u201cThe Court finds that Defendant Steve Hanson is guilty of contempt of Court, in violation of CCP code <em>[sic] </em>section 1209.A (1)(3)(5) [szc], Rules of Professional Conduct Section B200 (a)(b) [szc], and Business and Professions Codes [\u00edz'c] Section 6068 (b)(f).\u201d The order then prescribes petitioner\u2019s punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">On January 29, 2001, petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this court. On February 1, 2001, we stayed enforcement of the contempt order. The respondent court thereafter filed an informal response to the petition.  We subsequently notified the parties we would treat the habeas corpus petition as a petition for writ of prohibition (see <em>In re Coleman </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 568, 572, fn. 2 [116 Cal.Rptr. 381, 526 P.2d 533]), and requested opposition in accordance with the requirements of <em>Palma v. U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">A. <em>The Contempt Order Is Not Invalid by Virtue of Its Failure to Recite Facts in Support of Its Findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Petitioner first contends the respondent\u2019s January 23, 2001, contempt order is void on its face because it is a direct contempt order and must therefore state sufficient facts to support the contempt finding. Because we conclude the respondent\u2019s court order found an indirect contempt, we reject petitioner\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u201cWhen a contempt is committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, or of the judge at chambers, it may be punished summarily; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>which an order must be made, reciting the facts as occurring in such immediate view and presence, adjudging that the person proceeded against is thereby guilty of a contempt, and that he be punished as therein prescribed. 00 When the contempt is not committed in the immediate view and presence of the court, or of the judge at chambers, an affidavit shall be presented to the court or judge of the facts constituting the contempt, or a statement of the facts by the referees or arbitrators, or other judicial officers.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1211, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u201c \u2018Direct\u2019 contempt is that committed in the immediate view and presence of the court or of the judge in chambers; all other contempts, . . . which occur outside the presence of the court, are \u2018indirect.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Reliable Enterprises, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 604, 611 [204 Cal.Rptr. 786], disapproved on another ground in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1230, 1248, fn. 13 [265 Cal.Rptr. 144, 783 P.2d 731].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u201cIn a case of <em>direct </em>contempt, the court must make an order reciting the facts constituting the contempt. [Citations.] However, in a case of <em>indirect </em>contempt, the court need not state evidentiary facts supporting an ultimate finding of wilful violation of an order. Such a finding will be upheld in a case of indirect contempt if it is supported by substantial evidence. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Reliable Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 614.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u201c[T]he generally recommended standard that the order recite every factor essential to the contempt holding appears to have been promulgated for application in direct contempt cases wherein there is no filing and serving of charging documents which present a prima facie showing of such elements or a record thereof. The significant thing in the indirect contempt cases is that the record contain the findings upon which the contempt order is based.\u201d <em>(In re Morelli </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 819, 850-851 [91 Cal.Rptr. 72], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u201cMoreover, while an indirect contempt judgment need not recite the court\u2019s factual findings as a jurisdictional prerequisite, those findings should be specifically recited orally or in the judgment to assist a reviewing court in determining if the evidence is sufficient to support the judgment of contempt.\u201d (M<em>oss </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 396, 404, fn. 3 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 950 P.2d 59].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Although direct contempt may be punished instantly by the court, where the contempt is committed by an attorney in the midst of a jury trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201c[v]irtually uniform practice entails deferment of the contempt adjudication or of actual punishment until the jury is discharged.\u201d <em>(People v. Fusaro </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 877, 888 [96 Cal.Rptr. 368].) The term \u201csummarily,\u201d as used in section 1211, \u201crefers to the character of the contempt proceeding, not its timing, and does not demand instanter punishment. [Citations.]\u201d (18 Cal.App.3d at p. 889.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Moreover, when the contempt adjudication or punishment is deferred to the end of trial, the attorney must have reasonable notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond, and the hearing may, and sometimes must, be set before another judge. <em>(Taylor v. Hayes </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 488, 498-499, 501-502 [94 S.Ct. 2697, 2703-2704, 2704-2705, 41 L.Ed.2d 897]; <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 455, 466 [91 S.Ct. 499, 505, 27 L.Ed.2d 532]; <em>In re Karagozian </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 516, 522-524 [118 Cal.Rptr. 793].)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Because petitioner\u2019s statements were made in Judge Henry\u2019s immediate view and presence, Judge Henry could have himself adjudicated and punished the contempt. However, Judge Henry chose instead to utilize the procedures for indirect contempt, and chose to set the matter for hearing before another judge, Judge Dier. Because none of the contemptuous conduct occurred \u201cin the immediate view and presence of\u2019 Judge Dier, the respondent court adjudicated an indirect contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The parties have simply assumed that if a contempt occurs in a judge\u2019s immediate presence, the contempt necessarily constitutes for all time or must be adjudicated as a direct contempt. This assumption is inconsistent with case law recognizing a judge\u2019s authority to defer the contempt adjudication to another judge. The assumption is also inconsistent with the language of section 1211, which requires \u201cthe court, or . . . the judge at chambers,\u201d when adjudicating contempt as direct contempt, to recite \u201cthe facts as occurring in such immediate view and presence.\u201d When, as here, a judge chooses to defer adjudication of contempt to another judge, the judge who adjudicates the contempt obviously cannot recite the facts as occurring in the judge\u2019s immediate view and presence. Rather, the second judge must, as here, be presented with \u201can affidavit ... of the facts constituting the contempt, or a statement of the facts by the referees or arbitrators, or other judicial officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Although the respondent court should have set out the facts constituting the contempt in its January 23, 2001, order, the court was not jurisdictionally required to do so. Rather, the court orally recited the facts constituting contempt at the conclusion of the January 23, 2001, hearing. Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>contempt order is not void for failure to recite the facts constituting contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Nor does petitioner\u2019s alternative contention have merit, that even if the order is one in indirect contempt, it is insufficient because \u201cthe order must still show that the court found sufficient facts to be true as to constitute a contempt.\u201d Petitioner cites two cases involving indirect contempt, both of which recite the rule that the indirect contempt order will stand if \u201c \u2018the record unmistakably shows that the court found to be true all the facts constituting contempt of the authority of the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bone v. Superior Court </em>(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 972, 975 [54 Cal.Rptr. 406], quoting <em>Harlan v. Superior Court </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 902, 906 [211 P.2d 942], disapproved on another ground in <em>Signal Oil etc. Co. v. Ashland Oil etc. Co. </em>(1958) 49 Cal.2d 764, 775-776, fn. 5 [322 P.2d 1].) Our record so unmistakably shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">0</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">B. <em>The Affidavit Charging Contempt Is Procedurally Regular.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Petitioner next raises a series of contentions challenging the procedural regularity of the affidavit setting forth the contemptuous acts. Petitioner first contends the respondent court prejudicially failed to amend the affidavit to include allegations of contempt made by Judge Henry during the contempt hearing concerning a videotape brought into court by the defendant in the underlying criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is not supported by the record. Judge Henry never alleged that petitioner\u2019s conduct involving the videotape was contemptuous. Rather, Judge Henry mentioned the incident involving the videotape solely as background information, relevant to explain why petitioner may have been motivated to assert that his client had not received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Petitioner next asserts the affidavit is insufficient because it fails to allege petitioner violated the court\u2019s order not to mention a \u201cProposition 215 defense\u201d and, further, there is neither a finding nor evidence that petitioner violated this court order. This is irrelevant. Judge Henry\u2019s affidavit makes it clear he cited petitioner for contempt based on petitioner\u2019s statements that his client had not received a fair trial and that both petitioner and the prosecutor had misrepresented the facts, <em>not </em>because petitioner violated the court\u2019s order not to mention Proposition 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Petitioner also argues the affidavit is insufficient because it does not allege any of the contemptuous statements were made toward the judge. Again, petitioner is wrong. The affidavit alleges petitioner\u2019s statements held the judge out as being \u201ca sham\u201d and as misrepresenting the truth to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>C. <em>Petitioner\u2019s Statements Were Contemptuous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Petitioner contends that neither of his statements was contemptuous. First, he argues his remark that his client had not received a fair trial did not constitute contempt because it was not directed toward the judge, relying on \u201cIn re Carrow CA3d 924 [,?zc].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In <em>In re Carrow </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 924 [115 Cal.Rptr. 601], the Court of Appeal annulled a finding of contempt based on an attorney\u2019s remark, \u201c \u2018Your Honor, I submit this trial is becoming a joke.\u2019 \u201d The appellate court explained the remark was not contemptuous on its face because it did not refer to judicial conduct. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 927-928.) Moreover, the court concluded the contempt order was defective in failing to recite how the remark obstructed the administration of justice, particularly given the context of the case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 928-930.) That is, the attorney had called a probation officer as a witness and was necessarily concerned about limiting the scope of cross-examination. The trial court refused to hear from the attorney when he tried to address the court regarding imposing such limitations. During the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the witness, the witness \u201cran away with a narrative.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 928.) As the Court of Appeal explained: \u201cThen came the single expostulation from petitioner. It may have been directed primarily at the witness and only secondarily, if at all, at the judge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 929.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Petitioner fails to address the case distinguished by the court in <em>Carrow, </em>i.e., <em>In re Buckley </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 237 [110 Cal.Rptr. 121, 514 P.2d 1201, 68 A.L.R.2d 248]. There, the Supreme Court upheld a finding of contempt based on an attorney\u2019s statement, \u201c \u2018This Court obviously doesn\u2019t want to apply the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 246, 259.) The Supreme Court explained \u201cit is the settled law of this state that an attorney commits a direct contempt when he impugns the integrity of the court by statements made in open court either orally or in writing. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 248.) The Supreme Court held the statement was contemptuous on its face because it impugned the court\u2019s integrity by suggesting \u201cthat the judge knew the law but deliberately chose to ignore it,\u201d and thus, with no basis in fact, improperly charged \u201cdeliberate judicial dishonesty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 250; see also <em>Gillen v. Municipal Court, etc. </em>(1940) 37 Cal.App.2d 428, 429 [99 P.2d 555] [contempt affirmed where attorney said that opposing counsel had won before he started].)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Unlike <em>Carrow, </em>but like <em>Buckley </em>and <em>Gillen, </em>petitioner\u2019s statement that his client \u201chas not received a fair trial\u201d was contemptuous on its face because it impugned Judge Henry\u2019s integrity by suggesting he had failed in his duty to guarantee a fair trial. Petitioner\u2019s remark constituted \u201c[disorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge while holding the court, tending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>to interrupt the due course of a trial or other judicial proceeding.\u201d (\u00a7 1209, subd. (a)l.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Finally, petitioner contends his statement that the prosecutor\u2019s purpose was to misrepresent the facts was not contemptuous, relying on \u201cP v. Bell C3d 502, 538 [sic].\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 502, 538 [262 Cal.Rptr. 1, 778 P.2d 129], the prosecutor argued to the jury that it was the defense attorney\u2019s job to \u201c \u2018focus on areas which tend to confuse\u2019 \u201d and to \u201c \u2018throw sand in your eyes,\u2019 \u201d and that defense counsel \u201c \u2018wants to confuse you.\u2019 \u201d The issue before the Supreme Court was not whether these statements were contemptuous but rather whether they constituted prosecutorial misconduct. The court held that to the extent the remarks could be construed as suggesting counsel was obligated to present a defense dishonestly, the argument was improper, but rejected the claim of error because the defense attorney failed to object. <em>(Ibid.) Bell </em>supports the respondent\u2019s conclusion that it is contemptuous for an attorney to assert that opposing counsel\u2019s job is to misrepresent the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">A court may hold an attorney in contempt for willful violation of a duty. (\u00a7 1209, subd. (a)3.) An attorney has the duty to maintain respect to the courts and judicial officers, to abstain from all offensive personality, and not to mislead the judge or jury by an artifice or false statement of fact or law. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subds. .(b), (d) &amp; (f); Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 5-200(B).) Petitioner violated these duties by arguing to the jury that it was the goal of the defense and prosecution to misrepresent the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The petition for writ of habeas corpus, treated as a petition for writ of prohibition, is denied. The stay previously issued is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Callahan, J., and Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-11\"> Prohibition lies to determine whether a superior court has exceeded its jurisdiction by imposing an invalid contempt order. <em>(Lister v.
