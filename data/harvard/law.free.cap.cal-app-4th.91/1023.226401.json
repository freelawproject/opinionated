J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmmD\">Cesar V., biological and presumed father of Anthony and presumed father of Annissa, and Cesar\u2019s mother, Elvia E., seek extraordinary relief from the order of the juvenile court refusing to place the children with Elvia. They claim the social worker failed to assess Elvia properly under the relative placement preference, and the juvenile court should have independently evaluated her as a placement resource rather than merely reviewing the decision of the Orange County Social Services Agency (SSA) for an abuse of discretion. We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">In September 1999, Annissa and Anthony were declared dependents of the juvenile court. The children, then two and three years of age, had been detained after their mother was arrested. Cesar was unable to take care of the children because he was about to enter a court-ordered residential drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>treatment program; Annissa\u2019s biological father was nowhere to be found. After dispositional orders were entered, the court granted Cesar de facto parent status as to Annissa because, although he was not her biological father, he was present at her birth, his name was on her birth certificate, and he had always cared for her and held her out as his own child. The children were placed together in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">At the six-month review hearing for Annissa, reunification services were terminated and a permanency hearing was set for July 2000. At Anthony\u2019s six-month review, however, further reunification services were offered to the parents. By July, Cesar was requesting reunification services for Annissa because he planned to adopt her after he reunified with Anthony. The court continued Annissa\u2019s permanency hearing, and Cesar filed a paternity petition, seeking presumed father status.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">In August, the court found Cesar to be Annissa\u2019s presumed father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It vacated Annissa\u2019s permanency hearing and set a 12-month review hearing for both children a week later. By then, however, Cesar had been arrested on charges of burglary, petty theft and probation violation. According to his counsel, \u201che was resigned to losing his parental rights because of his being incarcerated. [^] However, he was adamant that he wanted the children placed with his mother . . . .\u201d He was transported in custody and stipulated to the termination of reunification services for both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The children\u2019s foster family was not interested in adoption, necessitating a change in placement; all parties stipulated to a placement evaluation of Elvia. The court set a permanency hearing for both children in January 2001 and ordered \u201cSSA to evaluate paternal grandmother and paternal uncle for possible placement and any other suitable relative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">In the report filed on December 22, 2000, for the permanency hearing, the social worker reported the children had been placed in a prospective adoptive home on November 21, 2000. The social worker stated that \u201cElvia . . . was found not to be a suitable placement due to having a CAR [child abuse registry] history dated March 25, 1996 for allegations of physical abuse [against her son, Cesar] that were unsubstantiated due to an alternative plausible explanation. . . . The undersigned reviewed this Child Abuse Report with her supervisor and decided that this would not be a stable and safe environment for the children based on what was included in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>report.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The social worker was also concerned that the grandmother had not been in contact with social services or the children during the dependency proceedings and that she had not followed up with paperwork necessary to have the children placed with her. The social worker met with Elvia on September 18, 2000, and \u201crequested documentation from her boyfriend she lives with to do a background check as well as a household budget and proof of income to financially provide for the children!,] which was never given to the undersigned.\u201d Elvia told the social worker she was moving and would call to give social services her new telephone number so the new home could be evaluated. The social worker stated there was no word from Elvia until December 4. \u201cThe undersigned went ahead to place these children in a stable fos-adopt home in order to not further delay providing a possible permanent home for these children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">When the court convened for the permanency hearing on January 3, 2001, Cesar\u2019s counsel challenged SSA\u2019s denial of placement with Elvia. After discussions on and off the record, the parties stipulated to proceed \u201cin a bifurcated fashion ...\u201d and resolve Cesar\u2019s challenge to placement before the permanency issues. Cesar\u2019s counsel was allowed to make an oral motion that SSA abused its discretion \u201cin the reevaluation and assessment of the grandmother pursuant to the order made on September 7th.\u201d Over the next two weeks, the court heard five days of testimony and argument on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The social worker, Julie Fulkerson, testified Elvia called her after.the September 7 court hearing; Fulkerson returned the call and set up the September 18 meeting at Elvia\u2019s home. They discussed background clearance information and household budget issues, and Fulkerson explained Elvia would receive forms that needed to be filled out. The forms were sent to Elvia 10 days later by a social worker assistant. On September 26, Cesar\u2019s counsel called Fulkerson and asked her to follow up on the relative placement issue. Fulkerson called Elvia the next day reminding her to call with her new address and telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">On September 29, Fulkerson received the CAR report from 1996. Although she felt the report might disqualify Elvia, she did not speak to Elvia, Cesar, or any other witnesses to the reported incidents. Fulkerson reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>the report with her supervisor in \u201cmaybe early October,\u201d and they determined Elvia was unsuitable based on the report \u201cas well as over time not hearing from her, not getting other information, documentation, background information from her boyfriend, household budget. There was no response from her at all.\u201d Fulkerson later testified the \u201cprimary reason\u201d for not placing the children with Elvia was her lack of \u201crelationship with the children throughout dependency proceedings.\u201d Elvia called Fulkerson on December 4, and Fulkerson returned the call on December 16, informing Elvia that the children had been placed elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Fulkerson denied receiving calls from Cesar\u2019s counsel or an SSA court officer in October 2000. She acknowledged receiving a telephone message from Cesar\u2019s counsel on November 27, 2000, asking about progress on placing the children with Elvia, but instead of returning the call, Fulkerson called the deputy county counsel on the case and asked her \u201cto direct information to [Cesar\u2019s counsel] with regard to the placement issues.\u201d Both Cesar\u2019s counsel and the SSA court officer called Fulkerson \u00f3n December 4 asking about placement; both calls were referred to county counsel. Fulkerson testified she had talked to her supervisor about the case and \u201che told me it\u2019s standard protocol to go ahead and call your county counsel and direct it that way.\u201d The court sustained relevancy objections to Cesar\u2019s counsel\u2019s questions about the \u201cprotocol\u201d of social workers refusing to speak directly to other parties\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The children\u2019s prospective adoptive family first saw pictures of the children on September 27, 2000, at a family night sponsored by SSA. The children met the family on November 15 and were placed with them a week later. Fulkerson testified the family had the resources necessary to meet the children\u2019s special education needs. \u201cThese foster parents had a lot of background information, with their own son needing the specific education needs.\u201d She also considered that \u201cthe foster mother is an at-home foster mother and she\u2019s readily available to meet the needs of the two children in the home.\u201d Cesar\u2019s counsel objected to Fulkerson\u2019s testimony as irrelevant. \u201cThis is not relating to the fos/adopt parents. It\u2019s regarding the appropriateness of analyzing the placement of the grandmother. This is not a who\u2019s better test.\u201d The court overruled the objection, stating that the relative placement preference statute did not apply after the termination of reunification services \u201c[a]nd in addition, in this instance we are looking at abuse of discretion with respect to placement issues. And certainly one aspect of abuse of discretion is a consideration that was given to the needs of the child and the needs that these prospective adoptive parents could meet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Elvia testified she had almost daily contact with the children before the dependency proceedings were initiated and she saw the children during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>first part of the dependency when Cesar was allowed unmonitored visits. She did not ask for visits for herself because she thought she was not entitled and she thought Cesar would reunify with them. When Fulkerson met with Elvia in September, \u201cshe asked me questions about my income, and how I would provide for the kids. And then she asked me about my boyfriend\u2019s income. And I told her I did not have that information at that time.\u201d Fulkerson told Elvia she would send some paperwork, but Elvia claimed it never arrived. She testified she made several calls to Fulkerson between September 18 and December 4, but the calls were not returned. She had planned to move into a house she was purchasing in November, but the escrow fell through. She ultimately moved in December into another house she is purchasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">The juvenile court found SSA acted upon its order to assess Elvia as a placement resource. It determined that Welfare and Institutions Code section 361.3<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applied and that the question before it was whether SSA abused its discretion under the statute. Given the information available to SSA, which the court found was \u201ccredible to the point it was not unreasonable for the Agency to act on it,\u201d balanced against Elvia\u2019s conduct, the court found SSA did not abuse its discretion in denying placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Cesar\u2019s counsel then filed a section 388 petition alleging new evidence showing Elvia\u2019s suitability as a placement for the children. The petition incorporated offers of proof from an independent clinical social worker and Elvia\u2019s former landlady which confirmed Elvia\u2019s good moral character and her parenting abilities, and provided an assessment of her new home. The court denied a hearing on the petition, finding it did not make a prima facie showing of how the relief sought would be in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">II. <em>Relative Placement Preference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Cesar and Elvia first contend SSA never completed the relative placement evaluation it was ordered to perform at the 12-month review hearing on September 7. They are joined in this contention by counsel for both Anthony and Annissa, who urged at oral argument before this court that Elvia\u2019s evaluation should be completed. Cesar and Elvia also contend even if the evaluation were complete, the juvenile court used the wrong standard in reviewing SSA\u2019s refusal to place the children with Elvia. They claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>section 361.3,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court should have used its independent judgment to evaluate the grandmother rather than merely reviewing SSA\u2019s actions for an abuse of discretion. SSA, on the other hand, contends section 361.3 was not applicable because reunification services had been terminated, but that in any event, the juvenile court correctly evaluated SSA\u2019s decisions under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">A. <em>Section 361.3 applies before parental rights are terminated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">It is well established that the relative placement preference found in section 361.3 does not apply after parental rights have been terminated and the child has been freed for adoption. In <em>In re Sarah S. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 274 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 503], the court compared that statute to section 366.26, subdivision (k), which provides that a relative caretaker or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>foster parent of a dependent child shall be given preference in applying to adopt the child. \u201c[S]ection 361.3 assures interested relatives that, when a child is taken from her parents and placed outside the home pending the determination whether reunification is possible, the relative\u2019s application will be considered before a stranger\u2019s application. . . . When reunification fails, section 366.26, subdivision (k), assures a \u2018relative caretaker\u2019 who has cared for the child that, when parental rights are terminated and the child is freed for adoption, his or her application will be considered before those submitted by other relatives and strangers.\u201d <em>(In re Sarah S., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 285; see also <em>In re Baby Girl D. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 1489, 1493 [257 Cal.Rptr. 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Here, the question is whether the relative placement preference applies when a new placement becomes necessary after reunification services are terminated but before parental rights are terminated and adoptive placement becomes an issue. Citing language from several cases, SSA urges the underlying purpose of the relative placement preference is to facilitate reunification, and that purpose no longer obtains once reunification services are terminated. \u201c[T]he \u2018object of dispositional hearings is to find a temporary caretaker who will meet the child\u2019s physical and psychological needs while cooperating in reunification efforts. A relative, who presumably has a broader interest in family unity, is more likely than a stranger to be supportive of the parent-child relationship and less likely to develop a conflicting emotional bond with the child.\u2019 [Citation.] When a case moves from reunification to permanency planning, however, and a court determines that a child should be freed for adoption, we held there is \u2018no longer any reason to give relatives preferential consideration in placement.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Jessica Z. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1089, 1098 [275 Cal.Rptr. 323], quoting <em>In re Baby Girl D., supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 1493; see also <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">These cases, however, were decided under a previous version of section 361.3. In 1993, the statute was amended to include subdivision (d), which specifically provides for the application of the relative placement preference if a child must be moved after disposition, \u201cto relatives who have not been found to be unsuitable and who will fulfill the child\u2019s reunification <em>or permanent plan </em>requirements.\u201d (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (d), italics added.) In 1997, the statute was again amended to add the ability of the relative to \u201c[p]rovide <em>legal permanence for the child if reunification fails\u201d </em>to the list of factors that must be considered when evaluating a relative for placement. (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(7)(H), italics added.) These additions to the statute indicate the Legislature did not intend to limit the purpose of the relative placement preference to reunification efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>B. <em>SSA\u2019s evaluation of Elvia was not sufficient under section 361.3.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Section 361.3 gives \u201cpreferential consideration\u201d to a relative request for placement, which means \u201cthat the relative seeking placement shall be the first placement to be considered and investigated.\u201d (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (c)(1).) The assessment of the relative shall involve the consideration of eight factors set out in the statute, including \u201c[t]he good moral character of the relative and any other adult living in the home, including whether any individual residing in the home has a prior history of violent criminal acts or has been responsible for acts of child abuse or neglect\u201d; and \u201c[t]he safety of the relative\u2019s home. For purposes of this paragraph, the county social worker shall conduct a direct assessment of the safety of the relative\u2019s home. The information obtained as a result of this assessment shall be documented by the county social worker in the child\u2019s case record.\u201d (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(5) &amp; (8).) The statute reiterates: \u201cThe county social worker shall document these efforts [to assess the relative according to the statutory factors] in the social study prepared pursuant to Section 358.1.\u201d (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a)(8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The record shows the social worker did not make significant efforts to gather the required information before deciding Elvia was unsuitable and abandoning the assessment. Furthermore, the social worker began looking for another foster family before Elvia had even received SSA\u2019s forms. This approach is clearly not within the spirit of the statute. While we understand the urgency involved in securing a stable placement for dependent children, SSA is required to give a fair chance to a relative seeking placement. The correct application of the relative placement preference places the relative \u201cat the head of the line when the court is determining which placement is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>(In re Sarah S., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">C. <em>Section 361.3 requires the juvenile court\u2019s independent judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">When section 361.3 applies to a relative placement request, the juvenile court must exercise its independent judgment rather than merely review SSA\u2019s placement decision for an abuse of discretion. The statute itself directs both the \u201ccounty social worker and court\u201d to consider the propriety of relative placement. (\u00a7 361.3, subd. (a).) The cases, too, discuss the relative placement preference in the context of an independent determination by the juvenile court. \u201c[T]he statute expressed] a command that relatives be assessed and considered favorably, subject to the juvenile court\u2019s consideration of the suitability of the relative\u2019s home and the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>(In re Stephanie M. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 320 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706], italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">The confusion apparently arose from the juvenile court\u2019s misapprehension that its role was controlled by <em>Department of Social Services </em>v. <em>Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number><em>Court </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 721 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 239]. There, the court held the Legislature has given the social services agency the exclusive care, custody and control of minors referred for adoptive placement following the termination of parental rights. Thus, the juvenile court has no power to use its independent judgment to change the placement decision of the social services agency for a child that had been freed for adoption, but can review its decision only for an abuse of discretion. \u201cAbsent a showing that DSS\u2019s placement decision is patently absurd or unquestionably not in the minor\u2019s best interests, the juvenile court may not interfere and disapprove of the minor\u2019s placement, thereby requiring that the minor be relocated to another home.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 734; see also <em>Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 369].)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">These cases concerned children who had been referred for adoptive placement after the termination of parental rights and were based squarely on statute. (See \u00a7 366.26, subd. (j); Fam. Code, \u00a7 8704.) The case before us, however, involves the relative roles of SSA and the juvenile court <em>before </em>parental rights are terminated. Notwithstanding the termination of reunification services here, parental rights are still intact and the children have not yet been referred to SSA for adoptive placement. Under these circumstances, the juvenile court has the power and the duty to make an independent placement decision under section 361.3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">III. <em>Standing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">SSA contends neither Cesar nor Elvia has standing to appeal the relative placement preference issue. It argues Cesar is not legally aggrieved by the order denying placement because the only interest affected is Elvia\u2019s interest in preserving her relationship with the children. But it then claims Elvia cannot challenge that order because she is not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Elvia, although not a party, has standing to seek appellate review of the denial of her request for placement under section 361.3. \u201c[Wjhether one has standing in a particular case generally revolves around the question whether that person has rights that may suffer some injury, actual or threatened.\u201d <em>(Clifford S. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 747, 751 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 333].) Elvia\u2019s separate interest in her relationship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>Anthony, her grandson, is legally protected in section 361.3, which confers upon a grandparent the right to preferential consideration for placement. \u201c[A]ny person having an interest recognized by law in the subject matter of the judgment, which interest is injuriously affected by the judgment\u201d is considered a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d for purposes of appellate standing. <em>(In re Joel H. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1196 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 878].)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We agree with SSA that Cesar has no standing to appeal the relative placement preference issue. Especially in light of his stipulation to terminate reunification services, we cannot see how the denial of placement with Elvia affects his interest in reunification with the children. It does not preclude Cesar from presenting any evidence about the children\u2019s best interests or their relationship with him. (See <em>In re Vanessa Z. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 258, 261 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 313]; cf. <em>In re Daniel D., supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1833-1834 [although challenge was untimely, mother apparently had standing to raise denial of relative placement preference before termination of reunification services where such placement arguably would have affected the mother\u2019s chances at reunification].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cAn appellant cannot urge errors which affect only another party who does not appeal.\u201d <em>(In re Vanessa Z., supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th atp. 261; <em>In re Sarah M. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1486, 1503 [285 Cal.Rptr. 374].) But Elvia has properly placed the issue before us, and Cesar has formally joined in her arguments; furthermore, by stipulation of the parties and with the juvenile court\u2019s acquiescence, Cesar extensively litigated the issue below. Under these circumstances, Cesar will be permitted to support Elvia\u2019s position with arguments of his own. (See <em>In re Sarah S., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.4th at p. 282, fn. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">IV. <em>Denial of Cesar\u2019s section 388 petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Cesar and Elvia\u2019s final contention is that the juvenile court erroneously refused to grant a hearing on Cesar\u2019s petition under section 388 because there was no prima facie case of changed circumstances. They claim a showing of new evidence is enough to trigger the right to a hearing.  The statute requires either new evidence or changed circumstances, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>neither of these is sufficient to obtain a hearing without a prima facie showing that \u201cthe best interests of the child may be promoted by the proposed change of order. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 388.) Because we have determined that there must be a new hearing on the relative placement preference issue, however, the claim of error on the section 388 petition is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">V. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Let a writ of mandate issue directing the juvenile court to reverse its order finding no abuse of discretion by' SSA and denying placement with Elvia and enter a new order directing SSA to complete its assessment of Elvia as required by section 361.3.

Although we are troubled about the implications of such a protocol, if it exists, our determination that a new hearing is necessary eliminates its relevance to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b981-8\"> We note the cases cited in support of SSA\u2019s contention that Cesar lacks standing are factually inapt. <em>In re Gary P. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 875 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 929] and <em>In re Nachelle S. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1557 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 200] involved challenges to visitation orders made in conjunction with appeals from the termination of parental rights.

In <em>In re Devin M. </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1538 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 666], the mother challenged an order severing her child\u2019s relationship with his foster family. The child had been placed in long-term foster care, and although the mother\u2019s parental rights had not been terminated, the case had gone beyond the permanent planning stage. And <em>In re Carissa G. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 731 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 561] concerned the mother\u2019s standing to appeal the juvenile court\u2019s dismissal of a dependency petition for insufficient evidence of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b982-8\"> Anthony\u2019s counsel tells us that in mid-April, the children were removed from their \u201cfos-adopt\u201d home and returned to Orangewood.
