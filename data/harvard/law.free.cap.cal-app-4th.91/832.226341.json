J.</author>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">This appeal from the denial of an anti-SLAPP suit motion requires us to come to the following conclusions:</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">(1) Because the Legislature has specified that the anti-SLAPP suit law (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16) is to be construed broadly, the provision in the law that a special motion to strike \u201cmay be filed within 60 days of the service of the complaint\u201d (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (f)) includes amended as well as original complaints. (See <em>DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 562, 565 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 755] [considering anti-SLAPP motion to strike first amended complaint]; <em>Globetrotter Software, Inc. v. Elan Computer Group, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 1999) 63 F.Supp.2d 1127, 1129 [observing that since the Legislature did not say \u201coriginal complaint,\u201d statutory time period runs \u201cfrom the filing of the most recent amended complaint\u201d].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">(2) Because the time specified in the anti-SLAPP law (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (f)) allows filing motions to strike within 60 days of the service of amended complaints, and the amended complaint in this case was itself served by mail, the moving party had an extra five days to file his anti-SLAPP suit motion. (\u00a7 1013, subd. (a).) Accordingly, an anti-SLAPP suit motion to strike, filed 64 days after the service of the first amended complaint by mail, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>(3) Because the issues involved in consideration of a preliminary injunction are different from those involved in an anti-SLAPP suit motion to strike, the granting of a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiff does not have collateral estoppel or res judicata effect as against a subsequent antiSLAPP suit motion. (Compare <em>Pro-Family Advocates </em>v. <em>Gomez </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1674, 1680-1681 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 600] [consideration of preliminary injunction entails interrelated factors of likelihood of prevailing <em>and </em>the need to prevent interim harm] with \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(3) [standard for anti-SLAPP suit is whether plaintiff has \u201cestablished a probability\u201d of prevailing on claim].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">(4) Because the trial judge erroneously assumed both (a) that the antiSLAPP suit motion was untimely, and (b) that the prior granting of a preliminary injunction precluded consideration of the motion on the merits, the order denying the motion was predicated on two faulty premises. Therefore this court must proceed to the merits of the motion de novo. (See e.g., <em>Paul for Council v. Hanyecz </em>(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1364 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 864] [\u201cOn appeal, the issues are reviewed de novo.\u201d]; <em>Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 468, 474 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 205] [\u201cwe review the record de novo\u201d]; <em>Foothills Townhome Assn. v. Christiansen </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 688, 695 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 516] [reviewing record independently to determine whether trial court correctly denied anti-SLAPP suit motion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">(5) Because this case involves possible tort liability for the collateral effects of a political protest, three principles set forth in <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 886 [102 S.Ct. 3409, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215] are controlling. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">(a) Peaceful picketing of a business for political reasons cannot be burdened by state tort liability, even if it has the effect of interfering with prospective economic advantage. <em>(NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 918 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3428] [state may not \u201caward compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">(b) Violence and other criminal acts <em>are </em>bases of tort liability and not constitutionally protected, even when committed out of political motives and in the context of a political demonstration. <em>(NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 916 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3427] [\u201cNo federal rule of law restricts a State from imposing tort liability for business losses that are caused by violence and by threats of violence.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>(c) An organizer of a political protest cannot be held personally liable for acts committed by other protesters unless he or she authorized, directed or ratified specific tortious activity, incited lawless action, or gave specific instructions to carry out violent acts or threats. (See <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 927 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">(6) Applying these principles to the case at hand, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to implicate the sole named defendant, organizer Ky Ngo, in any of the violent acts that occurred in connection with the protest. We further conclude that the nonviolent aspects of the protest (in which Ngo was implicated) cannot, consistent with <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>support tort liability. Accordingly, the tort causes of action against Ngo must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">(7) The violent acts associated with the protest do support tort liability, so the case must be remanded to allow the plaintiff to substitute named individuals for any of the Doe defendants who can be shown to have engaged in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In 1999, a video store in Westminster placed the flag of the North Vietnamese communists and a poster of Ho Chi Minh in the window. Large numbers of Orange County\u2019s Vietnamese community were outraged and staged demonstrations at the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">They also demanded the support of local politicians, including Garden Grove City Council Member Tom Lam. Lam, however\u2014or at least as his court papers in this case would later claim\u2014had been instructed by the Garden Grove City Attorney not to publicly support the anti-video-store demonstrators. He kept mum.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">A group of the demonstrators then focused their attention on council member Lam, who, they would later claim, had shown a \u201cconspicuous lack of interest or concern for the Vietnamese community\u2019s outrage\u201d at the video store display. (We note the irony in passing: A man who had risked his life to escape from a communist regime was now condemned for being soft on communism.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Lam owned a restaurant, the Vien Dong, and beginning March 12, 1999, a group of protesters showed up at the restaurant to demand that Lam resign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>his city council post. The restaurant\u2019s landlord was sympathetic to the protester\u2019s position, and allowed them to gather in the parking lot. The Vien Dong\u2019s business suffered, and less than a week later, Lam and the restaurant (which is separately incorporated) filed this action against Ky Ngo, the landlord,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 1,500 Doe defendants. A temporary restraining order was issued on March 19, 1999, prohibiting the protesters from \u201capproaching within 20 feet of the entrance and windows\u201d of the restaurant, and from using bullhorns or other amplification equipment that could be heard within the restaurant. By April 2, a modified temporary restraining order established a 50-foot \u201cbuffer zone\u201d in all directions from the perimeter around the restaurant\u2019s parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Lam and the restaurant sought a preliminary injunction based on a series of declarations that established these facts: In the period prior to the issuance of the TRO\u2019s (temporary restraining orders), protesters (a) physically accosted prospective patrons and shouted epithets at them; (b) in some cases, slashed the tires and pounded on the cars of prospective patrons; (c) used bullhorns to disrupt the meals of those customers who did manage to make it into the restaurant; (d) plastered posters and banners on the side of the restaurant; and (e) even urinated on the side of the restaurant premises. In one instance, an 89-year-old man was surrounded by 30 to 40 protesters who kicked and pounded his car, causing about $250 in damages. When the elderly gentleman finally stepped out of the car, he faced further insults from the crowd. Security guards came to his rescue and escorted him safely away. And when one of the county board of supervisors and his wife tried to have lunch at the restaurant, they were called \u201cmotherfuckers\u201d by the crowd as they approached the premises. As they left, protesters stood in front of their car blocking the driveway. Lam also presented evidence that some of the protesters tried to videotape or otherwise record the license plates of some of the restaurant\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Continuing throughout the protests, demonstrators bore numerous signs casting Lam as a communist and a traitor. They carried drawings of Lam as a homed and fanged devil with blood dripping down his mouth. They crafted a life-sized effigy of Lam tied to a gallows next to a life-sized effigy of Ho Chi Minh; a bloody axe bearing a South Vietnamese flag, coffin-like box, and the slogan \u201cDown with the Communists\u201d adorned their creation. The protesters also created three-dimensional effigies of Lam and Ho Chi Minh in lewd sexual positions across the street from the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>Financially, the restaurant suffered a 40 percent decline in revenues through the end of April, compounded by the extra expense of needing to hire security guards to escort customers through the parking lot. The trial court granted the preliminary injunction May 28, 1999.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">On May 24, 1999, four days before the preliminary injunction was granted, Lam filed and served by mail a first amended complaint. His wife was added as a plaintiff, and he alleged these causes of action against Ngo and the protesters: intentional infliction of emotional distress, intentional interference with economic advantage, trespass, and nuisance. Ngo filed a motion to strike pursuant to section 425.16 (i.e., an anti-SLAPP suit motion) on July 28, 1999, 64 days after the service by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The trial court denied the motion in October, and the written order makes it very clear that the denial was based on the fact that Ngo had already lost the preliminary injunction battle and was presenting nothing \u201cnew.\u201d Indeed, it was on this basis that the court also found that Ngo\u2019s motion had been brought to harass the plaintiffs by putting them to extra expense and delay. Accordingly, the court ordered monetary sanctions against Ngo and his trial attorney in the amount of $8,000 as reimbursement for the fees Lam incurred in opposing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The order also concluded that the motion was untimely under subdivision (f) of section 425.16. That subdivision states: \u201cThe special motion may be filed within 60 days of the service of the complaint or, in the court\u2019s discretion, at any later time upon terms it deems proper. The motion shall be noticed for hearing not more than 30 days after service unless the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing.\u201d Ngo timely appealed from the order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">A. <em>Timeliness of Anti-SLAPP Suit Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">1. <em>Original Complaint Only? The Statute Includes Amended Complaints Also</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Clearly, the 60-day time period set forth in subdivision (f) of section 425.16 is not jurisdictional. The trial court has the legal authority to allow the filing of an anti-SLAPP suit motion to strike \u201cat any later time [after \u201c60 days of the service of the complaint\u201d] upon terms it deems proper.\u201d The nonjurisdictional nature of the time limit is also emphasized by the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in the setting forth of the time limit (\u201cThe special motion may be filed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">But while the time period is not jurisdictional, the provision specifying that the <em>court </em>may allow later filings of the motion still has consequences. There is no <em>right </em>to file an anti-SLAPP suit motion beyond the deadline. It can then only be \u201cfiled\u201d \u201cin the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">The parallel structure of the first operative sentence is also somewhat revealing, in that the verb \u201cmay be filed\u201d applies both to what the defendant does as well as what the <em>court </em>does. Strictly speaking, of course, merely allowing a later <em>filing </em>at the trial court\u2019s discretion is somewhat meaningless, because if the trial court were not disposed to hear the motion on the merits, it could (as was the case before us) simply deny the motion as untimely, even though the moving papers had a clerk\u2019s file stamp on them. The inference is that the trial court retains the discretion to consider the merits of a special motion to strike filed beyond the 60-day deadline, but also retains the discretion to refuse to hear any such motion on the merits. On the other hand, the statutory language certainly implies that the trial court <em>must </em>consider a special anti-SLAPP suit motion on the merits if it is filed within the 60-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">The first question we must answer, then, is whether the words \u201cthe complaint\u201d in section 425.16, subdivision (f) may include amended complaints, or necessarily are restricted to just the original. We conclude that the words include amended complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Primarily, the purpose of the anti-SLAPP suit law would be readily circumventable if a defendant\u2019s only opportunity to strike meritless SLAPP claims were in an attack on the original complaint. Causes of action subject to a special motion to strike could be held back from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>original complaint, particularly in situations where, as in the case before us, there are strong equities in favor of granting a preliminary injunction against an anonymous group of protesters, but the imposition of tort liability against a specific individual is problematical.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In context, the \u201cspecial\u201d anti-SLAPP suit motion is directed at a particular document, namely \u201cthe complaint.\u201d It would make no sense to read \u201ccomplaint\u201d to refer to an earlier complaint that contained no anti-free-speech claims, but not allow such a motion for a later complaint that had been amended to contain some. After all, the whole purpose of the statute is to provide a mechanism for the <em>early </em>termination of claims that are improperly aimed at the exercise of free speech or the right of petition. (See <em>Paul for Council </em>v. <em>Hanyecz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th at p. 1364 [\u201cthe anti-SLAPP legislation found in section 425.16 provides an efficient means of dispatching, early on in a lawsuit, a plaintiff\u2019s meritless claims\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Secondarily, of course, to the degree there is any ambiguity in the statute that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of a hearing on the merits. A federal district court construing California law first articulated this point in <em>Globetrotter Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>Elan Computer Group, Inc., supra, </em>63 F.Supp.2d at page 1129, pointing to the statutory directive in subdivision (a) of section 425.16 that the statute is to be \u201c \u2018construed broadly.\u2019 \u201d There is no reason to doubt the soundness of the <em>Globetrotter Software </em>court\u2019s conclusion, which in any event is self-evident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Finally, in <em>DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at page 565, our Supreme Court directed an appellate court to reconsider, in light of <em>Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope and Opportunity </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564], the summary denial of a petition for a writ of mandate seeking to compel the trial court to grant a special motion to strike. The summary denial had been based on the fact that the special motion was untimely because the 60 days began running from the original, as distinct from the amended, complaint. The appellate court took the direction and the reference to <em>Briggs, </em>a case dealing with when defamatory statements made in the course of authorized official proceedings are protected, as a signal from the Supreme Court to consider the petition on the merits. The inference from <em>DuPont </em>is that our Supreme Court saw nothing wrong in considering an anti-SLAPP suit motion directed against an amended complaint, even though more than 60 days had elapsed since the service of the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">2. <em>An Extra Five Days If the Relevant Complaint Is Mailed? Yes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Ngo\u2019s motion was filed 64 days after the amended complaint. This fact raises the additional question of whether the moving party on an anti-SLAPP suit motion gets an extra five days for mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The answer is yes, when, as here, the complaint at which the special motion to strike is directed has itself been mailed. Section 1013, subdivision (a) provides in part: \u201c[A]ny right or duty to do any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended five days, upon service by mail, if the place of address is within the State of California . . . .\u201d The plain terms of the statute would thus add five days for Ngo\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to file a special motion to strike to \u201crespond\u201d to the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Certain language in section 1005, subdivision (b) should not be read to the contrary. (The language is: \u201cSection 1013, which extends the time within which a right may be exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of motion, papers opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.\u201d) The key words are \u201cgoverned by this section.\u201d The context of the \u201csection\u201d is the series of minimum specifications for the time period between the filing of a motion and the time it is heard. (The first sentence starts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>the theme: \u201cUnless otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 21 calendar days before the hearing.\u201d) The focus of section 1005 is minimum notice of one\u2019s papers before any hearing. The reference to section 1013 in section 1005 is to prevent section 1013 from reducing the period of minimum notice. It has no application in a context where the deadline to bring a motion is the service by mail of a complaint or amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">B. <em>Does a Preliminary Injunction Have an Issue Preclusive Ejfect on an Anti-SLAPP Motion? No</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The trial court did not consider the merits of Ngo\u2019s motion because it viewed the motion as nothing more than a rerun of the preliminary injunction question. But the standards bearing on the two kinds of proceedings are different, so the special motion to strike should have been evaluated on its own merits. Collateral estoppel requires, among other things, that the <em>issue </em>be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In deciding whether to grant preliminary injunction, the trial court not only assesses \u201cthe likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail at trial,\u201d but \u201cthe interim harm that the plaintiff will likely sustain if the injunction were denied.\u201d <em>(Pro-Family Advocates </em>v. <em>Gomez, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1680-1681.) Trial courts must balance the respective equities, and in any event the decision is tested under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">By contrast, in passing on anti-SLAPP suit motions, the trial court faces a much more binary task, more akin to a summary judgment motion: Has the plaintiff made a prima facie showing of facts which, if proved at trial, support a favorable judgment? <em>(Wilcox v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 809, 823 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 446].)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The present case illustrates how the plaintiff\u2019s ability to obtain a preliminary injunction cannot be equated with a \u201cprobability\u201d the plaintiff will prevail on the claim (the statutory standard for anti-SLAPP suit motions; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)). Here, strong equities certainly favored the grant of a preliminary injunction requiring the protesters to be at least some distance from the Vien Dong restaurant. Those equities included at least the dramatic drop in the restaurant\u2019s business and the willingness of the protesters to copy down the license plates of the restaurant\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">But by the same token it cannot be assumed that any of the tort causes of action directed against Ngo personally would withstand substantive scrutiny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>under section 425.16. (A topic we explore in detail in the next section of this opinion.) An individual organizer of a political protest is not necessarily liable for acts of \u201c \u2018animal exuberance\u2019 \u201d perpetrated by the protesters. <em>(NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 924 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 3431-3422], quoting <em>Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Co. </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 287, 293 [61 S.Ct. 552, 555, 85 L.Ed. 836, 132 A.L.R. 1200].) In <em>Claiborne Hardware, </em>for example, the United States Supreme Court held that Charles Evers and the NAACP could not be held liable in tort for business losses incurred during a boycott of White merchants in Claiborne County, Mississippi, even though some of those losses could undoubtedly be attributed to a number of acts of violence directed at Black individuals who did not participate in the boycott.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The federal high court held that there was simply insufficient evidence of their <em>authorization </em>of the wrongful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Additionally, a key difference between preliminary injunctions and special motions to strike is the role of the individual cause of action. A single cause of action can sustain a preliminary injunction. (See <em>California Medical Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 542, 552 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 194].) By contrast, an anti-SLAPP suit motion involves examination of each of the causes of action attacked, because the purpose is to weed out meritless \u201cclaims\u201d at an early stage. (See <em>Wilcox v. Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 823.) In the context of this case, for example, the single cause of action against the protesters as a group for nuisance might indeed be meritorious. But the meritoriousness of that cause of action couldn\u2019t make valid a cause of action brought by a public figure for intentional infliction of emotional distress claim based on, say, being called a \u201ccommunist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In sum, the fact that a preliminary injunction was granted did not prevent consideration of the merits of the anti-SLAPP suit motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>C. <em>The Merits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">1. <em>No Connection of Ky Ngo to Any of the Wrongful or Violent Activity Done by Some of the Protesters</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">As mentioned above, denials of anti-SLAPP suit motions are reviewed de novo by appellate courts. <em>(Paul for Council v. Hanyecz, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1364; <em>Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 468, 474 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 205]; <em>Foothills Townhome Assn. v. Christiansen, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at p. 695.) In reviewing the record de novo, the fact that Lam opposed Ngo\u2019s motion based solely on the evidence supporting the preliminary injunction, and did not go out and try to link Ngo to any specific violent act, now takes special importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The basic two-prong framework for analyzing an anti-SLAPP suit motion is well established. First prong: Has the defendant shown that the causes of action he or she is attacking arise from acts in furtherance of the right of free speech or petition? (See <em>DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 567, citing \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) Here, there is no doubt that the protests directed at a public figure (Lam) based on his stand concerning an issue of public significance in his constituency (whether a local video store should be displaying the flag of the North Vietnamese communists) satisfies the first prong, and Lam makes no argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The second prong focuses on the \u201cprobability\u201d that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim <em>(DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 567), which case law has refined into an inquiry as to whether the <em>plaintiff has </em>made a \u201cprima facie showing of facts\u201d that, if proved at trial, would support a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>(Wilcox v. Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 823.) Thus an important substantive aspect of the law is that, once it has been shown a cause of action is based on the defendant\u2019s exercise of free speech or petition, it is the plaintiff who has the burden of making a prima facie case of prevailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">In regard to Ky Ngo personally, however, we cannot say that the burden has at all been met.  <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. </em>is quite clear that there must be some evidence of authorization, direction, or ratification of \u201cspecific\u201d constitutionally unprotected tortious activity by the organizer of a protest before the organizer can be held responsible for the consequences of the activity. <em>(NAACP </em>v. <em>Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 927 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Lam may have had a good case against the protesters generally for a preliminary injunction based on nuisance, but the evidence against Ngo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>personally is very thin indeed. A Garden Grove Police Department lieutenant declared that on the first day of the protest, March 12, 1999, \u201cA gentleman approached me and identified himself as Ky Ngo and said he was an organizer of the protest, which again, is directed at Mr. Lam. Mr. Ngo assured me that he wanted a peaceful demonstration and that the protesters would limit their activities to the public sidewalk in front\u201d of the restaurant. Lam produced several declarations to the effect that on April 4, Ngo had \u201cinstructed\u201d the protesters not to take a copy of the TRO when one of Lam\u2019s daughters attempted to serve them with it. (Ngo controverted this allegation with his own set of declarations denying he had ever said any such thing, and in fact claimed to have posted the TRO himself on a fence for his fellow protesters to see.) Those declarations also asserted that just before Ngo made the \u201cdon\u2019t take it\u201d statement, Ngo went 20 feet inside the then 50-foot buffer zone and screamed at one of Lam\u2019s process servers \u201cyou cannot stop them, they are just citizen [szc] with flags.\u201d On April 5, Ngo apparently also violated the buffer zone, was confronted by Lam\u2019s daughter, walked back, made some rude gestures toward Ms. Lam, took some pictures of her, and then \u201cscreamed in Vietnamese the equivalent of, T will send these pictures to Playboy magazine.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">And that, unless we have missed some reference to Ngo in this record or otherwise blinked, is pretty much it so far as the evidence of Ngo\u2019s personal involvement in the protests. None of the declarations delineating the clearly wrongful acts involved in the early days of the protests\u2014such as the slashed tires, the posting of banners on the restaurant, the urination on it, or even the direct intimidation of any of the customers in the parking lot\u2014show that such acts were authorized, directed or ratified by Ngo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">There was, in fact, far more in <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>to link Charles Evers, the field secretary of the state NAACP, to the sporadic acts of violence in that case. Evers organized the boycott, made \u201cemotional and persuasive appeals for unity in the joint effort,\u201d and even made \u201c \u2018threats\u2019 of vilification and social ostracism.\u201d <em>(NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 926 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 3432-3433].) Even so, Evers\u2019s conduct was \u201cconstitutionally protected and beyond the reach of a damages award.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In the case before us, as in <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>tort liability cannot be predicated merely on Ngo\u2019s role as an \u201corganizer\u201d of protests in which some protesters committed wrongful acts. Ngo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>didn\u2019t even make a \u201cpersuasive speech.\u201d The record lacks any \u201cthreat\u201d of vilification or social ostracism.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The worst that can be said about his actual conduct is that he violated the extended 50-foot buffer zone a few times, \u201cinstructed\u201d his fellow protesters not to take copies of the TRO, and taunted Lam\u2019s daughter. While Ngo\u2019s violation of the restraining order on those occasions may indeed have subjected him to contempt of court (perhaps the same may be said of his \u201cinstruction\u201d not to take the TRO), any effect on Lam or the Vien Dong restaurant from those nonviolent incursions was de minimis in terms of the tort causes of action alleged against him in the first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">2. <em>No Tort Liability Against Ky Ngo or Any Other Protester for the Peaceful Speech Connected to the Protest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">a. <em>Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The next question is whether the fact of the protests, or the statements made in connection with them, can support tort liability\u2014in particular based on causes of action for interference with prospective economic advantage or intentional infliction of emotional distress. In this regard it must be remembered that there is no dispute that Tony Lam, as a local politician, is a public figure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">We must begin by distinguishing labor law disputes from public protests which are political in nature. There is a well-established line of federal Supreme Court cases centered on <em>Carpenter\u2019s Union </em>v. <em>Ritter\u2019s Cafe </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 722 [62 S.Ct. 807, 86 L.Ed. 1143], which establish that at least the picketing of noncombatants in a labor dispute can be prohibited by state law. In <em>Ritter\u2019s Cafe, </em>union members picketed a cafe that was owned by a man who was employing nonunion labor on a construction site a mile and a half away. The United States Supreme Court held that state law could constitutionally ban picketing at the cafe, because the picketing there amounted to the \u201cconscription of neutrals\u201d in a dispute that otherwise did not affect them. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 728 [62 S.Ct. at p. 810].) Then again, substantive California law would appear to be more solicitous of free speech when the \u201cneutral\u201d being picketed in a labor dispute is the business of a public official. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number><em>Pittsburg Unified School Dist. v. California School Employees Assn. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 875, 893-894 [213 Cal.Rptr. 34] [teachers union members had constitutional right to pass out leaflets on the public sidewalk in front of the businesses of school board members].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The labor cases are, in any event, of only limited use in the case before us. <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. </em>specifically confronted the labor union cases, but said they were explained by the \u201cbroad power\u201d of the states \u201cto regulate economic activity,\u201d a right which was <em>not </em>comparable to the \u201cright to prohibit peaceful political activity\u201d such as the boycott in that case against the White merchants. <em>(NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at pp. 912-913 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 3425-3426].) Our conclusion in this regard is reinforced by our own high court\u2019s decision in <em>Environmental Planning &amp; Information Council </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 188 [203 Cal.Rptr. 127, 680 P.2d 1086], which involved an organized effort by an environmental group who published a newsletter to boycott the advertisers of a newspaper that was perceived by the group as too pro-developer. The <em>Environmental Planning &amp; Information Council </em>court specifically referenced the <em>Claiborne Hardware </em>distinction between \u201csolely economic boycott activity\u201d and \u201cpeaceful political activity,\u201d and concluded that the trial court should have granted a summary judgment on a complaint predicated on a cause of action for intentional inference with prospective economic advantage. (See <em>Environmental Planning &amp; Information Council, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 193, 196, 198.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">For our purposes there is no basis on which to distinguish the White merchants who were boycotted by Black customers in <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Claiborne Hardware Co. </em>and the Vien Dong restaurant here. Indeed, the connection between the political purpose of the picketing here and the target is, if anything, closer than in <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>where the only reason for boycotting was the color of the owner\u2019s skin. Here, at least, the restaurant is owned by a political figure. If liability for interference with prospective economic advantage could not constitutionally be imposed in <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. </em>(or <em>Environmental Planning &amp; Information Council </em>for that matter) it cannot constitutionally be imposed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">b. <em>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Almost all the cases involving public figures suing for intentional infliction of emotional distress involve publications, and are thus typically governed by the principles set forth in <em>Hustler Magazine v. Falwell </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 46 [108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41]. The rule is: A public figure \u201cmay not recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>. . . without showing . . . that the publication contains a false statement of fact . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 56 [108 S.Ct. at p. 882].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">While the <em>Hustler </em>case involved a magazine parody, there can be no doubt that its basic framework must apply to picket signs and effigies as well. In the context of peaceful picketing in a place where the picketer has a right to be, there is no meaningful difference in terms of the medium between words on a picket sign and, as in <em>Falwell, </em>a fake ad in a magazine. The same may be said for effigies, which are surely at least as protected a form of political communication as flag burning. (See <em>United States v. Eichman </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 310 [110 S.Ct. 2404, 110 L.Ed.2d 287]; <em>Texas v. Johnson </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 397 [109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The federal high court\u2019s subsequent opinion in <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 1 [110 S.Ct. 2695, 111 L.Ed.2d 1], has refined the <em>Falwell </em>court\u2019s requirement of \u201cfalse statement of fact,\u201d at least in the defamation context. While there is not \u201can additional separate constitutional privilege for \u2018opinion\u2019 \u201d <em>(Milkovich, supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 21 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2707]), statements \u201cthat cannot \u2018reasonably [be] interpreted as stating actual facts\u2019 about an individual\u201d are still constitutionally protected. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 20 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2706].) Thus the <em>Milkovich </em>court made clear that \u201c \u2018rhetorical hyperbole\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>or \u201cloose, figurative, or hyperbolic language\u201d which would \u201cnegate the impression that the writer was seriously maintaining\u201d a proposition that was \u201csufficiently factual to be susceptible of being proved true or false\u201d is protected. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 21 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2707].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The content of the signs and effigies in this case was that Lam was a communist sympathizer, and\u2014as rather grossly expressed in the effigies\u2014 the ideological lackey of Ho Chi Minh. That these sentiments would appear to be grossly unfair to Lam\u2014himself an immigrant who risked his life to escape from a Communist country\u2014is beside the point. The dispositive question is whether they constituted protected rhetorical hyperbole or loose language.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">On that point the answer must be yes. In context, the protesters were making a political point as to what they thought of Lam\u2019s stand on the video store controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Charges of communism are part of the heat of the political kitchen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254, 273, fn. 14 [84 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>710, 722, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 95 A.L.R.2d 1412] [observing that political figures often must face charges of \u201ccommunist sympathies\u201d]; <em>Milkovitch v. Lorain Journal Co., supra, </em>497 U.S. at p. 20 [110 S.Ct. at p. 2706] [hypothetically observing that the statement, \u201c \u2018In my opinion Mayor Jones shows his abysmal ignorance by accepting the teachings of Marx and Lenin\u2019 \u201d would not be actionable]; <em>Nat. Ass\u2019n, etc. v. Central Broadcasting </em>(1979) 379 Mass. 220 [396 N.E.2d 996, 1002] [charge of communism against union on talk show was \u201cmost likely taken by the audience as mere pejorative rhetoric\u201d]; see also <em>Rosenaur v. Scherer </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 260, 280 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 674] [use of words \u201cthief\u2019 and \u201cliar\u201d in heated oral exchange at shopping center in the midst of \u201chard-fought initiative contest\u201d held protected as loose, figurative or hyperbolic language]; <em>Beilenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 944, 951 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 357] [political mailer charging state official with having \u201cripped off\u2019 taxpayers because he had an outside job was, in context, protected as \u201crhetorical hyperbole that is common in political debate\u201d].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As Justice Kline wrote in the <em>Pittsburg Unified School Dist. </em>case, \u201cPublic office is no place for the thin-skinned.\u201d <em>(Pittsburg Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>California School Employees Assn., supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 899.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The protesters were not accusing Lam, like Chambers vis-a-vis Hiss, of being an actual member of a secret Communist cell. (See <em>Nat. Ass\u2019n, etc. v. Central Broadcasting, supra, </em>396 N.E.2d at p. 1002 [there is a difference between charging a person with \u201c \u2018communism\u2019 \u201d and \u201ccharging him specifically with being \u2018a member of the Communist Party\u2019 \u201d].) In context, their statements were not susceptible to verification using a falsifiability test.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">It is true, as Lam\u2019s brief reminds us, that the word \u201cCommunist\u201d has some real sting in the Vietnamese community in Orange County, California. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>community, after all, consists of many people who have actually lived under a Communist regime. Then again, such folks are in a better position to appreciate First Amendment freedoms than some of us who have not lived in a totalitarian country.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">3. <em>The Conduct of the Doe Defendants Who Participated in the Violence Is</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">\n<em>Not Protected</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">As in <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., </em>the present case involves discrete \u201celements of criminality,\u201d and certainly tortious conduct unprotected by the First Amendment. (See <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, </em>458 U.S. at p. 888 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3413].) Justice Stevens there noted, the \u201cFirst Amendment does not protect violence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 916 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3427]) and the present case\u2014particularly events, in the first week of the protests\u2014certainly involved acts of violence, not political theater. Some protesters, presently anonymous, accosted patrons of the Vien Dong, slashed the tires of cars, plastered posters on the outside of the restaurant, and urinated on it. All clearly unprotected acts. Our conclusion that the record contains no support for a prima facie case that Ky Ngo, as an individual, authorized, directed or ratified these acts does not mean that <em>someone </em>isn\u2019t liable for them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On remand, Lam should have the opportunity to substitute for existing Does any individuals who participated in the violent acts involved in this case, or any as yet unnamed organizer who can be shown to have authorized, directed or ratified those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We reverse the order denying the anti-SLAPP suit motion as it applies to Ky Ngo.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, Tony Lam and the other plaintiffs have shown that other, anonymous, protesters did engage in violent acts for which there is no First Amendment protection. We therefore affirm the order to the extent it contemplates causes of actions against any Doe defendants based on violent acts. On remand Lam and the other plaintiffs should be given ample opportunity to substitute for current Doe defendants any specific individuals who were actually involved in the wrongful acts which we have identified in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">In the interests of justice, both sides will bear their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Rylaarsdam, 1, and O\u2019Leary, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-13\"> SLAPP stands for \u201cStrategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation,\u201d and basically refers to suits directed at some exercise of a person\u2019s right of free speech or petition. All statutory references in this opinion are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"> The landlord is not a party to this appeal, which involves only Ky Ngo\u2019s anti-SLAPP suit motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\"> The injunction required the protesters to stay 900 feet away from the restaurant. Much of Ngo\u2019s opening brief is devoted to attacking the 900-foot distance, and intuitively it would appear that his position on the point might have some merit. (See <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 290, 302 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 736] [250-foot buffer zone around apartment where physician who performed abortions at a local clinic was too restrictive].) However, Ngo never perfected an appeal from the preliminary injunction, so we do not address the merits of the preliminary injunction, except to point out that a different set of legal standards applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\"> So solicitous is California law of free speech that orders on SLAPP-suit motions under section 425.16 are immediately appealable. (See \u00a7 425.16, subd. (j).) Compare that with <em>denials </em>of summary judgment motions, where a litigant may only file a writ petition if he or she wants an immediate review of a possibly erroneous trial court ruling denying the motion. (See \u00a7 437c, subd. (/).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\"> There are no less than three ironies in the fact that Ngo was sanctioned because, as the trial court\u2019s order recited, he \u201ccited and relied upon an unpublished federal district court opinion in violation of California Rule of Court 977 and decisional authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The first irony is that by October 1999, rule 977 of the California Rules of Court had been amended to <em>allow </em>citation or reliance on unpublished opinions, as long as they weren\u2019t California state court opinions. So the basis of the court\u2019s order sanctioning Ngo was based on out-of-date law.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">The second irony is that the <em>Globetrotter Software </em>opinion eventually made its way into the Federal Supplement Second, so it wasn\u2019t \u201cunpublished\u201d after all, though it had existed only in cyberspace at the time of the hearing on the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The third irony is that the \u201cdecisional authority\u201d that Ngo supposedly violated began with footnote 34 in the opinion of this court in <em>ACL Technologies, Inc. v. Northbrook Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1773, 1783 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 206]. There we observed that a California court need not consider federal and out-of-state opinions that had not been published. The change in rule 977 in 1997 was clearly aimed at that footnote. The irony here is that footnote 34 was written to <em>relieve </em>courts and counsel from having to worry about the continuously growing legions of unpublished cases, <em>not </em>to add another trap for the unwary practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">We must also reiterate this truth: Unpublished decisions from the federal and out-of-state courts were by definition never <em>intended </em>for use as precedent. As Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judges Kozinski and Reinhardt have pointed out, unpublished decisions usually do not get the kind of attention that published decisions get. (See Kozinski &amp; Reinhardt, <em>Please </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number><em>Don\u2019t Cite This! Why We Don\u2019t Allow Citation to Unpublished Dispositions </em>(June 2000) Cal. Law. 43-44 [contrasting care that must go into opinions intended for use as precedent with work on unpublished \u201cmemdispos\u201d].) Thus, even though a litigant can certainly cite and rely on such decisions in state court under the amended rule, California courts are well within their own power to view such \u201cprecedent\u201d as having little or no weight in and of itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> The incidents of violence were not unlike those involved in the present case, except obviously more extensive, as they covered a seven-year time period beginning in the 1960\u2019s. The <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. </em>court noted these specific incidents: Shots were fired at a house in two cases. Someone threw a brick through a windshield. Tires were slashed. Someone damaged a flower garden. One NAACP member took away a man\u2019s whisky bottle bought from a White merchant. Four men grabbed and beat up a fisherman who failed to observe the boycott. (458 U.S. at pp. 904-906 [102 S.Ct. at pp. 3420-3422].) And there was an incident in which a \u201cgroup of young blacks apparently pulled down the overalls of an elderly brick mason known as \u2018Preacher White\u2019 and spanked him for not observing the boycott.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 905 [102 S.Ct. at p. 3421].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> In the respondent\u2019s brief Lam is forced to implicate Ngo personally either by the use of generalities (\u201cThe Lams submitted evidence that Ngo engaged in illegal conduct [the allusion to the violation of the TRO], in Ms. Lam\u2019s presence.

However, the \u201cspeech\u201d part of this case, i.e., the picketing <em>qua </em>picketing and the effigies, were all directed at Lam, not his restaurant. While, in the early days of the protest, a number of anonymous protesters yelled \u201chow does it feel to eat shit,\u201d or words to that effect, at customers emerging from the restaurant, this is not a case for trade libel. Our opinion, however, should not be read to preclude claims based by the restaurant on such remarks against the protesters, presently unknown according to this record, who uttered them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\"> So are charges of fascism. (See <em>Buckley v. Littell </em>(2d Cir. 1976) 539 F.2d 882, 890-895 [charge that political commentator William F.

A statement in a book that the plaintiff was a fellow traveler of fascism was not actionable because those terms were loaded with \u201ctremendous imprecision.\u201d (See <em>id. </em>at p. 893.) But the same book also said that \u201cBuckley could be taken to court by any one of several people who had enough money to hire competent legal counsel\u201d indicating that he had \u201cimplicitly libeled several people.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 895.) That, said the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, was \u201can assertion of fact\u201d as distinct from \u201cloosely definable, variously interpretable statements of opinion\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>and could even justify a punitive damage award, albeit a small one under the facts of that case. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 897.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\"> Because this case comes to us in an appeal from an anti-SLAPP suit motion, we confine our determination regarding the viability of Lam\u2019s causes of action against the Does to the question of whether the Does enjoyed First Amendment protection for their acts. (Answer, with regard to the violent acts: no.) We do not address the substantive merits of each cause of action apart from the question of First Amendment protection. An anti-SLAPP suit motion is not a substitute for a demurrer or summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\"> The good news for Lam and the other plaintiffs is that Ky Ngo\u2019s opening brief did not address the sanction order in the slightest, and he has filed no reply brief, so any argument that the sanction order was in error has been waived. The sanction order is therefore not affected by our decision today. While such a result is anomalous, it would be unfair to Lam under these circumstances to conclude anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The bad news for the plaintiffs is that their motion to have Ky Ngo and his counsel sanctioned for a frivolous appeal obviously, in light of our disposition, has no merit and is hereby denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
