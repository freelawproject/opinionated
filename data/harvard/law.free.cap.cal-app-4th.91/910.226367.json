Fenenbock </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1688 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 608], defendants contend the trial court violated their right to notice and due process by instructing the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, they could convict him of the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit assault with a firearm. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>In the published portion of the opinion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we hold the trial court may look to the overt acts pleaded in a charge of conspiracy to determine whether the charged offense includes the lesser included offense. Under the accusatory pleading test for determining lesser included offenses, we find that conspiracy to commit assault by means of a firearm is a lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit murder as that offense was pleaded in the accusatory pleading. The overt acts alleged in the information gave notice to defendants of the lesser included offense, and the defendants do not claim the facts shown at the preliminary hearing failed to give them notice of the lesser offense or that they were surprised by the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">With the exception of sentencing error relating to the prior prison term enhancements imposed upon defendants Cook and Gains, which we vacate, we find no error and affirm the judgments and the sentences otherwise imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Factual Background<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">In a four-count information, defendants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were charged in count 1 with conspiracy to commit murder with eight overt acts alleged<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in count 2 with murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)), in count 3 with attempted murder committed with deliberation and premeditation (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187, subd. (a)), and in count 4 with burglary of an inhabited dwelling. (\u00a7 459.) As to each count it was alleged against defendants Cook and Gains that they were armed (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)), and against defendant Lozo that he used a firearm. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a), 1203.06, subd. (a)(1).) Additionally, it was alleged against Lozo in count 3 that he personally inflicted great bodily injury on the victim. (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.7, 1203.075.) It was also alleged that the offenses charged in counts 2, 3, and 4 were serious felonies. (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(1), (18).) Defendants Cook and Gains were also charged with having served a prior prison term. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">A jury found defendants not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder as charged, but guilty of the lesser offense of conspiracy to commit assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>a firearm, and guilty of first degree murder, attempted murder with premeditation and deliberation, and burglary. The jury also found true the armed allegations against Cook and Gains, and the use of a firearm and great bodily injury allegations against Lozo.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Defendants Cook, Gains, and Lozo were sentenced on count 2 to 25 years to life and on count 3 to a consecutive life term. Defendants Cook and Gains were sentenced to an additional two years for the armed enhancements, and one year for the prior prison term enhancement, with the sentences on counts 1 and <em>4 </em>stayed. (\u00a7 654.) Defendant Lozo was sentenced to an additional 23 years for the enhancements, with the sentences on counts 1 and 4 stayed. (\u00a7 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">I.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">\n<em>Conspiracy to Commit Assault with a Deadly Weapon as a Lesser Included Offense of Conspiracy to Commit Murder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Fenenbock, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 1688, (hereafter <em>Fenenbock), </em>defendant Gains, joined by defendants Cook and Lozo, contends the trial court violated his right to notice and due process by instructing the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, they could convict him of the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit an assault with a firearm. This error, he claims, requires that his conviction for conspiracy to commit assault with a firearm be reversed. The People concede instructional error and request that defendants\u2019 convictions for conspiracy to commit assault with a firearm be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">We disagree with both parties and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">The facts relevant to the defendants\u2019 claim are as follows. In an incident in a Raley\u2019s parking lot between Jimmie Fonseca, the murder victim, Carl Kato, the surviving victim, and defendant Cook, Fonseca struck defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Cook on the head several times with a gun, knocking him down. A day or so later, defendants Cook, Gains, and Lozo all appeared angry about the pistol-whipping incident and spoke about getting revenge on Kato.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">On the day of the shootings, Cook told Jose Gomez, an acquaintance of his, that he was looking for a gun, so Gomez introduced Cook and Lozo to one of his friends who sold the twosome a .38 special revolver for about $200. Later, Gomez and defendants purchased knit caps to use when they went to Kato\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Defendants returned to Cook\u2019s apartment, where Cook showed Kami Jonutz, his brother\u2019s girlfriend, the .38 special revolver. Defendants spoke about using it that night to get revenge on Kato. Brian Cook, defendant Cook\u2019s brother, cut eyeholes in the recently purchased caps and gave them to defendants. The three defendants left the apartment and around 9:45 p.m. they, along with codefendant Bolds, met Gomez in an alley near the victims\u2019 apartment. They were all wearing baggy clothing and had the ski caps pulled down over their faces. Gomez and defendant Lozo were both armed. Lozo had the .38 special revolver he had purchased earlier that day. When the group approached the victims\u2019 apartment, Gomez thought he saw someone with a gun peering out through the window, whereupon Gomez and Bolds fled down the alleyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Undeterred, defendants Cook, Gains, and Lozo forced open the apartment door. Lozo went into Fonseca\u2019s bedroom, found him sitting in a chair beside the window, and shot at him, stating, \u201c[d]ie mother fucka, die.\u201d When Fonseca fell to the floor, Lozo shot him again. Next, defendants went to Kato\u2019s bedroom where Kato was sleeping. They kicked open the locked door and shot twice, hitting him in the chest. Fonseca died from his injuries; Kato survived after being placed in intensive care.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit murder, and the trial court instructed the jury using a modified version of CALJIC Nos. 6.10 and 8.69. The jury was instructed in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-9\">\u201cThe information charged conspiracy to commit murder. If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt ultimately in this case, after hearing the arguments, et cetera, if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, you may nevertheless convict him of a lesser crime, if you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the lesser crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>\u201cThe crime of conspiracy to commit an assault with a firearm is lesser to that of conspiracy to commit murder, and I will give further instructions on the process whereby you would consider a lesser charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">\u201cNow that I have explained the alternatives you will have in connection with Count 1, let me go back and define the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-6\">\u201cAs I just stated, conspiracy is an agreement entered into by two or more persons with the specific intent to agree to commit the crime of murder, or the crime of assault with a firearm, and with the further specific intent to commit the crime charged, murder, or the lesser crime, assault with a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">\u201cThe agreement must be followed by an overt act committed by one or more of the parties for the purpose of accomplishing the object of the agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">It is well established that even in the absence of a request, the trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct on lesser included offenses when there is substantial evidence the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense. <em>(People v. Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 118 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073].) This requirement is based upon the rule that \u201cthe court must instruct sua sponte on \u2018the \u201cgeneral principles of law governing the case;\u201d \u2019 i.e., those \u2018 \u201cclosely and openly connected with the facts of the case before the court.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birks, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 118, quoting <em>People v. Hood </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 444, 449 [82 Cal.Rptr. 618, 462 P.2d 370]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 749, 759 [59 Cal.Rptr. 156, 427 P.2d 820]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Putnam </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 885, 890-891 [129 P.2d 367].) More recent cases have found the requirement is based upon the defendant\u2019s \u201c \u2018constitutional right to have the jury determine every material issue presented by the evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birks, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 119, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 720 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">This instructional rule benefits both the prosecution and the defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 194-195 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531].) It \u201censures that the jury will be exposed to the full range of verdict options which, by operation of law and with full notice to both parties, are presented <em>in the accusatory pleading itself </em>and are thus closely and openly connected to the case. In this context, the rule prevents either party . . . from forcing an all-or-nothing choice between conviction of the stated offense on the one hand, or complete acquittal on the other. Hence, the rule encourages a verdict, within the charge chosen by the prosecution, that is neither \u2018harsher [n]or more lenient than the evidence merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Birks, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 119, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>To determine whether a lesser offense is necessarily included in a greater charged offense, one of two tests must be met. <em>(People v. Lopez </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 282, 288 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 195, 965 P.2d 713].) The \u201celements\u201d test is satisfied if the statutory elements of the greater offense include all the elements of the lesser offense so that the greater offense cannot be committed without committing the lesser offense. <em>(People v. Birks, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 117.) The \u201caccusatory pleading\u201d test is satisfied if \u201cthe facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading, include all the elements of the lesser offense, such that the greater [offense] cannot be committed without also committing the lesser [offense].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In the case before us, the trial court instructed the jury that conspiracy to commit assault with a firearm was a lesser included offense of the charged offense of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">A conspiracy is an agreement by two or more persons to commit any crime. (\u00a7 182; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morante </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 403, 416 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 975 P.2d 1071].) A conviction for conspiracy requires proof of four elements: (1) an agreement between two or more people, (2) who have the specific intent to commit a public offense, (3) the specific intent to commit that offense, and (4) an overt act committed by one or more of the parties to the agreement for the purpose of carrying out the object of the conspiracy. (\u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (b), 184; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morante, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 416; <em>People v. Herrera </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1456, 1464 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 307]; <em>People v. Lui </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1128 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 578]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sconce </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 693, 700 [279 Cal.Rptr. 59]; <em>Feagles </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 735, 739 [90 Cal.Rptr. 197]; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Elements, \u00a7 90, p. 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Under section 182, the jury must determine which felony the defendants conspired to commit, and it cannot make that determination unless it is instructed on the elements of the target offense charged as well as the elements of any lesser included target offense which the jury could reasonably find to be the object of the conspiracy. <em>(People v. Horn </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 290, 297 [115 Cal.Rptr. 516, 524 P.2d 1300].) Thus, the trial court has a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on a lesser included target offense if there is substantial evidence from which the jury could find a conspiracy to commit the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">In the present case, defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and the trial court had a sua sponte duty to instruct on the lesser included offenses of the target offense of murder. However, as the parties both correctly point out, since violence is not an element of murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>under the statutory definition of murder and the statutory test for lesser included offenses, assault with a firearm is not a lesser included offense of murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dixie </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 852, 856 [159 Cal.Rptr. 717]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Benjamin </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 63, 71 [124 Cal.Rptr. 799].)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We reach a different result applying the \u201caccusatory pleading\u201d test. Count 1 of the information charged defendants with conspiracy to commit murder, alleging seven overt acts. Based upon these allegations, the information charged defendants with conspiracy to commit murder by means of a firearm which they used to shoot and kill Jimmie Fonseca and to shoot and wound Carl Kato. (Overt Act Nos. 1 and 7.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The overt acts alleged in the information gave notice that defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit murder by means of a firearm and that they shot and killed one victim and shot and wounded the other victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>The elements of assault with a firearm, under section 245, subdivision (a)(2) include (1) an assault, which requires the intent to commit a battery, and (2) the foreseeable consequence of which is the infliction of great bodily injury upon the subject of the assault. (See <em>People v. Smith </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1484 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 604].) Murder is the killing of a human being with the intent unlawfully to kill. (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 188; <em>People v. Bobo </em>(1990) 229 Cal.App.3d.1417, 1433 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 747].) Consequently, when murder is alleged to have been committed by means of a firearm, it cannot be so committed without also committing an assault with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">We therefore find the facts alleged in count 1 of the information, based upon Overt Acts Nos. 1 and 7, and the facts alleged in Overt Act No. 2, necessarily include and gave notice of, the elements of assault with a firearm, and the trial court properly instructed the jury in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">However, relying on <em>Fenenbock, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 1688, defendants argue that the overt acts alleged in the accusatory pleading may not be considered in determining the lesser included target offense to a charge of conspiracy to commit murder. In <em>Fenenbock, </em>three defendants were convicted of murder and conspiracy to murder. With respect to the conspiracy charge, the jury was instructed on conspiracy to commit first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred by refusing to give instructions on conspiracy to commit offenses other than murder, such as assault, battery, or mayhem. (Fenenbock, <em>supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1707.) While conceding that these lesser offenses did not qualify as offenses included within the statutory definition of murder, they argue that these offenses qualified as lesser included target offenses by virtue of the facts alleged in the accusatory pleading describing the overt acts. The court in <em>Fenenbock </em>rejected this argument reasoning that, \u201c[bjecause overt acts need not be criminal offenses or even acts committed by the defendant, the description of the overt acts in the accusatory pleading does not provide notice of lesser offenses necessarily committed by the defendant. Moreover, inasmuch as overt acts may be lawful acts, the overt acts do not necessarily reveal the criminal objective of the conspiracy.\u201d (46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1709, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">We do not find this reasoning persuasive. First, an accusatory pleading does not fail to give notice merely because an overt act, or any other charged act, is not personally committed by a defendant. Defendants who do not directly commit an offense have long been treated as principals equally liable under the law for the criminal acts committed by their accomplices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>(see \u00a7\u00a731-32; <em>People v. Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 554-555 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1024 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044]), and \u201ccase law has long held due process notice satisfied as to defendants prosecuted as aiders and abettors [citation], accessories after the fact [citation], or <em>conspirators </em>[citation].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 721, 737 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 282], italics added.) This is so because the accused receives adequate notice of the prosecution\u2019s theory from the evidence introduced at the preliminary hearing. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In a case where a defendant is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, the charge of conspiracy serves to give a defendant actual notice that he is subject to accomplice liability for the murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 1024.) Additionally, principles of due process require that the overt acts be pleaded with particularity in order to give defendants notice of the nature and cause of the charge so that the defendant may defend against that charge. <em>(Feagles v. Superior Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.App.3d at pp. 739-740; 4 Witkin <em>&amp; </em>Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Pretrial Proceedings, \u00a7 187, p. 394.) It cannot be said then that an accusatory pleading charging conspiracy, fails as a matter of law to give sufficient notice of the charged offense and any lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">To the extent an accusatory pleading fails to allege overt acts sufficient to give notice of a lesser included offense, the trial court may not rely on the pleading as a basis to instruct on lesser included offenses not included in the allegations of that pleading. Nevertheless, the possibility that some pleadings charging conspiracy may fail to give sufficient notice of lesser included offenses is not cause to hold, as a matter of law, that no pleading charging conspiracy gives sufficient notice of lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">In the case before us, the overt acts alleged in the information specified which defendants committed which overt acts, thereby giving sufficient notice to allow defendants to prepare a defense to both the charged and lesser included target offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">However, Lozo and Gains claim the agreement to commit a particular felony is the crucial element in a charge of conspiracy, and the overt acts do not necessarily give notice of an agreement to commit a lesser included target offense. While this claim may be true in some cases, it is not true here. The information provided sufficient notice that defendants agreed to commit an offense that included the lesser included offense of assault with a firearm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>The first overt act alleged that \u201cdefendants, Matthew Loren Cook and Anthony Soloman Lozo acquired a gun . . . .\u201d The whole thrust of the prosecution\u2019s case was that defendants agreed to go to the intended victim\u2019s residence to shoot him and defendants do not claim the preliminary hearing failed to give them notice of that fact. Furthermore, Overt Act No. 2 alleges that \u201cdefendants, Matthew Loren Cook and Anthony Soloman Lozo wanted that gun in order to seek revenge against the victims . . . .\u201d While we hold in the unpublished portion of this opinion, that Overt Act No. 2 is invalid, defendants did not challenge that allegation by demurrer. Consequently, although it does not operate as an overt act, it does give notice of the fact pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Looking to the accusatory pleading as a whole, the information gave notice that defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit murder by means of a firearm and therefore also gave notice of the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit assault with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Accordingly, the jury was properly instructed on the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit assault with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">VH.-X.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The judgments of sentence imposing prior prison term enhancements on Matthew Loren Cook and Darrion Troy Gains are vacated and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
