Tapia pled guilty to one count of robbery. A three-year state prison sentence was imposed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>suspended, and \u201cformal\u201d probation was granted for a term of three years (which meant it would expire on <em>July 10, 1999). </em>Tapia was ordered to spend one year in jail, then to report to the probation department \u201cwithin 24 hours of [his] release\u201d; if he left the Country, he was not to re-enter illegally; if he did return, he was \u201cto report to the probation officer within 24 hours of [his] return and present documentation that [he was] in the Country legally</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Upon his release from custody in <em>late 1996, </em>Tapia was deported to Mexico. In <em>March 1997, </em>when the trial court was informed that Tapia had failed to report to the probation department, his probation was summarily revoked and a bench warrant was issued. Tapia was arrested when he returned to California in <em>September 2000, </em>and a probation violation hearing was held in November 2000. Tapia admitted that he \u201cdid not report to [his] probation officer when [he] returned to the United States\u201d in September 2000, and that he \u201cdid not, when [he] came back to the United States, show proof that [he was] in the United States legally to [his] probation officer.\u201d No evidence was taken. Based solely on Tapia\u2019s admissions, the trial court found a violation, revoked probation, then reinstated probation and extended it to March 21, 2003. Tapia appeals, contending the trial court had no jurisdiction to extend the term of probation. We agree, and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Although Tapia\u2019s probation was summarily revoked based upon his failure to report to his probation officer when he was released from custody in late 1996, that is not the violation he admitted at the formal probation revocation hearing. All he \u201cadmitted\u201d was that he did not report to the probation department when he returned to the United States in September 2000, and that he did not at that time present proof that his reentry was legal. <em>He did not admit a failure to report in 1996, and he did not admit that his reentry in 2000 was illegal. </em>Since no evidence was presented, the basis for the summary revocation\u2014a claim that Tapia had failed to report to the probation department in 1996\u2014was not proved. Since that violation was not proved, the term of probation expired in July 1999\u2014before Tapia reentered the United States. Since his probation had expired by the time he did reenter in September 2000, the trial court had no jurisdiction to extend the period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">To avoid this result, the Attorney General glosses over the fact that the summary revocation was based on a purported 1996 violation that was neither proved nor admitted, and argues that Tapia\u2019s deportation does not excuse his failure to report to the probation officer when he was released <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>from custody. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Campos </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 917, 923 [244 Cal.Rptr. 75].) The Attorney General then contends that, because summary revocation tolls the running of the probation period and preserves the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the defendant (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.2, subd. (a) [\u201cThe revocation, summary or otherwise, shall serve to toll the running of the probationary period\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>DePaul </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 409, 415 [187 Cal.Rptr. 82] [as used in the statute, \u201ctoll\u201d means the period of probation is suspended, \u201cand if probation is reinstated the period of revocation cannot be counted in calculating the expiration date\u201d]), the trial court had jurisdiction to find a violation based on Tapia\u2019s admission, and to then extend the period of probation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">While the summary revocation of probation does suspend the running of the probationary period so that the court retains jurisdiction to determine at a formal revocation hearing whether there has, in fact, been a violation, an unproved violation cannot support the conclusion that, after the date on which probation expired under its original terms, a violation occurred upon Tapia\u2019s failure to report to the probation department when he later returned to the United States. The rules cited by the Attorney General simply do not apply where, as here, the People have failed to prove that a violation occurred <em>during the term of probation. </em>Thus, while we agree that the period is tolled by summary revocation, and that the period of tolling can be tacked onto the probationary period if probation is reinstated, we do not agree that these rules apply where, as here, there is no proof or admission of a violation during the period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 958, 966 [119 Cal.Rptr. 54], the trial court has \u201cthe power and duty to summarily revoke . . . probation on the information supplied by the probation officer and to issue a bench warrant as the only practical and expeditious way to bring the defendant swiftly before the court, to give him notice of the <em>claimed </em>violations and to afford him a hearing.\u201d (Italics added.)  But when it comes to the tolling contemplated by Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (a), and <em>People v. DePaul, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d at page 415, it is clear that a summary revocation of probation suspends the running of the probation period and permits extension of the term of probation if, and only if, probation is reinstated based upon a violation that occurred during the unextended period of probation. (See <em>People v. Lewis </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1949, 1955 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 376] [summary revocation is simply a device by which the defendant may be brought before the court and jurisdiction retained before formal revocation proceedings commence; if probation is restored, there has, in effect, been no revocation at all].)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Just as the restoration of probation erases the summary revocation, so too does the court\u2019s failure to find a violation within the period of probation. Put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>another way, the jurisdiction retained by the court is to decide <em>whether </em>there has been a violation during the period of probation and, if so, <em>whether </em>to reinstate or terminate probation. When the court finds there has been no violation during the period of probation, there is no need for further jurisdiction. And where, as here, the term of probation has expired, the defendant is also entitled to an order discharging him from probation. <em>(People v. Lewis, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1955-1956.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">It follows that Tapia\u2019s probation expired in July 1999, that the order finding him in violation is void, and that he is entitled to an order discharging him from probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Spencer, P. J., and Ortega, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 5, 2001, and respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied December 12, 2001.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
