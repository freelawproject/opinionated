J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">\u2014 Attorney Paul Gillingham appeals to this court from an order of the Disciplinary Board of the Washington State Bar Association (Board) suspending him from practice for violating the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC). Gillingham concedes violations in that he obtained a loan from a client without meeting the proper safeguards and drafted a will in which he was named as a beneficiary. However, both bar counsel and the Board agree Gillingham repaid the loan with interest and did not receive any proceeds from the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A complaint was brought against Gillingham by the attorney for the personal representative of the estate of Edith Liebel. The hearing examiner found three counts of misconduct were proved, and recommended suspension from the practice of law for 1 month. Gillingham appealed to the Board, but failed to appear for the hearing due to miscommunication. After an uncontested presentation by bar counsel, the Board ordered Gillingham suspended for 12 months. We reverse the Board\u2019s order and adopt a 60-day suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The attorney-client relationship between Gillingham and Liebel forms a necessary backdrop to the present matter. It began around 1976 when Gillingham started representing Liebel in connection with legal difficulties engendered by Liebel\u2019s mother, Clara Sommers. Sommers owned a large number of properties in Seattle. During the mid-70\u2019s, Sommers was repeatedly cited for various building, zoning, fire, and health code violations. Apparently in order to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>accountability for the violations, Sommers devised the tactic of quitclaiming the deed to the properties to someone else. Some of the people she used had been dead for many years, some were ex-husbands, and she frequently quitclaimed property to her daughter, Liebel.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">This practice created certain difficulties, among them that Sommers had transferred the properties to Liebel without advising Liebel of the transfer. Gillingham began representing Liebel in relation to a health code violation regarding one of the properties Sommers had transferred to her. He eventually discovered some 21 properties deeded to Liebel by her mother. Gillingham assisted Liebel by clearing title to the properties, selling the properties, and initiating a guardianship for Liebel\u2019s mother. As a result of his efforts, Liebel eventually received approximately $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Over the course of the professional relationship, Gillingham and Liebel became friends. In 1984, Gillingham drafted Liebel\u2019s will at her request. According to Gillingham, after initially protesting, he agreed to draft the will. Under the will, he was named the executor of Liebel\u2019s estate and was also named a 10 percent beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">In 1987, Gillingham made amendments to the will pursuant to Liebel\u2019s instructions. Under the 1987 will, Gillingham became a beneficiary of 20 percent of Liebel\u2019s estate, and was named as the executor of the estate. In 1989, Liebel changed her will to exclude Gillingham from participating in her estate as a beneficiary, and she appointed Joan Meryhew as her personal representative. Liebel died in March 1990, and in June 1990 Gillingham filed pleadings to contest the change in her will. However, Gillingham did not complete service on one of the parties and abandoned the will contest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>In 1987, Gillingham started a wine importing company called \"Riservati\u201d. In 1988, Ms. Liebel offered to give $25,000 to Riservati. Gillingham ultimately agreed to accept the money as a loan if Ms. Liebel would draw up a repayment schedule. Other testimony before the hearing examiner corroborated Gillingham\u2019s claim that the money was originally intended as a gift. Nevertheless, Liebel prepared a payment schedule containing principal and interest balances, which includes a column titled \"10% interest\u201d. Gillingham repaid the entire amount due with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">After Liebel died in 1990, her personal representative hired attorney Eileen Lawrence to investigate certain aspects of Gillingham\u2019s representation of Liebel. Lawrence brought a civil suit against Gillingham and also initiated the present bar complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After conducting an investigation, the bar association brought five counts of misconduct<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against Gillingham pursuant to the Rules for Lawyer Discipline. A hearing was held before a hearing examiner in June 1993. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>hearing examiner found that counts 1, 2, and 3 were proved. Count 4 was dismissed by the bar association, and count 5 was dismissed for insufficient evidence by the hearing examiner. The hearing officer recommended a sanction of suspension for 1 month.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Gillingham appealed to the Disciplinary Board. The Board scheduled a hearing, but as a result of what appears to have been a miscommunication with his lawyer, neither Gillingham nor his attorney attended the hearing. After an uncontested presentation by bar counsel, the Board made a number of additional findings of fact, deleted mitigating circumstances found by the hearing officer, and added two aggravating circumstances. The Board declined, however, to disturb the hearing officer\u2019s dismissal of count 5. Bar counsel recommended a 6-month suspension. The Board voted to increase the sanction from the 1-month suspension imposed by the hearing examiner to a 12-month suspension. Two members dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Only counts 1-3 are before us here, and Gillingham concedes violations of the RPC with respect to counts 1 and 3. We must, therefore, decide only (1) whether count 2 is in error; (2) whether a 12-month suspension is the appropriate sanction for the misconduct detailed in counts 1 and 3; and, if not, (3) what the appropriate sanction is.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Standards in Attorney Discipline Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Attorney misconduct is defined by the RPC, and any violation of the RPC may be grounds for attorney discipline. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>RLD l.l(i) (incorporating the RPC into the RLD). The appropriate level of sanction for a given violation is determined by reference to the <em>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>(Approved Draft, 1986) <em>(ABA Standards). In re Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d 693, 701, 826 P.2d 186 (1992). Under the RLD, bar counsel has the burden of establishing acts of misconduct by a clear preponderance of the evidence. RLD 4.11(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"> While we normally accord greater weight to the Board than to the hearing officer with regard to the recommended sanction, the responsibility for determining the nature of discipline ultimately rests with this court. <em>Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d at 703. We will decline to adopt the Board\u2019s recommended sanction if we are convinced by one or more factors that the recommendation is inappropriate. <em>Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d at 703. The relevant factors include the purposes of attorney discipline, the proportionality of the recommended sanction to the misconduct, the effect of the sanction on the attorney, the record developed by the hearing panel (including whether the sanction is fairly supported by the record), and the extent of agreement among the members of the Board. <em>Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d at 703. As we indicate in more detail below, we are persuaded that a 12-month suspension for the misconduct at issue here is disproportionate to the misconduct, is not fairly supported by the record before the Board, and is not supported by a unanimous recommendation of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Specific Counts of Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">We will first discuss the validity of count 2, and then the appropriate sanction for counts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Count 2 alleges Gillingham engaged in misconduct in 1984 by drafting a will in which he was named a beneficiary. The hearing officer found, and the Board affirmed, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">Respondent Gillingham\u2019s conduct in naming himself as a beneficiary of the estate of Ms. Liebel violated RLD l.l(i) in that it violated DR 5-101(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Hearing Officer\u2019s Findings of Fact, at 8. Because the current Rules of Professional Conduct were not adopted until September 1, 1985, the previous Code of Professional Responsibility applies to the drafting of the 1984 will. Under that code, Disciplinary Rule 5-101(A) provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">Except with the consent of his client after full disclosure, a lawyer shall not accept employment if the exercise of his professional judgment on behalf of his client will be or reasonably may be affected by his own financial, business, property, or personal interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">There is one major defect with this count. As Gillingham notes, 1 year <em>after </em>the will was drafted, this court specifically found that while such conduct was to be strongly discouraged, it did not violate the Code of Professional Responsibility. In that case, which involved an attorney who drafted a will in which he was a beneficiary, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">While we do not hold . . . that this violates the Code of Professional Responsibility, it is an activity of which we disapprove, in which we believe no attorney should engage, and which should not occur in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-7\"><em>In re Estate of Shaughnessy, </em>104 Wn.2d 89, 97, 702 P.2d 132 (1985). Bar counsel contends that <em>Shaughnessy </em>is distinguishable, since there the court found the attorney had acted in good faith. However, <em>Shaughnessy </em>did not make its holding dependent on an absence of bad faith. Moreover, even if it had, there is no clear preponderance of evidence that Gillingham acted in bad faith in drafting the 1984 will. We conclude therefore that count 2 is predicated on an error of law and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">We next turn to the appropriate sanction for count 1, which concerns the loan Gillingham obtained from Liebel. The <em>ABA Standards </em>govern attorney discipline cases in Washington. <em>Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d at 701. Determining the appropriate sanction involves a 2-stage process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">First, we determine a presumptive sanction by considering (1) the ethical duty violated, (2) the lawyer\u2019s mental state and (3) the extent of the actual or potential harm caused by the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>conduct. Then, we consider any aggravating or mitigating factors which may alter the presumptive sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>at 701. Gillingham concedes he violated the rule which governs entering business transactions with a client. Our inquiry is to determine the proper sanction for an attorney who accepted a loan from a client, where the loan initially was intended as a gift from the client and the loan was repaid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">RPC 1.8(a) determines the ethical duty violated. It provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">A lawyer who is representing a client in a matter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">(a) Shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">(1) The transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which can be reasonably understood by the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">(2) The client is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel in the transaction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">(3) The client consents thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">The rule requires that the business transaction and its terms be (1) fair and reasonable, (2) fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client, (3) in a way the client can understand, (4) the client must consent, and (5) the client must be given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent counsel. The loan transaction at issue was fair and reasonable to Liebel. It provided for repayment with interest. In fact, the repayment schedule was drawn up by Liebel and is in her own handwriting. It is reasonable to infer from this fact that the transaction was communicated to Liebel in a way that she could understand, and that she consented to it. Finally, Gillingham claims he urged Liebel to seek independent counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, Gillingham did not fully disclose and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>transmit <em>in writing </em>to Liebel the terms of the loan. Therefore, the transaction at least technically violates RPC 1.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Next we consider Gillingham\u2019s state of mind in committing the misconduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Did Gillingham negligently, knowingly, or intentionally engage in misconduct regarding the loan? The evidence strongly suggests negligence. RPC 1.8(a) does not flatly prohibit business transactions with clients. It allows such transactions, provided certain conditions are met. While Gillingham did not fully meet all the conditions, the violation is not egregious and is consistent with negligence, since it complies roughly with the spirit of RPC 1.8(a). Further evidence for a negligent state of mind may be educed from the record. The hearing officer found that Liebel initially offered the money as a gift. Depending on the surrounding circumstances, it may be true that Gillingham could have accepted the money as a gift without violating the terms of RPC 1.8(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, he accepted the money as a loan. We conclude that Gillingham negligently failed toabide by RPC 1.8(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\" 'Intent\u2019 is the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\" 'Knowledge\u2019 is the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the conduct but without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular task.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\" 'Negligence\u2019 is the failure of a lawyer to heed a substantial risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, which failure is a deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable lawyer would exercise in the situation.\u201d <em>ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions </em>17 (Approved Draft, 1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Third, we examine the extent of harm. Since Gillingham fully repaid the loan with the interest stipulated by Liebel, there is no actual harm. However, the <em>ABA Standards </em>impose sanctions for either actual or potential injury to a client. <em>See ABA Standards </em>Std. 4.1, at 26. Bar counsel argues that Gillingham caused Liebel potential injury by not securing the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The <em>ABA Standards </em>explicitly define \"potential injury\u201d as \"the harm to a client, the public, the legal system or the profession that is reasonably foreseeable <em>at the time of the lawyer\u2019s misconduct, </em>and which, but for some intervening factor or event, would probably have resulted from the lawyer\u2019s misconduct.\u201d (Italics ours.) <em>ABA Standards, </em>at 17. If Liebel fully intended the loan initially to be a gift, and it was only at Gillingham\u2019s insistence that she agreed to convert it to a loan, then it is unclear exactly what the harm was that was reasonably foreseeable by Gillingham at the time he entered into the loan transaction. Bar counsel seems simply to assume a potential harm existed. It is true that had Liebel been seeking an investment opportunity, an unsecured loan would represent a potential injury. However, the evidence suggests that Liebel\u2019s purpose in making the loan was not to invest in a business but to convey a gift in a form acceptable to Gillingham. If that was her purpose, the lack of a formal security interest did not constitute a potential injury to Liebel.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Finally, we factor in any aggravating or mitigating circumstances relevant to this count. Bar counsel asserts that Liebel was a vulnerable victim, an aggravating circumstance under the <em>ABA Standards. </em>The hearing officer included vulnerability of the victim as an aggravating factor. However, as to the loan, this appears to have been an extrapolation from the finding of fact that Liebel was an unsophisticated and difficult client. While the record is clear that Liebel was a difficult client, it is at best equivocal on the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>sophistication. Moreover, the phrase \"unsophisticated\u201d does not automatically equate with the term \"vulnerable\u201d. <em>See generally People v. Lanza, </em>613 P.2d 337 (Colo. 1980) (cited by <em>ABA Standards </em>as illustrative of vulnerability of victim aggravating factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The <em>ABA Standards </em>provide that \"[a]dmonition is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in dealing with client property and causes little or no actual or potential injury to a client.\u201d <em>ABA Standards </em>Std. 4.14, at 28. The <em>ABA Standards </em>also provide that \"[reprimand is generally appropriate when a lawyer is negligent in dealing with client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\u201d <em>ABA Standards </em>Std. 4.13, at 27. We conclude that had Gillingham been guilty of only this violation, he would deserve an admonition. However, the parallel ethical violation regarding Liebel\u2019s will is far more serious and calls for a stronger sanction. To that violation we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Count 3 of the bar\u2019s formal complaint alleges that Gillingham violated RPC 1.8(c)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by revising Liebel\u2019s will in 1987 without removing himself as a beneficiary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Gillingham again concedes a violation but contends there was only potential rather than actual injury to Liebel, since she later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>removed him from the will when she had the will revised by another attorney in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Again, we determine the presumptive sanction by considering (1) the ethical duty violated, (2) the lawyer\u2019s mental state, and (3) the extent of the actual or potential harm caused by the misconduct, and then consider aggravating or mitigating factors which may alter the presumptive sanction. <em>Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d at 701. The duty violated is the duty of lawyers not to prepare an instrument giving the lawyer a substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift. RPC 1.8(c). This duty is a specific application of the basic conflict of interest principles of RPC 1.7. 1 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. &amp; W. William Hodes, <em>The Law of Lawyering: A Handbook on the Model Rules of Professional Conduct </em>261 (2d ed. 1992). The basic principles govern situations in which the lawyer\u2019s own self-interest threatens to adversely affect or even destroy the quality of the representation to be provided. <em>See </em>1 Hazard &amp; Hodes, at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Gillingham\u2019s mental state was either intent, knowledge or negligence. A lawyer who drafts a will in which he or she is named a beneficiary is involved in a facial and obvious conflict of interest. Any lawyer who ignores this conflict of interest is guilty not of mere negligence but of ignoring what he or she knows or should know. In any event, Gillingham could not have remained ignorant of the conflict of interest: he stood to gain 20 percent of Liebel\u2019s estate. Moreover, Gillingham knew or should have known the RPC eliminate the conflict of interest inherent in a lawyer\u2019s drafting a will from which he or she substantially benefits by banning the practice. We conclude Gillingham acted with knowledge, that is, with \"the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the conduct\u201d. <em>ABA Standards, </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">As for the extent of harm, no actual harm resulted since Gillingham received no portion of the estate. However, the potential harm was extreme. What Gillingham did is banned for good reason. The RPC prohibit lawyers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>drafting wills in which they receive substantial gifts because the practice is inherently permeated with the dangers of self-dealing and undue influence. <em>See </em>1 Hazard &amp; Hodes, at 261. The failure to have the instrument drafted by uninvolved counsel not only deprived Liebel of an independent point of view but also exposed her to the inherent conflict of interest the rule is designed to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Gillingham evidently made the 1987 revisions to Liebel\u2019s will pursuant to her instructions. Ex. 35. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the RPC explicitly prohibit exactly what Gillingham did, whether or not it was according to Liebel\u2019s instructions. Unlike the other rules governing conflicts of interest, the prohibition on testamentary gifts which are drafted by the lawyer-beneficiary does not include an exception when the client gives informed consent. <em>Compare </em>RPC 1.8(c) <em>with </em>RPC 1.7; RPC 1.8(a), (b), (f), (g). Furthermore, Liebel\u2019s instructions may have been much different had she been given the benefit of independent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Finally, we consider aggravating or mitigating factors. Unlike the Board, we discern no significant mitigating or aggravating factors other than those considered by the hearing officer. The hearing officer found three aggravating factors: a prior disciplinary offense (Gillingham received an admonition in 1986), a selfish motive, and vulnerability of the victim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The hearing officer found two mitigating factors, absence of a dishonest motive and a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The mitigating and aggravating factor analysis conducted by the Board is unpersuasive. The Board added two aggravating factors based on the <em>ABA Standards, </em>the first for \"[sjubmission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process\u201d, the second for \"[r]efusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>conduct\u201d. Order on hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendation, at 5. As the phrase, \"or other deceptive practices\u201d makes clear, a simple misstatement of fact is not the same as a false statement. There is no evidence that the two misstatements cited by the Board were false or deceptive statements. As to the second aggravating factor, the record clearly shows Gillingham repeatedly acknowledging the wrongful nature of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s attempt to add aggravating factors is not supported by the record. The doubling of the sanction proposed by bar counsel is largely inexplicable. The fact that neither Gillingham nor his attorney appeared before the Board may have led to the assumption that the absence was deliberate. See Dissent to Bd. order Ex. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Appropriate Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Because we decline to adopt the Board\u2019s recommended sanction, we must independently determine the appropriate sanction for Gillingham\u2019s misconduct. Suspension is generally appropriate \"when a lawyer knows of a conflict of interest and does not fully disclose to a client the possible effect of that conflict, and causes actual injury or potential injury to a client.\u201d <em>ABA Standards </em>Std. 4.32, at 30. A reprimand is generally appropriate \"when a lawyer is negligent in determining whether the representation of a client may be materially affected by the lawyer\u2019s own interests . . . and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\u201d <em>ABA Standards </em>Std. 4.33, at 31. Gillingham either knew or should have known of the facial conflict of interest inherent in drafting a will for a client in which he was named a beneficiary. Given the mental state of knowledge, the facial and obvious nature of the conflict of interest, the potential for serious injury to the client, and what Gillingham conceded to be his \"casual\u201d attitude toward the Rules of Professional Conduct, we find suspension to be the appropriate sanction for Gillingham\u2019s violation of RPC 1.8(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Having found suspension to be the appropriate sanction, we turn to the question of the duration of the suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>sion. We have previously emphasized our commitment to consistency in attorney discipline cases. <em>Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d at 704. Accordingly, we attempt to impose sanctions roughly proportionate to sanctions imposed in similar situations or for analogous levels of culpability. <em>See Johnson, </em>118 Wn.2d at 703 (court will consider the proportionality of the sanction to the misconduct; sanction must not depart significantly from sanctions imposed in similar cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">There appear to be no reported Washington cases in which an attorney violated the RPC\u2019s ban on the practice of preparing wills in which the attorney is a substantial beneficiary. However, as the court noted in <em>Shaughnessy </em>in construing the more vague provisions of former CPR Disciplinary Rule 5-10KA), \"[I]t is an activity of which we disapprove, in which we believe no attorney should engage, and which should not occur in the future.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Shaughnessy, </em>104 Wn.2d 89, 97, 702 P.2d 132 (1985). Both <em>Shaughnessy </em>and RPC 1.8(c) are clear and unambiguous. The practice which each unequivocally prohibits casts a pall of potential self-dealing and undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We view this practice with extreme censure. Given the seriousness of the misconduct, the clarity and force with which this court and the RPC proscribe it, and Gillingham\u2019s prior disciplinary history of one admonition, we find a suspension of 60 days appropriate. Accordingly, we order Gillingham suspended from the practice of law for 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Dolliver, Smith, Guy, Johnson, and Madsen, JJ., and Andersen, Brachtenbach, and Utter, JJ.

He contends he initiated the contest at the request of Liebel\u2019s aunt, who became concerned about the validity of the will when she noticed Liebel\u2019s request that she be cremated. Bar counsel claims he was selfishly pursuing a stake in the estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Lawrence wrote to bar counsel requesting \"the disciplinary counsel to immediately take all action appropriate to pursue appropriate disciplinary proceedings regarding these complaints and not wait until the civil litigation is resolved\u201d. TP II Ex. 16. As a general rule, the bar association does not take action on disciplinary matters when a civil proceeding is pending addressing the same issues. It is not at all clear why the bar association departed from this sensible policy in view of the direct interest Lawrence had in testifying against Gillingham at the disciplinary proceeding. In fact, Gillingham has now filed a bar complaint against Lawrence for knowingly making false statements of material fact to the hearing examiner.
