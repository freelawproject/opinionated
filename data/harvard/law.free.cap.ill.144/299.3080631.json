Where one purchases land with his own money and the legal title is taken in the name of his wife or child, the law will presume that it was intended as an advancement. This presumption may be rebutted or supported by evidence of antecedent or contemporaneous acts, facts or circumstances connected with the purchase, or so soon thereafter as to be fairly considered a part of the transaction itself.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b299-13\" pgmap=\"299\">2.

O. H. Horton, Judge, presiding.</summary><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-18\" pgmap=\"299(22) 300(52)\">This was a bill filed by appellant in the Circuit Court of Cook county against Walter H., F. Clarence, Jessie O. and H. Irene Smith, to have a resulting trust declared and enforced in his behalf in certain property in the city of Chicago. After issues joined, the cause was referred by the court to a master in chancery to take the evidence and report the same to the court, together with his conclusions.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-6\" pgmap=\"300\">Upon the incoming of the report, the master having found in favor of the complainant, exceptions were filed to the report by defendants Walter H. and Jessie O. Smith, which exceptions were sustained by the court, and said complainant\u2019s bill dismissed. From this ruling of the court this appeal is prosecuted.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\" pgmap=\"300(268) 301(106)\">The facts in this case are substantially as follows : In 1883 the property in question belonged to the Travelers\u2019 Insurance Company and had for sometime been occupied by appellant with his family! Appellant desiring to purchase the property for a home, through a Mr. Calhoun, opened negotiations with Mr. White, the agent of the company. The result was that a price and terms of sale were agreed upon, and appellant took an abstract of title to his attorney and procured his opinion thereon. Shortly afterward, it is shown, appellant brought a mortgage (of the premises) to secure $800, part of the purchase price, to the same attorney for examination and said : \u201c Here is the mortgage White has made out. I will come over here some noon hour with my wife; we can acknowledge it, then I wish you would attend to the winding up of it.\u201d Subsequently appellant and wife called at the\" attorney\u2019s office. The mortgage and notes were produced, and, by direction of the attorney, Mrs. Smith signed the same first and appellant\u2019s signature followed hers, that being the order of the names in the body of the instrument. The four (4) principal notes of $200 each, and twenty (20) interest coupons were all signed the same way. The attorney indorsed on the back of the mortgage, \u201cAdelaide Smith and Frederick J. Smith.\u201d \u201c Travelers\u2019 Insurance Company.\u201d Appellant then said that he was very busy, and handing the mortgage to the attorney with a check for $675, being the cash payment, requested him to go down with Mrs. Smith to White\u2019s office and close up the purchase. The attorney and Mrs. Smith went to White\u2019s office, delivered the mortgage, notes and check and received in return a warranty deed from the Travelers\u2019 Insurance Company conveying the property to Mrs. Adelaide Smith. Nothing had been said up to that time by appellant to the attorney in reference to whom the deed was to be made, nor is any explanation given of why Mrs. Smith was made principal in the mortgage, and why she signed the notes and coupons. The mortgage was by \u201c Mrs. Adelaide Smith and her husband, Frederick J. Smith,\u201d and acknowledged accordingly.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-5\" pgmap=\"301(278) 302(16)\">It does not appear that the attorney had been consulted in respect of how the title was to be taken, and when the deed was received he directed the attention of Mrs. Smith to the fact that it was to her, but does not remember what she said. The deed was placed on record by the attorney. The evidence shows subsequently, how long after the recording of the deed does not appear, the attorney called appellant\u2019s attention to the matter, who replied : \u201c Well, for the present, we will let the thing rest; my wife will make a deed to me, fix it all right.\u201d The proof shows that appellant paid the entire purchase price, taxes and repairs out of his own -money. Mrs. Smith had no means. From the time of the purchase the property was occupied as a homestead by appellant and Mrs. Smith until Mrs. Smith\u2019s death in March, 1886, and by appellant since. Appellant remarried in April, 1887. It appears that in the conversations between appellant and the attorney, before referred to, appellant said that he was buying the property, and said nothing about buying it for his wife. There is testimony of declarations by appellant tending to show that he understood the property to be his wife\u2019s. Thus, on a visit of himself and wife to the house of witness Reed, the wife of witness remarked that the title to their new house was in her name; appellant replied that is just what he did \u2014 had it put in his wife\u2019s name. At another time he said that he wanted to purchase a lot to live on, for the reason that the property in controversy belonged \u201c to the children,\u201d etc.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-5\" pgmap=\"302\">Mr. Thomas Taylor, Jr., for the appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-6\" pgmap=\"302\">The doctrine of resulting trusts arises by analogy, from the theory of the common law that a feoffment without consideration results to the feoffer.

Cases, supra; Robinson v. Robinson, 45 Ark. 484; Perry on Trusts, sec. 147.</p> <p id=\"b305-6\" pgmap=\"305\">Are the facts presented by the record in this case sufficient to overcome the presumption, attaching to the conveyance in question, that the same was intended by appellant as an advancement to his wife ?</p> <p id=\"b305-7\" pgmap=\"305(186) 306(21)\">The complainant\u2019s bill alleges that at the time of the purchase of said real estate, he was closely engaged in business, and, not having time to attend to the details thereof, entrusted the same to his wife, Adelaide Smith; that it was the intention to have the title to said real estate taken in complainant\u2019s name, but he discovered afterward that it had been taken in the name of his wife; that his wife knew all the time that the same belonged to and should have been taken in the first instance in the name of complainant. These allegations are evidently intended to impute fraud and artifice, upon the part of appellant\u2019s wife, in taking the deed to the property, and indirectly and inferentially charge that she being entrusted \u201c to attend to the details of said purchase,\u201d surreptitiously procured said deed to be made to herself as grantee, instead of to her husband, the appellant. Admitting that these allegations amount to a substantial charge of fraud, or to any other statement of fact, sufficient, if sustained by the evidence, to overthrow the presumption attaching to the conveyance, the bill is-not borne out and supported by the evidence in the case.</p> <p id=\"b306-5\" pgmap=\"306\">It is clear to our minds, from the evidence in the record, that from the time Mr. Calhoun\u2019s connection with the negotiations ceased, no one had anything to do with the purchase, other than appellant himself, until the day the transaction was closed. Mr. Calhoun, in his testimony, leaves the appellant to go ahead, and carry on the negotiations for the purchase already inaugurated by his apparently disinterested instrumentality. The appellant procured the abstract of title, which it is reasonable to presume he obtained from or through Mr. White, agent of the grantor, the insurance company, and took the same to his attorney for examination. Afterward the appellant took a mortgage, made out by Mr. White to secure $800 of the purchase price, to said attorney to examine. Appellant and his wife subsequently called at the attorney\u2019s office and signed the mortgage and acknowledged it before him, Mrs. Smith signing the mortgage, four principal notes and twenty interest coupons first, and appellant signing after her, under the direction of appellant\u2019s attorney. Appellant then handed a check of $675 to said attorney, and directed his wife and said attorney to go to White\u2019s office and close the transaction.</p> <p id=\"b306-6\" pgmap=\"306\">Appellant, instead of trusting the details of the purchase to his wife, performed every act, ordinarily incident to the purchase of real property, and his wife does not appear in the transaction in any essential particular, if at all, until the day the purchase is closed. All the connection then shown consisted in her executing the notes and mortgage and going with the attorney to turn over the same and the check to Mr. White, and obtaining the deed which was executed ready for delivery.</p> <p id=\"b306-7\" pgmap=\"306(50) 307(104)\">The deed and its acknowledgment in Hartford, Conn., the mortgage, notes and interest coupons all bore date October 1; the transaction was closed December 1, prior to which latter date there is not a scintilla of evidence showing or tending to show that appellant\u2019s wife had any connection, directly or indirectly, with the purchase of the property. Undoubtedly, if the wife, by fraud or wrongful act against the intention of the husband, had.obtained the conveyance to be made in her name, the presumption of an advancement would be rebutted, and the presumption that she held in trust arise. Perry on Trusts, sec. 148, and cases cited. But there is absolutely no evidence tending to sustain the allegations of the bill in that regard. It may be that the death of White and of Mrs. Smith, and the consequent disqualification of appellant, renders it impossible to show the true state of the case.</p> <p id=\"b307-6\" pgmap=\"307\">The burden being upon appellant, he must establish the necessary facts, either by direct proof of a contrary intention, or of facts and circumstances which will overcome and rebut the presumption. The presumption of fact, where the deed is made to the wife, that it was intended as a gift or advancement, must prevail until overcome or rebutted by proof of such facts and circumstances as will satisfy the conscience of the chancellor that the conveyance was in fact taken 'to the wife for the benefit of the husband. In this case, independently of the proof that the consideration was paid by the husband, there is evidence of no fact or circumstance, as we read the record, inconsistent with the presumption. Indeed, the only competent evidence in the record tends to show that the husband had the deed made to the wife, and that he recognized the title to be in the children of the wife after her death intestate. It is unnecessary, therefore, in this case to consider the many authorities cited where an attempt has been made to lay down a rule as to the measure and quantum of evidence necessary to overcome the presumption of a gift or advancement. The burden is, at least, on the party holding the affirmative, to make out his case and show that an advancement was not intended. Perry on Trusts, sees. 145-152, and cases supra.</p> <p id=\"b307-8\" pgmap=\"307\">The decree dismissing the bill was properly entered and must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b307-9\" pgmap=\"307\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
