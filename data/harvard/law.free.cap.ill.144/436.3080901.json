Husband and wife \u2014 ante-nuptial contract set aside for unfairness. A marriage contract was entered into four days before marriage of the parties, by which the intended wife, in consideration of $2000, to be paid two years after the husband\u2019s death, released all the rights given her by law in his estate, including dower and homestead, and by which he also released all rights in the wife\u2019s estate, and it appeared that she had no property or expectation of property, which provision for the wife was shown to be very inadequate, taking into consideration his means. There was no proof of the circumstances attending the execution of the contract, or that the wife was made acquainted with the extent of property owned by her intended husband: Held, that the agreement was one-sided and unfair to the wife, and did not bar her right of dower in the husband\u2019s lands and estate.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b436-15\" pgmap=\"436\">2. While it may be conceded that an intended wife has the legal capacity to make an ante-nuptial contract, and that marriage is a sufficient consideration to support it, yet in the absence of clear and satisfactory proof, it will not be presumed that she would, with full knowledge of all the circumstances, enter into such a contract which makes an inadequate provision in her favor.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b436-16\" pgmap=\"436(65) 437(28)\">3. Same \u2014 burden of sustaining ante-nuptial contract. Parties to an ante-nuptial contract occupy a confidential relation toward each other. While they may lawfully contract with each other when there is full knowledge of all that materially affects the contract, yet when the provision secured for the intended wife is disproportionate to the means of the intended husband, it raises the presumption of designed concealment and throws the burden upon those claiming in his right to prove that there was a full knowledge in her of all that materially affects the contract.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-5\" pgmap=\"437\">4. Where the provision made for the intended wife is inadequate to the husband\u2019s means, the burden will be on his heirs to prove by satisfactory evidence that she had full knowledge of the character and extent of her intended husband\u2019s property, and of the provisions of the contract, or at all events that the circumstances were such that she reasonably ought to have had such knowledge at the time the contract was executed.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-6\" pgmap=\"437\">5. Same \u2014 ante-nuptial contract construed \u2014 after-born children. An ante-nuptial contract provided that if any children should be born of the marriage, and survive the husband, such issue should inherit all his estate equally with any issue of him by any former marriage, \u201cthe same as if no contract existed between the parents: \u201d Held, that such provision created no contract in behalf of after-born children, but was intended to leave the inheritance of the husband\u2019s property, as respects his children by his intended wife, unaffected by the contract.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-7\" pgmap=\"437\">6.

Assignment of dower \u2014 decree construed \u2014 homestead rights of minor child. A decree for the assignment of a widow\u2019s dower directed the commissioners to give her dower \u201cwithout prejudice to the homestead rights of the minor child of her deceased husband,\u201d and directed the widow to be let into the possession of the premises \u201c so assigned to her as dower: \u201d Held, that the decree did not ignore the homestead rights of the minor heir.

Taylor, late of Peoria county, deceased, filed her bill in the Circuit Court of that county for the assignment of dower in lands whereof he died seized. The heirs at law of Burtis S. Taylor were made defendants, and they answered denying that the complainant was ever entitled to dower in the lands whereof Burtis S. Taylor died seized, because, before her marriage with him, they entered into an agreement as follows :</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-5\" pgmap=\"438\">\u201cThis agreement, made and entered into this 18th day of October, 1883, between Burtis S.

Taylor died seized, giving her, without prejudice to the homestead rights of the minor child of the said Burtis S. Taylor, the homestead or dwelling house, if she so desired. The commissioners assigned dower and reported their action to the court, which report was approved by the court.

It may also be stated as a general rule that relief will be afforded in equity in all transactions in which influence has been acquired and abused, in which confidence has been reposed and betrayed.

Ho one witnessed its execution, and no one was informed that such an instrument had been executed until long after its execution. Some expressions of Taylor and admissions of complainant that such an instrument had been executed, are proved; but Taylor\u2019s expressions were as to the effect of the instrument, making no explanation of the circumstances attendant upon its execution, and the admissions of the complainant are accompanied by the explanation, that if she had known, at the time the instrument was executed, what she knew at the time of making the admission, she would not have signed it.</p> <p id=\"b443-8\" pgmap=\"443\">The parties were married four days after the date of this agreement \u2014 October 22,1883 \u2014 and Taylor died on the 30th of June, 1889.</p> <p id=\"b443-9\" pgmap=\"443(129) 444(109)\">At the time of Taylor\u2019s death, he was seized of real estate estimated to be of the value of $28,000, of most of which he was seized at the time the agreement was executed. His personal estate, at the time of his death, was estimated to be of the value of $13,000. How much of this he owned at the time the agreement was executed does not appear. The parties were cousins \u2014 both had been previously married \u2014 he twice and she once. She had one daughter then married and living apart from her. He had three sons and three daughters, two or three of whom were minors, but not of a very tender age. The complainant was born and raised in the city of New York and resided there until she came to Peoria county shortly previous to her marriage. She had no property, either real or personal, and maintained herself by dresssmaking. Taylor had been a resident of Peoria county for many years, but we think there is competent evidence in the record clearly proving that, at the time this agreement was executed, he knew that complainant had no property. There is not a particle of evidence in the record tending to show that it was anticipated by the parties, when this agreement was executed, that the complainant would or could in any understood way, acquire a separate property subsequent to her marriage.</p> <p id=\"b444-5\" pgmap=\"444(274) 445(31)\">In view of these facts that must be taken into consideration in connection with the making of the agreement, the agreement is one-sided and unfair to the complainant. It is a virtual relinquishment on her part of dower in his real estate, and of her claim for a personal allowance in his personal property, and of what she would take in his personal estate under the statute of descents, for $2000, to be paid to her within two years after his decease. Having, no separate property and the acquisition of none in contemplation, the surrender of his rights as to such property is meaningless. Nor do we agree with counsel that the provision that children to be born of the contemplated marriage shall inherit equally with his other children, amounts to a contract in behalf of such children. The language is: \u201c Should any children be born of said marriage, and survive the party of the first part, said issue shall inherit all the estate of the party of the first part equally with any issue the party of the first part may have from former marriage or marriages, the same as if no contract existed between the parents,\u201d plainly intending not to restrict the power of disposition by sale or devise, but to leave the inheritance of his property, as respects his children by her, unaffected by the agreement; and so they were as well off without as with this stipulation. The sum to be paid is not above one-half, if indeed it is that, of what complainant would have received as widow from the personal estate alone, in the absence of any agreement, and it is to be received at a date no earlier than she would have received it in the absence of an agreement.</p> <p id=\"b445-5\" pgmap=\"445\">It is unnecessary to say that complainant was not competent to enter into such an agreement. It may be conceded that she had the legal capacity to make such a contract, and that marriage was a sufficient consideration to support it. But, in the absence of clear and satisfactory proof, it is not to be presumed that she would, with full knowledge of all the circumstances, have entered into such a .contract. Parties to an ante-nuptial contract occupy a confidential relation toward each other. Kline's Estate, 64 Pa. St. 124; Pierce v. Pierce, 71 N. Y. 154: Rockafeller v. Newcomb, 57 id. 86. While they may lawfully contract with each other, where there is full knowledge of all that materially affects the contract, yet where the provision secured for the intended wife is disproportionate to the means of the intended husband, it raises the presumption of designed concealment and throws the burden upon those claiming in his right to prove that there was full knowledge on her part of all that materially affected the contract. Cases cited supra; Beirer\u2019s Appeal, 92 Pa. St. 267; Tiernan v. Reims, id. 248; Spurlock v. Brown (Tenn.), not yet reported (18 S. W. 868). The burden here was, therefore, upon appellants to prove by satisfactory evidence that appellee had knowledge of the character and extent of her intended husband\u2019s property, and of the provisions and effect of this instrument, or, at all events, that the circumstances were such that she reasonably ought to have had such knowledge at the time this instrument was executed. In our opinion, they failed to make such proof.</p> <p id=\"b445-6\" pgmap=\"445(62) 446(25)\">It is further contended that there is error in the decree in awarding the homestead to complainant as part of her dower, without recognizing the existing rights of William G. Taylor therein, In our opinion, this is a misapprehension of the effect of the decree. It expressly directs that the commissioners shall give her, \u201c without prejudice to the homestead rights of the minor child of the said Burtis S. Taylor,\u201d who is William G. Taylor, \u201c the homestead or dwelling-house of her husband,\u201d etc.</p> <p id=\"b446-11\" pgmap=\"446\">The clause directing her to be let into possession is subordinate to this. She is to be let into possession of the premises so assigned to her as dower; \u201d that is, in those where William G. Taylor, the minor, has a homestead right, without prejudice to that right, as well as absolutely into those where there are no conflicting rights.</p> <p id=\"b446-12\" pgmap=\"446\">The decree is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b446-13\" pgmap=\"446\">Decree affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b446-14\" pgmap=\"446\">Craig and Magruder, JJ., dissenting.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
