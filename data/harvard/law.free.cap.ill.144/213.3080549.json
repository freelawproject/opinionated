Contract of sale \u2014 failure of vendor to comply\u2014option of vendee. A contract for the sale of land provided that the purchaser should be furnished with a complete abstract of the title, and that in case the title should be found to be materially defective within ten days thereafter, then unless such defects should be cured within sixty days after written notice thereof, the earnest money should be refunded, and the contract become void. Held, that on the failure of the vendor to obviate the defects in the title within sixty days after notice, the purchaser had the right to treat the contract as inoperative and demand the return of the cash payment, or to tender the balance of the purchase money and demand a deed of the premises, in the exercise of his legal option to take the defective title.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b213-9\" pgmap=\"213\">2. Same \u2014promises by vendor to cure defective title \u2014 waiver as to time. \u2014 If the vendor, from time to time, after the lapse of the sixty days, promises to cure the defects in the title, which promises are accepted, this will amount to an arrangement between the parties for an extension of the time fixed by the contract for the curing of the defective title, and such arrangement will involve a waiver on the part of the vendor of the requirement that the purchaser should either take back the earnest money or pay the balance of the purchase money at the expiration of the sixty days. Time, though the essence of a contract, may be waived.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b213-10\" pgmap=\"213\">3. Same\u2014signing by a third person not named therein. Where a third person merely annexes his name to a contract, which in the body of it does not mention him, and which is in itself a complete contract between other parties who sign it and are mentioned in it, such third person does not thereby become a party to the efficient and operative parts of the contract. His signature can only be regarded as an expression of his assent to the act of the parties making the contract, and may perhaps operate as an estoppel against his assertion of title.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b213-11\" pgmap=\"213\">4. So, when a written contract recited that A agreed to sell, and B agreed to purchase, a lot at a price named, and contained a covenant to convey by a good and sufficient warranty deed on payment, and the contract was signed by A, O and D as well as by B, it was held that C and D could not be held bound by the covenant or be treated as signing as joint vendors of A any more than that they signed as joint purchasers.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-4\" pgmap=\"214\">5. Same \u2014 mutuality of contract. In such a case there is a want of mutuality in the contract as between B, the purchaser on the one side, and O and D on the other, as the latter could not enforce the contract, as to B.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-5\" pgmap=\"214\">6.

Same\u2014failure of vendor\u2019s title\u2014Ms power to rescind. Where the vendor of land is in no position to compel a specific performance of the contract by the vendee by reason of the failure of the vendor to remove incumbrances from the title, and his inability to make a good title, he cannot rescind the contract.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-7\" pgmap=\"214\">8. Same \u2014 laches of purchaser \u2014 caused by acts of vendor. The vendor of land can not take advantage of the purchaser\u2019s neglect to promptly rescind the contract, or take steps to enforce specific performance, when such delay is caused by the vendor\u2019s repeated promises to cure the defects in the title to the property, and thereby retain the earnest money.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-8\" pgmap=\"214\">9. Where the purchaser of land is induced to delay filing his bill for specific performance, by the promises of the vendor to cure the defects in the title, such promises will excuse a delay of about two years in filing the bill.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-9\" pgmap=\"214\">10. Same \u2014 conditions as to title \u2014 Construed most strongly against vendor \u2014 option of purchaser. A condition in a contract for the sale of land, by which the sale is to become void in case the vendor can not deduce a good title, is to be taken most strongly against him, because he alone is able to judge of the necessity of making the condition before he offers the property for sale. Such a condition gives an option, not to the vendor, but to the purchaser, to avoid the contract for failure to deduce a good title.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-10\" pgmap=\"214\">11.

Specific performance \u2014 right of purchaser to waive failure of vendor\u2014and to abatement out of purchase money. In suits by the purchaser for a specific performance where the vendor is unable to make a complete title, it is a general rule that the purchaser, if he chooses, is\u2019 entitled to have the contract specifically performed as far as the vendor can perform it, and to have an abatement out of the purchase money, or compensation for any deficiency in the title, quantity, quality, description or other matter touching the estate.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b214-12\" pgmap=\"214(63) 215(17)\">13. Dower \u2014 deed sufficient to release. Where a deed of a husband is signed and acknowledged by his wife without mention of her name in the same, her signature will operate as a relinquishment of her dower, although the deed does not mention her as a grantor, or her dower in any way whatever. This depends upon the provisions of our statutes which are construed as giving to the signature or acknowledgment of the wife or husband such effect.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b215-5\" pgmap=\"215\">14. Practice \u2014 demurrer by several defendants to a bill \u2014 good as to some and bad as to others. Where there are several defendants, if they all join in one demurrer to a bill, the demurrer may be good and be allowed as to one of the defendants, and be bad and disallowed as to the other defendants, as the defense may be good as to one person and be wholly inapplicable to another.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b215-6\" pgmap=\"215\">Appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon.

The case stood thus until November 9, 1891, when the complainant filed an amended bill, several solicitors in the meantime appearing for the defendants, and again withdrawing their appearance. The amended bill was demurred to by the three defendants, George W. Roberts, Nellie F. P. Jones, and Ann Auguste Roberts, and, the demurrer having been sustained, the complainant elected to stand by his bill, which was dismissed at his costs for want of equity. Subsequently his death was suggested, and his executors, the present appellants, were substituted as complainants.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-11\" pgmap=\"216(42) 217(365) 218(210)\">The amended bill alleges, that on said July 20, 1887, said three defendants \u201c being or pretending to be seized and possessed in fee simple\u201d of said premises entered into said! written agreement with the complainant for the sale of the same; that said agreement was signed by each and all of said defendants and by complainant, and recorded on August 2, 1887, in the recorder\u2019s office of Cook County; that said defendants therein and thereby \u201cjointly and severally covenanted and agreed for themselves, their heirs, executors and administrators, for and in consideration of the sum of $15,500, to be paid as hereinafter mentioned, well and truly to convey by a good and sufficient warranty deed in fee simple to your orator, his heirs or assigns, the tract or parcel of land above described ; and in consideration whereof your orator covenanted and agreed to pay to said defendants, their heirs, executors or administrators the said sum of $15,500,\u201d in the manner stated in said agreement, which is attached as an exhibit to the bill and made a part thereof; that on or about August 2, 1887, said defendants submitted to the complainant an abstract of title to said premises, which, upon examination, was found to be materially defective: there being still outstanding and unreleased, three incumbrances executed by said George W. Roberts, one upon said premises for $1900, dated April 19, 1883, payable in three years: one upon said premises and other property for $23,000, dated May 26, 1886, payable in five years; one upon the undivided one-half of said premises and other property for $10,000, payable on demand; and there also being a judgment for $11,163, rendered May 27, 1887, against said George W. Roberts; that complainant was ignorant of said liens when the agreement was made; that knowledge of said defects was given by complainant to said defendants in writing within ten days after said abstract was delivered to complainant, and they were requested to cure the same, but said defendants and each of them wholly neglected to cure the same or any of them, although the defendant George W. Roberts from time to time from said last mentioned date until the date of the filing of the bill herein promised to cure such defects, and solely by reason of said promises and with the hope from day to day that the same would be cured, the complainant delayed the filing of the bill in this cause until the 21st day of November, 1889 ; that orator has always been willing, able and ready to comply with the terms of said agreement on his part; that on the 2d day of August, 1887, and at divers times thereafter, he applied to said defendants and offered to pay them $15,000, on their delivering to your orator a sufficient warranty deed for the said premises according to said agreement; yet the said defendants refused and ever since have and still refuse to comply with said agreement on their part, and to convey said premises to complainant by a good and sufficient warranty deed conveying a good title subject as above set forth, although your orator is and always has been ready, willing and able to pay the said sum of $15,000, and fully perform his part of said agreement whenever they, the said defendants, will make and deliver to him a good and sufficient deed, subject as aforesaid, for the premises aforesaid, and to take such title as the defendants actually had, upon compensation being allowed to him for the difference in value of the title thus actually conveyed, and of the title agreed to be conveyed.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\" pgmap=\"218(169) 219(45)\">The prayer of the bill, after waiving the answer under oath, is that the said defendants may be decreed specifically to perform the said agreement, and to make a good and sufficient deed of conveyance to orator, he being ready, able and willing, and offering specifically to perform the agreement on his part, and upon the defendants making out a good and sufficient title to the said premises and executing a proper conveyance thereof to orator pursuant to the terms of said agreement, to pay to the defendants the residue of the said purchase money; and that in case it shall appear that the title of said George W. Roberts in and to said premises is impaired in value by reason of the existence of and lien of said incumbrances and judgment, or any or either of them, said defendants be ordered and decreed to convey to the complainant such estate and title in and to said premises as they are by this court found to have therein, and that the complainant be decreed to have compensation for the difference in value of the title thus actually conveyed, and of the title agreed to be conveyed; and that orator may have such other and further relief as equity may require.</p><attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-4\" pgmap=\"219\">Messrs.

In Illinois effect is given by statute to the mere formality of subscribing and acknowledging by a wife? even in a case where the deed, on its face, would not show her to be a party to the contract. The question here is, what legal significance is imported by the fact that a person subscribes his name to a writing, when the contract expressed in said writing appears to be between other persons % That Mrs. Roberts or Mrs. Jones may or may not be married women is immaterial. They did not become parties to the contract by writing their names to the paper set forth in this amended bill, as is shown by the following citations: Powell v. M. &amp; B. M.

This contention is based upon the fact, that the contract does not mention or in any way refer to \u00a1Nellie F. P. Jones and Ann Auguste Roberts, although it is signed by them. As they are not referred to in the body of the agreement, it is said that their signatures thereto are mere surplusage.</p> <p id=\"b222-5\" pgmap=\"222\">The courts have passed upon a number of cases, where the deed or contract of a husband has been signed by his wife without mention of her name in the instrument itself. It has been held in this State, that, where the wife of a grantor in a deed signs the deed with him, her dower is thereby relinquished, although the body of the deed does not describe her as a grantor, or name her or her dower in any mode whatever. (Johnson v. Montgomery, 51 Ill. 185; Miller v. Shaw, 103 Ill. 277; Yocum v. Lovell, 111 Ill. 212; Schley v. Pullman Palace Car Co., 25 Fed. Rep. 890; Bute v. Kneale, 109 Ill. 652). The same is true of the estate of homestead as well as of the estate of dower, and of deeds where the wife is grantor and the husband signs with her without being named in the deed. (Idem.) The Illinois cases, however, depend upon particular statutory provisions, which are construed as giving to the signature or acknowledgment of the wife or husband the effect above stated. In other States it has been held, that a deed which is merely signed by a wife, but does not contain apt words of grant on her part, does not pass her dower. (Bruce v. Wood, 1 Met. 542; Leavitt v. Lamprey, 13 Pick. 382; Lothrop v. Foster, 51 Me. 367; Cox v. Wells, 7 Blackf. 410; Davis v. Bartholomew, 3 Ind. 485; McFarland v. Febiger, 7 Ohio, 337). These cases, decided in other States, were shown in Johnson v. Montgomery, supra, to be inapplicable under the statutes of Illinois.</p> <p id=\"b222-6\" pgmap=\"222(78) 223(175)\">But we have been referred to no authority, which discusses the effect of merely signing a deed or contract where the relation of husband and wife does not exist between the grantor or party named in the instrument, and the party signing the same but not named therein. It would seem, however, upon reason and principle, that, where a third person merely annexes his name to a contract which in the body of it does not mention him, and which is in itself a complete contract between other parties who sign it and are mentioned in it, such third person does not thereby become a party to the efficient and operative parts of the contract. His signature in such case can only be regarded as an expression of his assent to the act of the parties in making the contract, and may perhaps operate as an estoppel against his assertion in the future of an adverse interest in the subject-matter of the agreement. We, therefore, think that the bill misstates the effect of the signatures of Nellie F. P. Jones and Ann Auguste Roberts to the contract in alleging that they thereby agreed to sell the lot and covenanted to convey it by a good and sufficient warranty deed. The assumption, that they signed the contract as joint vendors with George W. Roberts, is no more justified by anything which appears upon the face of the instrument, than the assumption that they signed their names as joint purchasers with Lancaster.</p> <p id=\"b223-5\" pgmap=\"223\">There is a want, of mutuality in the contract as between Lancaster on the one side and said Nellie and Ann on the other. The latter could not enforce the contract against the former. \u201c Whenever * * * the contract is incapable of being enforced against one party, that party is equally incapable of enforcing it against the other, though its execution in the latter way might in itself be free from the difficulty attending its execution in the former.\u201d (Fry on Spec. Perf.\u20143 ed.\u2014sec. 440)</p> <p id=\"b223-7\" pgmap=\"223\">But, while the demurrer was properly sustained as to said Nellie and Ann, it need not necessarily have been sustained as to George W. Roberts. \u201cWhere there are several defendants, if they all join in one demurrer to a bill, the demurrer may be good and be allowed as to one of the defendants, and be bad and disallowed as to the other defendants; for the defence may be good as to one person, and be wholly inapplicable to another.\u201d (Story\u2019s Eq. Plead., sec. 445). If, therefore, the bill is such, that the complainant was entitled to have an answer to it from George W. Roberts, it was error to sustain the demurrer as to him.</p> <p id=\"b224-4\" pgmap=\"224\">Second, it is claimed on behalf of the appellees that the demurrer to the bill was properly sustained upon the alleged ground that the only remedy, which the purchaser named in the contract can resort to, is a suit at law for the amount of the cash deposit made at the time, of the execution of the agreement. This contention is based upon that clause in the contract which provides, that \u201c in case the title upon examination is found materially defective within ten days after said abstract is furnished, then unless the material defects be cured within sixty days after written notice thereof, the said earnest money shall be refunded and the contract is to become inoperative.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b224-5\" pgmap=\"224\">A condition in a contract of sale, by which the contract is to be void in case the vendor cannot deduce a good title, is to be taken most strongly against the vendor, because he alone is able to judge of the necessity or propriety of making the condition before he offers the property for sale. (Greaves v. Wilson, 25 Beav. 290; Page v. Adams, 4 Beav. 269). Such a condition gives an option, not to the vendor, but to the purchaser, to avoid the contract for failure to deduce a good title. (Roberts v. Wyatt, 2 Taunt. 268). In the recent case of Hale v. Cravener, 128 Ill. 408, the contract contained the following provision: \u201c In case the abstract of title to be furnished as aforesaid does not show a good title, as herein stated, then the $500.00 this date paid thereon shall be returned to said first party, and this contract determined; \u201d and we there held, that said provision was designed for the benefit of the purchaser and could not be taken advantage of by the vendor, because the latter was presumed to know the title, while the former did not know it. If it were otherwise, a vendor might purposely neglect to furnish a good title, and then rely upon his own default, in order to accomplish a rescission of the contract by merely returning the earnest money.</p> <p id=\"b224-6\" pgmap=\"224(35) 225(49)\">It is a familiar rule, that the vendor cannot force the purchaser to pay his money and receive a defective title. (Wallace v. McLaughlin, 51 Ill. 53; King v. Knapp, 59 N. Y. 462; Hepburn v. Auld, 5 Cranch, 262). But the purchaser may elect to take a title which is defective. (Harding v. Parshall, 56 Ill. 219; Hoyt v. Tuxbury, 70 Ill. 331; Hale v. Cravener, supra; 3 Pom. Eq. Jur., sec. 1405, and cases referred to in notes).</p> <p id=\"b225-5\" pgmap=\"225\">In the case at bar, the title was found to be defective within ten days after the abstract was furnished, and notice of such defects was given to the vendor, who was allowed by the contract sixty days after such notice for the purpose of curing the defects. At the end of the sixty days the vendor, Roberts, had not cleared the title by removing the incumbrances and cancelling the judgment. Therefore, the purchaser, Lancaster, had the right at that time either to treat the contract as inoperative and demand the return of his cash payment, or to tender the balance of the purchase money and demand a deed of the premises in the exercise of his legal option to take the defective title disclosed by the abstract. There are no allegations in the bill, that he did either, but the bill alleges that Roberts promised from time to time after the lapse of the sixty days to cure the defects in the title, and that Lancaster was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. The bill being demurred to, these allegations must be assumed to be true. If Roberts thus promised to cure the defects and Lancaster accepted his promise to do so, there was substantially an arrangement between the parties for an extension of the time fixed by the contract for the curing of the defective title. This arrangement involved a waiver on the part of Roberts of the requirement that Lancaster should either take back the earnest money, or receive the defective title, at the expiration of the sixty days. Although time be made of the essence of the contract, yet the condition may be waived. (1 Sugden on Vendors\u2014Perkins\u2019 8th Am. ed.\u2014page 417; Dennis v. McCagg, 32 Ill. 429).</p> <p id=\"b225-6\" pgmap=\"225(35) 226(121)\">The vendor here has not been in a position to compel a specific performance by the vendee. The latter could not be compelled to pay for a title clouded by encumbrances. Unless the vendor can sustain a bill for specific performance, he cannot rescind the contract. (Wallace v. McLaughlin, supra). Even if Roberts had the right to tender a deed and offer to return the earnest money, he did not do so. His failure to make such tender and offer is implied from the continued promises to cure the defects in the title, as such promises are alleged in the bill. It would be inequitable to allow the vendor to retain the earnest money, if the purchaser was ready and willing to perform and was prevented from taking steps to enforce performance against the vendor by the latter\u2019s promises to cure the defects in the title. (Snyder v. Spaulding, 57 Ill. 480).</p> <p id=\"b226-5\" pgmap=\"226\">We do not think, that the bill is demurrable because it asks for compensation or for an abatement of the amount of the encumbrances out of the purchase-money. When the answer and the testimony are before the court, it may not be possible or advisable to grant such compensation, but equity has the power to allow it. In suits by the purchaser for a specific performance where the vendor is unable to make complete title, \u201cthe general rule (for it is not universal), in all such cases is, that the purchaser, if he chooses, is entitled to have the contract specifically performed as far as the vendor can perform it, and to have an abatement out of the- purchase money or compensation for any deficiency in the title, quantity, quality, description or other matters touching the estate.\u201d (2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur.\u201413th ed.\u2014sec. 779; Woodbury v. Luddy, 14 Allen, 1; Gerome v. Scudder, 2 Rob. (N. Y.) 169; Wallace v. McLaughlin, supra; Snyder v. Spaulding, supra; Lombard v. Chicago Sinai Congregation, 64 Ill. 485). We are of the opinion that Lancaster was entitled to file the bill, and cannot be limited to an action at law for the earnest money.</p> <p id=\"b226-6\" pgmap=\"226(56) 227(105)\">Third, it is said that the demurrer to the bill was properly sustained upon the alleged ground that it shows laches upon the part of the purchaser. If it should turn out to be true when the facts are developed, that the purchaser was induced to postpone action under the contract by promises to cure the title made by the vendor from time to time during the period between notice of the defects and the filing of the original bill, then the purchaser was excusable for not sooner filing his bill for specific performance. While the allegations are not as full and definite as they should have been both in regard to the causes of the delay in beginning the suit and in regard to the other matters herein considered, yet we think that the bill shows sufficient ground for relief to have justified the court in overruling the demurrer as to George W. Roberts and requiring him to answer.</p> <p id=\"b227-5\" pgmap=\"227\">We cannot see that the delay in the progress of the suit after the demurrer to the original bill was overruled and leave was given to amend it, was due any more to the fault of the complainant than to the fault of the defendants. There is no specific relief asked for in the amended bill, which could not have been granted under the general prayer for relief in the original bill. The original bill, as well as the amended bill, was for the specific performance of the contract. The amended bill was in no sense a new suit, and the delay in filing it cannot be charged as laches under the circumstances of this case.</p> <p id=\"b227-6\" pgmap=\"227\">The decree of the Superior Court in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill is reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p> <p id=\"b227-7\" pgmap=\"227\">Reversed and, remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
