Attachment \u2014 recognizance by defendant\u2014its purpose and effect. The purpose and effect of giving a recognizance by the defendant in attachment, as provided in section 15 of the Attachment act, is to enable the defendant to obtain control of the property attached or in the hands of garnishees, upon giving security for the payment of the judgment to be recovered in the attachment suit. Upon giving the bond or recognizance, the case proceeds in personam and the judgment entered is a personal judgment, the recognizance standing as security for its payment.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-13\" pgmap=\"382(67) 383(15)\">2. Same \u2014 liability of surety therein\u2014judgment against administrator. The surety in a recognizance given to release the property attached, or to release the garnishee from liability, becomes liable to pay the judgment that may be recovered against the administrator of the defendant in the action on final trial thereof. In such case the judgment against the personal representative of the sole defendant in the same proceeding is a judgment against such defendant within the meaning of the statute.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b383-5\" pgmap=\"383\">3. Same \u2014 not abated by death of defendant. By section 11 of the Abatement act the death of the sole defendant does not abate the action in cases where the cause of action survives, but, upon suggestion of the death, summons may issue against his administrator and the cause will then proceed as if the same had been originally commenced against him.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\" pgmap=\"383\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the First District;\u2014heard in that court on appeal from the Superior Court of Cook county; the Hon. Elliott Anthony, Judge, presiding.</summary><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\" pgmap=\"383\">This was an action of assumpsit by W. J. Morgan &amp; Company against James Allison, and by an attachment, which was served upon garnishees. The defendant, with Lewis L. Sharpe, entered into recognizance in open court conditioned that the defendant would pay to the plaintiff whatever judgment might be rendered against the defendant upon final trial with costs, etc., within ninety days after judgment.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-10\" pgmap=\"383\">Before trial and judgment the defendant Allison died, and Henry A. Foster, his administrator, was made defendant, and on the final trial the plaintiff recovered judgment against the administrator for $797.60 and for costs, which, not being paid within ninety days, the plaintiff sued out a writ of scvre facias upon the recognizance against Sharpe, the surety,.who pleaded nul tiel record as to the recognizance. To this plea the plaintiff replied \u201c that there is such record of the said recognizance remaining in the said Superior Court of Cook county, in the words and figures following,\u201d setting out the record of the recognizance in full. The defendant demurred to this replication, assigning the following special causes:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-11\" pgmap=\"383\">\u201cFirst. The recognizance set out in the said replication is an entirely other and different recognizance than that described in the scire facias heretofore filed herein.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-12\" pgmap=\"383\">\u201c Second. That said replication contains new matter and concludes to the court.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-4\" pgmap=\"384\">\u201c Third. That said replication contains an entirely other and different ground of action from that stated in the scire facias heretofore filed herein.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\" pgmap=\"384\">The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant standing by his demurrer, the cause was tried upon the issues by the court without a jury, and the court found the issues for the plaintiff. The defendant then filed a motion for a new trial, assigning causes as follows :</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\" pgmap=\"384\">\u201c First. The court admitted on the trial on the scire facias improper evidence. on the part of the plaintiff, that is to say, the court admitted in evidence on the trial on said scire facias a recognizance other and different from that described in said scire facias.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-7\" pgmap=\"384\">\u201c Second. The court admitted in evidence on the trial on said scire facias the record of a judgment other and different from that required by the condition in the said recognizance so offered in evidence.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-8\" pgmap=\"384\">\u201c Third. There is no evidence in this case of the forfeiture of the recognizance before the issuing of the sci/re facias thereon.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-9\" pgmap=\"384\">\u201c Fourth. There is no evidence in this case tending to show the death of James Allison, or the substitution of an administrator as a party defendant in the original suit in which said scire facias issued.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-10\" pgmap=\"384\">\u201c Fifth. There is no evidence in this case tending to show that the judgment alleged in the said scire facias was recovered in the case in which the said recognizance was entered into.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-11\" pgmap=\"384\">\u201c Sixth. The recognizance offered in evidence in this case is conditioned to pay whatever judgment might be rendered against James Allison only, while the judgment alleged in the scire facias is against Henry A.

Allison appeared in open court and entered into a recognizance, as provided in section 15 of the Attachment act, with appellant as surety. The attachment was thereupon dissolved, and the proceeding against the garnishee set aside. Before judgment, Allison died ; suggestion of his death having been made, his administrator was made party defendant and the case proceeded to judgment. That judgment not having been paid within ninety (90) days after its entry, as conditioned in the recognizance, the present writ of scire facias was sued out against the surety. The question presented by the record is, whether the failure to pay the judgment against the personal representative of Allison was a breach of the condition of the recognizance.</p> <p id=\"b388-4\" pgmap=\"388(221) 389(17)\">The recognizance in this case was in substantial compliance with the statute, the purpose of which is to enable the defendant to obtain control of the property attached, or in the hands of garnishees, upon giving security for' the payment of the judgment to be rendered in the cause in which the recognizance is given. Upon giving the bond or recognizance the case proceeds in personam j the judgment entered is a personal judgment, the recognizance standing as security for its payment. Hill v. Harding, 93 Ill. 77. The language of the statute is, that the recognizance shall be \u201c conditioned that the defendant will pay the plaintiff the amount of the judgment and costs, which may be rendered against him in. that suit on a final trial, within ninety days after such judgment shall be rendered.\u201d And the recognizance. here was conditioned for the payment \u201c of whatever judgment may be entered herein against said defendant upon a final trial hereof,\u201d etc. At the time of entering into this recognizance, section 11, chapter 1 of the Revised Statutes provided, that upon the death of a sole defendant the action should not on that account abate, in cases where the cause of action would survive, etc.; but upon suggestion of the death upon the record, summons might issue against his administrator and the cause \u201c proceed as if it had been originally commenced against him.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b389-5\" pgmap=\"389\">The giving of the recognizance is a right accorded by law to the defendant, which the plaintiff must accept, if the right is properly exercised. Its effect is to release the property attached, and to discharge the garnishee from liability for property of the attachment debtor in his hands. To effect this purpose appellant voluntarily joined with the attachment debtor, and took upon himself the obligation prescribed by the statute, to pay whatever judgment might be rendered in that action. He was bound to know, that upon the death of Allison, the suit would not abate, but might proceed to final judgment against his personal representative. The statute provides that the defendant may enter into a recognizance to secure the judgment that may be rendered \u201cagainst him\u201d in that suit. The law being that, upon the death of Allison, the suit might proceed against the administrator, it must be held that the undertaking of appellant was made in contemplation thereof, and was to stand as security for the judgment rendered against the defendant \u201cin that suit, on final trial.\u201d Any other construction of the statute would not only be inconsistent with the language employed, but would lead to the most absurd and unjust results. In contemplation of law, the judgment against his personal representative in the same proceeding is a judgment \u201cagainst him within the meaning of the language, employed. If this be not so, the legislature must have intended to deprive the plaintiff of the security afforded by the service of his attachment, in all cases where the defendant dies before the entry of final judgment. Such a construction is not consistent with the language employed, or the spirit and purpose of the act. Churchill v. Abraham, 22 Ill. 455; Brown v. Gorton, 31 id. 416.</p> <p id=\"b389-6\" pgmap=\"389(35) 390(146)\">It may be conceded, without at all affecting the question here involved, that a surety may stand upon the very terms of his contract, and if he does not assent to its variation, and a change is made affecting his liability, he can not be bound thereby. This case is clearly distinguishable from those where a common law or voluntary bond is executed; and from those also, where there has been some change in the liability of the surety by the act of the parties seeking to enforce it, as in Tucker v. White, 5 Allen, 322; Richard v. Stover, 114 Mass. 101; and other similar cases cited by counsel for appellant. The liability of appellant, as surety, was in no wise increased or changed, because by operation of law the action survived against the personal representative. And we hold that the effect of appellant\u2019s undertaking was to pay the judgment recovered \u201c in that suit \u201d in the usual course of law. Bean v. Parker, 17 Mass. 602; Quillion v. Arnold, 12 Nev. 234; Poole v. Dyer, 123 Mass. 363.</p> <p id=\"b390-5\" pgmap=\"390\">In the latter case the goods of Ellen and John Dyer had been attached at the suit of Poole. A bond was given to pay the judgment \u201cin such action \u201d and the attachment dissolved. The plaintiff discontinued as to Ellen Dyer and took judgment against John Dyer only. It was held that the non-payment of this judgment was a breach of the condition of the bond. There, although the parties to the action were changed by the voluntary action of the plaintiff, the court said : \u201c The result, so far as the surety is concerned, is the same, whether the plaintiff discontinues against one defendant, or fails to recover against him upon the trial. Ho change is made in the nature of the claim which is the subject of the suit, and no greater and different liability is cast upon the surety by the discontinuance.\u201d We need not pursue the discussion farther. The obligation being statutory, must be construed so as to give effect to the purpose and intent of the statute.</p> <p id=\"b390-6\" pgmap=\"390\">Other errors are assigned which we have carefully examined, and find either that they do not arise upon the record in this court, or are not of sufficient merit to warrant discussion.</p> <p id=\"b390-7\" pgmap=\"390\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b390-8\" pgmap=\"390\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
