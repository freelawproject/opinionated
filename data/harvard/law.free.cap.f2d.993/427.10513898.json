Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-22\">In December 1990, Bell, a soldier stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, met his future wife, Veronica Jean, a nurse also stationed at Fort Hood. The two married in March 1991, and thereafter lived together in officer housing on the base. The previous October Mrs. Bell had given birth to a baby girl. Immediately following her birth the baby suffered episodes of constipation. From time to time, in response to such episodes, Mrs. Bell used a technique called \u201cdigital extraction\u201d to induce a bowel movement. Digital extraction involved insertion of a suppository or small piece of soap just inside the baby\u2019s anus, using the small finger. By April 1991, the baby\u2019s constipation problem had substantially diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-23\">In June 1991 Mrs. Bell was assigned to the evening shift at the base hospital, working from 2:45 p.m. to 11 p.m. When working she usually left her baby at a child care center or with a friend. On June 24, 1991, however, she left the child in her husband\u2019s care. Before she left for work that day the baby had a normal bowel movement. The child had no bruises or other abnormal marks on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>her body.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following morning the baby behaved strangely, struggling and screaming when her mother attempted to move her legs to change her diaper. Mrs. Bell noticed for the first time swelling and bruising on the baby\u2019s bottom and thighs and took her to the hospital. Examining physicians concluded that sexual abuse had caused the baby\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In response to an initial inquiry by authorities Bell denied any knowledge of the baby\u2019s injuries or their origin. Three days later, in a second interview Bell stated that the baby\u2019s injuries resulted from an attempt at digital extraction in response to an episode of constipation. At the time of his arrest in March 1992, Bell added to this explanation the inadvertent placement of keys and a metal barbell pin on the baby\u2019s car seat while the infant was in his custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The grand jury indicted Bell for aggravated sexual abuse of a child under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) and intentionally causing bodily injury to a child under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 and Tex.Penal Code \u00a7 22.04(a)(4). Bell unsuccessfully moved for judgment of acquittal after the government\u2019s case-in-chief and again at the close of evidence. The jury found Bell guilty on both counts, and the trial court sentenced him to concurrent 120- and 135-month terms of imprisonment, concurrent five-year supervised release terms, and the statutory assessments. Bell timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Bell initially challenges the government\u2019s proof that the offense in this ease occurred within the \u201cspecial maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13, 2241(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While this jurisdictional element is essential in prosecutions under section 13 and section 2241(c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the government need prove it only by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bell concedes that any offense in the instant case took place within the boundaries of Fort Hood, but argues that the federal government does not exercise \u201cexclusive or concurrent jurisdiction,\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7(3), over all property on every military base. Thus, Bell asserts that the government had to demonstrate its special jurisdiction over the housing complex in which this crime took place.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We, however, have repeatedly recognized crimes committed within the confines of federal military reservations as falling within the special territorial jurisdiction of the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This assignment is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">Bell next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions. Mindful that weight and credibility assessments lie within the exclusive province of the jury,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in considering this claim we must view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences most favorable to the verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the evidence so viewed would permit a rational jury to find all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, we must affirm the conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The evidence need not exclude all hypotheses of innocence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order to convict Bell under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c), the government had to prove that he knowingly engaged in a sexual act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> with a person who had not yet attained the age of 12 years. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 and Tex.Penal Code \u00a7 22.04(a)(4), the government must demonstrate that the defendant \u201cintentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence ... eause[d] to a [person 14 years of age or younger] ... bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The two physicians who examined the infant on June 25, 1991 testified that her injuries could have resulted only from sexual abuse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Other government evidence corroborated that testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although Bell presented expert testimony that the baby\u2019s injuries could have resulted from causes other than sexual abuse, including an unskilled attempt at digital extraction, and testified to such an event, the jury was entitled to discredit that evidence. The record amply supports inferences that Bell sexually abused and intentionally caused bodily injury to the baby. The evidence sufficiently supports the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Bell finally claims that the district court erroneously sentenced him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 on the bodily injury count. In applying section 2A2.2, the district court relied on a finding that Bell injured his victim with intent to commit another felony\u2014 the sexual assault.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Relying on his claim that insufficient evidence supported the aggravated sexual assault conviction, Bell asserts that the district court should have sentenced him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.3 on the second count. Because we find Bell\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) fully supported by the record, this assignment of error necessarily founders.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">The convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">. Bell does not dispute that he had sole custody of the baby during his wife\u2019s absence that day, except for a brief period after which he concedes that she had no apparent injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">.

Bell claims that because they testified only to knowledge gained from third persons and maps of untested accuracy, the two witnesses presented by the government on this issue could not give competent testimony regarding jurisdiction. In this connection, Bell suggests that the government's failure to produce maps or other documentation in response to a general motion for discovery and inspection prevented him from properly investigating the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b543-16\">. <em>United States v.

Bell suggests that due to inconsistencies regarding the positioning and direction of bruises on the baby\u2019s body, testimony by the government's expert witnesses cannot support a conviction. We disagree. Minor divergence between the testimony of Dr. Hines and that of Dr. Noel, while it might have affected the weight accorded by the jury to the government\u2019s case, did not render their statements \u201cfacially insubstantial or incredible\u201d so as to fall short of constitutional sufficiency requirements. <em>See United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1458 (5th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 2354, 124 L.Ed.2d 262 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b544-19\">. We note, among other things, testimony that when Veronica Bell indicated intent to change the baby after her June 24 shift, Bell, in contrast to his usual aversion to changing diapers, indicated that he already had done so. Testimony also reflected that he voluntarily did so again on the morning of June 25, just before Mrs. Bell discovered the baby\u2019s injuries. We further note the contrast between testimony that Bell found the digital extraction technique disgusting, refusing even to watch his wife perform it, and his later claim that the baby\u2019s injuries resulted from his attempt at the procedure. Finally, inconsistent statements which Bell made to investigating authorities regarding the source of the baby\u2019s injuries supports the inference of guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b544-20\">. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, cmt. 1 (guideline applicable to assault involving intent to commit another felony).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
