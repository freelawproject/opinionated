Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">On March 4, 1992, authorities arrested Aguirre in possession of approximately eight ounces of heroin. He was indicted for possession of in excess of 100 grams of heroin \u2022with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Invoking 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, the government supplemented the indictment with an enhancement information, alleging a 1976 Texas heroin distribution conviction which became final in 1985. Aguirre moved to quash the information, contending that the state obtained the earlier conviction in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and it therefore could not serve as the basis for sentence enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aguirre entered a guilty plea under an agreement in which he reserved his right to challenge the enhancement. The guilty plea was accepted and Aguirre was sentenced to .prison for 120 months plus a term of supervised release. He timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-17\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\">On appeal Aguirre renews his arguments that the district court erred in refusing to quash the enhancement information and, notwithstanding <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a <em>Batson </em>violation at the 1976 trial, relying on the conviction there obtained in imposing an enhanced sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He acknowledges that, due to its nonretroactivity, <em>Batson </em>could afford him no relief from his 1985 conviction in federal habeas corpus proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Burgett v. Texas,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> Baldasar v. Illinois,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Bourgeois v. </em>Whitley,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the proposition that unconstitutionally-obtained convictions cannot support sentence enhancements, Aguirre urges, however, that we must deny any prospective effect to his Texas eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>viction. Although initially facially appealing, we find this argument ultimately unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In <em>Burgett, </em>the Supreme Court considered a direct appeal from a murder conviction where, in support of enhanced sentencing, the state had placed before jurors evidence of a prior uncounseled conviction. Noting the fully retroactive effect of <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court found Burgett\u2019s pri- or conviction presumptively invalid and held that the state could not use such a conviction either to support guilt or to enhance punishment in a subsequent prosecution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Later cases adhering to Burgett prohibit reliance upon <em>Gideon </em>-violating convictions at sentencing,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and use of such convictions at trial to impeach the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Bourgeois, </em>we recognized that the <em>Burgett </em>principle extends to later use of convictions invalid on different grounds and found invalid a sentencing proceeding in which the trial court considered a conviction by a nonunanimous six-member jury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Subsequent authority, however, suggests that <em>Burgett, </em>its progeny, and <em>Bourgeois </em>are not dispositive of the instant case. In <em>Lewis v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court found no sixth amendment impediment to a firearms possession conviction under 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> predicated upon a prior <em>Gideon </em>-tainted felony conviction. The Court there noted that it had <em>not </em>endorsed an absolute prohibition on use of uncounseled convictions,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> distinguishing <em>Burgett, Tucker, </em>and <em>Loper, </em>noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">[i]n each of those cases, this Court found that the subsequent conviction or sentence violated the Sixth Amendment because it depended upon the reliability of a past uncounseled conviction. The federal gun laws, however, focus not on reliability, but on the mere fact of conviction, or even indictment, in order to keep firearms away from potentially dangerous persons.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-15\"><em>Lewis </em>suggests the close relationship between the right to counsel and the reliability of criminal proceedings as the driving force of the <em>Burgett </em>line of cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Obviously, convictions obtained through nonunanimous six-member jury verdicts \u2014 at issue in Bourgeois \u2014 raise similar concerns. <em>Batson </em>violations, however, do not. Racially motivated peremptory strikes at best marginally implicate the reliability of fact-finding in criminal trials.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Batson protects against racially motivated peremptory strikes principally because they \u201c \u2018cast[ ] doubt on the integrity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the judicial process\u2019 ... and place[ ] the fairness of a criminal proceeding in doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Additionally, <em>post hoc </em>identification of <em>Bat-son </em>error presents difficulties we do not find in either the <em>Burgett </em>or <em>Bourgeois </em>contexts. By contrast to the minimal inquiry required to determine whether a defendant had or waived counsel in prior proceedings, or whether a prior conviction resulted from a unanimous jury verdict,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcN\">the finding of intentional discrimination in use of peremptory challenges is a finding of fact that \u201clargely will turn on evaluation of credibility.\u201d Years after trial, the prosecutor cannot adequately reconstruct his reasons for striking a venireman. Nor can the judge recall whether he believed a potential juror\u2019s statement that any alleged biases would not prevent him from being a fair and impartial juror.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">Thus, the inquiry into possible <em>Batson </em>violations tainting a prior conviction \u2014 particularly in a case such as this one, involving 17-year-old peremptory strikes \u2014 offers little potential for a meaningful result.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Racially motivated use of peremptory strikes only marginally implicates the reliability concerns underlying the <em>Burgett </em>line of cases. Further, unlike <em>Burgett, </em>the instant case does not involve enhancement on the basis of a prior conviction presently subject to collateral attack.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Finally, the difficulty inherent in after-the-fact identification of <em>Batson </em>violations counsels strongly against requiring inquiry into such error in <em>pre-Bat-son </em>convictions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We conclude and hold that <em>pre-Batson </em>convictions, although potentially faulted by <em>Batson </em>-violating use of peremptory strikes, may properly support sentence enhancement in subsequent prosecutions.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In view of this holding, Aguirre\u2019s remaining contentions are mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">The sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-12\">. 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\">.
