The bill denied the right of the Railroad company to divert the course of the Beaver Dam stream,- or to fill up any portion of the mill-race, and charged that it was the duty of the company to build bridges, culverts, Ac., for the uninterrupted passage of all streams which crossed the line of their road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The bill concluded with a prayer for an injunction commanding the company, &amp;c., to cease from diverting or altering the water of the \u201c Beaver Dam \u201d branch from its present bed or course through the complainant\u2019s lands, and also to desist from any attempt to shut up or destroy the mill-race running through his land at the point where the said mill-race crossed or intersected the line of the railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">Upon this bill the Court granted an injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">On the 28th day of April, 1869, the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Company filed their answer, admitting that they were engaged in constructing their road through the land of the complainant, and averred that being unable to agree with him for the purchase, or use, or occupation of the land wanted for the construction of their road and the works of the same, they caused a warrant to be issued; that under this warrant the jury valued and condemned certain real estate and assessed the damages which the complainant would sustain by the use and occupation aforesaid, at \u00a75,225; that the inquisition was confirmed, and the damages had been paid to the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">The defendants further admitted that in the construction and building of the road, they had changed the \u201cBeaver Dam\u201d stream or straightened the same, but they averred that in making the change they had not carried the stream outside of the limits of the land condemned, and that the proposed change was necessary for the proper construction of the road, and that under their charter and the said inquisition they had the right to make such change.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">The answer denied that the proposed change would deprive the complainant of water for the use of his stock; and further that there w'as a mill-seat and mill-race to which the complainant could set up any claim, and that in point of fact they were depriving the complainant of the use of a race or mill-seat by so changing the course of the stream.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">The defendant further charged that the sum of \u00a75,200 awarded as damages, covered all damages which the eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>plainant would sustain by the construction of the .road and works thereof; that by the reception of the damages he was estopped from claiming that the straightening of the stream in the proper and necessaiy construction of the road was an irreparable damage; and further that he had been compensated for whatever damage might be sustained by the construction of the road in a proper and necessary manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">A motion was made after filing the answer to dissolve the injunction.

Berry, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-11\">The appellee is as much entitled to the water of the \u201c Beaver Dam \u201d stream, as to the -land through which it runs, or as he would be to wood, stone, or any other material that might be thereon, and the appellant had no right to divert the stream outside of the land condemned. <em>Act of </em>1853, <em>ch. </em>194; <em>Greenleaf Cruise Dig., </em>37; <em>William\u2019s Real Property, </em>12; <em>Den vs. Wright, et al., </em>1 <em>Peters\u2019 C.

The jury condemned <em>that extent of land alone, </em>and awarded the sum of $5,225 for the damage sustained by the appellee, by the use and occupation <em>of said strip of land for construction. </em>This is the <em>limit </em>of the <em>land condemned, </em>and for <em>which alone damages toare awarded.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">Whilst the appellant may have the right to change the course of a stream within the limits of a grant or land condemned, it must be so exercised as not to be detrimental to the rights of proprietors of the land, above or below the point at which the proposed change is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">Courts of Chancery are the only tribunals vested with jurisdiction to restrain parties from altering, changing, or obstructing the course of waters flowing through the lands of others, as such changes or obstructions are an injury and damage to the freehold, which could not be adequately redressed in a Court of law. <em>White vs. Flannigan, </em>1 <em>Md., </em>539; <em>Lamborn vs. Covington Co., </em>2 <em>Md.

Dec., </em>499.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">There is no proof that tiie damages sustained by the appellee, in thus changing the course of said stream, were considered by the jury in awarding damages for the right of way through the lands of the appellee; nor is there any sufficient proof that the jury which made the condemnation as a whole, knew at <em>the </em>time of making up their verdict, that the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>posed change in said stream was contemplated or intended to be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">The receipt by the appellee of the damages awarded by the jury, is no estoppel to,the prosecution of this suit on his part, as the damages awarded by the jury were estimated by them solely for the sixty-six feet of land condemned by them for the construction of the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-6\">Even should the proposed change of said stream benefit the .appellee as claimed by the appellant, (but which is denied by the appellee,) it is not a matter for the consideration of this Court; the only question for this .Court to consider is, <em>has the appellant the right under its grant in this case of sixty-six feet, to go beyond the limits of its grant to make such change, </em>and thereby divert the water from the freehold of the appellee?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b102-7\">Miller, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AOu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Since the passage of the decree from which this appeal is taken, the ease of <em>Beaver vs. The Western Maryland Railroad Company </em>has been decided by this Court. That was a case where Beaver brought an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit, </em>against the Railroad Company for entering upon his land, and by. the construction of their road, diverting a stream of water called the ^Patapsco Falls\u201d from its ancient course into a new channel, dug for that purpose, whereby the stream was cut off from a large part of his farm through which it used to flow, so that he could no longer water his stock and cattle therefrom, and us\u2019e it for the purposes of his farm as he had been accustomed to do. The company relied upon the inquisition (which had been duly confirmed and the assessed damages paid) and the fact that the attention of the jury of inquest was directed to the intended diversion of the stream, and that the same was within the lines of the land condemned, as a bar to any recovery for damages resulting from such diversion: The inquisition there does not materially differ from that in the present case. Instead of describing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the land condemned precisely in the same mode as the one before us, it did so chiefly by reference to lines on a plat filed with, and made part of the inquisition, \u201c which lines,\u201d as it states, \u201c fully describe the piece or parcel of <em>land </em>required by the said Western Maryland Railroad Company\u201d for the construction thereon of the <em>bed </em>of their road, but in both it is the described <em>land </em>that is condemned, and there is nothing on the face of either amounting to an <em>express grant </em>of the right to divert the stream. In that case, conflicting oral testimony of many witnesses on both sides was offered upon the question whether the attention of the jury of inquest, was called to the intended diversion, as well as whether they actually took it into consideration in estimating the damages they awarded. At the instance of the defendant the Court below instructed the jury that if they should find from the evidence, that the <em>attention </em>of the jurors who found the inquisition <em>was called </em>to the intended diversion of the stream in the construction of the railroad, and should also find that the road was constructed, and the new channel for the diversion of the stream was dug, in and upon the land within the lines of the land condemned by the inquisition, then their verdict <em>must be for the defendant, </em>and in reference to this instruction this Court said: \u201c Wc can discover no objection to this prayer, and the only objection that is made to it in the appellant\u2019s brief, is that it should have required the jury to find that the jury of inquest <em>estimated, </em>in the damages allowed by it, the injury to the appellant by reason of the intended diversion of the water in the Patapsco Falls. The prayer did require the jury to find that the <em>attention </em>of the jury of inquest was directed to that diversion, and the <em>legad presumption is that they estimated in their inquisition the damages to result from such diversion. Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Co. vs. Grove, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>404.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">That case decides <em>first, </em>that under a charter, similar in this respect to that of the appellant, conferring the power to acquire by condemnation land <em>for the </em>construction of its road, the company has the right to divert, if they see fit to do so, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>stream of water flowing across the line of their road: <em>secondly, </em>that this right does not depend upon an express grant to be made and specified in the inquisition itself, but may be acquired by condemnation of the land duly confirmed, and payment or tender of the damages awarded, and proof <em>de hors </em>the inquisition that the attention of the jury of inquest was directed to the intended diversion at the time of taking, and before they signed the same: and <em>thirdly, </em>that if the attention of the jury was thus directed to such diversion, and the same was made within the lines of the land condemned for the construction of the road, the owner of the land through which the road passes has no remedy, either at law or in equity, for any injury that may result therefrom.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b104-8\">(Decided 15th February, 1871.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The inquisition in the present case was regularly confirmed, and the damages thereby awarded have been paid to the appellee. The proof in the record, which -we have examined with care, establishes to our satisfaction the fact that the attention of the jury was directed to the proposed diversion of the stream called \u201cBeaver Dam Branch,\u201d (the making of which the injunction restrains,) from its old channel through the lands of the complainant, at the time of taking and before they signed their inquisition, and also that such diversion is confined within the limits of the land condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The decree appealed from must be reversed, the injunction dissolved and the bill of complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed and bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
