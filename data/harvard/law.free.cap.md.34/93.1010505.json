The defendant pleaded the Statute of Limitations. The plaintiffs replied that by virtue of the Acts of 1861, ch. 17, and 1862, ch. 249, known as the stay laws, they were precluded from having an execution on their judgment, from the 10th of May, 1861, to the 1st of November, 1862; and that from the date of the judgment to the issuing of the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>a period of twelve years liad not elapsed during which it was lawful and proper for them to have had execution on said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">To this replication the defendant demurred.

That is to sajq in the case of a judgment, that the proper legal result of judgment, viz: execution, should have been, upon proper application, procurable during such period. <em>Evans\u2019 Practice, </em>164, <em>(2d Ed.,) </em>203; <em>Salisbury vs. Black, </em>6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>296; <em>Hall vs. Cresswell, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>36; <em>Keefer vs. Zimmerman\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, </em>22 <em>Md., </em>274.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">In the case of a judgment, the limitation runs not from the date, but from the time when the plaintiff is entitled to judicial process, <em>i. e., </em>execution to enforce it.

And further, the stay law not only thus rendered the proceeding practically ineffectual, even <em>iffiat executio </em>could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>have been entered, in the face of the statute, but the statute itself could have been pleaded as an effectual bar to the writ, which writ expressly calls on the defendant to show caused why execution should not issue, and the judgment on which is not that of an ordinary recovery \u201c <em>quod recuperet,\u201d </em>but an award of execution <em>\u201cfiat executio.\u201d Campbell vs. Booth, </em>8 <em>Md., </em>107, <em>and </em>15 <em>Md., </em>569; 8 <em>Bacon\u2019s Abridgt, title Scire facias, </em>598; Foster\u2019s <em>Scire facias, </em>73 <em>Law Library, </em>11 <em>to </em>16.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-5\"><em>Arthur W.

The whole object of the Legislature was to protect the property of the debtor from actual seizure and sale, at a time when the condition of affairs was such that forced sales would probably have involved ruinous sacrifices. Suits and actions, and indeed all judicial proceedings wont on as before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">In the condition in which the judgment in question was at the time of the enactment of the stay law in 1861, that Act had no practical operation upon it at all. More than three years having elapsed since the date of the judgment, without any measures to keep it alive, it was not then fitted for execution. Before they could obtain execution, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to revive it by debt or <em>scire facias. </em>Had tllhy tlietolpon so revived it, wliicli tiiere was nothing then to prevent, the stay law would have operated upon the new judgment, and suspended execution of it for the prescribed term. They did nothing, however. The judgment remained as it was, until the statutory period of twelve years expired, and the bar created by the Code, Art. 57, sec. 3, became complete.

And there was nothing in the nature of such a stay law to operate an exception by necessary <em>implication.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">Every creditor \"has a <em>common law right to judgment, </em>and only the express words of a statute will suffice to exclude him from that right.\u201d <em>Sir Fitzroy Kelly, C.

Huston vs. Ditto, </em>20 Md., 328.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-7\">Robinson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">A <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the 24th February, 1868, to revive a judgment recovered by the plaintiffs on the 29th June, 1855, to which the defendant pleaded the <em>Statute </em>of Limitations, and the question is whether the statute was suspended as against this judgment during the stay of execution and sale, prescribed by the Acts of 1861, ch. 17, and 1862, ch. 249, known as the <em>stay </em>laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">That the Legislature did not intend to interfere with the statutory limitations in regard to judgments we think quite clear, for' although the above Acts of Assembly expressly declare that the stay thereby prescribed, shall not be computed as part of the three years within which execution may issue, we find no such provision or exemption in regard to the judgment itself. Moreover, it is well known that these laws were passed soon after the commencement of the late war, and the purpose, <em>the sole purpose, </em>was to protect the property of the debtor from seizure and sale, at a time when the condition of affairs was such that <em>forced sales </em>would have proved ruinous to the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>But it was insisted that the operation of these laws deprived the plaintiff of the effectual prosecution of his remedy by <em>scire facias, </em>and that the suspension of the Statute followed as a necessary consequence upon this suspension of the remedy. Now, it is true, the term cause of action implies the right of action, and hence certain exceptions, have been engrafted upon the Statute, not perhaps within its letter, as for instance, whore there is no person capable of suing or being sued, or when a temporary incapacity to sue grows out of some particular provision of a statute. <em>Trecothick vs. Austin, 4 Mason\u2019s Cir. Ct. Rep., </em>16; <em>Dowell vs. Weber, </em>2 <em>Smedes &amp; Mars., </em>452; <em>Tarver vs. Cowart, </em>5 <em>Ga., </em>66; <em>Murray vs. The East India Co., 5 Barn, </em>&amp; <em>Ald., </em>204. To permit the Statute to run in such cases, where no <em>laches </em>can be imputed to the parties, and where it is impossible, by suit or otherwise, to prevent its operation, would not only be extremely unjust, but, in the language of the authorities, contrary to the conclusions of reason that the framers of the Statute so intended. The exceptions, therefore, in such cases, are put upon the express ground that the parties are deprived of all remedy whereby the cause of action may be kept alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Now, if the stay laws, in addition to the stay of execution and sale, had provided that no action by <em>scire facias </em>or otherwise, should be brought upon the judgment during the stay, it might be contended that the time during which such temporary disability continued, should be excluded from the computation. But we are at a loss to understand why a <em>stay </em>of <em>execution </em>is to be considered as denying to the plaintiff the right to bring an action upon the judgment either by debt or <em>scire facias. </em>To the latter the defendant has the right to plead, and although generally termed a judicial writ, it is classed and recognized by all the authorities as an action. 2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Practice, </em>1090; <em>Evan\u2019s Practice. </em>The object of a <em>scire facias, </em>we admit, is to obtain a judgment capable of being enforced, but subject, nevertheless, to such restraints and dealings as the law itself may impose. It was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>supposed that the stay laws of 1861 and 1862 interfered with the right of action. Suits were brought as before, although the judgment, when rendered, ivas subject to the stay therein prescribed, and it would bo unreasonable to suppose the Legislature intended to put a specialty creditor upon an inferior footing to that enjoyed by a simple contract creditor. If, then, the plaintiffs had the right to keep their judgment alive by <em>scire facias </em>during the stay of execution, there is no reason why it should be exempted from the operation' of the statutory law of twelve years.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b114-8\">(Decided 16th February, 1871.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The question as to whether the Statute begins to run from the date of the judgment or the expiration of the stay, can have no practical bearing upon this case, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to consider it. Here more than three years had elapsed from the date of the judgment, when the stay laws were passed, and more than twelve years from the time when execution could issue thereon, before the <em>scire facias </em>was sued out.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">. For these reasons, we are of opinion that the judgment ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
