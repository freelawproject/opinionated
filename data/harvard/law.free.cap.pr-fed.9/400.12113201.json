A demurrer is interposed setting up that a mother cannot recover damages for tbe death of a minor illegitimate son under tbe laws of Porto Pico.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> There is no question that there could not be a recovery if tbe suit is brought under \u00a7 60 of tbe Code of Civil Procedure. Diaz v. Porto Pico P. Light, &amp; P. Co. 21 P. P. P. 78. Tbe Code of Civil Procedure was taken from common-law sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Tbe plaintiff, however, contends that tbis suit is not brought under tbe Code of Civil Procedure, but under \u00a7 1803 of tbe Civil Code, which is tbe same as \u00a7 1902 of tbe Spanish Civil Code, and contends that such a suit is authorized under tbe jurisprudence of Spain. Tbe following cases are recited in support of tbis contention:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Num. 14. Supreme Court. \u2014 June 12, 1900. Indemniza-ci\u00f3n de Da\u00f1os y Perjuicios. \u2014 Tbis is a case in which Do\u00f1a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Mar\u00eda Silva Leon brought suit against the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de los Ferrocarriles Andaluces, claiming damages for the death of Ealbinoi Tovia Sevilla, a bugler of Carabineers, the husband of the said Do\u00f1a Maria Silva Leon.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The plaintiff instituted both the criminal and the civil action. In the first there were prosecuted Jose Pascual Fares, Isabel Sanchez Calle, and Ramon Rosello Morales. After the\" trial the court acquitted Isabel Sanchez Calle, and sentenced Jose Pascual Fares and Ramon Rosello to imprisonment for two months and one day, and to the payment jointly and severally to Do\u00f1a Maria Silva, or her heirs, as indemnity for losses, the sum of 2,000 pesetas, and in case that the defendants should be insolvent, payment should be exacted from the Empresa de los Ferrocarriles Andaluces. Judgment reversed and the defendants absolved. Appeal denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">90 Jur. Civ. p. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Judgment No. 18. July 6, 1901. Indemnizaci\u00f3n de Da\u00f1oa y Perjuicios. \u2014 This is a case in .which Do\u00f1a Teresa Lezcano Lucas, in representation of her daughter Manuela Lucas, and Do\u00f1a Francisca and Do\u00f1a Victoriana Lezcano, represented by their respective husbands, brought suit .against the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de los Ferrocarriles de Madrid a Zaragoza y a Alicante, for the death of their father. This action did not prosper in either court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">92 Jur. Civ. p. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Num. 15. Judgment of Jan. 15, 1902. \u2014 This is a suit brought by Do\u00f1a Petra Melero y Guerra against the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de los Caminos de Hierro del Norte de Espa\u00f1a for the death of Don Anselmo de la Rosa, son of the plaintiff, although emancipated from her, being of full age. Plaintiff claimed 90,000 pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>setas, and obtained judgment for 1,462 pesetas, 50 cents. 'Appeal denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">93 Jur. Civ. p. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Num. 103. Judgment of June 16, 1905. \u2014 This is a case in which Don Mariano Garcia Gamo filed a suit against the Com-pa\u00f1\u00eda Madrile\u00f1a de Alumbrado y Calefacci\u00f3n por Gas for the death of his legitimate son Andres Garcia Robledillo, decided in favor of the Gas. Co. Appeal denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">101 Jur. Civ. p. 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">No. 134. December 14, 1894. \u2014 In this case Do\u00f1a Juana Alonso Celada, as legal representative of her minor son Teo-doro Santa Maria Alonso, brought suit against Don Manuel Chacon and Don Candido Lara y Ortal for the death of her husband while hanging certain flags. Judgment in favor of the heirs of Don Eulogio Santa Maria for 5000 pesetas. Appeal denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">76 Jur. Civ. p. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">None of these, however, seems to be the case of a suit by the parent of an illegitimate child. The exact point in question, therefore, does not seem to have been decided. The extent to which these decisions go is that the Spanish statute corresponding to the Porto Pico \u00a7 1803 permits suit by a parent for the unlawful death of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The argument is that this right of suit grows out of the right of support, as under \u00a7 213 of the Civil Code of Porto Pico, and that therefore the mother of an illegitimate child because she is entitled to support by the child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, has this right. This can only be true under the Diaz Case provided there are two systems of suits recognized in Porto Rico, one by the parent of a legitimate child under \u00a7 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the other by the parent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>a'legitimate or of an illegitimate child under \u00a7 1803 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Such a construction cannot be sustained. The jurisprudence of Porto Eico is a unit. Some elements are derived from the common law and some from the civil law, but together they make up one system, and it cannot be held, unless required by the clear letter of the law, that there are two antagonistic systems of right in the same matter. Consistency requires that if there was a right of suit by a parent under \u00a7 1803 (Spanish \u00a7 1902), of the Civil Code for the death of a child, this subject must now be regarded as falling entirely under \u00a7 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which was adopted at a later date. In other words, from the law of negligence under \u00a7 1803, if it is held to be as broad in Porto Eico as in Spain, there was carved out the subject of recovery for the death of children, and this was limited to legitimate children.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">It follows, therefore, that the demurrer is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
