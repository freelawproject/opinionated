By consent, however, the case was taken from the jury and the matter submitted to the court upon the evidence taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">That showed that during 1915 one Jos\u00e9 Fernandez, father of the alleged bankrupt, purchased and began operating a store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>at Faguabo. After awhile Fernandez fell in bad health, and had his son, Miguel Fernandez, come and act as clerk. On May 2, 1916, he executed a full power of attorney to Miguel, and shortly afterwards left for Spain for the benefit of his health. There was no change in the form of the business, and Miguel continued it in the name and as the representative of his father, Jos\u00e9 Fernandez. Jos\u00e9 Fernandez died in Spain on August 19, 1916. Meanwhile, no one in Porto Rico knew this fact. The business did not prosper, and on September 10 E. Bird Arias attached it, and the same thing was done on the 23d \u25a0 by the Fajardo Sugar Growers\u2019 Association. These accounts and all others were shown by evidence to have been contracted largely by Miguel, in the name and as a part of the current business of Jos\u00e9 Fernandez. The store was closed by the attachment of September 23. About that time Miguel learned of the death of his father. On October 19, as above stated, the petitioners filed their petition in this court against Miguel Fernandez, seeking to have him declared a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> It is sought to have Miguel Fernandez subjected upon the ground that the debts were contracted by him. It is not altogether clear that a sufficient amount in value was contracted by Miguel, but, at. all events, if this were so, it is clearly enough shown by all the evidence that the debts were so contracted as a part of the going business of Jos\u00e9 Fernandez. Some of the petitioners spoke of a partnership, or of Miguel succeeding to the business, but the evidence does not bear out either contention. The origin of these accounts and all others was the business carried on by Jos\u00e9 Fernandez himself. Miguel held the power of attorney of his father, and whatever orders he gave were expressly or impliedly in the name of his' father, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>business accounts were continued in the name of Jos\u00e9 Fernandez. The inference seems to be that Miguel was only a wage earner, carrying on the business of his father for the father\u2019s benefit, in anticipation of his return. There seems to be no doubt that, if Jos\u00e9 Fernandez had returned, the creditors herein would have looked to him and him only for payment of their debts. The results of the agency of Miguel were not, in point of law, ended with the death of his father. Section 1640 of the Civil Code provides that \u201cwhat has been done by the agent, when he was not aware of the death of the principal, . , . shall be valid and of effect with regard to third persons who may have contracted' with the agent in good faith.\u201d There seems to be no reason for finding that Miguel had any \u201cintervention,\u201d as it is commonly expressed in Porto Pico, except on behalf of his father, Jos\u00e9 Fernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> But it is contended that, as Jos\u00e9 Fernandez did not return, and as he died and his son carried on the business, the son should be held responsible for the debts which he had himself contracted. It is true that \u201cagency is terminated , . . by death, interdiction, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the principal. . . .\u201d Civ. Code, \u00a7 1634. Section 969 of the Civil Code provides that \u201cthrough an acceptance, pure and simple, or without benefit of inventory, the heir shall be liable for all the charges on the estate, not only with the property of the same, but also with his own.\u201d The special proceedings, corresponding to probate proceedings in the states, contemplate that if an heir goes into possession without more he becomes responsible for the debts of the decedent. Such facts, however, are not triable in the Federal court in bankruptcy. Valid proceedings cannot be begun against the estate of a deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>person, but only against the person and property of the living. Re Hicks, 107 Fed. 910. It would not he good practice for this court to entertain probate proceedings indirectly when it has not the power to do so directly. Aran v. Fritze, 3 Porto Rico Fed. Rep. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The facts seem to show that, while Miguel was in charge of the business of his father, it was only as a representative, .and that within the purview of the Bankruptcy Act he was a wage earner, and, so far as appears, did not owe debts to the .amount of $1,000. C. C. Taft Co. v. Century Sav. Bank, 72 C. C. A. 671, 141 Fed. 369. This exemption applies to those who are dependent for a living upon the result of their individual effort, without the aid of property or capital. First Nat. Bank v. Barnum, 160 Fed. 245. There is nothing in the evidence to show that Miguel had any interest in the business, or had succeeded his father, or had any property of his own invested. He seems to have been working for wages before he came to help his father, and has been working for wages since. The burden of showing the contrary is on the petitioning creditors. Re Burgin, 173 Fed. 726; Flickinger v. First Nat. Bank, 76 C. C. A. 132, 145 Fed. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">As this court has no jurisdiction of a wage earner, and defendant herein did not owe the debts claimed, it is unnecessary to discuss whether an act of bankruptcy has or has not been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">It follows that the issues submitted to the court must be found for the defendant, and that, as a consequence, the petition in bankruptcy must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
