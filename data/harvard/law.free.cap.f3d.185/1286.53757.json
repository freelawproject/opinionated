(RAMCOR), an incumbent contractor, the United States Court of Federal Claims issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) from awarding a contract to a new contractor. RAM-COR subsequently filed an action under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (1994), for attorney fees and expenses in obtaining the injunction. The Court of Federal Claims denied RAM-COR\u2019s application, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction and, even if it had jurisdiction, RAM-COR was not entitled to an EAJA award on the merits. <em>See Ramcor Services Group, Inc. v. United States, </em>41 Fed.Cl. 264 (1998). Although the trial court possessed jurisdiction to issue the injunction, this court affirms its exercise of discretion in denying an EAJA award on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">RAMCOR had a contract with INS to provide maintenance and support services at the Border Patrol Academy in Charleston, South Carolina. Upon discovering the impropriety of its five-year contract to RAMCOR, INS decided to award a new contract. After two six-month extensions of the contract, INS began a new contract award process. In its initial evaluation, INS excluded RAMCOR from the competitive range because of inadequacies in its proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">RAMCOR filed a pre-award bid protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO). That protest triggered an automatic stay under the provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-56 (1994), prohibiting INS from awarding a new contract pending a decision on the protest. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). CICA, however, also allows an agency to override the automatic stay if it issues a written finding that \u201curgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting\u201d for the bid protest decision. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). INS issued a written \u201cDetermination and Finding\u201d setting forth purported urgent and compelling circumstances. Having overridden the stay, INS awarded the contract to OMNI-CUBE. Citing deficiencies in the written findings, RAMCOR sought a preliminary injunction in the Court of Federal Claims to prohibit INS from allowing OMNI-CUBE to act under the newly awarded contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-18\">The Court of Federal Claims granted the preliminary injunction. In issuing the injunction, the trial court noted: \u201c[INS has] not established the precipitous decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>in performance that manifests an urgent and compelling need to override the GAO stay.\u201d <em>RAMCOR Services Group, Inc. v. United States, </em>No. 98-152C (Ct.Fed.Cl. Mar. 9, 1998) (order granting prehminary injunction). The trial court thus reinstated the stay pending a GAO decision. INS moved to quash the injunction, arguing that the Court of Federal Claims lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review an agency\u2019s override of a CICA stay. In a later hearing on the INS motion, the trial court informally suggested that INS should pay part of RAMCOR\u2019s fees. The trial court again noted INS\u2019s failure to produce evidence to substantiate the alleged urgent and compelling reasons for its stay override. A few days later, the GAO decided against RAMCOR on the merits of its bid protest. The Court of Federal Claims, therefore, lifted its injunction and dismissed the action without deciding the pending jurisdictional motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Citing its success in obtaining a preliminary injunction, RAMCOR filed an application for attorney fees and expenses under EAJA. That Act allows a party who prevails in a civil action against the United States to recover fees and expenses, subject to certain conditions satisfied by RAMCOR. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). EAJA, however, also specifically requires that civil action to arise in a \u201ccourt having jurisdiction of such action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Federal Claims thus examined its subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying action \u2014 the request for injunctive relief from INS\u2019s override of the CICA stay. Only if it possessed this jurisdiction could the trial court make an EAJA award. The trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction and, accordingly, dismissed the EAJA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">In the alternative, the trial court also decided the merits of RAMCOR\u2019s case. Once a prevailing party satisfies the EAJA requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(B), the burden shifts to the Government to show that its litigating position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d Such a showing precludes an award of fees and expenses to a prevailing party. <em>See id. </em>The Court of Federal Claims found that the Government had shown a substantial justification and denied an EAJA award.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">RAMCOR appeals. On appeal, RAM-COR contends both that the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b), gives the trial court jurisdiction over RAMCOR\u2019s underlying claim, and that the Government was not substantially justified in its litigating position.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">The jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims is a legal issue reviewed without deference by this court. <em>See Crocker v. United States, </em>125 F.3d 1475 (Fed.Cir.1997). This court reviews the trial court\u2019s decision not to award fees and costs under the standards of EAJA for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Chiu v. United States, </em>948 F.2d 711, 713 (Fed.Cir.1991) (citing <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 557-63, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">As a predicate to an EAJA award, the awarding court must have had jurisdiction over the civil action in which the applying party prevailed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). RAMCOR asserts that amendments to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 under the ADRA granted the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over RAMCOR\u2019s action for a preliminary injunction. The relevant provision reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-11\">Both <em>the Unite[d] States Court of Federal Claims </em>and the district courts of the United States <em>shall have jurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to </em>a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or <em>any alleged violation of statute </em>or regulation <em>in connection with a procurement </em>or a proposed procurement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV-\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) (emphasis added). In the underlying action, RAMCOR ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>jected to INS\u2019s 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) override of the automatic stay triggered by RAMCOR\u2019s appeal to the GAO, <em>see </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1). This court must decide therefore, whether an objection to a \u00a7 3553(c)(2) override can serve as a jurisdictional basis under \u00a7 1491(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">This issue, in turn, requires this court to determine whether \u00a7 3553(c)(2) is a statute \u201cin connection with a procurement,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1491(b)(1). Because the ADRA covers primarily pre- and post-award bid protests, the trial court determined that RAMCOR could only invoke \u00a7 1491(b)(1) jurisdiction by including in its action an attack on the merits of the underlying contract award. RAMCOR had objected only to the \u00a7 3553(c)(2) override. Therefore the Court of Federal Claims determined that it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See Ramcor, </em>41 Fed.Cl. at 269 (\u201cHad plaintiff asked the court to review the merits of the award of the base support services contract it could have based jurisdiction on a violation of section 3553(c).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The language of \u00a7 1491(b), however, does not require an objection to the actual contract procurement, but only to the \u201cviolation of a statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement.\u201d The operative phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is very sweeping in scope. As long as a statute has a connection to a procurement proposal, an alleged violation suffices to supply jurisdiction. Section 3553(c)(2) fits comfortably in that broad category. After all, INS\u2019s \u00a7 3553(c)(2) override allowed it to procure immediately OMNI-CUBE\u2019s services. Moreover, under that procurement, OMNI-CUBE could have immediately commenced work. Where an agency\u2019s actions under a statute so clearly affect the award and performance of a contract, this court has little difficulty concluding that that statute has a \u201cconnection with a procurement.\u201d <em>Cf. CCL, Inc. v. United States, </em>39 Fed.Cl. 780, 788-89 (1997) (grounding jurisdiction on the final disjunctive phrase of \u00a7 1491(b)(1) to adjudicate a contractor\u2019s claim that a procurement required competitive bidding). Although hardly necessary to establish this connection, this court also notes that the subchapter containing \u00a7 3553(c)(2) bears the title, \u201cProcurement Protest System.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The trial court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1491(b) would also render the \u201cviolation of statute or regulation\u201d prong of that provision superfluous. If \u00a7 1491(b) required a challenge to the merits of the contract.award, the contractor would never need to use the \u201cviolation\u201d prong but could always rely on other jurisdictional grants in \u00a7 1491(b)(1). A challenge on the merits would, for example, amount to an objection to \u201ca proposed award or the award of a contract.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1). When construing a statute, this court must, if at all possible, give, effect to all its parts. <em>See Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc., </em>412 U.S. 609, 633, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). The trial court\u2019s proposed interpretation of \u00a7 1491(b)(1) would violate this basic tenet of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The language of \u00a7 1491(b)(1) also raises the question of whether INS \u201cviolated\u201d \u00a7 3553(c)(2). Arguably, INS satisfied the \u00a7 3553(c)(2) requirements by issuing a written finding of urgent and compelling circumstances and notifying the GAO. Because \u00a7 3553(c)(2) lacks substantive requirements <em>(e.g., </em>that the agency\u2019s finding not be \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d), the argument continues, a trial court can only address any deficiencies in the written finding as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706 (1994), which explicitly sets forth such substantive requirements. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. Indeed, United States District Courts have reviewed \u00a7 3553(c)(2) overrides under the APA. <em>See, e.g., Dairy Maid Dairy, Inc. v. United States, </em>837 F.Supp. 1370, 1376 (ED.Va.1998) (\u201c[T]he Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq., governs judicial review of the Army\u2019s decision to override CICA\u2019s automatic stay provisions....\u201d); <em>Universal Shipping Co. v. United States, </em>652 F.Supp. 668, 675 (D.D.C.1987) (\u201c[The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>Agency for International Development\u2019s] decision not to stay the Young Contract does not meet the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act and must be set aside as contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">This court is not persuaded that the trial court lacks jurisdiction because INS allegedly only violated the APA, not a procurement statute. The ADRA explicitly imports the APA standards of review into the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 review of agency decisions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4) (\u201cIn any action under this subsection, the courts shall review the agency\u2019s decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5.\u201d). Section 1491(b)(4) thus provides the substantive requirements that \u00a7 3553(c)(2) lacks. Stated otherwise, an agency may \u201cviolate\u201d \u00a7 3553(c)(2) by issuing a written finding that does not meet the substantive review criteria of \u00a7 1491(b)(4). An objection to such a violation falls squarely within the jurisdictional ambit of \u00a7 1491(b)(1). Although a contractor may instead pursue a district court action under the APA to seek redress for an agency\u2019s deficient \u00a7 3553(c)(2) override, that remedy does not alter the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. The ADRA, by its terms, provides alternative avenues for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Accordingly, this court determines that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) grants the trial court jurisdiction over an objection to a violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). Therefore, this court vacates that portion of the trial court\u2019s decision to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Wisely resolving all issues potentially before it, the Court of Federal Claims determined that RAMCOR was not entitled to an EAJA award because the Government was substantially justified in its litigating position. Although INS had lost the underlying action, that outcome does not alone show that its position had no substantial justification. In other words, EAJA is not a mandatory fee-shifting device. <em>See Gavette v. Office of Personnel Management &amp; Dept. of the Treasury, </em>808 F.2d 1456, 1465 (Fed.Cir.1986). Regardless of the outcome, the trial court had the duty to determine whether the INS litigating position had a \u201creasonable basis in law and fact.\u201d <em>See Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 566, 108 S.Ct. 2541. That determination, in turn, obligated the trial court to \u201clook at the entirety of the government\u2019s conduct and make a judgment call whether the government\u2019s overall position had a reasonable basis in both law and fact.\u201d <em>Chiu, </em>948 F.2d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">In this case, the Court of Federal Claims found \u201clegitimate factual reasons supporting INS\u2019s desire to override the GAO stay and allow the successor contract to be awarded immediately.\u201d These reasons included \u201csevere\u201d complaints about RAMCOR\u2019s performance which raised \u201csubstantial questions\u201d about the \u201cquality of the plaintiffs performance.\u201d <em>Ramcor, </em>41 Fed. Cl. at 271-72. In addition, the Border Patrol Academy \u201cwas facing significant problems that could only be alleviated by awarding the successor contract as soon as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, .the Academy expected the imminent arrival of 200 new students at a time when its staff was already \u201cstressed to the breaking point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These findings substantiate to some degree the urgency of INS\u2019s litigating position.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">In its weighing of the justification for the INS position, the trial court also considered the Government\u2019s belated presentation of its jurisdictional motion. Noting the compressed time frame for injunction actions and stressing that the jurisdictional issue was one of first impression, the Court of Federal Claims concluded that the defense was both \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">The trial judge enjoys considerable discretion to determine eligibility for an EAJA award. <em>See Chiu, </em>948 F.2d at 715 n. 4. Absent a serious error in judgment, this court will not re-weigh the factors considered by the trial court. <em>See id. </em>Having fully considered the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>EAJA analysis and RAMCOR\u2019s arguments on appeal, this court detects no serious error in judgment or abuse of discretion. Accordingly, this court affirms the denial of an EAJA award on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">This court has determined that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to entertain an action based on an objection to a violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). In this case, however, that court did not abuse its discretion in denying an EAJA award on the merits. Therefore, this court affirms the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AGn\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
