K. Eerguson and others filed their petition in the County court of Halifax county contesting the election of James R. West, as sheriff of the county. The proceeding was in form according to the act of April 22, 1852, ch.. 71; and West having appeared to maintain his election, the case was heard by the County court at its August term, when the court adjudged and declared that West was duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>elected sheriff of the county of Halifax for the term prescribed by law; to commence on the first of the next January: and then proceeded to render a judgment against the petitioners for the defendant\u2019s costs. The petitioners thereupon applied to the judge of the Circuit court of Halifax for a writ of prohibition to stay the enforcement of the judgment for costs. Upon this petition a rule was made directing West and the County court to show cause why the writ of prohibition should not be awarded. And at the October term of the court the case came on to be heard when the court made the rule absolute, and prohibited the defendant West from further proceedings to enforce the judgment for costs against the petitioners.

It is true that in actions in which damages were given the costs of the plaintiff were in reality considered and included in the quantum of damages, and he thus indirectly.recovered his costs, or their equivalent. But he could not do this in actions in which no damages were given; and the defendant could not, in any case whatever, recover his costs, either directly or indirectly.\u2014It is by virtue of statute law alone that any judgment for costs, eo nomine, can be rendered in favor of either party. 3 Black. Comm. 399; Com. Dig. Tit. Costs; Viner\u2019s Abr. Tit. Costs; 1 Rob. Prac. (old ed.) 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The act under which the proceedings in this case were had (acts 1852, ch. 71) provides that the returns of the elections of sheriffs, and of certain other officers, \u201cshall be subject to the enquiry, determination and judgment of the respective county and corporation courts,\u201d and that \u201cthe said courts shall in judging of said elections, proceed upon the merits thereof, and shall determine finally concerning the same according to the constitution and laws of this commonwealth\u201d ; but no authority is given by it to said courts to render any judgment for costs. If such authority exists it must be found in some statute conferring upon the courts general power over the subject of costs. The only enactments having any bearing on the question under consideration, are to be found in sections 4 and 8 of chapter 185 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The fourth section authorizes the court, \u201cupon any motion (other than for a judgment for money), or upon any interlocutory order or proceeding,\u201d to \u201cgive or refuse *costs, at its discretion, unless it be otherwise provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The eighth section declares that, 1 \u2018except where it is otherwise provided, the party for whom final judgment is given in any action, or in a motion for judgment for money, whether he be plaintiff or defendant, shall recover his costs against the opposite party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Unless the proceedings under the statute of 1852, in the case of a contested election, can be considered as a \u201cmotion,\u201d or an \u201caction,\u201d or an \u201cinterlocutory order or proceeding,\u201d it is clear that they are not embraced by either of these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">They certainly do not fall within the terms \u201cinterlocutory order or proceeding\u201d ; and it seems equally clear that they are neither a \u201cmotion,\u201d nor an \u201caction.\u201d These words have a well understood technical meaning, and cannot, by any stretch of construction, be made to embrace such proceedings as are directed to be had in cases of contested elections. These proceedings are novel and peculiar in their character, and seem designed rather for the purpose of ascertaining, on behalf of the public, who has been duly elected, than of enabling rival candidates to litigate, on their own behalf, the question of right to an office. No contests can be commenced unless complaint of an undue election, or false return, is made by fifteen or more of the qualified voters, two of whom must make oath or affirmation to the truth of the facts stated in the complaint. This must be filed in the Clerk\u2019s office within ten days after the election, and the party whose election is contested must within ten days after the complaint, be served with a copy of it. The defeated candidate, who is the only other party who can be supposed to have any personal interest in the matter, cannot, at his own pleasure, enter upon the contest; and it may be commenced and prosecuted without his knowledge, or against his wish. He is not a necessary party *in any stage of the proceedings. Indeed the complaint may be made and the election set aside when there has been no candidate except the one whose election is contested. In this case the defeated candidate was not one of the complainants, and the only thing in the record from which his name is to be asc\u00e9rtained is the statement, to be found in the decision of the court, of the number of illegal votes upon his poll.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Proceedings like these cannot be regarded as a \u201cmotion,\u201d or an \u201caction,\u201d within the purview of the statutes regulating costs between parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">Frivolous contests are guarded against by the requirement of an affidavit as to the truth of the complaint, by the number of complainants necessary to commence a contest, and the trouble and expense to which they must be subjected in prosecuting it. These safeguards are sufficient without superadding a liability for costs to the party whose election is contested. Such liability would operate as an undue discouragement to the institution of a contest in which the whole community is as much interested as the complainants. The refusal to' give costs to either party seems to be the best mode of avoiding the discouragement of proper contests on the one hand, and the encouragement of frivolous ones on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>other. But whether this be so or not, it is enough for us to know that the legislature has not authorized any judgment for costs to be given in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The County court in rendering such judgment exceeded its jurisdiction, and a writ of prohibition was a proper proceeding to arrest the execution of said judgment for want of authority in* the County court to render the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In this view of the case it is not necessary to decide the question which has been raised as to the right of two of the members of the County court to act as justices.</p>\n<p id=\"AbNM\">*The judgment of the Circuit court must be affirmed, \u2018 with costs . and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of ROBRRTSON, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">ELECTIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">I.

RIGHTS IN GENERAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-27\">Suffrage\u2014The Right Derived from the Constitution of the State\u2014Legislative Powers \u2014 Constitutionality of Statute.\u2014The right of suffrage is derived directly from the constitution of the state, and we look to it to ascertain who may or may not vote. It is not within the power of the legislature to prescribe any qualifications additional to those found in the constitution either directly or indirectly, and, since no educational qualification is prescribed by the constitution none can be required. The sole function of the legislature with respect to suffrage, is to provide the method of voting, to guard against any improper or fraudulent conduct in connection therewith, and to this end it may adopt and enforce reasonable rules and regulations, but the. enforcement of a regulation which virtually establishes a test of qualification of the voter in addition to those prescribed in the constitution is unconstitutional and therefore void. Pearson v. Supervisors, 91 Va. 322, 21 S. E. Rep. 483, 1 Va. Law Reg. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-28\">It was further held in this case that the act of the assembly, approved March 6,1894, \u201cto provide for a method of voting by ballot,\u201d does not contravene any of the propositions stated above, and it is therefore not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-29\">Duties of Legislature Concerning Electors\u2014Constitutional Provision.\u2014Under the constitution of West Virginia, \u00a7 11, art. 4, it is the duty of the legislature to prescribe the manner of conducting and making returns of elections and of determining contested elections, and to pass such laws as may-be necessary and proper to carry out their requirements in this regard without disorder or violence at the polls, and to prevent corruption or fraud in counting the votes ascertaining the result or otherwise.

Va. 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-31\">County and Corporation Courts\u2014Authority to Re= move Judges of Election.\u2014The county and corporation courts have full authority to remove a judge of elections for malfeasance in office or gross neglect of duty, though he has not been convicted by the verdict of a jury of any offenqe.

VIRGINIA ELECTION LAW\u2014STATUTES.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-33\">Australian Ballot System\u2014Constitutionality.\u2014The act of the assembly approved March 6, 1894, entitled \u201can act to provide for the method of voting by ballot,\u201d is a valid act; and not in conflict with Article III, sections 1 and 2 of the constitution of Virginia, nor with Article I, section 20, nor with Article I, section 8, of the Virginia Constitution. Nor is it in conflict with Article XIV of the amendments to the constitution of the United States. Pearson v. Supervisors, 91 Va. 322, 21 S. E. Rep. 483, 1 Va. Law Reg. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-34\">Virginia Election Law\u2014Case in Circuit Court of United States.\u2014See the case of Cox v. Gilmer (1898), 4 Va. Law Reg. 229, decided in the circuit court of the United States, Western District of Va. construing the Virginia election law. Act of General Assembly of Virginia, approved March 5, 1890, authorizing judges of an election to order the arrest of any person creating a disturbance at the polls, was held not repugnant to the Constitution of Virginia. See also, Pearson v. Board of Supervisors, 91 Va. 322, 21 S. E. Rep. 483, 1 Va. Law Reg. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-35\">Legislative Regulation\u2014Time for Preparing Ballot.\u2014 Under the statute, March 6, 1894, providing for voting in booths, a limit to the time for the preparation of ballots was an obvious necessity, for which the legislature had a right to provide, and the court cannot as a proposition of law, decide that the time allowed by the statute is inadequate. The act places no limit on the number of booths that may be supplied, and the county courts have full power to multiply the voting precincts to meet the necessities of the people. Pearson v. Supervisors, 91 Va. 322, 21 S. E. Rep. 483, 1 Va. Law Reg. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-36\">Special Constables\u2014Their Duties\u2014Statutes.\u2014It was held in Pearson v. Supervisors, 91 Va. 322, 21 S. E. Rep. 483, under Act of March 6,1894, that the special constables provided for in said act are sworn officers, charged with the gravest duty to the public in which every citizen is interested, and for failure to perform their duty severe penalties are inflicted. Among these is the duty to render to those who are blind or unable to read on account of defective education every assistance necessary to aid the elector in preparing his ballot. The word \u201cmay,\u201d used in the fifteenth section of this act, relating to the duty of special constables, is mandatory and not merely permissive and directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-37\">Secret Ballot\u2014Duties of Special Constable.\u2014A vote by ballot <em>ex vi t&amp;i'mini </em>implies a secret ballot; and the secrecy of the ballot is a right which inheres in the voter; but a blind man or a man unable to read, must, in the nature of things so far compromise this right of secrecy asUo obtain the aid of others in the preparation of his ballot; for which purpose a constable is provided by the statute. It is therefore the duty of the special constable, which he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>sworn to faithfully execute, to assist the voters in preparing their \"ballot, when requested, to observe all his rights and to keep the secrecy of his ballot inviolate. Pearson v. Supervisors, 91 Va. 322, 21 S. E. Rep. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Construction of Election Statutes.\u2014It is said by the court in \"Loomis v. Jackson, 6 W. Va. 691, that \u201cElection statutes are to be tested like other statutes ; but with a leaning to liberality, in view of the great public purpose which they accomplish ; and except where they specifically provide that a thing shall be done in the manner indicated, and not otherwise, their provisions, designed merely for the information and guidance of the officers, must be regarded as directory only; and the election will not be defeated by a failure to comply with them, provided, the irregularity has not hindered any who were entitled to vote from exercising the right of suffrage, or rendered doubtful the evidence from which the result was tobe declared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">IS. QUALIFICATIONS OF VOTERS AND OFFICE HOLDERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Requirements for Citizenship\u2014Evidence of Naturalization\u2014Parol Evidence Inadmissible.\u2014The law requires that an alien, in order to become a citizen, must be naturalized in a court of record and admitted to citizenship by the judgment of such court; therefore if it is claimed that an alien has been naturalized in a certain court, and this is the only court in which he claimed to have been naturalized, and on examination of the record it is shown that no record was made of naturalizing such alien, it cannot be proved by parol evidence that such alien was naturalized, and, by inadvertence no record was made thereof; nor can the citizenship of an alien under such circumstances be presumed by proof of his having held real estate or of his having voted or held office or by other circumstances. Dryden v. Swinburne, 20 W. Va. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Naturalization of a Father\u2014Effect on Son.\u2014By section 2172 of the revised statutes of the United States if the father be naturalized, while his son under the age of 21 is residing with him in the United States, his son will also- be considered a citizen ; but if at the time of the naturalization of the father the son is over the age of 21, such naturalization does not affect the character of the son as an alien, even though the father was naturalized before the first of Dec. 1873, when revised statutes of the United States went into operation. Dryden v. Swinburne, 20 W. Va. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Naturalization of Aliens\u2014Authority of the Court to Antedate Its Order.\u2014No court of the United States has authority or power in naturalizing an alien to declare in its order that such alien shall be deemed a citizen from a time prior to the making of the order ; if such declarations made itis unauthorized and void so far as such declaration is concerned, and he is a citizen only from the time such order is made. Dryden v. Swinburne, <em>20 </em>W. Va. <em>91.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Extension of City\u2019s Boundary\u2014Effect on Voter\u2019s Privileges.\u2014The Act of the Assembly, Sess. 1866-7, p. 635, extending the boundaries of the city of Richmond was held in Wade v. City of Richmond, 18 Gratt. 583, to operate upon the municipal relations of the inhabitants of the territory annexed to the city but in political elections they were still to vote as part of 1 the county of Henrico. !</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Cession of Land for District of Columbia\u2014Effect on Voters.\u2014A person who, at the time of the cession of the District of Columbia to the United States, resided in that part of the county of Fairfax which, by the said cession, was comprehended in that district, and who has continued to reside there ever since, is not entitled to vote for members of the General Assembly; notwithstanding he was born in Virginia and possesses a freehold therein. Custis v. Lane, 3 Munf. 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Authority of Nominating Conventions to Judge of Qualifications of its Hembers.\u2014In passing on the right of nominees for public office to appear on the election ballots, the supreme court in Marcum v. Ballot Commissioners, <em>42 </em>W. Va. 263, 26 S. E. Rep. 281, recognizes the right of the convention making the nominations to judge of the election, qualifications, and returns of its own members, and will not go back of its action to inquire as to the right or title of delegates admitted by it as members.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">Disqualification of Elected Officer\u2014Effect as to His DefeatedOpponent.\u2014Where two parties are opposing candidates for the office of sheriff, and the one receiving the highest number of votes disqualifies himself from holding the same by contracting to farm or sell the office or a portion thereof, such fact does not confer any interest in the office on the party receiving the minority of the votes cast at the election. State v. Matthews, <em>44 </em>W. Va. 372, 29 S. E. Rep. 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">Election of Alien\u2014Incompetent Candidate-Effect.\u2014 If an alien and a citizen, eligible to office are rival candidates for the same office, and the alien receives a majority of the votes cast, though such alien be declared incompetent by the court in the contest between them, the citizen having received only a minority of the votes cannot be declared elected to the office ; but it must be held to be vacant. Dryden v. Swinburne, 20 W. Va. 91. See State v. Matthews, 44 W. Va. 372, 29 S. E. Rep. 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-16\">Justice Convicted of Felony\u2014Forfeiture of Office\u2014 Effect of Pardon.\u2014A justice of the peace was convicted of the felony of malicious stabbing, sentenced to the penitentiary, confined there, and then pardoned. <em>11eld, </em>the conviction and judgment for this felony, was a forfeiture of his office of justice, and incapacitated him from afterwards acting under his commission; and the pardon neither avoided the forfeiture, nor restored his capacity. Com. v. Fugate, 2 Leigh 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">Selling or Farming Out Office\u2014West Virginia Statute Construed.\u2014The provision of West Virginia Code 1868, ch. 7, sec. 5, concerning the selling or farming out of offices is held to mean that the parties are disabled from holding the term of office, the whole or part of which was thus sold or contracted to be sold, whether the term of office be an existing or a future term of office, not then in existence; but it is only the term of office contracted for, that these parties are disabled from holding; and their competency to hold a future office is not affected, unless the contract is to sell or farm a future office, and then he is incompetent to hold only the future office so sold or farmed. Dryden v. Swinburne, 20 W. Va. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">III. REGISTRATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-19\">Board of Registration\u2014Acting in Judicial Capacity\u2014 Not Subject to Civil Action.\u2014Acting under the provisions of | 8, ch. 78, Acts of 1866 (W. Va.), themembers of the County Board of Registration passing upon the right of a party to be registered or not, were acting in a judicial capacity, and if they acted within their jurisdiction, limited by the statute, they could not be amenable in a civil action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Fausler v. Parsons, 6 W. Va. 486. It is said in this case, that it seems, therefore, settled that where the subject-matter and the person are within the jurisdiction of the courts, the judge, whether of a superior or inferior court, is not subject to a civil action for any matter done by him in the exercise of his judicial functions. He is not bound, at the peril of an action for damages, or personal controversy, to decide right, in matter either of law or fact; but to decide according to his own convictions of right, of which his recorded judgment is the test, and must be taken to be conclusive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Registration\u2014Mandamus\u2014When Proper. \u2014 Where under the Code of 1887, \u00a7 83, a voter appealed from refusal of the registrar to allow him to register, the answer of the registrar that the voter did not offer to qualify as to his right to vote, and that he was not entitled to vote, was held to be no defence to an application for <em>mandamus </em>to compel the registrar to transmit to the court the grounds relied on by the appellant, and the reasons for his refusal to register him. Coleman v. Sands, 87 Va. 689, 13 S. E. Rep. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Right to Inspect Registration Books\u2014Handamus.\u2014A <em>mandamus </em>will lie to compel a registrar to allow any citizen to inspect, and take copies of the registration book, although he is allowed no compensation for so doing; the books being of a public nature, in which every citizen has an interest; and more, the statute provides for such inspection in plain language. Clay v. Ballard. 87 Va. 787, 13 S. E.

And when the true result of a legal election has been ascertained, or can be ascertained, by the officers charged with the performance of this duty, no irregularity, mistake or even fraud committed by any of the officers conducting the election, or by any other person, can be permitted to defeat the fair expression of the popular^will as expressed in said section.

In this last c\u00e1se the defeated candidate for clerk of the county court asked to have the vote from a certain precinct thrown out on the ground that the two poll clerks divided the ballots between them and each signed his own name and the name of the other clerk, instead of each signing his own name on each ballot, as directed by the statute; this was done, however, in the presence of the election judges and of each other. It was held to be a ministerial act and capable of being validly done by an agent. The court said, however, that if one person standing, by another, authorizes him to sign his name, it is not an act of agency, but is regarded as the very signature of the party himself, as if done by himself. And in the case of Dial v. Hollandsworth, 29 W. Va. 1, 19 S. E. Rep. 567, the court went so far, in order to uphold a fair result, that it ignored the act of officers of the election in appointing two poll clerks without a shadow of authority, and the acting of such unlawful poll clerks of the same political party in preparing the ballots of illiterate voters in separate rooms, with every opportunity to falsify the ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Politics of Ballot Clerks\u2014Directory Provision.\u2014 While the election law requires the ballot clerks to be of opposite politics, the mere fact that such is not the case is not alone sufficient to justify the exclusion of the poll from the court.

On being called before the officers they were sworn as to the character of the ballots deposited by them, and four ballots were accordingly destroyed, which did not change the result of the election. The election officers certified certain parties as having received the highest number of votes, and the board of supervisors set the election aside because of the irregularity mentioned, and ordered another election. Subsequently, the parties who had been elected by the first vote, petitioned the circuit court for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to supervise the proceedings of the board of supervisors. <em>Held, </em>that there was no irregularity in the election, in fact or in law, that would be sufficient to invalidate the election, according to the provisions of \u00a7 28, Acts 1863; and that it was a proper case for review by a higher court.

In ascertaining and reporting the number of registered voters in the county they are to be guided and controlled by the registration books.

Rep. 337, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>returns of election on the location of a county seat must go before the county court to be canvassed, and to have the result declared, and not before the board of canvassers.

OFFICERS ELECTED-TERM OF OFFICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Election of Judge\u2014Limits of His Term\u2014Defined.\u2014 Manchester was incorporated as a city in 1874, and having more than five thousand inhabitants was entitled to have a judge of its hustings court. In March, 1874, C was elected and qualified as judge of said, court. <em>Held, </em>that this being the first judge of this coiirt, under the Constitution, C\u2019s term of office commenced on the first of January, 1875, and would continue until the 31st of December, 1880; and he was under the Constitution authorized to act as judge from the time of his qualification to the commencement of his term. <em>Ex parte </em>Fisher, 33 Gratt. 232.

In December, 1879, W was elected judge of the same counties, and commissioned as such on the 20th of the same month. Without objection on the part of E, W entered, at once, upon the duties of the office, and E qualified as an attorney and practiced in both of the courts over which W presided, until the April term, 1880, when the court of appeals having decided that the terms of all the county judges in Virginia, whether elected to fill vacancies or not, commenced on the first day of January next 'following their appointments, and were for the full term of six years, and fixed by the Constitution, E appeared and protested thathe was the lawful judge. This claim W refused to recognize, principally on the ground that E, by acquiescing in the assumption' of the office by W, and becoming a practicing attorney in his court, held an office incompatible with the office of judge, and by this conduct had forfeited and abandoned his said office. On <em>quo warranto </em>by E against W, <em>held, </em>E was entitled to the office, and the fact that he only yielded to the legislative and executive construction of the constitution, until the question was settled by the supreme court, was no abandonment or forfeiture of his office.

Law J. 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Supporting this doctrine, see <em>Ex parte </em>Meredith, <em>Ex parte </em>Harrison, 33 Gratt. 119. In Howison v. Weeden, 77 Va. 704, which was a petition to compel! the defendant to surrender the office of judge, it was held that the parties to the controversy were privies to the case of Meredith, <em>Ex parte, </em>etc., <em>supra </em>and that the decision therein, not having been reversed was binding on them. See also, Estes v. Edmondson, 33 Gratt. 510; Montague v. Massey, 76 Va. 307; Neal v. Allen, 76 Va. 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">The above cases, however, have been overruled in the subsequent case of Burks v. Hinton, 77 Va. 1, where it was held by a majority of the court of appeals that the constitution of Virginia empowers the legislature to prescribe the manner of filling all vacancies in office, and to declare when an office is vacant, in cases not especially therein provided for, and makes no exception as to the office of a judge; that, therefore, the joint resolution adopted by the general assembly, December 18, 1872, that all elections by the general assembly to fill vacancies in the office of a judge shall be for the unexpired term of his predecessor, is constitutional, and consequently Judge Burks, who was elected in 1876 to fill the vacancy in the court of appeals, caused by the death of Judge Bouldin, was not chosen for the regular term of twelve years, but only for the residue of Judge Bouldin\u2019s term, which expired 31st December, 1882.

Law J. 286, that it is well settled by the repeated decisions of this court that the terms of office of the different classes of judges in this state begin and end at fixed and definite periods; and that after the expiration of those periods the incumbents can only discharge the duties of the office until their successors have qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">Claim of Salary as Judge after Removal from Office by Legislature.\u2014On petition for <em>mandamus </em>to compel the board of supervisors of Fauquier county to issue a warrant upon the treasurer of said county for $1,250, which sum the petitioner alleges is due him as his salary as <em>de jure </em>judge of the county court from March, 1884, to January, 1886. The petition alleges further that upon presentation of his claim, the respondents refused to recognize him as a judge, on the ground that he had been removed from office by the legislature, and one Edward M. Spilman elected in his stead. He insists, however, that such alleged removal was in violation of the constitution and without legal effect for several reasons. It was held in the case that the judgment determining that the petitioner had no title to the office, necessarily determined that he was no longer entitled to receive its emoluments, though no claim for salary was specifically made, and could not have been regularly made, in that proceeding. And stated further in the opinion that an office is a right and correspondent duty to exercise a public or private trust, and to take the emoluments belonging to it; and as was said in Blair v. Marye, Auditor, 80 Va. 485, \u201cthe salary follows the office as the shadow follows the substance.\u201d Shumate v. Supervisors, 84 Va. 574, 5 S. E.

Coleman v. Sands, 87 Va. 689, 13 S. E. Rep. 148. It is held further in this case, that it is not true that an office is held at the will of either party. It is held at the will of both. Generally resignations are accepted, and it may be that it is generally believed that resigning is a matter of right; but it is otherwise. The public has a right to the services of all its citizens, and may demand them in all civil departments as well as in the military.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">De Facto Officers\u2014Validity of Their Acts.\u2014A was elected in .\"January, 1880, judge of the county court of Halifax and commissioned by the governor.

It ought not to contain any prayer for relief beyond what is found in the authority of the court to afford. To invoke the authority vested in the governor by sec. 13, ch. 6, W. Va. Code 1868, it is necessary that the contestant should file with the governor a petition with copies of his ground of contest, notice and specifications ; and such petitions must remain in the governor\u2019s office, in order that he may have evidence upon which to justify his official action. Loomis v. Jackson, 6 W. Va., 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">The allegations and the proofs must agree. Therefore a contestant, either in his petition or notice of the ground of contest and specifications, must show directly what was the result of the election as declared by the returning officers and in what manner and to what extent the result will be affected by the correction of errors complained of in the specifications.

E<em>x parte </em>Ellyson, 20 Gratt. 10. It was held in this case that, although a person voted for at an election, having been declared elected by the commissioners, and their report certified by the clerk, had entered upon the discharge of the duties of his office, the court might vacate the election, and direct another election to be held.

Va. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Subscription to Stock of Internal Improvement Company-Equity Jurisdiction.\u2014In Redd v. Supervisors, 31 Gratt. 695, it was held that although a mode for contesting the returns of an election or decision of the voters of the county or corporation upon the question whether the county or corporation shall subscribe to the stock of an internal improvement company is provided by statute. Acts 1874, ch. 37, a court of equity still has jurisdiction of the question, upon a bill filed by fifteen or more of the citizens and taxpayers of the county or corporation, and to enjoin the issue of bonds of the county or corporation in payment of said subscription if the proceeding has not been properly conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Power of the Legislature \u2014 Curative Acts.\u2014The legislature may by a subsequent act correct mistakes in a local election, legalize the proceedings, if they are irregular, and so confirm th e result. Redd v. Supervisors, 31 Gratt. 695. It is said in the opinion of this case that \u201cmistakes and irregularities are of frequent occurrence in municipal elections, and the state legislatures have often had occasion to pass laws to obviate such difficulties. Such laws, when they do not impair any contract, or injuriously affect the rights of third parties, are never regarded as objectionable, and certainly are within the competency of the legislative authority.\u201d See Bell v.

And if they refuse to sign and settle such bill of exceptions, the circuit court may by <em>mandamus </em>compel them to do so, and then perfect their record so that the action of the county court in this matter may be reviewed on writ of <em>certiorari </em>by the circuit court.

At the March term the court refused to proceed with the trial of the case on the ground that, at the said November term the county court had ceased to exist, and for that cause no contest was pending which could be tried. The circuit court having upon writ of <em>certiorari </em>reversed the judgment of the county court and remanded the cause to be further proceeded in according to law, its decision was sustained by the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">Giving of Notice\u2014Requirements of Statute\u2014Right of Amendment\u2014it is the manifest intent of the statute that a party proposing to contest the election of one who has been declared elected, shall, within a period of time precisely limited, give to him whose election he proposes to contest full information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of the case upon which he will proceed to trial.

Va. 811, that the complaint called in the statute, \u00a7 9, ch. 109. W. Va. Code 1868, a notice does not mean simply an informal paper such as is usually understood by the term notice ; but it is in the nature of a complaint or information setting forth a cause of action as well as the commencement and foundation of an important legal proceeding. See Dryden v. Swinburn, 15 W. Va. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">Notice\u2014Requirements of\u2014Failure to Comply with.\u2014 A notice, which states as the sole ground of complaint, that the county court commissioners failed and refused to count the vote.s cast at a certain precinct, which were duly and legally certified by the commissioners who held the election at said precinct, and that if said votes had been counted, the contestant would have been elected to the disputed office is held insufficient and should have been quashed by the county court. And it was further held that such could not be amended after the expiration of ten days from the time the result of the election had been declared if it could be amended at all. Halstead v. Rader, 27 W. Va. 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">Mere General Allegations Are Insufficient.\u2014Mere general allegations that the contestee wa.s not elected, and that the return declaring him so is untrue, false and fraudulent, afford no information to the contestee of the defence he may be required to make. Halstead v. Rader, 27 W. Va. 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-18\">Petition of Contestant Filed at the Trial\u2014For What Purposes Allowed.\u2014In an election contest the contestant may of right file a petition at the trial, but not for the purpose or to have the effect of curing defects in the notices and specifications; and so far as the petition contains new allegations material to the case, they must be disregarded or such allegations should be stricken out. Harrison v. Lewis, 6 W. Va. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-19\">Allegation of New Facts\u2014To Cure Defects\u2014When Allowed.\u2014ft was decided in the contested election case of Harrison v. Lewis, 6 W. Va.721, under W. Va. Code 1868, ch. 6, \u00a7 13, where it is provided that such case shall be decided \u201caccording to law and the truth upon the petition, returns, and evidence to be submitted,\u201d that facts, new and material to the contestant\u2019s case could not be alleged upon the record and regarded by the court for the purpose of curing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>any defects which may be inherent in the case made by the contestant in his notice, or notices and specifications, which were served upon the respondent within the time prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">It was however held in this same case that the contestant might file his petition before the hearing is proceeded with, as of right; but not after the trial of the case had begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">New Facts\u2014Additional Notice Allowed\u2014Time of Giving Notice.\u2014By sec. 4, ch. 6, W. Va. Code 1868, it is expressly declared that \u201cIf new facts be discovered by either party after he has given notice as aforesaid, he may give additional notice or notices to his adversary, with specifications and affidavit .as above prescribed.\u201d But it is held in Loomis v. Jackson, 6 W. Va. 613, 688, that the contestant in a judicial contest, needing all the time allowed by the law to collect the facts of the case, may postpone the service of his notice of contest until the sixtieth day after the election; and the respondent may in like manner and for a similar reason, delay the service of the return notice until the thirtieth day thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Additional Notice\u2014New Facts\u2014 Requirements..\u2014In the case of a contested election if the contestant gives an additional notice specifying new facts, it is essential that it appear in the notice that such facts are new and that they were discovered after service of the original notice, and that they could not have been discovered by the use of such diligence before service of the original notice, otherwise the additional notice is defective. Harrison v. Lewis, 6 W. Va. 713; Loomis v. Jackson, 6 W. Va. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u201cThe rule which requires the contestant to present such facts as that the court may see that the result of the election will be changed if the facts be proven, is a rule which is not only consistent with the principle of pleading, but one which is sustained by the authority of particular cases; well considered and solemnly adjudicated.\u201d Harrison v. Lewis, 6 W. Va. 713. It was therefore held in this case that the notice and specification taken together did not disclose such state of facts as required, hence it was insufficient and should on motion be quashed. See Halstead v. Rader, 37 W. Va. 806; Loomis v. Jackson, 6 W. Va. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Contested Elections\u2014Amendment of Notice\u2014Two Methods.\u2014In the trial of contested eleciions, two methods of amendment to the notices required by our statute are permissible: First, the statutory method, which is always based upon new facts discovered after the original notice has been given ; second, the method incident to common-law procedure. Ralston v. Meyer, 34 W. Va. 737, 12 S. E. Rep. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">It is further stated by the court in this case that fairness, purity, and freedom of elections are essential to free government, and the object of the judicial tribunal engaged in deciding upon a contested election is not so much to determine the private rights of the parties, as to decide whom the people have elected in that particular election, according to the very right of the case and the principles of justice ; hence, at common law, amendments to the notice of petition are permitted only to further the ends of justice, and to promote a true and impartial decision, according to the evidence. Ralston v. Meyer, 34 W. Va. 737, 12 S. E. Rep. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Permission to Amend Counter Notice Refused\u2014Votes Rejected.\u2014The counter notice filed by a contestee in an election contest stated that A. and B. were not qualified voters, but had voted for the contestant; which latter had not challenged their qualificatk n in his notice. At the trial the contestee asked leave to strike from his counter notice the names of A. and B., and the allegations concerning them. This was refused, and the court found from the evidence that A. and B. were not qualified voters, but that they had voted for the contestee. It was held, that leave to amend was properly refused, and that the court was justified in rejecting the votes of A. and B. Ralston v. Meyer, 34 W. Va. 737, 12 S. E. Rep. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Rights Waived by Failure to Act.\u2014The contestees, by filing a joint counter complaint, and allowing the contestants to incur expense in procuring depositions, waive their right to move for a dismissal on the ground of misj oinder of the parties.

But under section 17, ch. 116, the accused was entitled to challenge four jurors peremptorily, and, this having been refused, the judgment and verdict are set aside, and anew trial is awarded.
