Ordered and Adjudged that the order entered herein on June 30, 1941, dismissing this cause be, and the same' is hereby vacated and set aside, the same having been entered in error and the said cause is reinstated and is hereby referred to Clyde Maddox, a practicing attorney, with directions to take and report the testimony herein to the court with his findings, with all convenient speed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cIt Is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed That. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the time within which the parties hereto shall be allowed to take their said testimony before the Master is filed at sixty days from the date of this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cDone and Ordered in Chambers at Bartow, Florida, this 3rd day of January, A. D. 1942.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On petition for rehearing being presented, the Court entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201cThis cause is before the Court on motion to vacate and set aside an order entered by this court vacating and setting aside its .previous order by which order this cause was dismissed for want of prosecution. The records show that the cause had been pending for about a year and was at issue on the answer filed by the defendant to the Bill of Complaint. In this situation a motion was presented to the Court to dismiss the cause for want of prosecution and at the time of the presentment of said motion by counsel for the defendant it was represented to the Court by the attorney for the defendant that he believed the suit was abandoned by plaintiff and that he, the plaintiff, did not further care to prosecute said suit and based on such premises the Court inadvertently entered an order dismissing the cause for want of prosecution. That the record in this cause discloses no notice was given to plaintiff or his counsel of the presentment of said motion. This Court is of the opinion that this previous order of dismissal was improperly and inadvertently entered, and that the cause was not subject to dismissal for want of prosecution, and that, therefore, the subsequent order entered by the Court setting aside the order of dismissal and reinstating the cause and referring it to a Master, all of which was done with notice, was the proper order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201cIt is Therefore Ordered and Adjudged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>motion of the defendant to vacate and set aside the order reinstating this cause is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">\u201cDone and Ordered at Chambers in Bartow, Polk County, Florida, this 27th day of February, A. D. 1942.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cAn order dismissing the case was a \u2018final judgment\u2019 and became absolute on expiration of 20 days, subject to appeal within 6 months. Acts 1931, Ch. 14658, Sec. 70.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201cWhere no appeal was entered from order dismissing a case within 6 months period, court lost jurisdiction of subject matter and of parties, and hence properly denied subsequent motion to vacate the order of dismissal and to reinstate the cause. Acts 1931, Ch. 14658, Sec. 70.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">See Mayflower Investment Co. v. Brill et al., 131 Fla. 70, 178 Sou. 827; same case, 132 Fla. 530, 180 So. 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">It appears in this case, however, that the order dismissing the cause was inadvertently entered and was entered without notice when the cause was not subject to dismissal for want of prosecution. The record was then in such state that either party could have set the same down for final hearing on bill and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">It also appears from the order made in the cause, supra, that the court was led to believe that the complainant had abandoned his cause and did not wish to prosecute the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Under such circumstances, we hold that the order of dismissal was not an effective final judgment and that the order of the chancellor insofar as it vacated the order of dismissal and reinstated the cause, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>without error and that no abuse of judicial discretion on the part of the chancellor is shown. However, insofar as the order complained of allowed the parties additional time in which to take testimony we find from the record no sufficient showing to warrant such order of extension. Therefore, that part of the order should be and is quashed on certiorari granted, with leave, for either party to make application to the court below for extension of time and, if he can, show cause why such order of extension should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-6\">BROWN, C.
