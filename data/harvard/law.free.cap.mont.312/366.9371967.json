Collins and Joann Barrett appeal an order of the District Court for the Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County, denying their petition to remove Norwest Investment Management and Trust (Norwest) as trustee of their grandmother\u2019s testamentary trust and to appoint a new trustee. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">\u00b62 Appellants presented two issues on appeal which we have restated for clarity as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court had discretion to deny Appellants\u2019 request to remove Norwest, the institutional trustee of this testamentary trust, and appoint an individual trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in awarding Norwest its attorney's fees and expenses in defending this action in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">\u00b65 In addition, Norwest presented the following two issues on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b66 3. Whether the District Court erred in failing to allow Norwest to recover all of its attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred in preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b67 4. Whether Norwest is entitled to reimbursement from the trust for its attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b68 Appellants are the beneficiaries of a testamentary trust established by the will of their grandmother, Mildred I. Berthot. Berthot executed her will on April 6,1953. Under the terms of the will, all of her estate, with the exception of her jewelry, household goods and personal belongings, was bequeathed to Security Bank and Trust Company of Bozeman as trustee. Security Bank and Trust was founded by Berthot\u2019s late husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u00b69 The trust went into effect when Berthot\u2019s will was admitted to probate and subsequently settled on May 14,1962. The initial income beneficiary of the trust was Bernice B. Klingensmith, Berthot\u2019s daughter and Appellants\u2019 mother. When Klingensmith died in 1994, Appellants became the income beneficiaries entitling them to receive the net income from the trust during their lifetime. Upon the death of whichever Appellant dies last, the trust will terminate and the principal will be distributed equally among Appellants\u2019 six children. \u00b610 By order dated September 26,1966, the District Court confirmed Norwest as successor trustee to Security Bank and Trust Company. When Norwest became the trustee in 1966, the trust held assets valued at $166,757 of which $118,834 consisted of stock in several corporations; $28,661 was a real estate contract from the sale of farm land; $17,072 was a mortgage for the sale of city lots; $400 was in an escrow account; and $1,790 was in cash. Thus, of the original portfolio, 71% was in stock and 29% was in income producing assets. In 1966, the trust had income of $4,720 annually. As of the end of 1998, the value of the trust assets was $1,393,058 with income of $28,487 annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\u00b611 In administering the trust, Norwest has made monthly payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>of income to Appellants and has provided Appellants annually with both fiscal year itemized statements and calendar year itemized statements. These statements itemize receipts and disbursements of the trust and describe the current assets and asset values of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"ApZ\">\u00b612 After Klingensmith\u2019s death, Appellants sent Norwest two letters in which they asked several questions concerning Norwest\u2019s management of the trust, requested information concerning past performance of the trust, and requested details of a particular bond fund in which part of the trust assets were invested. Norwest duly responded to both letters, but heard nothing more from Appellants until Norwest filed its \u201cPetition for Settlement of its Twenty-Ninth Account of Successor Trustee\u201d on June 4, 1998. This Twenty-Ninth Accounting covered the two-year period from October 1, 1995, to September 30, 1997, and claimed trustee fees for that period of $16,403.68 and attorney\u2019s fees of $1,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b613 On July 29,1998, Appellants filed an objection to the accounting requesting that the District Court postpone its ruling to allow Appellants time to gather information to support a petition. Based on this objection, the court postponed a hearing on the Twenty-Ninth Accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b614 On May 20, 1999, Appellants filed their \u201cVerified Petition to Remove Trustee and Appoint New Trustee,\u201d in which they sought the replacement of Norwest and the appointment of Edwin G. Davis, a family friend, as trustee. Appellants alleged in their petition that they are dissatisfied because Norwest allowed the trust to become heavily invested in equities which do not produce maximum income for the beneficiaries and, instead, generate excessive fees for Norwest. Besides Appellants (the income beneficiaries), the petition was verified by five of the six residual beneficiaries. The sixth residual beneficiary stated that she chose to \u201cremain neutral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b615 A hearing in this matter was held on July 2,1999, at which time the parties appeared and presented witnesses and exhibits. On February 1, 2000, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order wherein it concluded that Appellants failed to establish that Norwest should be removed as trustee and that the individual proposed by Appellants as a substitute trustee was not qualified. The court also approved Norwest\u2019s Twenty-Ninth Accounting, including the trustee fees, but denied awarding Norwest its attorney\u2019s fees in preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting and in defending this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b616 Appellants filed their notice of appeal in the District Court on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>February 29, 2000, arguing that the District Court erred in not removing Norwest as trustee and in approving the Twenty-Ninth Accounting. Norwest filed its notice of cross-appeal on March 13,2000, arguing that the District Court erred in failing to award Norwest its attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in this litigation. While Norwest contended in its notice of cross-appeal that Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely because a judgment in this matter had not yet been entered, Norwest filed its notice in the event that it was ultimately determined that Appellants\u2019 notice was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b617 Meanwhile, on March 7, 2000, Norwest filed a motion in the District Court requesting that the court amend its order regarding reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in defending this action arguing that Norwest is entitled by law to reimbursement from the trust. In its motion, Norwest also sought clarification of the court\u2019s order regarding reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting. Appellants objected to Norwest\u2019s motion arguing that once the appeal had been filed, the District Court lost jurisdiction to consider Norwest\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b618 On April 21,2000, the District Court issued a Memorandum and Order concluding that it did have jurisdiction to consider Norwest\u2019s motion because the motion was timely under Rule 52(b), M.R.Civ.P., and as such, pursuant to Rule 5, M.R.App.P., the notice of appeal would be treated as being filed after the District Court\u2019s order. In addition, the District Court denied Norwest\u2019s request to modify its previous order regarding attorneys fees and costs for preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting. The court did, however, determine that although Norwest was not entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees from Appellants, it was entitled to be reimbursed by the trust for its attorney\u2019s fees and costs in defending this action. Consequently, the court amended its previous order to that affect and stated that the amount of those attorney's fees and costs would be determined at a subsequent hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b619 On June 5, 2000, Norwest filed a motion with this Court requesting that we remand the case to the District Court for a determination of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs Norwest incurred in defending this action. Hence, by order of this Court dated June 27,2000, the case was remanded and, on September 18,2000, the District Court entered an order approving an award of attorney\u2019s fees to Norwest from the trust in the amount of $10,463.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b620 Thereafter, Appellants filed a supplemental notice of appeal and a motion to file a supplemental brief since their original brief on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>was filed prior to the District Court\u2019s order approving attorney\u2019s fees. On October 18, 2000, this Court granted Appellants\u2019 motion. Appellants filed their supplemental brief on November 8, 2000, in which they argued that the District Court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Norwest. Norwest duly filed its brief on appeal, including therein its arguments on cross-appeal, and Appellants replied. Norwest declined to file a reply brief on its cross-appeal issue and this case was finally submitted for review to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Eggebrecht, </em>2000 MT 189, \u00b6 18, 300 Mont. 409, \u00b6 18, 4 P.3d 1207, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>1998 MT 303, \u00b6 29, 292 Mont. 97, \u00b6 29, 971 P.2d 767, \u00b6 29). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether that court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Eggebreeht, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b622 <em>Whether the District Court had discretion to deny Appellants\u2019 request to remove Norwest, the institutional trustee of this testamentary trust, and appoint an individual trustee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b623 Appellants contend that the District Court erred in failing to remove Norwest as trustee of the Berthot Trust because Norwest failed to heed the purpose of the trust to provide income for the beneficiaries; failed to heed its own guidelines on maintaining income producing instruments; and maximized its own fees at the beneficiaries\u2019 expense. Appellants also contend that the court improperly applied the law by focusing on Norwest\u2019s entitlement to hold its position instead of focusing on the best interests of the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b624 Norwest argues, on the other hand, that it has acted within the powers granted to it as trustee under both the will and applicable Montana law, and that Norwest has achieved excellent results for both the income beneficiaries and the remainder beneficiaries. Norwest maintains that there is no evidence in the record of any misconduct by Norwest or anything else to justify overruling the District Court\u2019s exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u00b625 Section 72-33-618(2), MCA, provides the following grounds for removal of a trustee by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">(a) if the trustee has committed a breach of the trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">(b) if the trustee is insolvent or otherwise unfit to administer the trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>(c) if hostility or lack of cooperation among cotrustees impairs the administration of the trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">(d) if the trustee fails or declines to act; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">(e) for other good cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">In addition, \u00a7 72-33-618(3), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">If it appears to the court that trust property or the interests of a beneficiary may suffer loss or injury pending a decision on a petition for removal of a trustee and any appellate review, the court may, on its own motion or on petition of a cotrustee or beneficiary, compel the trustee whose removal is sought to surrender trust property to a cotrustee or to a receiver or temporary trustee. The court may also suspend the powers of the trustee to the extent the court considers necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b626 Appellants contend that four of the statutory grounds for removal of a trustee exist in this case. First, they argue that subsection (a) of \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA, exists here because Norwest has breached the trust by failing to follow the purposes of the trust, which they claim is to provide income to the beneficiaries. Appellants argue that they are receiving poor service from Norwest because Norwest is managing the trust to maximize its fees. Although the trust assets have grown to nearly $1.4 million, Appellants each receive only $13,000 in income from the trust each year, while Norwest receives more than $8,000 in fees each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u00b627 Second, Appellants argue that subsection (c) of \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA, exists here because hostility and lack of cooperation between the trustee and the beneficiaries impairs the trust. Appellants rely on <em>May v. May </em>(1897), 167 U.S. 310, 17 S.Ct. 824, 42 L.Ed. 179, for the proposition that the rule set forth in <em>May </em>governing removal of a trustee because of hostility or lack of cooperation among co-trustees applies equally to those conditions between trustee and beneficiary and, thus, that rule is applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u00b628 In <em>May, </em>the testator devised and bequeathed all of his estate to his wife and his six children. In a codicil dated one year after the will, testator appointed his son William as co-trustee along with testator\u2019s wife. In the year and a half after testator\u2019s death, testator\u2019s wife, along with the other five children, attempted to have William removed as co-trustee and another individual appointed in his place, because William was \u201cuntrustworthy, dishonest, dictatorial, and disagreeable in manner, and incompetent as a business man.\u201d <em>May, </em>167 U.S. at 317-18, 17 S.Ct. at 827. The United States Supreme Court determined in <em>May </em>that a clause in the codicil gave testator\u2019s other heirs power to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>William as co-trustee by unanimous vote without having to resort to a court of equity. <em>May, </em>167 U.S. at 320, 17 S.Ct. at 827-28. Thus, Appellants in this case argue that they have the power to remove Norwest as trustee because of hostility between Appellants and Norwest.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b629 Third, Appellants argue that subsection (d) of \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA, exists here because the evidence is undisputed that Norwest, knowing of the beneficiaries\u2019 desire for more income, refused to act and was hostile, rude and defensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b630 Fourth, Appellants argue that good cause under subsection (e) of \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA, exists here because Norwest has violated its duty of loyalty by maximizing its fees at the expense of the beneficiaries. At the end of 1998, the trust contained 87% equities rather than the 70% Norwest claimed as its investment objective. Since Norwest bases its fee on the total market value of the portfolio, the growth in equities, while reducing or holding steady the income of the beneficiaries, yields a higher income for Norwest. Appellants contend this creates a conflict of interest for Norwest and good cause for removing Norwest as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b631 Norwest argues, on the other hand, that Appellants\u2019 assertions about the trust are mistaken in several key respects. First, Norwest contends that the will does not permit the trustee to liquidate principal assets and distribute them to income beneficiaries except in very limited circumstances that do not exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b632 Second, Norwest contends that the will does not establish a goal of maximum income to the income beneficiaries. Instead, it establishes a split interest trust providing for the payment of net income to the income beneficiaries and the preservation and appreciation of the principal assets for ultimate distribution to the remainder beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\u00b633 Third, Norwest contends that the will does not provide the beneficiaries the right to control or consult on the investment strategy for the trust. Rather, Norwest contends that the will gives the trustee full discretion to make investment decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\u00b634 Finally, Norwest contends that <em>May </em>is distinguishable from the facts in this case because the trust document in <em>May </em>gave the beneficiaries the power to remove the trustee by a unanimous vote. Norwest argues that that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u00b635 As Norwest points out in its brief on appeal, it is a basic principle of trust law that a trust is to be managed to carry out the testator\u2019s intent. <em>In re Estate of Lindgren </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 96, 100, 885 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>1280, 1282. Therefore, the threshold inquiry in any trust case is to examine the terms of the trust document. <em>In re George Trust </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 341, 344, 834 P.2d 1378, 1380.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">The intention of the testator should control the disposition and the intent shall \u201cbe found from all parts of the will... construed in relation to each other ... to form one consistent whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><em>George, </em>253 Mont, at 344, 834 P.2d at 1380 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b636 Paragraphs (a)( 1) through (a)(12) of the will establish the trustee\u2019s power to deal with trust assets. For example, paragraph (a)(4) provides that the trustee has the authority</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">[t]o sell, convey, lease, pledge, mortgage, transfer, exchange, or grant options upon any part or parts of the property of the trust estate, for such amounts, and upon such terms, and in such maimer, as to the trustee shall seem <em>for the best interests of the trust estate, </em>without an order of court therefor, and with or without notice;... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">However, nothing in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(12) give the trustee the power to distribute trust assets other than net income to the income beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u00b637 Paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of the will describe certain ancillary powers of the trustee and provide for the trustee\u2019s compensation. More specifically, paragraph (b)(2) provides that the trustee has the right to fair and just compensation from the trust estate, and paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) give the trustee the authority to employ agents and attorneys and allow the trustee to be reimbursed for all such reasonable expenses incurred. To that end the District Court concluded that Norwest\u2019s fees are consistent with the fees generally charged by professional corporate fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">\u00b638 Paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(13) describe the purposes of the will and give directions to the trustee for the distribution of income to the various beneficiaries. The only provision in the will allowing for the invasion of trust principal to be paid to a beneficiary is contained in paragraph (c)(3), which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">During the minority or other disability of any beneficiary of the trust, to whom payments of income or payments of principal in the discretion of the trustee are to be made, the trustee may make such payments .... For the purpose of this paragraph, a beneficiary shall be deemed to be under disability if under a legal disability declared or adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, or if incapacitated +o such an extent as in the opinion of the trustee shall make it im ossible or impracticable for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>beneficiary to give prompt and intelligent consideration to business matters. The trustee may accept and act upon such evidence of disability, incapacity, or incompetency of any beneficiary as the trustee may deem appropriate and reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">All of the beneficiaries in this case are above the age of majority and Appellants do not claim to be disabled, incapacitated or incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"A0u6\">\u00b639 The most telling provision of the will, as far as this action is concerned, is paragraph (c)(6) which gives the trustee the sole discretion to decide whether to place the assets into income producing property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">And the trustee shall have full power and authority to invest and reinvest the principal in any kind of property whether such property is actually producing income or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Moreover, throughout the wdll, the testator consistently instructs the trustee to act in \u201cthe best interests of <em>the trust estate\u201d </em>rather than in the best interests of the income beneficiaries. These provisions belie Appellants\u2019 contention that the primary purpose of the trust is to provide maximum income to the income beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b640 Furthermore, as Norwest points out, the trust terminates on the death of both Appellants even if their mother, Klingensmith, were still alive. Consequently, this provision also contradicts Appellants\u2019 argument that the purpose of the trust is to provide maximum income to the income beneficiaries for if both Appellants died prior to the death of Klingensmith, not only would Appellants not receive income from the trust, but Klingensmith would also stop receiving income from the trust regardless of her economic position at the time of Appellants\u2019 deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\u00b641  In short, we agree with Norwest that under the terms of the will and under the provisions of \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA, there is no justification for removing Norwest as trustee. We also agree wdth Norwest that Appellants\u2019 dissatisfaction with the performance of the trust under Norwest\u2019s trusteeship is not justified in light of the trust\u2019s performance. The District Court correctly found that over the course of Norwest\u2019s tenure as trustee through the end of 1998, the principal assets of the trust have increased 835% and the income has increased 604%.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b642  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are both supported by substantial evidence and are legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">\u00b643 That said, the dissents have raised several contentions that deserve a response. First, Justice Cotter argues in her dissent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>since the beneficiaries were \u201cvirtually unanimous\u201d in their request to modify the trust, \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA, justifies removal of Norwest as trustee. However, \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA, does not allow modification or termination of a trust unless there is <em>unanimous </em>agreement among the beneficiaries, not <em>virtually unanimous </em>agreement as Justice Cotter contends.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">Modification or termination of irrevocable trust by <em>all </em>beneficiaries. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if <em>all </em>beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust consent, they may compel modification or termination of the trust upon petition to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZT\">Section 72-33-406(1), MCA (emphasis added). The word \u201call\u201d is defined as \u201cthe whole of; <em>every </em>member of.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New American Dictionary </em>14 (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b644 Second, while Justice Cotter is correct that the sixth residual beneficiary, Leslie Barrett, chose to \u201cremain neutral,\u201d Barrett\u2019s failure to disagree is not an indication that she agrees with removal of Norwest as trustee. The dictionary defines the word \u201cneutral\u201d as \u201cnot favoring <em>either </em>side in a quarrel, contest, or war.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New American Dictionary </em>349 (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b645 Furthermore, in her letter expressing her desire to remain neutral, Barrett stated that she was not knowledgeable in the area of trusts and that she felt \u201cit should be left to the actual Beneficiaries as well as someone with an acute business acumen and experience to handle such issues.\u201d Justice Cotter claims that this statement \u201cleaves the clear indication that [Barrett] would defer to the actual beneficiaries ... as to the propriety of removing the trustee in favor of a successor trustee.\u201d However, if that were the case, then why didn\u2019t Barrett go ahead and \u201cdefer\u201d to the income beneficiaries\u2019 wishes and agree to the removal of Norwest as trustee? Contrary to Justice Cotter\u2019s interpretation of Barrett\u2019s statement, \u201cthe clear indication\u201d is that Barrett wants the trust left as is until someone with \u201can acute business acumen and experience\u201d advises otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b646 Third, while Justice Cotter urges the application of \u00a7 72-33-406(1), MCA, in this situation, she fails to recognize that \u00a7 72-33-406(2), MCA, prohibits modification or termination of the trust-even if all of the beneficiaries agree- <em>\u201c\\i]f the continuance of the trust is necessary to carry out a material purpose of the </em>trust....\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 72-33-407(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">If any beneficiary does not consent to the modification or termination of the trust, upon petition to the court, the other beneficiaries, with the consent of the trustor, may compel a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>modification or a partial termination of the trust <em>if the interests of the beneficiaries who do not consent are not substantially impaired. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b647 As we noted previously in this majority Opinion, the purpose of the trust is not to provide income for the income beneficiaries, but rather, to preserve trust assets for later distribution to the residual beneficiaries. Removal of Norwest as trustee and modification of the trust to provide more income to the income beneficiaries and, consequently, less assets for the eventual distribution to the residual beneficiaries, would substantially impair the interests of the residual beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b648 Fourth, Justice Cotter faults the majority for placing the interests of the trustee ahead of the interests of the beneficiaries. On the contrary, we are simply following the basic principle of trust law that a trust is to be managed to carry out <em>the testator\u2019s </em>intent, not the intent of the trustee or even of the beneficiaries. <em>See Lindgren, </em>268 Mont. at 100, 885 P.2d at 1282; <em>George, </em>253 Mont. at 344, 834 P.2d at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"AAD\">\u00b649 Fifth, in his dissent, Justice Trieweiler takes issue with the majority\u2019s determination that the purpose of the trust is to preserve trust assets for later distribution to the residual beneficiaries rather than to provide income for the income beneficiaries. He argues that it would have been unnatural for Mildred to be more concerned about the amount of the residual estate left to her yet unborn great grandchildren than the three descendants who were specifically mentioned as income beneficiaries of her trust and that Mildred\u2019s primary reason for establishing the trust was to benefit her three named descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b650 On the contrary, if that were the case, then why didn\u2019t Mildred make her grandchildren the residual beneficiaries, rather than the income beneficiaries, and distribute the remainder of her estate to them after her daughter passed away and after the grandchildren reached an appropriate age? Why keep her grandchildren locked into receiving only the income from the trust? While both the majority and the dissent can speculate all day as to Mildred\u2019s reasons for setting up the trust in the way she did, the simple fact is that no one knows why. We can only go by the wording of the trust document itself and in that document Mildred consistently instructs the trustee to act in \u201cthe best interests of <em>the trust estate\u201d </em>rather than in the best interests of the income beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b651 Sixth, Justice Trieweiler uses various mathematical comparisons in his dissent to illustrate his point that Norwest\u2019s fees have steadily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>increased. While we do not dispute that Norwest\u2019s fees have increased along with the value of the trust itself, it is important to point out that the District Court concluded, and Appellants did not dispute, that Norwest\u2019s fees are consistent with the fees generally charged by professional corporate fiduciaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b652 Finally, both Justices Cotter and Trieweiler assert that, rather than depleting trust resources to defend its position, Norwest should have granted the beneficiaries\u2019 request that it resign. They fail to note, however, that Norwest has simply followed the terms of the trust document and that it is because of Norwest\u2019s capable management of the trust that both the assets and the income of the trust have substantially increased over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b653 <em>Whether the District Court erred in awarding Norwest its attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in defending this action in the trial court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6z\">\u00b654 On September 18, 2000, the District Court entered an order approving an award of $10,463 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Norwest for defending this action. In addition, the court determined that that amount should be paid by the trust, rather than by Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b655 We have repeatedly stated that absent a contractual agreement or statutory provision, the prevailing party in a civil action is not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>In re Estate of Dern Family Trust </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 138, 154, 928 P.2d 123, 133 (citing <em>Thompkins v. Fuller </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 168, 186, 667 P.2d 944, 954). This case, however, is one in which both contractual and statutory provisions govern the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b656 Appellants argue on appeal that the award of attorney\u2019s fees to Norwest should be vacated because it is not reasonable given that Norwest \u201cbreached the Trust, ignored the Trust\u2019s purposes, and managed the Trust for its own financial benefit.\u201d As Appellants note in their supplemental brief, they do not challenge the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees, but rather, they object to any award of attorney\u2019s fees to Norwest. They maintain that a trustee has a duty to administer a trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries and that Norwest failed to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">\u00b657 We disagree. As we already noted elsewhere in this Opinion it is a basic principle of trust law that a trust is to be managed to carry out \u2022 the testator\u2019s intent. <em>Lindgren, </em>268 Mont. at 100, 885 P.2d at 1282. And, as we held in the previous issue, Norwest did exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\u00b658  Furthermore, as we also noted in the previous issue, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>threshold inquiry in any trust case is to examine the terms of the trust document. <em>George, </em>253 Mont. at 344, 834 P.2d at 1380. In this case, paragraph (b)(4) of the will provides: \u201cMy trustee shall be reimbursed out of the trust estate for all reasonable expenses incurred in its management or protection, including attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 72-33-631, MCA, provides that a trustee \u201cis entitled to the repayment out of the trust property for ... expenditures that were properly incurred in the administration of the trust;...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b659 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s award of attorney's fees and expenses to Norwest for defending this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b660 <em>Whether the District Court erred in failing to allow Norwest to recover all of its attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred in preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b661 In its February 1,2000 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, the District Court approved Norwest\u2019s Twenty-Ninth Accounting, including the trustee fees, but denied awarding Norwest its attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting. Norwest subsequently filed a motion in the District Court seeking clarification of the court\u2019s order. On April 21,2000, the District Court issued a Memorandum and Order denying Norwest\u2019s request to modify its previous order regarding attorney\u2019s fees and expenses for preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u00b662 Norwest now argues on appeal that the will, the provisions of the Montana trust statutes and prior decisions of this Court support Norwest\u2019s right to reimbursement for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting. The reason the District Court gave for denying the fees and expenses of presenting the Twenty-Ninth Accounting was that the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees were unsubstantiated. Norwest argues that while that justifies withholding approval of those fees and expenses until such time as Norwest provides proper supporting evidence, it does not justify an outright denial of the fees and expenses. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">\u00b663 Paragraph (b)(4) of the will directs that the trustee be reimbursed \u201cout of the trust estate for all reasonable expenses incurred in its management or protection, including attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 72-33-631, MCA, provides that a trustee is entitled to reimbursement from the trust for necessary expenses. And, finally, in <em>Dern, </em>this Court held that a trustee is entitled to recover its attorney's fees absent a showing of breach of the trustee\u2019s fiduciary duties. <em>Dern, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>279 Mont. at 154-56, 928 P.2d at 133-34. No such showing was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b664  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in failing to allow Norwest to recover its attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred in preparing the Twenty-Ninth Accounting and we remand for further proceedings in the District Court to determine the amount of those attorneys fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b665 <em>Whether Norwest is entitled to reimbursement from the trust for its attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses of this appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u00b666 Norwest argues that it is also entitled to reimbursement from the trust for attorneys fees and expenses it incurred in responding to this appeal. In addition, Norwest requests direction on whether those fees and expenses should be charged equally to the principal and income portions of the trust, or whether they should be charged entirely to income inasmuch as the income beneficiaries caused the fees and expenses to be incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u00b667 As we stated in our discussion under Issues 2 and 3 of this Opinion, paragraph (b)(4) of the will allows the trustee to be reimbursed out of the trust estate \u201cfor all reasonable expenses incurred in its management or protection.\u201d We conclude that responding to this appeal is a reasonable expense incurred in the management and protection of the trust. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 72-33-631, MCA; <em>Dern, </em>279 Mont. at 154-56, 928 P.2d at 133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u00b668  Accordingly, we hold that Norwest is entitled to reimbursement from the trust for its attorneys fees and expenses on appeal and we remand to the District Court for a determination of the amount of those fees and expenses and for a determination of whether those fees and expenses should be charged equally to the principal and income portions of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\u00b669 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b404-12\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"A-i\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">\u00b670 I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that there is no justification for the removal of Norwest as trustee. The Court reached this conclusion pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA. I would reach the opposite conclusion, premised upon both \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA, and \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00b671 As the Court points out, the income beneficiaries (Appellants) and five of the six residual beneficiaries joined in the petition to remove the trustee and appoint a new trustee. The Court further notes that the sixth residual beneficiary stated that she chose to \u201cremain neutral.\u201d (Majority Opinion, at \u00b6 14). In actuality, the sixth residual beneficiary, Leslie Barrett, indicated in a \u201cTo Who it May Concern\u201d letter made part of the record, that she chose to remain neutral because \"... I am not knowledgeable in the area of Trusts and I feel it should be left to the actual Beneficiaries as well as someone with an acute business acumen and experience to handle such issues.\u201d Thus, while Barrett expressed an interest in remaining neutral, her letter leaves the clear indication that she would defer to the actual beneficiaries (the appellants herein) as to the propriety of removing the trustee in favor of a successor trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b672 In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the District Court referenced, but declined to apply, \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA, which allows for modification or termination of an irrevocable trust by all beneficiaries. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if all beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust consent, they may compel modification or termination of the trust upon petition to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">(2) If continuance of the trust is necessary to carry out a material purpose of the trust, the trust cannot be modified or terminated unless the court, in its discretion, determines that the reason for doing so under the circumstances outweighs the interest in accomplishing a material purpose of the trust....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Section 72-33-406, MCA. I believe sub-section (1) of this statute squarely applies here, and the District Court erred in refusing to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b673 Section 72-33-618, MCA, which specifically addresses removal of a trustee, permits a trustee to be removed by the court on its own motion or on petition of a beneficiary. Moreover, the grounds for removal of a trustee under the statute are not statutorily limited. As \u00a7 72-33-618(2)(e), MCA, indicates, a trustee may be removed by the court for specified reasons or for \u201cother good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\u00b674 The District Court stated it would not apply \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA, in part because the instant action was not an action to modify or terminate the trust, but was rather a petition to remove the trustee, which is governed by \u00a7 72-33-618, MCA. I do not agree that the two statutes are mutually exclusive. Security Bank and Trust Company of Bozeman, Montana was named in the original trust agreement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>trastee. Norwest is its duly authorized successor. Thus, if the trustee is to be changed, then the trust by necessity has to be modified. Appellants\u2019 petition therefore qualifies as both a petition to modify an irrevocable trust, pursuant to \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA, and a petition for removal of a trustee, pursuant to \u00a7 72-33-618, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b675 Section 72-33-406(1), MCA, provides that beneficiaries, if they all agree that modification is necessary, may \u201ccompel modification\u201d of the trust upon petition to the court. I would conclude that the virtually unanimous request of the beneficiaries (seven in favor and one abstaining but not objecting) to modify the trust should have been granted pursuant to \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA, and that this statutory basis for removal of the trustee constitutes \u201cother good cause\u201d under \u00a7 72-33-618(2)(e), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b676 In deferring to the trustee as it has in its Opinion, over the express objection of the beneficiaries, I believe the majority has erroneously placed the interests of the trustee ahead of the interests of the beneficiaries. Rather than spending trust money to protect its position, the trustee should have granted the request of the beneficiaries that it resign. Such an approach would not have been a disservice to the trust. More to the point, it would have avoided the instant litigation and would have prevented the significant depletion of trust monies used to pay the trustee\u2019s fees and expenses. I would conclude that the trustee\u2019s adamant refusal to resign in the face of a virtually unanimous request that it do so, and its concomitant depletion of trust resources to defend its position, demonstrates that it was ultimately more interested in protecting its trustee\u2019s fees than in serving the beneficiaries of the trust. The trustee has an obligation to administer a trust \u201csolely in the interest of the beneficiaries.\u201d Section 72-34-103(1), MCA. I agree with the beneficiaries that the trustee\u2019s conduct in this matter would support a finding that the trustee has breached this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b677 For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s decision not to remove Norwest as trustee. I dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b406-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AkO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b678 I join in the dissent of Justice Cotter to the extent that it is based on \u00a7 72-33-618(2), MCA. I conclude, based on the following additional thoughts, that removal of, and substitution of, Norwest Investment Management and Trust as trustee of the Berthot Estate was appropriate under both subsection (a) for breach of the trust and subsection (e) for other good cause. I depart from that dissent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>extent that it would reverse the District Court on the basis of \u00a7 72-33-406, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b679 I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a trust must be managed to carry out the testator\u2019s intent. My problem with the majority Opinion is what I believe to be its premise as set forth in \u00b6 47 where the majority states, \u201cthe purpose of the trust is not to provide income for the income beneficiaries, but rather, to preserve trust assets for later distribution to the residual beneficiaries.\u201d To believe that is to believe that Mildred I. Berthot, who executed this testamentary trust at the age of 73, in 1953 cared more about her unborn and unknown great grandchildren than she did her own daughter and living grandchildren. To make that assumption defies everything that I understand about human nature and relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b680 Mildred\u2019s will, which includes the trust, mentions only three beneficiaries, her daughter Bernice B. Klingensmith and her granddaughters, Ellen M. Collins and Joanne Barrett, who are the petitioners in this case. Collins was 11 years old when the trust was executed and had no children. Barrett was 24 and, based on the record, may or may not have recently given birth to her first child but no others. (The oldest child has joined in the petition to replace the trustee.) It would have been unnatural for Mildred to be more concerned about the amount of the residual estate left to her yet unborn great grandchildren than the three descendants who were specifically mentioned as income beneficiaries of her trust and I would conclude that her primary reason for establishing the trust was to benefit her three named descendants. The original trustee would have known that. Mildred designated Security Bank and Trust of Bozeman as trustee. Her husband was a founder and the officers were friends of the family. It was not until after her death that Norwest was substituted as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b681 The majority state in \u00b6 51 that Mildred\u2019s exact intent is a matter of speculation. I agree and only speculated based on the corresponding effort to do so in the majority Opinion. However, I continue to believe that reliance on human nature will bring us closer to the truth than reliance on the legal fiction drawn from boilerplate language that this 73 year old grandmother of two intended the current consequences of the discretion she vested in her family bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b682 As Justice Cotter mentions in her dissenting opinion, the trust simply has not been managed by Norwest for the benefit of Mildred\u2019s three named descendants. From the time of Bernice Klingensmith\u2019s death in 1994, the percentage of the trust value paid to Mildred\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>grandchildren has steadily declined and the fee paid to Norwest has steadily increased as the following table indicates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">Year Market Value Percent of Market Distribution Value Distributed to Each To Beneficiaries Beneficiary Norwest Fee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE_\">1994 $ 565,599.80 3.9% $ 3,108.92 $ 4,807.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab_\">1995 $ 717,893.22 3.7% $13,334.67 $ 6,102.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asi\">1996 $ 861,648.30 2.9% $12,325.32 $ 7,324.01</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A40\">1997 $1,096,306.23 2.1% $11,662.74 $ 9,318.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An2\">1998 $1,393,057.53 1.7% $12,121.23 $11,841.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-22\">\u00b683 The fact is that Norwest now receives practically the same amount in fees as is distributed as income to each of Mildred\u2019s granddaughters. Furthermore, because Norwest collects half of its fee from the residual beneficiaries and half of its fee from the income beneficiaries, the income beneficiaries bear an increasingly disproportionate share of that expense. The trustee\u2019s fee in 1998 equals nearly 49% of the income distributed to the income beneficiaries compared to 22% of the income distributed in 1995. By comparison, the percentage of Norwest\u2019s fee paid by the residual beneficiaries in 1998 was the equivalent of .42%.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-23\">\u00b684 In 1998, while Mildred\u2019s grandchildren were receiving 1.7% of the trust\u2019s total value, Norwest was being paid a fee equal to 28% of the total dividend and interest income. If attorney and accounting fees are included, an amount equal to 31% of the total dividend and interest income was being paid to someone other than Mildred\u2019s intended income beneficiaries. By 1998, Norwest had achieved a financial position equal to Mildred\u2019s intended income beneficiaries. The reason was that from 1994 until 1998, the amount of the trust invested in equities increased from 70% to 87%. By 1998, it was clear to both beneficiaries, and five out of six of their children, that the trust was being managed primarily for the benefit of Norwest and not for the benefit of Mildred\u2019s two grandchildren. The reason is clear. It was acknowledged during the District Court proceedings by Neil Severinson, Norwest\u2019s vice-president and trust officer, when he gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the following answers to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\">Q. Mr. Severinson, there\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been wondering and perhaps you can clear it up for both me and the Court. Why if beneficiaries of this trust and five of the six residual beneficiaries of the trust have signed a petition saying they don\u2019t trust you and they don\u2019t want you, why don\u2019t you just resign?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">A. If the reason for asking that is because of the litany of alleged offenses, we don\u2019t believe we have done those things. We think we have had good performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">Q. The question is why are you fighting it whether it\u2019s true or not true? They don\u2019t trust your judgment. They don\u2019t trust your management. Why do you want to continue to be the trustee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">A. That is what we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">Q. It\u2019s the fees, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">A. That\u2019s why we are in the business; that\u2019s how we make our living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">Q. Alright. Okay. So you lose this trust, you lose some fees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-11\">A. Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-12\">Q. Okay. And you realize, don\u2019t you, that the higher the market value of the trust, the greater fees you\u2019re going to generate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">\u00b685 I would conclude there was sufficient basis, pursuant to \u00a7 72-33-618(2)(a) or (e), MCA, to remove Norwest as trustee and that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to do so. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the District Court refusing to do so and dissent from the majority Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-24\"> Based on Norwest\u2019s estimate, that fee is equivalent to 0.85% of trust value.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b409-15\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A4D\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">\u00b686 I concur with the Court\u2019s holding on all issues addressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"AmYY\">\u00b687 I am persuaded that the trustee\u2019s management of the estate cannot be faulted under the terms of this trust document, particularly the provisions of paragraph (a)(7), which indicate that the trustee shall have the authority to: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Clearly, investment strategy and decisions were placed in the absolute discretion of the trustee under this provision.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u00b688 That does not mean, however, that the trustee, within the broad discretion granted to it by the trust, could not or should not have managed the trust to produce a higher level of income for the income beneficiaries. I do not concur with the Court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe purpose of the trust is not to provide income for the income beneficiaries, but rather, to preserve trust assets for later distribution to the residual beneficiaries.\u201d Taken to the extreme, this conclusion could authorize the trustee to eliminate all income-producing investments in favor of growth investments. In my view, the trustor intended to provide for both groups of beneficiaries, and I am not persuaded that the language of the trust expresses a preference which favors one set of beneficiaries over the other, only that the trust gave the trustee wide latitude to make investment decisions in consideration of both groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b689 For these reasons, I concur with the Court\u2019s holding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
