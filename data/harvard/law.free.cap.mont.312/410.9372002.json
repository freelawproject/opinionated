Flynn also requested that the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sanction the State Fund for unreasonably reducing his temporary total disability benefits in an effort to recoup overpayments. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied both of Flynn\u2019s claims and Flynn appeals. We affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b63 1. Should the State Fund bear a proportionate share of the attorney fees incurred by Flynn to recover social security disability benefits based on the common fund doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b64 2. Was the State Fund entitled to reduce Flynn\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits to recover overpaid benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b65 On June 23, 1993, Robert Flynn was diagnosed with an occupational disease which developed as a result of repetitive work activities associated with his job at the Salish Kootenai College in Lake County, Montana. At all relevant times, the College was enrolled in Compensation Plan Number Three of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and insured by the State Fund. Following his diagnosis, Flynn filed a claim for compensation and the State Fund accepted liability and tendered medical and temporary total disability (TTD) benefits to Flynn. Flynn has remained totally disabled since 1993 and the State Fund recently conceded that Flynn is permanently totally disabled (PTD).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\u00b66 Sometime prior to 1996, Flynn also filed a claim for social security disability (SSD) benefits. His claim was initially denied but later awarded retroactively by an administrative law judge for the Social Security Administration. On February 8, 1996, after learning of the SSD award, the State Fund advised Flynn that it was going to reduce his biweekly benefits from $336.00 to $217.59, effective February 7, 1996. The State Fund also notified Flynn that because of the retroactive application of the SSD award, it intended to recoup $14,006.25 in overpaid benefits by an additional offset against Flynn\u2019s TTD benefits. However, the State Fund did not implement the offset \u25a0until September of2000. As a result, Flynn was overpaid an additional $947.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\u00b67 On September 26,2000, the State Fund notified Flynn of its intent to recoup $14,984.58 and began deducting an additional $49.86 from Flynn\u2019s weekly benefits. Flynn requested that the State Fund postpone its recoupment plan until May of 2001. The State Fund agreed to suspend the additional offset until April 24, 2001, at which time it would resume recoupment at the rate of $54.64 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u00b68 On October 30, 2000, Flynn filed a petition for hearing with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. The petition requested that the Court: 1) order the State Fund to pay a proportionate share of the attorney fees incurred to recover the SSD benefits; and 2) sanction the State Fund for unreasonably and unlawfully reducing Flynn\u2019s TTD benefits. On May 18, 2001, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied Flynn\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b69 The parties submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, and requested that the Court decide the legal issues presented by the parties. We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Matthews v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 225, \u00b6 5, 296 Mont. 76, \u00b6 5, 985 P.2d 741, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqM\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b610 Should the State Fund bear a proportionate share of the attorney fees incurred by Flynn to recover social security disability benefits based on the common fund doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b611 Sometime prior to 1996, Flynn submitted a claim for SSD benefits which the Social Security Administration denied. Subsequently, Flynn incurred approximately $4,000 in attorney fees to recover those benefits. Flynn contends that the State Fund benefitted from his SSD award as much as he did because it can now reduce the disability benefits paid to him by one-half the amount of the SSD award, and that it should therefore bear a proportionate share of the $4,000 attorney fee based on the common fund doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u00b612 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court rejected Flynn\u2019s attorney fee claim for three reasons. First, it cited <em>Stahl v. Ramsey Const. Co. </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 271, 811 P.2d 546, for the proposition that no statutory or contractual authority supports Flynn\u2019s apportionment claim. Second, the Court relied on <em>Murer v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 210, 942 P.2d 69, for its conclusion that the common fund doctrine \u201chas no application here [because] Claimant is not seeking attorney fees for others who may benefit by this decision, rather he is seeking attorney fees with respect to his own entitlement.\u201d Finally, the Court based its decision on statutory preemption. Citing <em>ISC Distributors, Inc. v. Trevor </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 185, 202, 903 P.2d 170, 180, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that \u201c[w]here a conflict arises between the common law and a statute, the common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>must yield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b613 In <em>Stahl, </em>the claimant incurred attorney fees to recover SSD benefits and the Social Security Administration withheld a percentage of the award for direct payment of his attorney fees. Following the claimant\u2019s SSD award, the State Fund determined that it was entitled to offset its future payment of benefits to account for the retroactive SSD award. The claimant contended that since he had not received the amount withheld for fees, it should not be included in the overpayment calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b614 This Court denied Stahl\u2019s request to, in effect, apportion costs and attorney fees because no statutory or contractual authority existed for doing so. <em>Stahl, </em>248 Mont. at 275, 811 P.2d at 548. However, Stahl presented a different theory for relief than is presented by Flynn. Stahl did not argue for application of the common fund doctrine. Therefore, this Court did not analyze the applicability of the common fund doctrine in <em>Stahl. </em>Accordingly, <em>Stahl </em>is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b615  Generally, the common fund doctrine authorizes assigning responsibility for fees among those individuals who benefit from the litigation which created the common fund. <em>See Morris B. Chapman &amp; Assocs., LTD. v. Kitzman </em>(Ill. 2000), 739 N.E.2d 1263, 1271. The doctrine entitles the party who created the fund to reimbursement of his or her reasonable attorney fees from the common fund. <em>Murer, </em>283 Mont. at 223, 942 P.2d at 76. Recently, in <em>Mountain West Farm Bureau v. Hall, </em>2001 MT 314, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, 308 Mont. 29, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, 38 P.3d 825, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, we summarized the elements of the common fund doctrine as follows: 1) an active beneficiary must create, reserve, or increase a common fund; 2) the active beneficiary must incur legal fees in establishing the common fund; and 3) the common fund must benefit ascertainable, non-participatingbeneficiaries. We enforce this doctrine because equity demands that all parties receiving a benefit from the common fund share in the cost of its creation. <em>See Means v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 395, 405, 625 P.2d 32, 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b616  With the aid of counsel, Flynn recovered SSD benefits in the approximate amount of $1000 per month. It is uncontroverted that Flynn incurred attorney fees to recover this award. This SSD award enabled the State Fund to reduce Flynn\u2019s weekly TTD benefits, and subsequent PTD benefits, by \u201cone-half the federal periodic benefits for the week\u201d pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-701(5) and -702(4), MCA. As a result of Flynn\u2019s litigation efforts, funds were recovered which accrued to the substantial benefit of the State Fund. While the State Fund reaped the benefit of Flynn\u2019s efforts, it was not required to intervene, risk expense, or hire an attorney throughout the litigation proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Consequently, we hold that Flynn\u2019s SSD award constitutes an existing, identifiable monetary fund or benefit in which an ascertainable, nonparticipating beneficiary maintains an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">\u00b617  The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly cited the general rule of statutory preemption. We agree that the common law is preempted where the law is statutorily declared. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-1-108, MCA; <em>Brewington v. Employers Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 297 Mont. 243, 248, 992 P.2d 237, 241. However, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is silent on the issue of attorney fee apportionment following benefit recoupment. Therefore, there exists no statutory declaration which preempts the equitable principles of the common fund doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b618  Accordingly, pursuant to the common fund doctrine, the State Fund should contribute, in proportion to the benefits it actually received, to the costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it denied Flynn\u2019s request for reasonable apportionment of attorney fees. To the extent it declined to apply the common fund doctrine, the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b619 Was the State Fund entitled to reduce Flynn\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits to recover overpaid benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b620 In 1993 the Legislature amended \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-701 and -702, MCA, to authorize insurers to suspend biweekly compensation benefits to recover overpayment from those claimants who receive social security benefits. However, the law in effect at the time of a work-related injury governs the determination of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the respective rights of the insurer and employer. <em>Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 318, 321, 730 P.2d 380, 382. Flynn was diagnosed with the occupational disease in June of 1993, prior to the amendments\u2019 July 1, 1993, effective date. Therefore, the 1991 version of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act governs the disposition of Flynn\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b621 Flynn cites <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court, </em>2000 MT 266, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 39, \u00b6 18, 22 P.3d 166, \u00b6 18, for the proposition that when the Legislature amends a statute, this Court will presume that it intended to implement some change in the existing law. Flynn argues that the Legislature\u2019s 1993 amendments imply that an insurer\u2019s unfettered right of recoupment did not exist prior to July 1, 1993. Relying on a 1993 judgment from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, Flynn insists that prior to July 1, 1993, an insurer could not unilaterally suspend benefits to recoup overpayments absent a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>order or the injured claimant\u2019s consent. Flynn maintains that the State Fund had neither and, therefore, was not entitled to terminate or reduce his benefits to recover an alleged overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b622 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court rejected Flynn\u2019s characterization of the state of the law on overpayment recoupment in 1991. In so doing, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">The [Mackney] decision ... lends no support whatsoever to the claimant\u2019s position. There is nothing in the decision stating that an insurer cannot unilaterally reduce a claimant\u2019s benefits to recoup a SSD offset.... The law is clear that an insurer is entitled to offset SSD benefits. That law puts claimants on notice that if they receive retroactive benefits, the offset will apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">Claimant, however, urges that ... an insurer lacked authority prior to July 1,1993, to unilaterally reduce benefits to recoup the offset. The argument is without merit. The new [amendments] sanction suspension of all benefits to recoup the offset, which is the most extreme possible method of recoupment. There is nothing in the adoption of the section indicating that the legislature believed that insurers were prohibited from lesser measures of recoupment, and nothing in the prior statutes which precluded such lesser measures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b623 The 1991 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act authorized insurers to offset benefit distributions on account of an SSD award in \u00a7 39-71-701(5), MCA (1991), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">In cases where it is determined that periodic disability benefits granted by the Social Security Act are payable because of the injury, the weekly benefits payable under this section are reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal, as nearly as practical, to one-half the federal periodic benefits for such week, which amount is to be calculated from the date of the disability social security entitlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation offset statutes is to prevent duplication of disability pay. <em>Watson v. Seekins </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 309, 314-15, 763 P.2d 328, 332. Prior to 1993, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act failed to address the recovery of prior payments which become duplicate by virtue of a subsequent retroactive SSD award. However, what once was a procedural vacuum has now been statutorily defined. Nevertheless, the 1993 legislative enactments do not transform the prior silence into a prohibition on recovery of overpayments.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">\u00b624  Had the Social Security Administration accepted Flynn\u2019s initial claim, the State Fund could have reduced its weekly payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-701(5), MCA. (1991), from the time payments commenced. The fact that Flynn\u2019s SSD award was delayed should not preclude offset for the same amount. To accept Flynn\u2019s construction of the 1991 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act would be to frustrate the policy against double recovery. Therefore, we conclude that the State Fund was entitled to suspend a portion of Flynn\u2019s benefits to recover the alleged overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">\u00b625  Because the State Fund was entitled to offset Flynn\u2019s benefits, and the 1991 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides no methodology for recovering overpaid benefits, the only remaining question is whether the method employed by the State Fund was reasonable. In analyzing this same issue, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">An insurer has an obligation to act reasonably with regard to payment of benefits. I do not determine that an insurer\u2019s unilateral offset for overpayments is in every case reasonable. I only determine that it is not per se unreasonable for an insurer to recoup overpayments despite a claimant\u2019s objections. In this case, claimant has not presented sufficient evidence to persuade me that the State Fund\u2019s offset for recoupment was unreasonable. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We agree that nothing in the record indicates that the State Fund acted unreasonably in offsetting Flynn\u2019s benefits. Therefore, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err when it concluded that the State Fund was entitled to reduce Flynn\u2019s disbursements to the extent that it did to recover overpaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b626 The judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AHU\">JUSTICE LEAPHART did not participate in this Opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"AVS\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AQl\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b627 I concur with the Court\u2019s holding on Issue 2, but respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s holding under Issue 1. This is not an appropriate case for the common fund doctrine, and its application here impinges on state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\u00b628 First, there is no \u201ccommon\u201d fund. \u201c[W]hen a party has an interest in a fund in common with others and incurs legal fees in order to establish\u201d the fund, that party is entitled to reimbursement of legal fees. <em>Murer, </em>283 Mont. at 222, 942 P.2d at 76. The State Fund was not a party in Flynn\u2019s SSD proceeding, made no claim against the Social Security Administration, and does not share a claim with Flynn. Flynn\u2019s SSD award is personal to him and all funds obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>thereunder are entirely under his control. The State Fund has no claim of entitlement to, or power to control the disbursement of, any funds paid to Flynn by the Social Security Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b629 Neither is there a common interest. Flynn successfully pursued a personal claim for Social Security disability benefits. The State Fund has no such claim, but rather, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-701(5), and -702(4), MCA, is authorized to reduce payment of state statutory disability benefits in an amount of one-half of Flynn\u2019s federal benefits. Contrary to the Court\u2019s conclusion that this provision makes the State Fund an \u201cascertainable, non-participating beneficiary\u201d to Flynn\u2019s Social Security benefits, the State Fund\u2019s status here is one of creditor. The Fund is not a beneficiary with a common claim to federal benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"A5b\">\u00b630 In <em>Neal v. Stanislaus County </em>(1983), 141 Cal.App.3d 534, plaintiff attorney filed an action to compel the county to share payment of his attorney fees for recovery of Social Security income for his clients, who had received interim financial assistance from the county. Because his work resulted in the county being fully reimbursed amounts paid to his clients, the attorney claimed that the federal benefits constituted a common fund from which the county was paid as a passive beneficiary. He thus argued that the county was obligated to pay attorney fees in accordance with the benefits derived from the attorney\u2019s efforts, to avoid unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b631 The <em>Neal </em>court discussed the development of the common fund doctrine and noted particularly the existence of contractual obligations which furthered the doctrine. <em>Neal, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at 538. It concluded that the county\u2019s interim financial assistance program created a debtor-creditor relationship which removed it from a common fund sharing of attorney fees. <em>Neal, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at 538. In so doing, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">The mere fact that defendant [county] benefits from plaintiffs efforts does not in itself entitle plaintiff to fees from defendant. In <em>County of Tulare v. City of Dinuba </em>[citation omitted], the Supreme Court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201cThe underlying principle in all the cases where one has been allowed compensation out of a common fund belonging to others for expenses incurred and services rendered on behalf of the common interest is the principle of representation or agency .... The fact that one may be benefitted by an action brought by another is not of itself sufficient to justify a court in assessing costs against the one who also profits by said action. Some contractual relation or some equitable reason sufficient to support an allowance of costs must be shown to exist to justify a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>equity in making such assessment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">Here, there is no contractual relation or overriding equitable rationale of unfairness to plaintiff which supports an allowance of fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><em>Neal, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b632 While <em>Neal </em>involved state statutes and federal regulations not at issue here, its reasoning in regard to the common fund doctrine is instructive. Like the county in <em>Neal, </em>the State Fund receives a benefit, but that, without more, is an insufficient basis for application of the doctrine. The State Fund\u2019s benefit is one provided by a state statute which creates a creditor\u2019s claim, which the Fund and Flynn sought to negotiate. The Court\u2019s holding infringes upon that statute, because it deprives the State Fund from collecting the full 50 percent of Flynn\u2019s federal award authorized therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b633 The common fund doctrine is \u201crooted in the equitable concepts of quasi-contract.\u201d <em>Murer, </em>283 Mont. at 222, 942 P.2d at 76 (quoting <em>Means v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 395, 403, 625 P.2d 32, 37). It is applied in cases involving \u201cprincipled of representation or agency.\u201d <em>Neal, </em>141 Cal.App.3d at 539. Cases involving multiple beneficiaries, active and passive, with common interests in a common fund are appropriate for application of the doctrine. <em>See Rausch, Fisch and Frost v. State Compensation Insurance Fund, </em>2002 MT 203, \u00b6 48, 311 Mont. 210, \u00b6 48, 54 P.3d 25, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u00b634 The Court\u2019s merger of the common fund doctrine with the statute at issue here is error. Further, the Court\u2019s holding divorces the doctrine from its fundamental precepts. Arguably, the doctrine is now applicable to virtually anyone deriving a financial benefit from a claimant\u2019s settlement or award. That was not, and is not, the purpose of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\u00b635 I would affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, which would keep our case law on this issue consistent, as established in <em>Stahl.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b443-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the foregoing concurring and dissenting opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
