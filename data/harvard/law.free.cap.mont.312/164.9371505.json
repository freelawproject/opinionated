The Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County, sentenced Johnson and entered judgment. Johnson appeals from the sentence and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A53\">\u00b62 The issue before us is whether the District Court violated constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment in sentencing Johnson to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b63 The State of Montana charged Ira Johnson by information with assault with a weapon and two counts of partner or family member assault. A jury ultimately found Johnson guilty of assault with a weapon, but not guilty of the other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b64 The State\u2019s primary witness at trial was Lori Berg. She testified she and Ira Johnson began dating late in 1998. Johnson subsequently moved in with Berg on her ranch. In December of 2000, Johnson and Berg had a baby. During the course of her pregnancy, Berg confided to Sue Irvin, the director of Central Montana Family Planning, that Johnson emotionally abused her. Irvin testified that, on a subsequent visits to the clime, Berg told her of instances when Johnson had threatened her family and punched a hole in a wall at their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u00b65 According to Berg, both before and after the baby\u2019s birth, she and Johnson kept weapons in the house, some of which were loaded. Johnson often wore a pistol in a holster. Berg testified to a number of instances where Johnson threatened to kill her and her family members, and also slapped or hit her. Johnson attempted to limit Berg\u2019s contact with her family, and made particular threats against her brothers. He also made threats involving the baby on multiple occasions, including that he would sell the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u00b66 Berg and Johnson often fought about money. Berg testified that Johnson demanded they sell Berg\u2019s metal detector so he would have money. She also testified that approximately May 6, 2001, he picked up a 20-gauge shotgun, cocked it, pointed it at her and demanded to know where the metal detector was. She feared he would kill her. He already had made verbal threats to that effect, to the point that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Berg-fearing she would be killed-made out a will in March of 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"Azs\">\u00b67 On May 18, 2001, Berg obtained a restraining order against Johnson and filed a criminal complaint against him with the Fergus County Sheriffs Department. Deputy Sheriff Rick Vaughn met with Johnson to explain the restraining order to him and, according to Vaughn, Johnson responded with threats to kill Berg\u2019s family and stated he would try to take the baby and leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b68 Johnson testified in his own defense. He admitted that he used to \u201cgive full vent to [his] anger,\u201d but denied that he ever slapped Berg or pointed a gun at her. The jury convicted Johnson of the felony offense of assault with a weapon, but found him not guilty of the two misdemeanor counts of partner or family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b69 At the sentencing hearing, the State argued that Johnson needed significant time in custody in order to undergo rehabilitation, such as anger-management training. Furthermore, the State requested that, when Johnson is released from custody, he be prohibited from entering central Montana. Johnson asked for leniency, asserting he was not a threat to Berg or her family and pointing out to the court that this was his first criminal offense of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b610 The District Court expressed concern that, without rehabilitation, Johnson would be a risk to re-offend in another relationship. It sentenced Johnson to 20 years at the Montana State Prison, with the requirement that Johnson successfully complete an anger-management or similar program. The court also imposed numerous conditions on Johnson during any parole, including no contact with Berg or her family (except as permitted under a possible future child custody order) and no entry into Fergus County or any of the surrounding counties. Johnson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b611 Did the District Court violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment in sentencing Johnson to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s sentence for legality only and will not disturb a district court\u2019s sentence unless the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Clark, </em>2000 MT 40, \u00b6 16, 298 Mont. 300, \u00b6 16, 997 P.2d 107, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\u00b613 The jury convicted Johnson of the felony offense of assault with a weapon. Pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-213(2)(a), MCA, \u201ca person convicted of assault with a weapon shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed 20 years or be fined not more than $50,000, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>both.\u201d The District Court sentenced Johnson to 20 years at the Montana State Prison. The sentence is the maximum term authorized by statute, but also is within the statutory parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b614  The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 22 of the Montana Constitution both prohibit cruel and unusual punishment. However, we have long held that \u201ca sentence which falls within the statutory maximum is not cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>State v. Tadewaldt </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 261, 271, 922 P.2d 463, 469 (citations omitted). An exception to that general rule exists in cases where the sentence \u201cis so disproportionate to the crime that it shocks the conscience and outrages the moral sense of the community or of justice.\u201d <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 271, 922 P.2d at 469 (citation omitted). The defendant bears the burden of proving that a sentence falls within this exception. <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 271, 922 P.2d at 469 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b615 Johnson relies generally on <em>Tadewaldt </em>and <em>Clark </em>for the proposition that aggravating factors must be present to support a sentence at the upper range of sentences available. He asserts no aggravating factors exist in his case because, among other things, his use of a weapon was merely an element of the offense, the victim was not physically harmed and he has no prior criminal record. He argues the absence of aggravating factors supports his position that the <em>Tadewaldt </em>exception applies and, therefore, his sentence is cruel and unusual punishment. Neither of the cases on which Johnson relies support his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b616 In <em>Tadewaldt, </em>the defendant was convicted of a felony drug offense. He argued on appeal that a mandatory felony for a college student possessing a small amount of drugs constituted cruel and unusual punishment. We upheld the district court\u2019s sentence, which was less severe than the statutory maximum, because we determined the defendant fell \u201cfar short of meeting his burden of proving that his sentence is so disproportionate to the crime that it outrages the moral sense of the community or of justice.\u201d <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 271, 922 P.2d at 469. Johnson\u2019s argument that we affirmed Tadewaldt\u2019s harsh sentence because of the presence of aggravating factors is simply untrue. Tadewaldt actually received \u201cthe most lenient sentence possible under the statute.\u201d <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 271, 922 P.2d at 469. Furthermore, we did not address the presence or absence of aggravating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b617 In <em>Clark, </em>the defendant was convicted of several motor vehicle-related offenses. The trial court sentenced Clark within the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>parameters, but he argued on appeal that his sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment because they were greatly disproportionate to sentences imposed against other defendants convicted of the same offenses. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 36. We upheld the sentences which were within the statutory limits. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 40. We did not discuss the presence or absence of aggravating factors in <em>Clark. </em>Indeed, we did not directly address Clark\u2019s disproportionality argument at all. We merely affirmed the sentences falling within statutory parameters and noted the district court\u2019s proper consideration of Montana\u2019s statutory sentencing policy. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 40. Neither <em>Tadewaldt </em>nor <em>Clark </em>support Johnson\u2019s position that aggravating factors must be present before the statutory maximum sentence properly can be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b618 Johnson also argues that, although his sentence is within the statutory parameters, it \u201cshocks the conscience,\u201d thereby falling within the exception described in <em>Tadewaldt. </em>In sentencing Johnson, the District Court noted Johnson\u2019s \u201cthreats to the victim, threats to the victim\u2019s child and the Defendant\u2019s child, threats to the victim\u2019s family, threats of abduction of the child, which really, really weight] on this Court very heavily.\u201d It also expressed concern that Johnson was a risk to re-offend and ordered that, during any parole, Johnson not be allowed to enter Fergus County or the surrounding counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b619  Given the facts of this case, we simply are not persuaded that Johnson met his burden of proving that his sentence \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d or \u201coutrages the moral sense of the community or of justice.\u201d <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 271, 922 P.2d at 469. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment in sentencing Johnson to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
