Wright (Wright), appeals from the orders entered by the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Hill County, denying his motion for striking the entire jury panel and his motion for a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying both Wright\u2019s motion to strike the entire venire panel and his motion to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\u00b63 Wright was charged by information on January 6,2000, with two counts of Criminal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101(4), MCA, and one count of Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102(1), MCA. Wright pled not guilty to all three charges. A jury trial commenced on July 25, 2000, and at that time, Wright filed a Motion in Limine seeking exclusion of all references, comments, allusions, and/or statements regarding Wright\u2019s criminal history, prior convictions, and prior contacts with law enforcement. The District Court granted Wright\u2019s motion, and the jury selection process began.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">\u00b64 The Honorable John Warner commenced voir dire by describing the charges against Wright and asking preliminary questions of the prospective jurors. When questioned if any of the jurors knew Wright, prospective juror, Timothy Goggins (Goggins), responded affirmatively. The following dialog occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">Goggins: I\u2019m acquainted as a coworker from the railroad. I also have knowledge of a case years ago that was involving Mr. Wright, where I was call as a jury [sic], but wasn\u2019t selected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-15\">The Court: All right. So you know Mr. Wright. You have some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>idea of something. Do you have any opinion about this case before we start the questions? Can you just hear the evidence, make a decision based on what\u2019s presented in court here today, not any prior performed opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">Goggins: I have knowledge of - it was the same things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">The Court: But there was no conviction there that I know of or anything. See where we are here is: Can you decide this case fairly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">Goggins: I have no knowledge of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">Mr. Yellin: Your Honor, can I approach the bench, please? (Off the record discussion held at the bench.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">The Court: My question to you: Can you judge this case fairly, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">Goggins: This case on its merits possibly, although I do know-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALc\">The Court: I know you have said you have some prior knowledge. I want to emphasize to all of the panel, that we all have a life. We are here today on only these allegations, only these allegations. And I just inquire of you, sir, can you judge this case fairly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADr\">Goggins: I guess probably not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">The Court: All right, I\u2019ll excuse you then. Thank you for your candor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">\u00b65 When defense counsel, Yellin, approached the bench, he requested that the entire venire panel be dismissed. Then again after the State\u2019s voir dire, Wright\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the entire panel and also hold individual voir dire on the basis of Goggins\u2019 statements about an earlier trial. The District Court denied both motions, finding that the remaining prospective jurors had not been prejudiced by the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"AEv-\">\u00b66 During voir dire, Wright\u2019s counsel asked several prospective members of the venire panel how they were affected by Goggins\u2019 statement. The prospective jurors in essence stated they believed Goggins\u2019 comments were inappropriate. After the jury was selected, Wright\u2019s trial commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">\u00b67 On July 26, 2000, the jury found Wright guilty on all three charges. Wright filed a motion for a new trial on the issue of jury misconduct and prejudice on August 24, 2000. After a hearing on Wright\u2019s motion, the District Court denied the motion for a new trial holding that Wright was not prejudiced. On September 29, 2000, the District Court issued a written order denying Wright\u2019s motion for a new trial. Wright now appeals that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b68 Granting or denying a motion for a new trial is within the discretion of the trial court. Section 46-16-702, MCA, and <em>State v. Gambrel </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 84, 91, 803 P.2d 1071, 1076. We have held that when the District Court has considered the matter, whether on a question for mistrial or motion for a new trial, this Court will not lightly disturb that ruling. <em>Mason v. Ditzel </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 364, 842 P.2d 707, and <em>State v. Counts </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 242, 679 P.2d 1245. \u201cTo overthrow it this Court must be shown by evidence that is clear, convincing, and practically free from doubt, of the error of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Mason v. Ditzel, </em>255 Mont. at 376, 842 P.2d at 715; <em>State v. Counts, </em>209 Mont. at 248, 679 P.2d at 1248. \u201cThe decision of a district court judge as to the impartiality of a jury should not be set aside unless there is clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. McMahon </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 75, 78, 894 P.2d 313, 315, quoting <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 313, 320, 880 P.2d 829, 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b69 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying both Wright\u2019s motion to strike the entire venire panel and his motion to grant a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u00b610 Wright argues that the District Court erred in denying both his motion to strike the entire venire panel and his motion for a new trial, which were premised on the theory that comments made by a prospective juror during voir dire poisoned the entire venire panel, and such comments can only be corrected by declaring a mistrial or granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\u00b611 In <em>McMahon, </em>we reversed the trial judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on comments from several prospective jurors regarding their knowledge of the defendant\u2019s violent tendencies and the expressed fear of the defendant by another prospective juror because of the very assault and intimidation incidents at issue in the trial. <em>McMahon, </em>271 Mont. at 77-78, 894 P.2d at 315. However, we cautioned that our holding should be interpreted narrowly and reserved only for the most egregious and prejudicial prospective juror comments, amounting to inadmissible opinions or comments about the defendant\u2019s character or propensities, which could not be cured by admonishment or instruction from the court. <em>McMahon, </em>271 Mont. at 81, 894 P.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">\u00b612 The <em>McMahon </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">In <em>State v. Dixon </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 38, 869 P.2d 779, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>upheld the conviction where the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments were considered insignificant when viewed in the context of the entire record. We noted that the judge instructed the jury not to use comments such as counsel\u2019s as evidence, and to consider only evidence when debating the verdict. In <em>State v. Walton </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 340, 722 P.2d 1145, the prosecutor made potentially erroneous and prejudicial comments regarding presentation of evidence to the judge but the judge admonished the prosecutor, issued precautionary statements to the jury, and the jury ultimately rejected several of the State\u2019s charges. In <em>State v. Gafford </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 380, 563 P.2d 1129, we held that non-responsive and prejudicial answers by a prospective juror were not cause for reversal when the defendant\u2019s motion was not made at the first recess following the answers and the answers had been invited by further questions of defense counsel. In <em>State v. Rhodes </em>(1974), 164 Mont. 455, 524 P.2d 1095, we held that a mistrial for prejudice against the defendants, caused by a juror\u2019s comment, was not warranted because defense counsel did not make a sufficient showing of prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><em>McMahon, </em>271 Mont. at 78-79, 894 P.2d at 315. After analyzing this precedent, the <em>McMahon </em>Court concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">[t]hese cases demonstrate a trend that improper comments by prosecutors or prospective jurors about the defendant or about the evidence, Eire not grounds for a mistrial [or a new trial] if the trial judge instructs the jury to disregard the questionable comment and if the court is satisfied that the juror can lay aside a fixed opinion and render a verdict solely on the evidence presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4T\"><em>McMahon, </em>271 Mont. at 79, 894 P.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b613 In <em>State v. Hagen </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 432, 903 P.2d 1381, Hagen argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to object to a line of questions during voir dire which referred to Steve Jennette (Jennette), a witness who was at the Hagen residence at the time of the shooting but not called at tri\u00e1l to testify. During questioning of a prospective juror, the juror stated that he knew Jennette and had counseled Jennette after the shooting. The prospective juror stated that he had received \u201cfirst hand\u201d information concerning the shooting from Jennette during the counseling sessions. <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 441, 903 P.2d at 1387. This Court distinguished <em>McMahon </em>from <em>Hagen. </em>In <em>Hagen, </em>no evidence concerning the substance of Jennette\u2019s conversations with the prospective juror was presented. During questioning, the prosecution elicited information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that the juror knew Jennette and had discussed the shooting with him, but no facts pertaining to the incident were disclosed. In <em>McMahon, </em>several jurors made comments concerning the defendant\u2019s poor character in the presence of the entire jury panel. We concluded in <em>Hagen </em>that defense counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient because of his failure to object. <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 441, 903 P.2d at 1387.</p>\n<p id=\"AvE\">\u00b614  Scrutinizing the comments at issue in the present case and set forth above, we conclude that the comments did not relate to Wright\u2019s character and, as a result, they did not constitute comments so egregious as to be incurable by the District Court\u2019s admonishment to the jury to decide the case based only on the evidence presented during trial. The extraneous information given by Goggins did not rise to the level of egregiousness contemplated by this Corurt in <em>McMahon. </em>The jury panel could surmise from Goggins\u2019 remarks only that Wright had, at most, been charged with a similar crime in the past, not that he had pled guilty or been convicted of a similar crime. While Goggins\u2019 remarks were improper, the District Court\u2019s inquiry was sufficient to show the comments did not prejudice the other members of the venire panel. The District Court correctly dismissed Goggins from the panel and specifically questioned the remaining members of the panel about Goggins\u2019 statements and their ability to fairly and impartially assess the case at hand. The District Court determined the remaining members of the jury panel had not been \u201cpoisoned,\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">The trial court has the ability to look into the eyes of each member of the jury panel, and to consider their responses in the context of the courtroom. After dismissing the juror, the court determined that the remaining panel could render a fair and impartial decision, and that the defendant was not prejudiced by Prospective Juror No. 7's comments. This was further confirmed by the answers to questions posed by defense counsel concerning this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b615 Relying on <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wright argues that the alleged error during the jury selection process in this instance requires an automatic reversal of his conviction. In <em>LaMere, </em>this Court distinguished trial error and structural error. Trial error includes error which occurs during the presentation of the case to the jury. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 47. Conversely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>structural error affects the framework within which a trial proceeds, rather than simply an error within the trial process itself, and is presumptively prejudicial. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 48. The <em>LaMere </em>Court held that a violation of the jury summoning statutes was a structural error which required a new trial. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b616 Although Wright\u2019s interpretation of <em>LaMere </em>is correct, it is necessary for this Court to apply the <em>LaMere /Van Kirk </em>analysis only if we determine an error occurred in the first instance. Because we have rejected Wright\u2019s argument that the District Court erred in denying his motions to strike the panel and to grant a new trial, the structural error analysis is not necessary for resolution of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AhZ\">\u00b617  The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Gambrel, </em>246 Mont. at 91, 803 P.2d at 1076. We will not disturb that decision absent a showing of abuse of discretion, <em>McMahon, </em>271 Mont. at 78, 894 P.2d at 315, and we find the actions of the District Court here were sound. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Wright\u2019s motions to strike the entire venire panel and to grant a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, COTTER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Following the submission of briefs in this matter, the Court decided <em>State v.
