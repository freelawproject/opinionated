Zenchiku Land and Livestock (Zenchiku), by counsel, has filed a Response. Madrid asks this Court to correct what it claims was an error of law made by the District Court when it allowed Zenchiku to contest its statutory liability to Madrid by presenting the defense of assumption of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"ATLE\">\u00b62 These parties were previously before this Court in <em>Madrid v. Zenchiku Land and Livestock, </em>2002 MT 172, 310 Mont. 491, 51 P.3d 1137 <em>(Madrid). </em>In that case, this Court held that \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, imposed strict liability on owners of livestock for injuries sustained by persons injured by their trespassing livestock. We therefore reversed and remanded the case to the District Court for a determination of the damages sustained by Madrid when he was injured by Zenchiku\u2019s trespassing bull. On remand, Zenchiku sought leave to pursue its previously raised affirmative defense of assumption of the risk, claiming that the viability of that defense was not addressed in our <em>Madrid </em>opinion, and that even if the owner of livestock may be held strictly liable for another\u2019s injuries, the owner of the livestock may nonetheless seek to mitigate his liability by establishing that the plaintiff assumed the risk of his injuries. The District Court, after considering briefs from both parties, concluded that Zenchiku should be allowed to present affirmative defenses, including assumption of the risk, at trial. Madrid filed this Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b63  Supervisory control is appropriate when a district court is proceeding under a mistake of law, and in so doing is causing a gross injustice for which appeal is not an adequate remedy. <em>Safeco v. Montana Eighth Judicial Dist., </em>2000 MT 153, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 123, \u00b6 14, 2 P.3d 834, \u00b6 14. Supervisory control remains an extraordinary remedy and will be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 14, <em>State v. Dist. Court of Fourth Jud. Dist. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 349, 352, 922 P.2d 474, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u00b64 The law of this case is set forth at \u00b6 20 of <em>Madrid, </em>where this Court held that the District Court erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA; that the circumstances in <em>Madrid </em>met all the requirements of that statute; and that the cause be reversed and remanded for a determination of damages. We did not address the viability of Zenchiku\u2019s assumption of the risk defense in <em>Madrid </em>for the simple reason that neither party brought it to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u00b65 Zenchiku argues now that this Court has always permitted the defendant to raise the defense of assumption of the risk in strict liability cases. It is true that in strict <em>products </em>liability cases, we have approved the defense, because such a defense is expressly authorized by statute. See \u00a7 27-1-719(5), MCA (1987). <em>(Lutz v. National Crane Corp. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 368, 379, 884 P.2d 455). A different result is compelled here. We have previously held that if a strict liability statute does not expressly provide for the defense at issue, it may not be raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">\u00b66 In <em>Stroop v. Day </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 314, 896 P.2d 439, we were asked to consider whether the defense of contributory negligence could be raised in a case brought under \u00a7 27-1-715, MCA, which imposes strict liability on a dog owner if the owner\u2019s dog bites, without provocation, anyone in a public place or who is lawfully present on the dog owner\u2019s property. The statute contains no \u201cassumption of the risk\u201d or other affirmative defense language similar to that found in \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA. We reviewed two lines of cases from other jurisdictions in <em>Stroop-one </em>allowing affirmative defenses such as comparative fault to be raised in strict liability dog-bite cases governed by statute, and the other limiting defenses to only those expressly provided in the statute. We were persuaded by the latter line of authority, concluding that the only defenses available to the dog-owner were those <em>expressly </em>set forth in the statute-provocation and unlawful presence. We stated: \u201cIdeas of comparative or contributory negligence are inapplicable under such a strict liability scheme.\u201d <em>Stroop, </em>271 Mont. at 322, 896 P.2d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"AI5\">\u00b67  This same analysis applies in the case at bar. Section 81-4-215, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">If any cattle, horses, mules, asses, hogs, sheep, llamas, alpacas, bison, or other domestic animals break into any enclosure and the fence of the enclosure is legal, as provided in 81-4-101, the owner of the animals is liable for all damages to the owner or occupant of the enclosure. This section may not be construed to require a legal fence in order to maintain an action for injury done by animals running at large contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The only defense supplied by the statute arises if the enclosure breached by the animal is not legal. No such defense exists here. Because the statute does not expressly provide for an assumption of the risk defense, and pursuant to our holdings in <em>Madrid </em>and <em>Stroop, </em>we conclude that the District Court erred in allowing Zenchiku to interpose the defense of assumption of the risk, and that the District Court therefore has proceeded under a mistake of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u00b68 In light of the fact that this is the second time this case has come before this Court, and so as to both preclude the prospect of a third such occasion and clarify the meaning of our holding in <em>Madrid,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b69 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner\u2019s Application for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b610 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b611 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court give notice of this Order by mail on all counsel of record and the Fifth Judicial District Court, Beaverhead County, the Honorable Loren Tucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b612 DATED this 11th day of December, 2002.</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
