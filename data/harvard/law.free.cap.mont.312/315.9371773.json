The District Court reversed the Board of Labor and Appeals\u2019 decision and awarded Rice retroactive unemployment benefits. The State of Montana appeals the District Court\u2019s decision. We affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether \u00a7 39-51-2302, MCA, barred Rice\u2019s claim for unemployment benefits as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A2f\">\u00b63 The facts in this case are undisputed. Rice was diagnosed with, and began treatment for, bi-polar disorder on September 21,1998. On October 14, 1999, he was hired by Interstate Transfer and Storage (Interstate Transfer), as a full time long haul truck driver. As a long haul truck driver, Rice was required to travel long distances and remain on the road for extended periods of time. When he was hired, his bi-polar condition was being successfully treated through medication and he was fully qualified as a commercial truck driver pursuant to state and federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b64 On or around June 8, 2001, Rice suffered from a blackout while visiting his home in Libby, Montana. Following the blackout, he sought medical advice about his condition at the Libby Prompt Care walk-in clinic. After consulting with an emergency room doctor, a Licensed Practitioner Nurse (LPN) authorized Rice to take four days off work, advised him to refrain from driving, and advised him to seek further assistance from his regular doctor, Dr. Gregory Winter. Rice informed Interstate Transfer that he would not be returning to work as scheduled and that he would contact them when he had more information concerning his condition. He was unable to immediately contact Dr. Winter at the Fort Harris VA hospital. However, the two VA counselors he talked to concurred with the LPN\u2019s opinion that he should not return to work as a trucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b65 Based on the advice he received from the LPN and the two VA counselors, on June 12, 2001, Rice notified Interstate Transport that he would not be returning to work. At that same time he filed a claim for unemployment benefits retroactive to June 10, 2001. On June 22, 2001, Dr. Winter concluded that Rice should not drive a motor vehicle and completed the necessary Department of Labor and Industry (Department) form to document that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b66 The Department conducted a hearing on August 13, 2001, and issued its decision to deny benefits on August 17, 2001. The Department held that Rice was not qualified to receive benefits because he had not received the advice of a licensed practicing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>physician before resigning from his employment on June 12. Rice appealed the Department\u2019s decision to the Board of Labor and Appeals (Board) which held an additional hearing on September 7, 2001. The Board affirmed the Department\u2019s decision to deny benefits on September 11, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b67 Rice appealed the Board\u2019s decision in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court pursuant to \u00a7 39-51-2410, MCA. The District Court\u2019s review was limited to issues of law pursuant to \u00a7 39-51-2410(5), MCA. It concluded that the Department and the Board misinterpreted \u00a7 39-51-2302, MCA, and that Rice qualified for unemployment benefits because he demonstrated that he left work for \u201cgood cause.\u201d The State appeals the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b68 Does \u00a7 39-51-2302, MCA, bar Rice\u2019s claim for unemployment benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b69 Interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law which we review to determine whether the district corut\u2019s conclusions are correct. <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 150, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 320, \u00b6 15, 50 P.3d 530, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). Construction of a statute requires this Court \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in the terms or substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b610 The State contends that the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 39-51-2302, MCA, is incorrect and that Rice is not eligible for unemployment because he failed to obtain a licensed and practicing physician\u2019s opinion before he resigned from his employment with Interstate Transfer. Rice did not file a Respondent\u2019s Brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\u00b611 Section 39-51-2302, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">(1) An individual must be disqualified for benefits if the individual has left work without good cause attributable to the individual\u2019s employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">(2) The individual may not be disqualified if the individual leaves:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH2\">(a) employment because of personal illness or injury not associated with misconduct upon the advice of a licensed and practicing physician and, after recovering from the illness or injury when recovery is certified by a licensed and practicing physician, the individual returned to and offered service to the individual\u2019s employer and the individual\u2019s regular or comparable suitable work was not available, as determined by the department, provided the individual is otherwise eligible; or ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u00b612 The Board interpreted \u00a7 39-51-2302, MCA, to require advice from a licensed and practicing physician before an individual can resign from his job because of personal illness. The District Court found that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute was too narrow and concluded that the advice of a licensed and practicing physician was not the exclusive method of showing \u201cgood cause\u201d for leaving work. We conclude that the District Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b613 Section 39-51-2302(1), MCA, disqualifies an employee for unemployment benefits if he voluntarily quits his job without good cause attributable to his job. Rules 24.11.457(l)(a) and (2)(a), ARM, equate \u201cgood cause\u201d with \u201cundue risk\u201d arising from the work environment. Section 39-51-2302(2)(a), MCA, provides that an employee may not be disqualified from receiving benefits when the claimant quits his job based upon a doctor\u2019s recommendation and similar suitable work is unavailable when he is able to return to work. This later section protects a person\u2019s right to receive benefits when the medical condition that caused the claimant to leave work no longer exists, yet the claimant cannot return to work because his or her job no longer exists. The requirements of the two provisions are independent.</p>\n<p id=\"As6\">\u00b614 The State argues that because subsection 2(a) requires the medical advice that prompts a claimant to leave work to come from a licensed physician prior to resigning, Rice is prohibited from receiving benefits because he did not receive advice from a \u201clicensed and practicing physician\u201d until after he resigned. The District Court concluded that while prior advice from a physician is an example of \u201cgood cause\u201d specifically provided by statute, there is nothing in the language of the statute to suggest that there may not be other good causes for leaving employment. We agree with the District Court that to interpret the statute so narrowly would undermine the humane purpose for which unemployment insurance is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b615  In this case, after experiencing blackouts, Rice resigned from his employment based upon the advice of an LPN who conferred with a licensed and practicing doctor. To do otherwise would have been detrimental to his employer, the public and himself. Following a short delay, Rice\u2019s physician, Dr. Winter, concurred with the recommendation of the LPN and VA counselors and completed the required medical documentation, which indicated Rice was not to operate a motor vehicle. There is no question that Rice\u2019s blackouts prevent him from continuing his employment as a long haul truck driver. Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 39-51-2302(1), MCA, does not require an employee to obtain a physician\u2019s advice prior to resigning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>from employment under these circumstances and Rice resigned from his job with \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b616 For these reasons, we affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"A7T\">JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
