Meeks was charged with three counts of indecent exposure and one count of carrying a concealed weapon in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County. Meeks was declared unfit to proceed and committed to the custody of the Department of Public Health and Human Services. Meeks was later deemed fit to proceed and pled guilty to the charges. The District Court sentenced Meeks to the custody of the Department of Corrections (DOC), and Meeks appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u00b63 1. Upon declaring Meeks unfit to proceed, did the District Court fail to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999)?</p>\n<p id=\"AHe\">\u00b64 2. Did Meeks receive an improper sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\u00b65 On July 28, 1999, the Respondent, State of Montana, filed an information charging John M. Meeks with indecent exposure, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA (1997), indecent exposure, a high misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA (1997), indecent exposure, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA (1997), and carrying a concealed weapon, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-316, MCA (1997). The incidents relating to these charges occurred in Missoula, Montana, between June 27, 1999, and July 11, 1999. On August 3, 1999, Meeks pled not guilty to all four charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">\u00b66 At the request of Meeks\u2019 court-appointed counsel, Meeks was evaluated at the Missoula County Jail by Dr. Robert Shea on August 7, 1999. Shea noted that Meeks was manic and uncooperative, and concluded that Meeks\u2019 mental state was such that he was unable to assist in his own defense. Meeks\u2019 court-appointed counsel submitted Shea\u2019s evaluation to the District Court on August 17,1999, requesting that Meeks be declared unfit to proceed and transferred to the Montana State Hospital (MSH) in Warm Springs, Montana. The District Court found Meeks unfit to proceed on August 18, 1999. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(a), MCA (1997), the proceedings against Meeks were suspended, and he was committed to the custody of the Department of Public Health and Human Services at MSH.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">\u00b67 On October 4, 1999, an evaluation of Meeks was documented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Dr. Virginia Hill, staff psychiatrist at MSH. Hill diagnosed Meeks with paranoid type schizophrenia. Hill based this diagnosis on Meeks\u2019 paranoia, illogical and disorganized thinking, agitated and hostile behavior, and delusional interpretation of reality. As part of her treatment plan, Hill recommended that Meeks take anti-psychotic medication. Meeks, however, refused to ingest any medication, or to follow any portion of MSH\u2019s treatment plan. On October 14,1999, Hill petitioned the District Court for an order requiring Meeks to comply with MSH\u2019s treatment plan. The District Court granted Hill\u2019s petition on October 18, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b68 Meeks was reevaluated by Dr. Jeffery Ritow, staff psychologist at MSH, on November 10,1999. The evaluation, in which Hill concurred, was submitted to the District Court on November 19, 1999. Ritow described Meeks as possessing a paranoid distortion of events, and determined that Meeks\u2019 behavior clearly indicated the presence of a mental disease. Ritow also noted that Meeks consistently refused to be interviewed by, or to cooperate with, the hospital staff. Finally, Ritow concluded that Meeks remained unable to assist his attorney with his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b69 During his stay at MSH, Meeks repeatedly complained about his compulsory medication. To address Meeks\u2019 complaints, the District Court set a hearing for December 8,1999. After several continuances, the hearing to determine the propriety of Meeks\u2019 medication plan occurred on February 29, 2000, at which the District Court ordered Meeks off of medication and took the entire issue of medication under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b610 On April 11, 2000, Hill filed a report updating the District Court on Meeks\u2019 fitness to proceed with the criminal charges against him. Hill noted that although Meeks still refused a clinical interview, and his hostile and disruptive behavior had persisted, Meeks had ceased all delusional verbalizations. As such, Hill concluded that Meeks was competent to stand trial. Hill based this conclusion on the following six factors: (1) Meeks\u2019 thirty-seven year criminal history, which implied a familiarity with the criminal justice process; (2) Meeks\u2019 coherence at the February 29, 2000, hearing; (3) Meeks\u2019 keen interest in the legal issues surrounding his case; (4) the absence of delusional statements, despite discontinuation of Meeks\u2019 medication; (5) Meeks\u2019 organized presentation of problems to hospital staff; and (6) information from Meeks\u2019 brother, describing Meeks\u2019 unfortunate early history, recent losses, and likelihood of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b611 On April 16, 2000, an independent psychiatric evaluation of Meeks was conducted by Dr. Terry Lanes. Lanes determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Meeks was admitted to MSH with a psychosis best characterized as a brief psychotic disorder. Lanes further diagnosed Meeks with personality disorder of a severe nature, with paranoid, narcissistic and antisocial traits. As a result of this personality disorder, Lanes characterized Meeks as severely dysfunctional. However, despite this characterization, Lanes concluded that Meeks was competent to stand trial. Lanes based this conclusion on the fact that Meeks understood the charges against him, and offered two reasonable defenses to such charges during the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b612 The District Court deemed Meeks fit to proceed to trial on May 9, 2000. On August 1, 2000, Meeks filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-222, MCA (1999), Meeks alleged that between his commitment to MSH, and the date he was deemed fit to stand trial, so much time had elapsed that it would be unjust to proceed with the criminal charges against him. The District Court denied Meeks\u2019 motion to dismiss on November 8, 2000. The District Court noted that although the parties to the case were in agreement as to the appropriateness of the civil commitment procedure to Meeks\u2019 situation, the methodology of such a procedure would be most efficiently determined by proceeding to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b613 Pursuant to an amended information which reduced his three indecent exposure charges to misdemeanors, Meeks pled guilty to all four charges against him on December 6, 2000. On December 7, 2000, the District Court ordered that Meeks be committed to MSH for an evaluation, which would determine the appropriate facility for his custody, care and treatment. Dr. John Van Hassel, staff psychologist at MSH, evaluated Meeks on February 5, 2001. Hassel submitted his recommendation to the District Court on March 28,2001, in which Hill concurred. Hassel noted that Meeks had consistently refused available treatment programs at MSH, and concluded that Meeks was unlikely to derive any significant benefit from continued hospitalization. As a result, Hassel recommended that Meeks be supervised for the remainder of his sentence by the DOC, rather than by the Department of Public Health and Human Services at MSH.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b614 On May 29, 2001, the District Court sentenced Meeks to six months in the Missoula County Detention Facility in Missoula, Montana, for each of three counts of indecent exposure, and five years in a State correctional facility for carrying a concealed weapon, the sentences to run concurrently. Meeks appealed the judgment of the District Court on July 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b615 In cases of statutory interpretation, our standard of review is whether the district court\u2019s decision was correct. <em>Holm-Sutherland Co., Inc. v. Town of Shelby, </em>1999 MT 150, \u00b6 8, 295 Mont. 65, \u00b6 8, 982 P.2d 1053, \u00b6 8. We review a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Setters, </em>2001 MT 101, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 253, \u00b6 16, 25 P.3d 893, \u00b6 16. The standard of review of the legality of a sentence is whether the sentencing court abused its discretion. <em>Setters, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Acr\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b616 Upon declaring Meeks unfit to proceed, did the District Court fail to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999)?</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b617 As a preliminary matter, the State contends that Meeks\u2019 appeal is not properly before this Court. That is, the State asserts that when Meeks pled guilty, he waived his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the charges against him. Meeks filed a motion to dismiss on August 1, 2000. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-222, MCA (1999), Meeks alleged that between his commitment to MSH, and the date he was deemed fit to stand trial, so much time had elapsed that it would be unjust to proceed with the criminal charges against him. The District Court denied this motion on November 8, 2000, and set the case for trial. The case, however, never went to trial, as Meeks pled guilty to the charges on December 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\u00b618 The State correctly contends that Meeks\u2019 guilty plea waived his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss. In <em>State v. Wheeler </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 400, 402, 948 P.2d 698, 699, we noted that: <em>\u201cA </em>voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty constitutes a waiver of non[-]jurisdictional defects and defenses.\u201d As such, Meeks\u2019 guilty plea waived all non-jurisdictional claims for purposes of appellate review. Meeks, however, is not appealing the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss on November 8,2000. The issue before this Court is the District Court\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999), in November of 1999. As such, the State\u2019s argument regarding Meeks\u2019 motion to dismiss is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\u00b619  In <em>Hagan v. State </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 31, 36, 873 P.2d 1385, 1388, we held that jurisdictional claims in the context of waiver are \u201cthose cases in which the district court could determine that the government lacked the power to bring the indictment <em>at the time of accepting the guilty plea from the face of the indictment or from the record.\u201d </em>On appeal, Meeks alleges that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999), criminal charges were improperly brought against him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>after November of 1999. Accordingly, we conclude that Meeks\u2019 claim is jurisdictional in nature, and was not waived by his guilty plea on December 6, 2000. We turn now to an analysis of \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b620 In 1979, the Montana Legislature abolished the traditional insanity defense, substituting alternative procedures for considering a criminal defendant\u2019s mental condition. <em>State v. Korell </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 316, 322, 690 P.2d 992, 996. Montana now considers evidence of mental disease or defect at three phases of a criminal proceeding: (1) determination of fitness to stand trial; (2) at trial to disprove state of mind; and (3) at sentencing. <em>State v. Cowan </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 510, 517, 861 P.2d 884, 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b621 Section 46-14-221(2), MCA (1999), dictates the procedure to be followed in the event that a criminal defendant is declared unfit to proceed. Section 46-14-221(2), MCA(1999), provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">(a) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed, the proceeding against the defendant must be suspended ... and the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the director of the department of public health and human services to be placed in an appropriate institution of the department of public health and human services for so long as the unfitness endures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">(c) The committing court shall, within 90 days of commitment, review the defendant\u2019s fitness to proceed. If the court finds that the defendant is still unfit to proceed and that it does not appear that the defendant will become fit to proceed within the reasonably foreseeable future, the proceeding against the defendant must be dismissed ... and the prosecutor shall petition the court in the manner provided in chapter 20 or 21 of Tifi\u00e9 53, whichever is appropriate, to determine the disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5\">\u00b622 Meeks was declared unfit to proceed on August 18, 1999, and immediately committed to the custody of the Department of Public Health and Human Services, as required by \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(a), MCA (1999). On November 19,1999, approximately ninety days after Meeks was committed to MSH, the District Court received an evaluation from Dr. Ritow at MSH. Ritow\u2019s evaluation concluded that Meeks was paranoid, uncooperative, and unable to assist his attorney in his own defense. Further, Ritow\u2019s evaluation gave no indication that Meeks would regain fitness in the reasonably foreseeable future. As such, Meeks contends that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>District Court was required to dismiss the criminal charges pending against him. The State counters that, throughout the case, the motivation of both the District Court and the State was to formulate an effective treatment program for Meeks in the context of his criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b623 In <em>Curtis v. Dist. Court of 21st Jud. Dist. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 231, 235, 879 P.2d 1164, 1166, we noted that: \u201cWhere the statutory language is plain, unambiguous, direct and certain, the statute speaks for itself and there is nothing left for the court to construe.\u201d This Court also specifically addressed \u00a7 46-14-221(2), MCA (1993), in <em>Curtis, </em>stating that: \u201cThe legislative intent of \u00a7 46-14-221(2), MCA [1993], is clearly stated by the plain and unambiguous language used.\u201d <em>Curtis, </em>266 Mont. at 235, 879 P.2d at 1166. As such, we held that the proper procedure for managing a criminal defendant declared unfit to proceed was strict compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 46-14-221(2), MCA (1993). <em>Curtis, </em>266 Mont. at 236, 879 P.2d at 1167. <em>See also State v. Drga </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 399, 401, 916 P.2d 739, 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u00b624 Subsections (a) and (c) of the 1999 version of \u00a7 46-14-221(2), MCA, are unchanged in substance, and remain the mandatory procedure for a court to follow when supervising a criminal defendant declared unfit to proceed. Under subsection (c) of \u00a7 46-14-221(2), MCA (1999), the District Court was required to review Meeks\u2019 fitness to proceed within ninety days of his commitment and, if appropriate, dismiss the criminal charges pending against him. The prosecutor was then required to petition the District Court to have the defendant committed via the civil procedure provided in \u00a7 53-21-121, MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"AIR\">\u00b625 Meeks was declared unfit to proceed on August 18, 1999. The District Court complied with subsection (a) of \u00a7 46-14-221(2), MCA (1999), suspending the criminal proceedings against Meeks and committing him to the custody of MSH. Approximately ninety days later, on November 19,1999, the District Court received an evaluation from Dr. Ritow at MSH. Ritow\u2019s evaluation described Meeks as paranoid, and concluded that Meeks was uncooperative and not able to assist his attorney with his own defense. Ritow\u2019s evaluation, in which Dr. Hill concurred, indicated that Meeks was unfit to proceed with the criminal charges pending against him. However, the District Court did not dismiss the charges against Meeks in November of 1999. Rather, at Ritow\u2019s recommendation, Meeks remained at MSH for further evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u00b626  In holding Meeks at MSH for farther evaluation, the District Court failed to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999). Ritow\u2019s evaluation, submitted to the District Court on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>November 19, 1999, indicated that Meeks was unfit to proceed. Furthermore, the November evaluation contained no specific evidence to suggest that Meeks would regain fitness in the reasonably foreseeable future. Therefore, upon review of the evaluation, there was no basis upon which to continue criminal proceedings against Meeks inNovember of1999. Under \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA(1999), the District Court was required to dismiss the criminal charges against Meeks, and the prosecution was required to commence civil commitment procedures, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 53-21-101-704, MCA (1999). Accordingly, we hold that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-221(2)(c), MCA (1999), the District Court erred in not dismissing the criminal charges against Meeks in November of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b627 Did Meeks receive an improper sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b628 In the alternative, Meeks contends that his sentence is illegal, as he was committed to the custody of the DOC, rather than the Department of Public Health and Human Services. The State maintains the District Court correctly concluded that Meeks belonged in a correctional facility. However, our above holding renders Meeks\u2019 sentence moot. As such, we decline to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b629 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"ACa\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, RICE and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
