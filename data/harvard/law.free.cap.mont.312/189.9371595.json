Gilbert subsequently filed a petition for postconviction rebef. The petition challenged the legality of the District Court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction for purposes of parole and a restitution provision in the sentence. The District Court denied Gilbert\u2019s petition and Gilbert appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it retained jurisdiction to revisit Gilbert\u2019s parole restriction?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it postponed the consideration and imposition of restitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\u00b65 On October 12,1999, the State filed an information in the District Court which charged Gilbert with: arson, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-103, MCA (1997), or in the alternative negligent arson, a felony or misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-102, MCA (1997); two counts of burglary, both felonies, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA (1997); and theft, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA (1997). On October 14, 1999, Gilbert pled guilty to negligent arson and one count of burglary. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the State dismissed the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">\u00b66 Following a sentencing hearing, and after considering the State\u2019s sentencing recommendation and a pre-sentence investigation conducted by the Montana Adult Probation and Parole Office, the District Court entered its Judgment and Order of Commitment on February 7,2000. The District Court sentenced Gilbert to ten years in the Montana State Prison, five suspended, for the offense of negligent arson and fifteen years in the Montana State Prison, ten suspended, for the offense of burglary, to be served concurrently with the negligent arson sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">\u00b67 Further, based on Gilbert\u2019s \u201cextensive criminal history\u201d and pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, the District Court declared Gilbert ineligible for parole or any supervised release program during the unsuspended portion of the sentence. However, in the very next sentence, the District Court seemingly contradicted this restriction by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>declaring Gilbert eligible for parole once he completed chemical or substance abuse treatment, obtained a mental evaluation and complied with the recommended treatment, and completed a boot camp program administered by the Department of Corrections. The court maintained that it retained \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction in this matter and may reconsider the parole restriction specifically set forth above upon petition of the Defendant in the event the Defendant successfully completes each of the foregoing conditions.\u201d Finally, the District Court ordered that during the portion of the suspended sentence, and in the event that Gilbert is granted early parole, Gilbert \u201cshall pay restitution in an amount to be stipulated by counsel and approved by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b68 On October 3, 2000, Gilbert filed a petition for postconviction relief. In his petition, Gilbert alleged, in part, that the District Court imposed an illegal sentence in that the court had no authority to retain jurisdiction over the parole eligibility matter. Further, Gilbert maintained that the District Court unlawfully imposed the restitution provision. Gilbert filed an amended petition for postconviction relief on February 1, 2001, which raised additional issues irrelevant to this appeal. Following a hearing, the District Court denied the petition on June 20,2001. On August 3,2001, Gilbert filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s order of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b69 The standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief is whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 349, \u00b6 9, 42 P.3d 753, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AmY\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it retained jurisdiction to revisit Gilbert\u2019s parole restriction?</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s February 7, 2000, judgment and order contains two distinct, yet seemingly contradictory, parole provisions. Initially, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">IT IS THE DECISION OF THIS COURT that pursuant to Section 46-18-202(2), MCA and for the specific reason of the Defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, the Defendant shall be ineligible for parole or participation in any form of any supervised release program while the Defendant is serving the unsuspended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>concurrent five (5) year terms of imprisonment ordered by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">However, the very next statement in the District Court\u2019s order provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">IT IS THE FURTHER ORDER OF THIS COURT that pursuant to Section 46-18-202(2), MCA and for the specific reason of the Defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, the Defendant shall be ineligible for parole or participation in any form of any supervised release program until the Defendant has: (a) satisfactorily completed in fall all courses of counseling or treatment for chemical or substance abuse at the Montana State Prison made available by and determined to be in the Defendant\u2019s best interests of rehabilitation by the Department of Corrections; (b) obtained a full scale mental evaluation and any recommended course -of counseling or treatment made available by the Department of Corrections; and (c) completed the Treasure State Correctional Training Facility (boot camp) program administered by the Department of Corrections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">As to the latter provision, the District Court retained \u201ccontinuing jurisdiction\u201d to reconsider the parole restriction set forth in the former provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b612 Gilbert' argues that a district court may retain jurisdiction to revisit a previously imposed sentence in select statutorily provided circumstances. Gilbert maintains that no statutory exception applies to the case at bar. Therefore, according to Gilbert, the District Court erred when it retained continuing jurisdiction to reexamine Gilbert\u2019s parole restriction. Gilbert, rather tenuously, asserts that since the retention of jurisdiction was unlawful, this Court should not only strike the retention provision of the judgment, but should also vacate the parole restriction altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00b613 The State maintains that the District Court did not unlawfully retain jurisdiction because the retention \u201cdid not change or modify Gilbert\u2019s underlying sentence.\u201d If we conclude otherwise, the State contends that we should simply strike the retention of jurisdiction provision from the sentence and allow the parole board to determine whether Gilbert has satisfied the parole eligibility requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u00b614 The State\u2019s alternative suggestion does not appear to be a workable solution. For, if we merely strike the retention of jurisdiction provision, the District Court\u2019s judgment and order will still contain the contradictory parole restriction and parole eligibility provisions. It is unclear to us whether the parole board would even examine Gilbert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>parole eligibility in the face of the clear parole preclusion immediately preceding the eligibility provision. Thus, we will first determine whether the District Court lawfully imposed each of the provisions. If we conclude that the provisions were lawfully imposed, we will next determine how to reconcile the apparent contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b615 Section 46-18-202(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">Whenever the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding 1 year, the sentencing judge may also impose the restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program while serving that term. If the restriction is to be imposed, the sentencing judge shall state the reasons for it in writing. If the sentencing judge finds that the restriction is necessary for the protection of society, the judge shall impose the restriction as part of the sentence and the judgment must contain a statement of the reasons for the restriction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Clearly, the District Court imposed a sentence of imprisonment, which exceeded one year. Further, the District Court declared Gilbert ineligible for parole or participation in any supervised release program \u201cfor the specific reason of the Defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history.\u201d We conclude that the District Court sufficiently complied with the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, and, therefore, lawfully imposed the parole restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b616 As for his parole eligibility, Gilbert does not challenge the District Court\u2019s authority to impose such a provision and we agree that it was certainly within the District Court\u2019s discretion to do so. However, Gilbert maintains that the District Court lacked authority to retain jurisdiction over the parole eligibility determination as courts generally lack jurisdiction to modify a previously imposed sentence. Gilbert indicates that \u201c[t]he only exception to a court retaining jurisdiction, under Montana law, is with regards to a sentencing court retaining jurisdiction for the boot camp incarceration program pursuant to \u00a7 53-30-401, et seq., MCA.\u201d However, Gilbert insists that the circumstances surrounding his case made it impossible to satisfy the statutory exception. Consequently, Gilbert asserts that the District Court imposed an unlawful sentence and, thus, erred when it denied the relief requested in his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b617  Once a valid sentence is imposed, a court lacks jurisdiction to modify that sentence absent specific statutory authority. <em>State v. Richards </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 322, 325, 948 P.2d 240, 241. Further, a court cannot reserve the right to change the sentence or add conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>at a later time. <em>State v. Renniek, </em>1999 MT 155, \u00b6 9, 295 Mont. 97, \u00b6 9, 983 P.2d 907, \u00b6 9. Here, the District Court essentially declared Gilbert ineligible for parole while serving the unsuspended portion of his sentence. Subsequently, the District Court reserved the right to modify the sentence, i.e., lift the parole restriction. Absent statutory authority for this reservation, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to revisit the parole restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b618 Section 53-30-402, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">Sentence reduction for offenders. A sentencing court retains jurisdiction for purposes of this section. A sentencing court may order a reduction of sentence for a convicted offender who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">(1) is certified by the department as having successfully completed the boot camp incarceration program; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">(2) applies to the court within 1 year after beginning to serve a sentence at a correctional institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Essentially, this provision extends a sentencing court\u2019s jurisdiction over the imposition of sentence for one year following commencement of the sentence. Gilbert maintains that the facts of this case precluded application of \u00a7 53-30-402, MCA, because he could not have completed the boot camp program and applied to the court for reconsideration within one year of his sentence commencement.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\u00b619 We need not indulge Gilbert in a lengthy review of these assertions as the District Court\u2019s order conditioned reconsideration on three occurrences: completion of chemical or substance abuse treatment, a mental evaluation and corresponding treatment, and the boot camp program administered by the Department of Corrections. At the time the District Court imposed Gilbert\u2019s sentence, \u00a7 53-30-402, MCA, presumably warranted continuing jurisdiction to review the boot camp condition. However, neither the District Court nor the State has cited any statutory authority which authorized continuing jurisdiction for the District Court to review the substance abuse treatment and mental evaluation conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\u00b620 We find it curious that Gilbert is challenging a sentencing provision imposed for his benefit. Nevertheless, Gilbert correctly asserts that the District Court lacked statutory authority to retain jurisdiction over his parole restriction. Therefore, we hold that the District Court erred when it denied Gilbert\u2019s petition for postconviction relief with respect to the retention of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">\u00b621 Upon striking the reservation of jurisdiction provision, the District Court\u2019s judgment is still left with the parole restriction and the parole eligibility provisions. In resolving this contradiction, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>have suggested, all in the name of the District Court\u2019s intent, striking the parole restriction, striking the parole eligibility provision, or retaining both and allowing the parole board to consider the conditions imposed in the District Court\u2019s judgment. We do not believe it appropriate in this case to determine the District Court\u2019s intent in imposing Gilbert\u2019s sentence. As the District Court affirmatively included both provisions in the judgment, one could ostensibly argue the court\u2019s intent either way. Under these circumstances, the court\u2019s intent should more appropriately be declared by the District Court itself. Therefore, we remand this matter to the District Court to consider two options: retain the parole restriction and, therefore, strike the conditional parole provision from its judgment; or strike the parole restriction provision from the judgment and allow the appropriate authorities to monitor the conditional parole provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err when it postponed the consideration and imposition of restitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b623 In its February 7, 2000, judgment, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">IT IS THE FURTHER ORDER OF THIS COURT that during the suspended portions of the sentences imposed herein and in the event the Defendant is granted parole or participation in a supervised release program of any form, the Defendant shall be subject to the following terms and conditions of probation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">5. The Defendant shall pay restitution in an amount to be stipulated by counsel and approved by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">In his petition for postconviction relief, Gilbert challenged the postponement of the restitution consideration. As to that challenge, the District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">The Defendant\u2019s argument is misplaced in that the Court has yet to make a specific order regarding restitution. The Court notes that at the time of sentencing, the scope and extent of pecuniary loss caused by the Defendant was then inascertainable.... Upon stipulation by counsel as to a proposed monetary amount of restitution, the Court shall conduct further hearing at which the Defendant shall be fully and fairly represented with ability to challenge any claim or request for restitution. The Defendant may not now challenge Condition Number 5 where the Court has yet to ascertain or consider any specific amount of restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">\u00b624 Section 46-18-241, MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Condition of restitution. (1) As provided in 46-18-201, a sentencing court shall require an offender to make full restitution to any victim of the offense who has sustained pecuniary loss as a result of the offense, including a person suffering an economic loss as a result of the crime. The duty to pay full restitution under the sentence remains with the offender until full restitution is paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Further, \u00a7 46-18-242(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">Whenever the court believes that a victim of the offense may have sustained a pecuniary loss as a result of the offense or whenever the prosecuting attorney requests, the court shall order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence investigation and report:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">(a) documentation of the offender\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">(b) documentation of the victim\u2019s pecuniary loss ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The presentence investigation report in this case contains no documentation of Gilbert\u2019s financial resources, his future ability to pay restitution, or the victims\u2019 pecuniary loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u00b625 Gilbert insists that the absence of the statutorily mandated documentation renders the District Court\u2019s restitution provision illegal. <em>See State v. Brown </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 223, 867 P.2d 1098, <em>superseded on other grounds by </em>\u00a7 46-18-241, MCA. Gilbert requests that we remand the matter to the District Court for a proper determination of restitution pursuant to the statutory scheme. On appeal, the State concedes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-10\">While the State agrees with the district court that due to Gilbert\u2019s act of arson it was difficult to ascertain the amount of restitution at the time of sentencing, and also understands why the court decided to wait on counsel to arrive at a stipulated amount rather than setting restitution at sentencing, the statutes authorizing restitution nonetheless contemplate that the restitution amount will be determined at the sentencing hearing pursuant to specific statutory requirements. ... As a result, the State agrees with Gilbert that the district court\u2019s restitution order was illegal. The State also agrees with Gilbert\u2019s proposed remedy, namely that this matter should be remanded to the district court for a determination of the amount of restitution pursuant to the restitution statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">\u00b626  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the District Court erred when it postponed consideration of restitution. Thus, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Court subsequently erred when it denied Gilbert\u2019s petition for postconviction relief with regard to the restitution issue. We remand on the issue of restitution for the District Court to proceed in accordance with the restitution provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b627 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, COTTER, RICE and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
