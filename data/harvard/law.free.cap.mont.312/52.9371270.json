We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\u00b62 After receiving a preliminary plat application for a proposed subdivision from Kiely Construction (Kiely), the Carbon County Planning Board recommended approval of the proposed subdivision, subject to eighteen conditions, to the City of Red Lodge (Red Lodge). Red Lodge received the application in the Summer of 1996, but failed to act upon it within sixty days. Kiely obtained a Writ of Mandamus in August of 1997, compelling Red Lodge to act upon the application, and Red Lodge conditionally approved Kieiys application, subject to twenty-six conditions. On October 14, 1997, Kiely filed a complaint, alleging that Red Lodge failed to act within the mandatory sixty-day time frame, that imposition of some conditions were an abuse of discretion, and that its due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">\u00b63 Following mediation in the Fall of 1998, the parties negotiated a subdivision improvements agreement, which Red Lodge conditionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>accepted, but Kiely then rejected. On March 20, 1999, the District Court entered partial summary judgment, ordering Red Lodge to review and \u201capprove, conditionally approve or deny,\u201d Kiely\u2019s application within thirty days. Following a public hearing, Red Lodge City Council unanimously denied Kiely\u2019s application without written findings. Kiely then filed an amended complaint, alleging constitutional violations and requesting damages and approval of its application. Prior to trial, the District Court entered partial summary judgment, dismissing Kiely\u2019s claims against the individually named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b64 At trial, Kiely sought damages for the alleged arbitrary or capricious denial of its application. The jury\u2019s special verdict awarded Kiely $292,170.00 in damages for Red Lodge\u2019s arbitrary and capricious actions pursuant to state law, and also found for Kiely on its constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, but awarded damages in the sum of only $1.00. Kiely had also appealed to the District Court from Red Lodge\u2019s denial of its preliminary plat application. The District Court accepted the jury\u2019s advisory verdict on this issue, and concluded that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily, capriciously and unlawfully, and ordered Red Lodge to conditionally approve Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application, subject to the original eighteen conditions. The District Court awarded Kiely $250,243.50 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and also awarded costs. Red Lodge appeals several of the District Court\u2019s pre-trial, trial, and post-trial rulings, while Kiely cross-appeals two of the court\u2019s summary judgment rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b65 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">1. Whether the District Court erred in submitting Kiely\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims to the jury;</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">2. Whether the District Court erred in awarding Kiely attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988;</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">3.

Whether the District Court erred by not modifying the damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b66 In the Spring of 1996, Kiely initiated the approval process for its proposed subdivision, referred to as Kiely Island at Rock Creek, and located within the City of Red Lodge, Carbon County, Montana. On May 16, 1996, Kiely submitted a preliminary subdivision plat application to the Carbon County Planning Board, because at the time, Red Lodge did not have a city planning board in place. Following a public hearing on June 18, 1996, the County Planning Board recommended approval of the proposed subdivision to the City of Red Lodge, subject to eighteen conditions. The recommendation was transmitted to the Red Lodge City Council (City Council) on July 2, 1996. Although \u00a7 76-3-604, MCA, requires the city to act upon such an application within sixty days, Red Lodge let the time pass without action. After the City of Red Lodge Planning Board was in place, it issued a staff report on July 15, 1997, wherein it recommended the City Council approve Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application with the same eighteen conditions proposed by the County Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b67 On August 26,1997, upon Kiely\u2019s request, the Thirteenth Judicial District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a Writ of Mandamus, compelling Red Lodge to act upon Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application within ten days by approving, conditionally approving, or denying the application. Following a public hearing on September 10,1997, Kiely\u2019s application was conditionally approved, subject to twenty-six conditions. Apparently, Red Lodge reviewed Kiely\u2019s application under the City of Red Lodge Development Code (1997 Development Code), which was adopted in April of 1997, and effective May 22,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b68 On October 14,1997, Kiely commenced this action appealing the twenty-six final conditions adopted by Red Lodge on September 10, 1997. Kiely brought the action under \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-625(1) and (2), MCA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u00a7 1983), maintaining that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily and capriciously in imposing the conditions. Kiely sought the following relief: (1) an order requiring Red Lodge to apply the regulations in effect at the time the application was submitted, and revise the \u201cfinal conditions\u201d to comply with such regulations; and (2) damages incurred as a result of the delay (caused by Red Lodge\u2019s violation of sixty-day requirement), and the final twenty-six conditions imposed, and also damages for Kiely\u2019s deprivation of property rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>under \u00a7 1983. Red Lodge responded that the adoption of interim zoning ordinances on April 8,1997, allowed it to prohibit any uses in conflict with the ordinances, and that the individual council members were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b69 In a motion for partial summary judgment filed on August 18, 1998, Kiely requested the District Court deem its preliminary plat application approved, subject to the original eighteen conditions recommended by the County Planning Board, because Red Lodge failed to act within the mandatory sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b610 The parties commenced mediation in the Fall of 1998. Following negotiations on September 14, 1998, the parties entered into a subdivision improvements agreement (SLA), which Red Lodge conditionally accepted on January 12,1999, by adding seven conditions that were not considered in the original agreement. Kiely rejected this conditional SIA, and pursued relief in the District Court, seeking either (a) a \u201cdeemed approval\u201d of the County Planning Board\u2019s eighteen conditions, or (b) an order requiring the city to revise its twenty-six condition approval to comply with the 1995 Subdivision Regulations for Carbon County, City of Red Lodge, and Towns of Bridger, Joliet, Fromberg, and Bearcreek (1995 Subdivision Regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b611 On March 20, 1999, the District Court entered partial summary judgment, finding that as a matter of law, Red Lodge violated \u00a7 76-3-604, MCA, by failing to act on Kiely\u2019s application for plat approval within sixty days. The court declined to grant relief in the form of a \u201cdeemed approval\u201d of Kiely\u2019s application, and instead ordered Red Lodge to review and \u201capprove, conditionally approve or deny,\u201d the application within thirty days, adding that any conditions based on regulations other than the 1995 Subdivision Regulations in effect at the time of preliminary application, were unlawful and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b612 Following a public hearing on April 15, 1999, the City Council unanimously denied Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application. However, it failed to provide Kiely with either written findings as required by \u00a7 76-3-608(2), MCA, or a written statement as mandated by \u00a7 76-3-620, MCA. Kiely then filed an amended complaint, seeking reversal of Red Lodge\u2019s denial of its application and an order requiring Red Lodge to apply the subdivision regulations in effect at the time the application was submitted. Kiely also sought compensatory damages and attorneys fees pursuant to its original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b613 In May of2000, Red Lodge filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging the acts by Red Lodge and the City Council were legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>acts, thus qualifying Red Lodge and the City Council for statutory immunity under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA. Red Lodge further asserted that it had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously. On June 13,2000, Kiely filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking a finding that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying its applications and that the City Council's failure to enter a written statement at the April 15, 1999, meeting was arbitrary and capricious <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b614 On July 3, 2000, the District Court entered an order, denying Kiely\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and denying summary judgment as to Red Lodge. However, the court granted summary judgment as to the individually named members of the City Council, pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, concluding the individual council members were immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b615 Prior to trial, the court and the parties agreed that Kiely\u2019s appeal from Red Lodge\u2019s denial of its application, under \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, was a non-jury issue, and therefore submitted that issue to the jury sitting as an advisory jury. However, Kiely also sought damages for Red Lodge\u2019s arbitrary or capricious actions on its application under \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA, as well as damages under \u00a7 1983, and those issues were submitted to the jury for a special verdict. The jury trial commenced on July 17, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b616 Following the trial, the jury found Red Lodge acted arbitrarily or capriciously and awarded Kiely $292,170.00 in damages pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA. The jury also found for Kiely on its constitutional claims under \u00a7 1983 (finding substantive and procedural due process violations, but not equal protection violations), but awarded damages in the sum of only $1.00. In an advisory verdict, the jury found Red Lodge had acted arbitrarily or capriciously or unlawfully when it (a) failed to act on Kiely\u2019s application within sixty days; (b) conditionally approved the application subject to twenty-six conditions, a number of which were unlawful and void; (c) voted to approve the SLA, subject to seven additional conditions; and (d) denied Kiely\u2019s application on April 15,1999, and failed to issue written findings explaining the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"ADfN\">\u00b617 Following the verdict, Kiely petitioned the court for attorney's fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (\u00a7 1988). Kiely also continued to pursue its appeal to the District Court, under \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, from the City Council\u2019s decision denying its application. Kiely sought an order approving the application as originally approved by the County Planning Board (i.e., subject to the eighteen conditions), or in the alternative, an order approving the application and January 1999 SIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00b618 On August 25, 2000, the District Court held a hearing to determine if Kiely was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and whether Kiely was entitled to relief under \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA. On October 23, 2000, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order. The court concluded that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily, capriciously and unlawfully when it failed to act on Kiely\u2019s application within sixty days, conditionally approved the application with conditions pursuant to the 1997 Development Code, rather than those in effect at the time of application (the 1995 Subdivision Regulations), and when it denied Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application. The court ordered Red Lodge to vacate its April 15, 1999 denial of Kiely\u2019s application and conditionally approve the application, subject to the original eighteen conditions recommended by the County Planning Board. The District Court awarded $250,243.50 in attorney\u2019s fees to Kiely, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, and also awarded $5,627.46 in costs pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b619 Red Lodge appeals the jury instructions and special verdict form, several of the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, the court\u2019s remedy requiring Red Lodge to approve the application subject to the eighteen conditions, the calculation of damages, and the attorney\u2019s fees award. Kiely cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s entry of two partial summary judgments, one of which allegedly eliminated conditional approval of Kiely\u2019s application, and the other which dismissed the individual City Council members.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b620 This Opinion addresses multiple and diverse issues, and therefore, each standard of review will be set forth immediately preceding discussion of the issue at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b621 Did the District Court err in submitting Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\u00b622 Kiely brought claims against Red Lodge under \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-625(1) and (2), MCA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. On appeal, Red Lodge challenges several jury instructions given by the District Court relative to Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims and alleges prejudice from the instructions. Kiely counters that we should not consider challenges to the constitutional claims, arguing that Red Lodge first raised them in its reply brief where it asserted Kiely was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. However, the question of whether Kiely possessed a protected property interest was the underlying basis of Red Lodge\u2019s challenges to the jury instructions, and we therefore will reach the merits of Red Lodge\u2019s challenge of Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. Because it is dispositive of other issues on appeal, we will address the issue of Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims first.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b623  In order to state a viable \u00a7 1983 claim, the plaintiff must first establish it possesses a protected interest since the guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \u201capply only when a constitutionally protected liberty interest or property interest is at stake.\u201d <em>Tellis v. Godinez </em>(9th Cir. 1993), 5 F.3d 1314, 1316 (citations omitted). Thus, \u201ca threshold requirement to a substantive or procedural due process claim is the plaintiffs showing of a liberty or property interest protected by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Wedges/Ledges of California, Inc. v. City of Phoenix, Ariz. </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 24 F.3d 56, 62 (citing <em>Board of Regents v. Roth </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2705, 33 L.Ed.2d 548, 556).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b624 While the Due Process Clause provides protection for certain property or liberty interests, property interests themselves are not created by the Constitution; \u201cthey are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source, such as state law.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701. <em>See also Parks v. Watson </em>(9th Cir. 1983), 716 F.2d 646, 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b625  Whether one has a protected property interest is determined as a matter of law. <em>See Doran v. Houle </em>(9th Cir. 1983), 721 F.2d 1182, 1184 (citation omitted) (\u201cAlthough the answer to the question of whether a property interest was present necessarily depends on the facts in this case, it remains a legal issue requiring an interpretation of the federal Constitution.\u201d). <em>See also, Gardner v. Baltimore Mayor &amp; City Council </em>(4th Cir. 1992), 969 F.2d 63, 68 (In analyzing substantive due process claims, \u201c[i]f there is no cognizable property interest, there is no need to reach the question of whether the purported deprivation was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d); and <em>RRI Realty Corp. v. Inc. Village of Southhampton </em>(2d Cir. 1989), 870 F.2d 911, <em>918, cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 893, 110 S.Ct. 240, 107 L.Ed.2d 191 (1989) (\u201cSince the entitlement analysis focuses on the degree of official discretion and not on the probability of its favorable exercise, the question of whether an applicant has a property interest will normally be a matter of law for the court.\u201d). The threshold question of whether one has a protected property interest must therefore be answered in the affirmative before the question of whether one was deprived of that interest may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>submitted to a jury. Thus, we must determine as a matter of law whether Kiely established a property interest sufficient to maintain its \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b626 Kiely claimed two sources for its \u201cprotected property interests,\u201d asserting that (a) a governing body may not unreasonably restrict Kiely\u2019s right to use its property, relying on \u00a7 76-3-608(5)(a), MCA; and (b) Kiely had a right to final approval of its plat, relying on \u00a7 76-3-611(1), MCA. Therefore, we must determine if either of these statutes confer a protected property interest sufficient to sustain a \u00a7 1983 claim. If the statutory scheme places a \u201csignificant substantive restriction\u201d on the decision to grant a permit or license, it would be sufficient to create a protected property interest. <em>Wedges, </em>24 F.3d at 62 (citing <em>Goodisman v. Lytle </em>(9th Cir. 1984), 724 F.2d 818, 820).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b627  When a plaintiff looks to state law to provide a basis for a property interest, \u201c[a] reasonable expectation of entitlement is determined largely by the language of the statute and the extent to which the entitlement is couched in mandatory terms.\u201d <em>Wedges, </em>24 F.3d at 62 (citation omitted). <em>See also, Allen v. City of Beverly Hills </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 911 F.2d 367, 370 (expectation of entitlement, sufficient to create a property interest, depends \u201clargely upon the extent to which the statute contains mandatory language that restricts the discretion of the decisionmaker\u201d) (citing <em>Jacobson v. Hannifin </em>(9th Cir. 1980), 627 F.2d 177, 180). \u201cA statute will create an entitlement to a governmental benefit either if the statute sets out conditions under which the benefit <em>must </em>be granted or if the statute sets out the <em>only </em>conditions under which the benefit may be denied.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>911 F.2d at 370 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted) (because of the broad discretion vested in the city to lay off the plaintiff \u201cin the interests of the economy,\u201d plaintiff had no constitutionally protected property interest in his employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b628 The Fourth Circuit has concluded that any significant discretion conferred upon a local agency defeats a claim of entitlement. <em>Gardner, </em>969 F.2d at 68 (plaintiff had no legitimate claim of entitlement to issuance of a public works agreement when state and municipal law accorded the city discretion to refuse to issue the agreement). In <em>Gardner, </em>the court noted that \u201cwhether a property-holder possesses a legitimate claim of entitlement to a permit or approval turns on whether, under state and municipal law, the local agency lacks <em>all </em>discretion to deny issuance of the permit or to withhold its approval.\u201d <em>Gardner, </em>969 F.2d at 68 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). The court further explained that \u201c[u]nder this standard, a cognizable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>property interest exists \u2018only when the discretion of the issuing agency is so narrowly circumscribed that approval of a property application is virtually assured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gardner, </em>969 F.2d at 68 (citing <em>RRI Realty, </em>870 F.2d at 918).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">\u00b629 \u201cWhen analyzing whether a plaintiff presents a legitimate claim of entitlement, we focus on the degree of discretion given the decisionmaker and not on the probability of the decision\u2019s favorable outcome.\u201d <em>Jacobs, Visconsi &amp; Jacobs v. City of Lawrence </em>(10th Cir. 1991), 927 F.2d 1111, 1116 (citation omitted). If applicants for rezoning cannot establish that \u201cthere is a set of conditions the fulfillment of which would give rise to a legitimate expectation\u201d of approval of their request, \u201cthe city\u2019s decision making lacks sufficient substantive limitations to invoke due process guarantees.\u201d <em>Jacobs, </em>927 F.2d at 1116 (citing <em>Walker v. City of Kansas City, Mo. </em>(8th Cir. 1990), 911 F.2d 80, 94; <em>Spence v. Zimmerman </em>(11th Cir. 1989), 873 F.2d 256, 258; <em>Yale Auto Parts, Inc. v. Johnson </em>(2d Cir. 1985), 758 F.2d 54; and <em>RRI Realty, </em>870 F.2d 911). <em>See also, Baumann v.

The two statutes Kiely relied on for this right were \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-608(5)(a) and 76-3-611(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b631 Does \u00a7 76-3-608(5), MCA, establish a constitutionally protected property interest (i.e., a legitimate claim of entitlement)?</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b632 Section 76-3-608, MCA, sets forth the criteria for local government review of preliminary plat applications and reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">(1) The basis for the governing body\u2019s decision to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove a subdivision is whether the preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or additional information <em>demonstrates that development of the subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">(2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3), as applicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>(4) The governing body <em>may require </em>the subdivider to design the subdivision to reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under subsection (3).

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b633 Subsection (5)(a), upon which Kiely relied for its vested property right, directs the government to not act \u201cunreasonably.\u201d Such a broad and subjective standard implicitly vests a substantial level of discretion in the governing body. <em>See Jacobson v.

Moreover, \u00a7 76-3-608(1), MCA, explicitly vests a considerable amount of discretion in the governing body, since the governing body makes its decision under the broad guidance of whether \u201cthe subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter.\u201d In subsection (4), the governing body has the discretion to require the subdivider to design the subdivision to minimize identified impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b634  No provision of \u00a7 76-3-608, MCA, either confers or infers a \u201cright to enjoy,\u201d or \u201cright to use,\u201d property in a particular manner, as Kiely argued. The statute imposes restrictions upon a landowner\u2019s ability to develop land; it does not establish a right to develop land. We therefore conclude \u00a7 76-3-608, MCA, does not establish a legitimate claim of entitlement to support Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b635 Does Montana\u2019s Subdivision and Platting Act, specifically \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-610 and 76-3-611, MCA, establish a constitutionally protected property interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b636 The remaining statutory provisions relied on by Kiely for its claimed protected property interest provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">76-3-610.

Kiely\u2019s proposed subdivision was located within the city limits of Red Lodge, thus Red Lodge is the \u201cgoverning body\u201d contemplated in \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-610 and -611, MCA. We must now examine the level of discretion reposed in the governing body concerning plat applications. If we conclude there is a lack of significant substantive restrictions on Red Lodge\u2019s powers to reject a plat, then we must conclude Kiely did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">\u00b638 Significantly, although Kiely argues it is entitled to final plat approval, Kiely never submitted a final plat for approval. Kiely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>received a conditioned approval on September 10, 1997 (with twenty-six conditions), and then following the court\u2019s order on summary judgment, Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application was denied entirely on April 15, 1999. At no time did Red Lodge consider a final plat application from Kiely.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b639 The county/city local subdivision regulations require that to obtain final approval, a final plat must be submitted to the subdivision administrator before the expiration of the preliminary plat approval period. <em>See </em>1995 Subdivision Regulations, \u00a7 II-C-1, Final Plat Submittal. Moreover, \u00a7 76-3-611(l)(a), MCA, requires the governing body approve \u201cthe [final] plat only if it conforms to the conditions of approval set forth on the preliminary plat ....\u201d In the instant case, there is no final plat available for review to determine if it conforms to the preliminary plat approval. However, Kiely maintains it had a protected property interest <em>once it acquired conditioned approval, </em>claiming it was entitled to final plat approval if it could meet all the requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b640 Under \u00a7 76-3-610, MCA, Red Lodge could not impose any new conditions as a prerequisite to final plat approval as long as the final approval was obtained within the approval period. Thus, according to \u00a7 76-3-610, MCA, it appears there were substantive restrictions on Red Lodge\u2019s powers to reject the final plat, as long as the final approval was obtained within the stated time frame. However, \u00a7 76-3-610, MCA, must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 76-3-611, MCA, since final plat approval is guided by the latter section.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b641 According to \u00a7 76-3-611(1), MCA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">The governing body shall examine each final subdivision plat and <em>shall </em>approve the plat <em>only </em>if: (a) it conforms to the conditions of approval set forth on the preliminary plat and to the terms of this chapter and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter; and (b) the county treasurer has certified that all real property taxes ... have been paid.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Although \u00a7 76-3-611, MCA, limits the discretionary power of the governing body (\u201ca preliminarily approved plat <em>shall </em>be approved\u201d), subsection (1) still requires the conditions of approval set forth on the preliminary plat be satisfied <em>before </em>the governing body is required to grant final approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\u00b642 In the situation here, Kiely did not fulfill all the conditions of preliminary approval. Kiely admits in its opening brief that: \u201cKiely was prepared to meet a majority of conditions,\u201d and then asserts: \u201c[u]pon meeting the valid conditions, Kiely had a vested right to final plat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>approval,\u201d citing \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-610, and -611, MCA. Moreover, during William Kiely\u2019s (William\u2019s) testimony, he was asked, \u201cHow close at that time [Spring of 1999] were you to applying for final platitude [sic]?\u201d William responded, \u201cAt that time it was just a matter of cleaning up a few loose ends and we were ready to go.\u201d Later William was asked to go through each of the twenty-six conditions and explain any problems he had with them and why. During this portion of his testimony, William commented on the provisions, noting he had \u201cno problem\u201d with some, while others were \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to meet. Although \u00a7 76-3-611, MCA, appears to leave little or no discretion to the city to deny final plat approval to the applicant who has met all conditions set by the governing body, Kiely had not yet met those conditions, and therefore, Red Lodge retained the discretion to deny Kiely\u2019s final approval pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-611(l)(a), MCA. <em>See Parks, </em>716 F.2d at 657 (\u201cThe Oregon statute mandates that if the three matters are determined in favor of the petition the governing body <em>shall </em>vacate the streets. Once the conditions are met the city lacks discretionary powers.\u201d) (underline emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b643 Kiely relies on <em>Bateson v. Geisse </em>(9th Cir. 1988), 857 F.2d 1300, in asserting it possessed a property interest. In <em>Bateson, </em>the Court of Appeals concluded Bateson\u2019s substantive due process rights were violated when the city failed to issue him a building permit. In its holding, the court did not explicitly hold Bateson had a protected property interest in his building permit, but did rely on the city\u2019s regulations that required issuance of a permit once an applicant\u2019s building plans complied with the code and the fees were paid. The court noted that Bateson had met all the necessary requirements for the city to issue him a building permit, and that the city regulations did not include a provision which allowed the city council to review an application before the permit was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b644 Kiely\u2019s reliance on <em>Bateson </em>is misplaced. There, the plaintiff had met all the requirements necessary for the city to issue him a building permit, whereas in the instant case, Kiely had not met the conditions for final approval (i.e., had yet to apply for final approval and had not met all the conditions from the preliminary plat approval in September of 1997). Furthermore, the regulations at issue in <em>Bateson </em>did not allow the city to review a building permit issuance, whereas here, the City Council was specifically required to review and approve preliminary and final plat applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b645  Thus, we conclude Kiely did not have a protected property interest at the preliminary approval stage of his plat application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>process. Arguably, Kiely could have established a property interest upon application for final approval, if it either met all twenty-six conditions or, once it was established which of the twenty-six conditions were based on the 1997 Development Code, that it had met those remaining lawful conditions, and paid the necessary taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b646 The problem is that the record before us does not clearly establish which of the twenty-six conditions Kiely complied with and which it did not. Nor does the record even establish compliance with the original eighteen conditions. Although in briefs to the District Court on pre-trial motions, Kiely questioned the legality of some of the twenty-six conditions, the record before us does not clearly demonstrate which conditions were \u201cunlawful,\u201d or impossible to satisfy according to Kiely. Significantly, the question of which of the twenty-six conditions were unlawful was never decided by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AUJ\">\u00b647  For Kiely to establish a legitimate entitlement to, or protected property interest in, final approval of its preliminary application, it would have had to either demonstrate it complied with all the conditions imposed upon its preliminary plat, or at a minimum, that it had met all the \u201clawful\u201d conditions. However, Kiely never reached this point in the application process, and therefore could not present evidence demonstrating the level of compliance required to establish a protected property interest in his plat application. In the absence of a demonstrated protected property interest, Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims cannot stand. Accordingly, we conclude the District Court erred in submitting Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims to the jury, and we vacate that portion of the jury\u2019s special verdict and decision of the court which premised Red Lodge\u2019s liability on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b648 In light of our dismissal of its \u00a7 1983 claims for lack of a protected property interest, is Kiely entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b649 Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981,1981a, 1982,1983,1985, and 1986 of this title,... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs, except that in any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity such officer shall not be held hable for any costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, unless such action was clearly in excess of such officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b650  Although the power to award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 is discretionary, a prevailing plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 claim should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee \u201cunless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d <em>Laudert v.

However, before attorney\u2019s fees can be granted, a court must determine whether the plaintiff prevailed. <em>Laudert, </em>\u00b6 49 (citing <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933).

City of San Rafael </em>(1996), 96 F.3d 359, <em>as amended on denial of rehearing, </em>108 F.3d 981 (1997). We disagree.

Although the opinion is difficult to decipher, it appears that the plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim was dismissed as to the city, but that he prevailed as against the officer. Therefore, in <em>Morales, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>unlike here, a basis for an attorney\u2019s fees award under \u00a7 1988 remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b653  Because we have vacated Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 verdict, Kiely is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988.

Although a portion of the special verdict form and some of the jury instructions questioned by Red Lodge involve Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, we will address only those dealing with Kiely\u2019s state law claims, as the \u00a7 1983 portion of the verdict has been vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b656 Red Lodge contends that the special verdict form essentially directed the jury to find for Kiely in this case, arguing that the interrogatories were unduly confusing and presented the issues of fact in a biased manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b657  The use of a special verdict form is left to the discretion of the trial court. Rule 49(a), M.R.Civ.P. A district court\u2019s decision to use a special verdict form is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Barthule v. Karman </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 477, 488, 886 P.2d 971, 978. <em>See also Baldauf v. Arrow Tank and Engineering, </em>1999 MT 81, \u00b6 49, 294 Mont. 107, \u00b6 49, 979 P.2d 166, \u00b6 49. Although it is \u201cwithin the trial court\u2019s discretion to structure the form and frame the questions of a special verdict, the interrogatories must be adequate to enable the jury to determine the factual issues essential to judgment.\u201d <em>Baldauf, </em>\u00b6 49 (citation omitted). We use a three-part standard to determine the adequacy of a special verdict form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">(1) whether, when read as a whole and in conjunction with the general charge, the interrogatories adequately presented the contested issues to the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">(2) whether the submission of the issues to the jury was fair; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">(3) whether the ultimate questions of fact were clearly submitted to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-13\"><em>Baldauf, </em>\u00b6 49 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">\u00b658 With respect to Kiely\u2019s state law claims, the special verdict form instructed the jury to check either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to the following interrogatories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-15\">1. Did the City of Red Lodge, acting through the Red Lodge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>City Council (the \u201cCity\u201d), act arbitrarily or capriciously when it did not, within the required 60 day period, approve, approve with conditions or deny the Application for Preliminary Plat Approval for the \u201cIsland at Rock Creek\u201d Subdivision (the \u201cApplication\u201d) that was filed with the Carbon County Planning Board (\u201cPlanning Board\u201d) on May 28,1996, by Kiely Construction, L.L.C. and which was forwarded by the Planning Board to the City on July 2,1996, with a recommendation by the Planning Board to approve the Application subject to 18 conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\">2. Did the City act arbitrarily or capriciously when, on September 10,1997, using the wrong regulations, it approved the Application subject to 26 conditions, a number of which were unlawful and void?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">3. Did the City act arbitrarily or capriciously when, on January 12, 1999, it unanimously voted to approve a Subdivision Improvements Agreement subject to seven additional conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">4. Did the City act arbitrarily or capriciously when, on April 15,1999, it unanimously voted to deny the Application and failed to issue written findings explaining the denial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b659 We conclude that Kiely\u2019s state law claims were adequately presented to the jury. Kiely alleged four distinct instances in which Red Lodge\u2019s final action or decision (or delay in making a decision) was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d In order to recover upon its state law claims under \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA, Kiely had to establish that the actions of Red Lodge were \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d Given that this was the level of misconduct required for there to be a finding of liability, it was appropriate for the court to ask the jury whether Red Lodge\u2019s conduct in those alleged instances met the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d threshold, much as would the trial court, in a negligence action, frame its question in terms of \u201cnegligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b660 The interrogatories incorporated facts gleaned from prior District Court rulings and unrefuted evidence presented at the trial. We conclude that the special verdict form presented the issues fairly and also submitted the ultimate questions of fact clearly. Accordingly, we conclude the special verdict form was not confusing, nor did it present the plaintiffs theories in a biased manner. We therefore hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in using this form.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b661 Red Lodge also claims the District Court abused its discretion when it gave certain instructions to the jury, arguing that several of the instructions pertaining to Kiely\u2019s state law claims were either duplicative or unduly emphasized Kiely\u2019s theories in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u00b662  A district court has discretion regarding the instructions it gives or refuses to give to a jury and we will not reverse a district court on the basis of its instructions absent an abuse of discretion. <em>McAlpine v.

In reviewing whether a particular jury instruction was properly given or refused, we consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial. <em>McAlpine, </em>\u00b6 16. The party assigning error to a district court\u2019s instruction must show prejudice in order to prevail, and prejudice will not be found if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>McAlpine, </em>\u00b6 16. <em>See also Barnes v.

Rather, the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on Kiely\u2019s state law claims properly stated the applicable law of the case. We therefore conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b664 What relief is Kiely entitled, to under its state law claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><em>\u00b665 In </em>addition to its \u00a7 1983 claims, Kiely sought statutory relief against Red Lodge pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-625(1) <em>and </em>(2), MCA. Subsection (1) of 76-3-625, MCA, allows a plaintiff to sue for actual damages caused by a governing body\u2019s decision on a plat application if that decision was arbitrary or capricious. In its special verdict, the jury concluded that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily or capriciously when it: (1) failed to review Kiely\u2019s application within sixty days; (2) applied the wrong regulations when it conditionally approved Kiely\u2019s application on September 10,1997, subject to twenty-six conditions-some of which were unlawful and void; (3) approved the SIA subject to seven additional conditions; and (4) denied Kiely\u2019s application and failed to issue written findings explaining the denial. The jury awarded Kiely $292,170.00 in damages. Inasmuch as a constitutionally protected property interest is not a pre-requisite to a finding of liability under \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA, we need not conduct a constitutional analysis of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>aspect of the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\">\u00b666 In addition to its action for damages pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA, Kiely also appealed Red Lodge\u2019s April 15, 1999 denial of its preliminary plat application, pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA. This subsection allows a party to appeal to the district court if it is aggrieved by a governing body\u2019s approval, conditional approval, or disapproval of a proposed preliminary plat or final subdivision plat. However, subsection (2) does not specify when the district court may grant relief nor what relief it may grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b667 Following the trial, and after considering the jury\u2019s advisory verdict, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, pursuant to subsection (2) of76-3-625, MCA. The court concluded that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily, capriciously and unlawfully when it: failed to act within the mandatory sixty-day requirement of \u00a7 76-3-604, MCA; conditionally approved the application with conditions pursuant to the 1997 Development Code rather than the 1995 Subdivision Regulations in effect at the time the application was submitted; and rejected the application without findings. The court ordered Red Lodge to vacate its April 15, 1999 denial and to conditionally approve the preliminary plat application subject to the eighteen conditions originally recommended by the County Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b668 Red Lodge contends this order was an unconstitutional violation of the doctrine of separation of powers, arguing that under the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, the governing body (city, town, county) had \u201cthe sole discretion to approve, conditionally approve or deny a proposed application.\u201d Kiely counters that the Act does not limit, the District Court\u2019s statutory powers on appeal, and that the court properly determined that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and unlawfully. Also related to this issue is Kiely\u2019s contention on cross-appeal that the District Court\u2019s partial summary judgment on March 20,1999, effectively abrogated the prior conditional approval of Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b669  When we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, our standard of review is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>Hampton v.

The standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, is the same standard of review we apply to decisions of administrative agencies: \u201cthe standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>review to be applied by the trial court and this Court is whether the record establishes that the agency [i.e., governing body] acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully.\u201d <em>Madison River R.V.

Dept. of State Lands </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 451, 458-59, 778 P.2d 862, 867). When a district court or this Court reviews an action under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard, a reversal of the appealed ruling is not permitted \u201cmerely because the record contains inconsistent evidence or evidence which might support a different result. Rather, the decision being challenged must appear to be random, unreasonable, or seemingly unmotivated, based on the existing record.\u201d <em>Silva v. City of Columbia Falls </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 329, 335, 852 P.2d 671, 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b670 First, we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination that Red Lodge acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and unlawfully in denying Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application on April 15,1999, was in error. In its Memorandum, the District Court noted that its \u201cconscience was shocked by the City Council\u2019s disregard for the laws of our state.\u201d We conclude the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law were based on substantial and credible evidence, as well as the advisory verdict from the jury, and therefore conclude the court did not err in determining Red Lodge acted arbitrarily, capriciously, and unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b671 Section 76-3-625(2), MCA, is silent as to what relief a district court may enter for an aggrieved party. Under this statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">[a] party ... who is aggrieved by a decision of the governing body to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove a proposed preliminary plat or final subdivision plat may, within 30 days after the decision, appeal to the district court in the county in which the property involved is located. The petition must specify the grounds upon which the appeal is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Section 76-3-625(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u00b672 The legislative history behind \u00a7 76-3-625, MCA, is devoid of helpful insight into the scope of relief intended under the statute, other than a passing indication that the provision \u201coverturned\u201d the holding in <em>City of Kalispell v. Flathead County </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 258, 859 P.2d 458 (because there was no mechanism for judicial review of a conditioned approval of a preliminary subdivision plat in the Subdivision and Platting Act, the County Commissioner\u2019s decision was not appealable). We had stated, \u201cthe legislature did not provide an appeal process under this Act for cases involving decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>conditional approval of preliminary plats; accordingly, this Court, will not fabricate one.\u201d <em>Kalispell, </em>260 Mont. at 261, 859 P.2d at 460 (citing <em>Sourdough v. Board of County Com\u2019rs </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 325, 327, 833 P.2d 207, 208). Although by enacting \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, the Legislature provided an option for appealing a governing body\u2019s decision concerning subdivision applications, it failed to provide any guidance concerning the appropriate scope of review or the parameters of the district court\u2019s authority on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">\u00b673 However, a statutory right of appeal \u201cis not rendered nugatory because the statute does not specifically prescribe rules to guide the district court in trying such an appeal.\u201d <em>Heldenbrand v. Montana St. Bd. of Reg. for P.E. &amp; L.S. </em>(1966), 147 Mont. 271, 278, 411 P.2d 744, 748 (the function of the district court, as provided by a statutory right of appeal of the board of registration decisions, was to \u201cassure that administrative officials do not overstep the guidelines of their authority set down by the legislature,\u201d and as such right to appeal existed, the district court did not err when it denied plaintiffs writ of mandate). In <em>Heldenbrand, </em>the statute at issue allowed a person, aggrieved by any action of the hoard of registration, to appeal to the district court, and after a hearing, \u201csaid cotut shall make such decree sustaining or reversing the action of the board as... may seem just and proper.\u201d <em>Heldenbrand, </em>147 Mont. at 276, 411 P.2d at 747 (citing \u00a7 66-2345, RCM 1947 (repealed 1975)). This Court recognized that although a trial of such a case in the district court may be \u201cawkward, difficult, and unsatisfactory,\u201d the \u201clearned district judge would be able to devise ways and means not incompatible with the Code for disposing of the case.\u201d <em>Heldenbrand, </em>147 Mont. at 279, 411 P.2d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b674 Although <em>Heldenbrand </em>dealt with an appeal of an administrative agency decision, in light of our holding in <em>Madison River, </em>where we applied the same standard of review (arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful) to legislative decisions as to those of administrative agencies, we conclude the rationale behind the analysis for fashioning the proper scope of judicial review in <em>Heldenbrand </em>likewise applies in the instant case. As we noted in <em>Heldenbrand,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">[t]he relief to be granted, or the disposition to be made of the appeal, must depend on the facts and circumstances of each case as it comes before the district judge. Corrective machinery, by its nature, must be given flexible limits, within of course the constitutional and statutory framework, that adequate and proper dispositions of each case may result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\"><em>Heldenbrand, </em>147 Mont. at 279, 411 P.2d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00b675  We conclude \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, vests a district court with the discretion to determine what relief is appropriate based on the facts and circumstances of each appeal. As we have noted, \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, provides no limits on the district court\u2019s authority or scope of review, and we decline to fashion such limits out of thin air. As we consistently have held, the Court\u2019s role in statutory construction \u201cis to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d <em>Huether v.

We conclude the plain language of \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, grants the district court the authority to fashion an appropriate remedy for an aggrieved party.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b676  We conclude the District Court\u2019s remedy in this case-ordering conditional approval of Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application subject to the original eighteen conditions recommended by the County Planning Board-was a proper remedy, and an appropriate response to the unique factual situation with which the court was presented. In fashioning this remedy, the court noted that \u201cthe evidence was clear that [Kiely] was entitled to the approval,\u201d and recognized that, \u201c[i]n view of the City Council\u2019s disregard of the laws of our state in acting upon [Kiely\u2019s] [preliminary plat] application, there is no reason to expect that it would follow those laws if the court were to ... remand the matter, back to the City Council.\u201d We cannot fault the District Court\u2019s logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b677 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling which ordered Red Lodge to (a) vacate its April 15,1999 denial of Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application, and (b) conditionally approve the preliminary plat application subject to the original eighteen conditions for a period of three years. However, we modify the court\u2019s ruling only to the extent that Kiely\u2019s preliminary approval shall be in force for three years from the date of this Court\u2019s decision, rather than three years from the date the District Court\u2019s order was entered. This conclusion also resolves Kiely\u2019s contention on cross-appeal, that the District Court\u2019s partial summary judgment effectively abrogated the prior conditional approval of Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat, because Kiely has been granted the conditional approval it sought in its motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Issue 5</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b678 Did the District Court err in dismissing the individual defendants by order of summary judgment on the basis of \u00a7 2-9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>305(5), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b679 We review appeals from summary judgment rulings <em>de novo.

When we review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we apply the same evaluation as the district court applies, based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Sleath, </em>\u00b6 19 (citation omitted). Finally, we review a district court\u2019s interpretation of law to determine if it is correct. <em>Steinback v. Bankers Life and Cas.

Kiely also asserts the City Council's actions were administrative, rather than legislative, and that therefore neither Red Lodge nor the individuals may claim immunity under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA. Red Lodge counters that the council members were acting within the scope of their employment and that their actions were legislative, and that therefore the immunity provisions of \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, apply. Red Lodge also cites to <em>W.D. Const. Inc. v. Bd. of County Com\u2019rs </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 348, 351-52, 707 P.2d 1111, 1113, for the proposition that the act of approving a plat application is a legislative act, which entitles the council members to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b681 In its July 3, 2000 Memorandum and Order, the District Court declined to determine, under \u00a7 2-9-111(2), MCA, whether the acts the City Council by its council members were either \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u2018legislative.\u201d In the opinion of the court, \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-111(2), MCA, and 76-3-625(1), MCA, were not in conflict. Rather, the court considered \u201cthe remedy afforded by Section 76-3-625(1), MCA, to be specific to cases involving the appropriate application of the provisions of the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act.\u201d The court granted the individual council members immunity under \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, noting that the \u201cstated position of the City of Red Lodge that the city council members acted in their official capacities as representatives of the Red Lodge City Council is tacit acknowledgment as contemplated by \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b682  First, we reject Red Lodge\u2019s argument that the actions by the City Council were legislative and therefore subject to immunity protection. We conclude the council's acts were administrative, and not legislative, and therefore afford neither Red Lodge nor the council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>members immunity under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b683 Although we held in <em>W.D. Construction </em>that the members of a Board of County Commissioners were immune from suit for damages arising from allegations that they failed to require compliance with subdivision regulations prior to a final plat approval, Red Lodge\u2019s reliance on <em>W.D. Construction </em>is misplaced, because that case was decided prior to the amendments to \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA. As we recognized in <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 224, 233, 819 P.2d 186, 191, \u201cSection 2-9-111, MCA (1991), significantly changed the statute and therefore modified the theories expressed in the various immunity cases . ...\u201d Moreover, we recognized that the amendments \u201cmake clear that a governmental entity is no longer immune for <em>all </em>its actions,\u201d only those actions considered to be legislative. <em>Knight v. City of Missoula </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 232, 245, 827 P.2d 1270, 1278 (emphasis in original). In <em>Dagel, </em>we recited the purpose of the act amending \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, which the Legislature described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">AN ACT CLARIFYING THAT STATUTORY LEGISLATIVE IMMUNITY EXTENDS ONLY TO LEGISLATIVE BODIES OF GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND ONLY TO LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THOSE BODIES; <em>CLARIFYING THAT GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES ARE NOT IMMUNE UNDER THE LEGISLATIVE IMMUNITY STATUTE FOR NONLEGISLATIVE </em>ACTIONS....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>Dagel, </em>250 Mont. at 231-32, 819 P.2d at 191 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b684 A legislative act is an action by a legislative body which results in creation of law or declaration of public policy. Section 2-9-111 (l)(c)(i)(A), MCA. By contrast, an administrative act is one taken in the execution of a law or public policy. Section 2-9-lll(c)(ii), MCA. <em>See Knight, </em>252 Mont. at 246, 827 P.2d at 1278 (a city\u2019s duties in connection with maintaining its streets is an administrative function); and <em>Dagel, </em>250 Mont. at 233, 819 P.2d at 191 (in an action for constructive discharge, alleged harassment by a supervisor does not constitute a legislative act).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b685 Although approving or denying plat applications are official duties of the City Council, such actions do not \u201cresult in the creation of law or declaration of public policy,\u201d but rather are the execution of the policies as set forth in the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act. We conclude the actions by Red Lodge and its City Council, which gave rise to this action, were administrative acts, and accordingly conclude neither the governmental entity nor any member acting for the entity are immune from suit for the actions alleged in Kiely\u2019s complaint. However, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>conclusion is not dispositive of the issue before us. We must now determine if the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the individual council members pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">\u00b686 The District Court relied on \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">Recovery against a governmental entity under the provisions of parts 1 through 3 of this chapter constitutes a complete bar to any action or recovery of damages by the claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the employee whose negligence or wrongful act, error, or omission or other actionable conduct gave rise to the claim. In any such action against a governmental entity, the employee whose conduct gave rise to the suit is immune from liability by reasons of the same subj ect matter if the governmental entity acknowledges or is bound by a judicial determination that the conduct upon which the claim is brought arises out of the course and scope of the employee\u2019s employment, unless the claim constitutes an exclusion provided in (b) through (d) of subsection (6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b687 We have had occasion to interpret and apply this statute. In <em>Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 207, 856 P.2d 202, the jury awarded the plaintiff $850,000 in damages against the city for breach of contract and/or breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and also awarded $100,000 in damages against the city engineer for intentional interference with contractual relations. After determining the recovery against the engineer and the recovery against the city arose from the same subject matter, we held \u201cthe double recovery awarded by the jury is barred by the plain language of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA,\u201d and struck the $100,000 award against the city engineer from the judgment. <em>Story, </em>259 Mont. at 221, 856 P.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b688  All the counts alleged in Kiely\u2019s complaint and amended complaint turn on actions performed by the individually named defendants, while serving as members of the City Council. The council members\u2019 actions served as the factual basis for Kiely\u2019s claims for damages under \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA and \u00a7 1983, as well as for Kiely\u2019s appeal of the City Councils\u2019 final decisions pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA. The recovery sought by Kiely against both Red Lodge and the City Council members arose out of the same subject matter, and because the intent behind \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, is to prevent a plaintiff from recovering from <em>both </em>the governmental entity and the individuals acting on behalf of that entity for the same conduct, we conclude Kiely is barred from recovering awards against the individual council members, separate and in addition to the awards it recovers from Red <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b689 Kiely argues the individual defendants cannot immunize themselves (i.e., acknowledge their conduct was within the scope of employment) without creating a conflict of interest. However, we conclude the first sentence of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, is on its face, a complete bar to holding the individual council members liable. <em>See Story, </em>259 Mont. at 222, 856 P.2d at 211. Therefore, we will not address Kiely\u2019s arguments concerning the effects of the second sentence of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b690  Although the District Court employed a slightly different analysis of \u00a7 2-9-305(5), MCA, it reached the same result as we do here, and we will uphold a court ruling if it is correct, regardless of the reasons given below for the result. <em>Schmasow v.

The district court has broad discretion to determine if evidence is admissible. Thus, absent an abuse of that discretion, this Court will not overturn the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Finstad, </em>\u00b6 43. <em>See also Baldauf, </em>\u00b6 41 (district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible pursuant to the Montana Rules of Evidence). \u201cThe test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Co-Op., Inc., </em>1998 MT 306, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 118, \u00b6 13, 970 P.2d 84, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">\u00b693 Red Lodge argues the District Court erred by refusing to admit certain documents and testimony that demonstrated the reasons the City Council denied Kiely\u2019s application (i.e., minutes of April 15,1999 meeting, and certain testimony of council members). Red Lodge also argues the court erred in admitting evidence of settlement negotiations and the resulting SIA, and in excluding evidence that Kiely\u2019s proposed subdivision did not meet the zoning requirements under the 1995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Subdivision Regulations. Finally, Red Lodge contends it was reasonable for it to believe the ruling in <em>Town Pump, Inc. v. Board of Adjustment, </em>1998 MT 294, 292 Mont. 6, 971 P.2d 349, permitted it to apply its 1997 Development Code retroactively, and that the District Court therefore erred in excluding evidence relating to the 1997 Development Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\">\u00b694  First, Red Lodge asserts the testimony regarding settlement negotiations and the resulting SIA were inadmissible under Rule 408, M.R.Evid. The District Court held that it was not precluded from admitting evidence of the settlement negotiations because under \u00a7 76-3-608(5)(b), MCA, which required the governing body to consult with the subdivider and give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the subdivider, Red Lodge was statutorily mandated to negotiate. We conclude the District Court did not err in admitting evidence from the settlement negotiations and resulting subdivision improvement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b695 Rule 408, M.R.Evid., is not a complete bar on evidence concerning offers of compromise. Rather, Rule 408, M.R.Evid., excludes only evidence that is being offered to prove liability or the validity of a claim or amount. The rule specifically \u201cdoes not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose ....\u201d Rule 408, M.R.Evid. The testimony concerning settlement negotiations and the resulting SIA were not offered to prove liability or the validity of Kiely5s claim, nor to prove the matter had been settled (i.e., to enforce the SIA). Rather, Kiely offered the evidence to demonstrate the arbitrary and capricious nature of the decision of Red Lodge to adopt the SIA subject to seven new conditions. Therefore, the evidence falls under the exception clause of Rule 408. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the negotiations and resulting SIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b696  Second, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded the minutes of the April 15, 1999 City Council meeting, as well as testimony from individual council members, as offered by Red Lodge to explain the individual member\u2019s reasons for the denial. The record is clear that Red Lodge violated \u00a7 76-3-620, MCA, by not issuing a written statement explaining the reasons for the denial and the evidence justifying the denial. The council meeting minutes are not the equivalent of the written statement the council was statutorily required to issue, and cannot be used as a substitute. Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u00b697 Norwerethe after-the-fact opinions ofindividual council members as to the reasons for the denial relevant. In an analogous situation, courts will not consider post-enactment statements of legislators because they are not part of the legislative history and accordingly, not part of the record. <em>See Slaven v. BP America, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1992), 973 F.2d 1468, 1475; and <em>Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. U.S. E.P.A. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1989), 886 F.2d 355, 365. Therefore, we conclude it was not error for the trial court to exclude testimony from the individual council members as to their reasons for denying Kiely\u2019s preliminary application, since such testimony would constitute \u201cpost-decision\u201d statements, which were not properly part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b698  Third, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded evidence concerning zoning requirements. The trial court properly concluded that evidence dealing with zoning was not relevant to the issue of whether Red Lodge acted arbitrarily or capriciously when it acted on Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat applications under the Subdivision and Platting Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b699 Red Lodge also challenges the District Court\u2019s partial summary judgment ruling which concluded that the 1997 Development Code (which presumably addressed zoning issues) could not be applied retroactively. The District Court rejected Red Lodge\u2019s argument that our decision in <em>Town Pump </em>allowed Red Lodge to apply the 1997 Development Code to Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of law to determine if it is correct. <em>Steinback, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b6100  Although <em>Town Pump </em>addressed issues similar to those presented here, this case is readily distinguishable on its facts. Here, an explicit provision of the Subdivision and Platting Act provided that \u201c[r]eview and approval or disapproval of a subdivision ... may occur only under those regulations in effect at the time an application for approval of a preliminary plat... is submitted to the governing body.\u201d Section 76-3-501(2), MCA. Thus, retroactive application of the 1997 Development Code to Kiely\u2019s May, 1996 preliminary plat application was expressly precluded by the statute. Accordingly, we conclude the District Court did not err in excluding the 1997 Development Code as evidence of local zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Issue 7</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b6101 Did the District Court err by not modifying the damage award?</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b6102 The standard of review when reviewing an award of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>is whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Sletteland, v. Roberts, </em>2000 MT 382, \u00b6 36, 304 Mont. 21, \u00b6 36, 16 P.3d 1062, \u00b6 36 (citing <em>Edington v. Creek Oil Co. </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 112, 127, 690 P.2d 970, 978). In all cases, damages must be reasonable. Section 27-1-302, MCA. \u201c[A]n award must be reduced when it substantially exceeds that which the evidence can sustain.\u201d <em>Onstad v. Payless Shoesource, </em>2000 MT 230, \u00b6 50, 301 Mont. 259, \u00b6 50, 9 P.3d 38, \u00b6 50 (citing <em>Maurer v. Clausen Distributing Co. </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 229, 237, 912 P.2d 195, 199). \u201cOnly when the amount awarded is so grossly out of proportion to the injury as to shock the conscience will an appellate court intervene.\u201d <em>Onstad, </em>\u00b6 50 (citation omitted). <em>See also, Frisnegger v. Gibson </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 57, 67, 598 P.2d 574, 580 (amount of damages awarded sufficiently based on record, did not shock the conscience, and was in effect approved by the district court when it denied motions for remittitur and new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b6103 Red Lodge argues that the trial court\u2019s order directing it to approve the preliminary application subject to the eighteen conditions eliminates the basis for much of the damage award, since the damages included amounts for property devaluation, future losses, and for costs associated with the project. Kiely contends the damages are not duplicative nor should they be extinguished upon the conditional approval of its application, arguing that \u201cwhether or not the subdivision was approved, Kiely experienced a loss.\u201d On appeal, Kiely asks this Court to affirm both the jury\u2019s damage award and the conditioned approval granted by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b6104 During trial, Kiely presented evidence from a certified valuation analyst, who testified to several types of damages suffered by Kiely. He testified that due to the delay in Red Lodge\u2019s decision making, Kiely suffered damages in the form of lost investment value of funds between October 1996 (when County Planning Board first approved Kiely\u2019s application) and the trial. In addition, Kiely asserted that Red Lodge\u2019s delayed decision-making also resulted in devaluation of the property due to a decline in the real estate market between the years of 1996 and 1999. The valuation analyst testified that the lost investment value of funds and devaluation of property damages would have been suffered regardless of the ultimate denial of application. Kiely also presented several receipts for expenditures that included both start-up costs associated with the project and costs stemming from the continued application process with the city. While Kiely claimed $179,000 in such costs, the jury awarded only $15,000. Finally, Kiely also asserted that it suffered \u201cLost Future Investment Value,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>arguing that Red Lodge\u2019s delay in decision-making also caused an additional two-year increase in the development time due to issues with implementing the sewer system. While the valuation analyst agreed that the Lost Future Investment Value may be somewhat affected by what relief Kiely was granted (i.e., conditioned approval), he stated Kiely would still have a loss because the development could have been done earlier if it had been properly approved. Kiely asserted its Lost Future Investment Value to be $116,000; however, the jury awarded the sum of $97,170 for this element of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b6105 Although the District Court did not address the issue of damages modification, we conclude that the testimony and evidence presented at trial support the conclusion that the conditioned approval of Kiely\u2019s application should not eliminate or reduce the jury\u2019s award of damages to Kiely. Moreover, the District Court was fully aware of the potential dilemma presented by Kiely\u2019s request for the two remedies under \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA (money damages), and \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA (appeal of a denial or conditional approval of a plat application). During a pretrial conference, the court discussed the potential for inconsistent remedies with the parties, and ultimately designated the jury as an advisory jury on Kiely\u2019s appeal under \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, while concluding that the issue of damages under \u00a7 76-3-625(1), MCA, would be determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b6106  The District Court, having heard all the evidence and the jury\u2019s verdict on damages, was cognitive of the possible overlap between the remedies, and was therefore in the best position to determine if the damages were excessive or duplicative. <em>See Maddux v. Bunch </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 61, 65, 784 P.2d 936, 939 (citing <em>Tague v. John Caplice Co. </em>(1903), 28 Mont. 51, 72 P. 297) (district court in best position to determine requirements of proof of punitive damages since it heard all evidence and observed witnesses). Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to adjust the damages awarded upon its order that Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application be conditionally approved subject to the original eighteen conditions. Accordingly, the award of damages is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AHbp\">\u00b6107 We summarize our holdings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">(1) We dismiss Kiely\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims and accordingly, vacate its \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees award;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">(2) We affirm the District Court\u2019s instructions to the jury and the special verdict form;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">(3) We affirm the District Court\u2019s order which vacated Red Lodge\u2019s denial of Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application and directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the city to approve Kiely\u2019s preliminary plat application subject to the eighteen original conditions, with the three year approval period commencing as of the date of this Opinion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">(4) We affirm the District Court\u2019s partial summary judgment order dismissing the individual council members from this action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">(5) We affirm the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">(6) We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment that Red Lodge was not entitled to retroactively apply the 1997 Development Code; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">(7) We affirm the award of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Kiely now possesses preliminary plat approval, conditioned on the original eighteen provisions recommended by the County Planning Board, and may, if it chooses, proceed to apply for final plat approval according to \u00a7 76-3-611, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\u00b6108 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"> Although this case originated in the Thirteenth Judicial District, in early 2000, it was transferred to the newly created Twenty-Second Judicial District. <em>See </em>1999 Mont.

Hannifin </em>(9th Cir. 1980), 627 F.2d 177, for the proposition that a statute which prohibits the government from acting \u201cunreasonably\u201d does not establish a legitimate claim of entitlement necessary to support a \u00a7 1983 claim. However, in my view, <em>Jacobson </em>is not persuasive authority for the Court\u2019s holding herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">fill <em>Jacobson </em>involved the denial of a gaming license by the Nevada Gaming Commission. The Nevada statute governing the commission granted \u201cfull and absolute power and authority to deny any application for any cause deemed reasonable\u201d to the commission. Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 463.220(6). A broader grant of authority can hardly be imagined. Clearly, no protectable property interest, or \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement,\u201d was created by the Nevada statute. Such <em>carte blanche </em>was not provided by the statutes at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">\u00b6112 Although the Court describes \u00a7 76-3-608, MCA, as only requiring the governing body to not act \u201cunreasonably,\u201d a close review of that term within the full context of the statute provided in the Court\u2019s opinion reveals that the discretion granted thereunder is not unconstrained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-16\">[A] governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner\u2019s ability to develop land, but it is recognized that in some instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the unmitigated impacts of a proposed development may be unacceptable and will preclude approval of the plat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Section 76-3-608(5)(a), MCA. \u201cRestrict\u201d and \u201c preclude\u201d are not equivalent terms within this provision. The power to place reasonable restrictions on the development does not, in and of itself, include the authority to preclude the proposed development. As the provision indicates, the \u201csome instances\u201d in which a development may be precluded altogether are only those in which unmitigated impacts exist and are found to be unacceptable. Even in those instances, the governing body may mitigate the unacceptable impacts and thereby eliminate these obstacles to approval of the development. Section 76-3-608(4), MCA. These provisions demonstrate that the governing body\u2019s duty to the applicant exceeds the mere avoidance of unreasonableness and requires earnest consideration of the landowner\u2019s plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b6113 Nonetheless, I do find sufficient discretion within the statute to defeat a claim of entitlement for purposes of a \u00a7 1983 claim. Section 76-3-608(4), MCA, does not require that the governing body approve mitigation of adverse impacts, stating only that it \u201cmay\u201d do so. Without mitigation, a development\u2019s \u201cunmitigated impacts\u201d can preclude approval. The statute uses other qualifying language as well and cannot be read as mandating approval in the event a developer meets certain requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b6114 The court in <em>Wallace v. Robinson </em>(7th Cir. 1991), 940 F.2d 243, offered an explanation of the entitlement that is necessary to establish a protectable liberty or property interest, drawing on many other cases which have addressed the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">Does this [statutory] language create a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d? If not, there is no constitutional liberty or property. [Citations omitted.] A \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d means more than an abstract desire. It is instead an entitlement contingent on facts, something you hold unless prescribed conditions of its defeasance can be established. [Citations omitted.] Something \u201csecurely and durably yours ... as distinct from what you hold subject to so many conditions as to make your interest meager, transitory, or uncertain\u201d. [Citations omitted.] How securely? Your entitlement must be \u201clegally enforceable\u201d [citations omitted]. Or, in the formulation of <em>[Kentucky Department of Corrections v. Thompson </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 454, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506] there must be \u201c \u2018explicitly mandatory language,\u2019 in- connection with the establishment of \u2018specified substantive predicates\u2019 to limit discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Wallace, </em>940 F.2d at 246-47. Although somewhat unwieldy, <em>Wallace\u2019s </em>explanation is detailed and helpful. Under this analysis, the statutes at issue here clearly do not use mandatory language which assures an applicant of approval, and I know of no court decision which has found a claim of entitlement under statutory language which is even remotely similar to the statutes here. For these reasons, I concur with the Court\u2019s holding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">\u00b6115 On all other issues, I also concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b113-4\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"ATX\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b6116 I concur with the majority\u2019s resolution of issues numbered one through six. I dissent from the majority\u2019s resolution of issue seven. I would vacate the damage award and remand to the District Court for further determination of damages in light of the District Court\u2019s decision to order approval of the plaintiffs application pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b6117 While I agree with the discussion of the damage law set forth in the majority Opinion, I disagree that there was any rational basis on which the jury could determine reasonable damages in this case without knowing the ultimate outcome of the plaintiffs appeal from the City\u2019s denial of its preliminary plat application. In other words, whether the City\u2019s arbitrary and capricious denial was a final decision or was going to be vacated by the District Court would have a substantial impact on the actual damages sustained by the plaintiff. As the following instructions indicate, the jury was led to believe the denial was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b6118 In Instruction No. 12, the jury was instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">11. On April 15, 1999, the Council held a special meeting and denied the Application for Preliminary Plat Approval. The Council\u2019s denial of the Application for Preliminary Plat Approval constitutes a <em>final </em>action, decision or order. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 76-3-625. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b6119 In Instruction No. 13, the jury was again instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">You are instructed that the City of Red Lodge\u2019s September 10, 1997, conditioned approval, January 12, 1999 approval of the Subdivision Improvement Agreement and April 15, 1999 denial are <em>final </em>actions, decisions or orders. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\u00b6120 In Instruction No. 24, the jury was given the following advice regarding damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">If you find the City acted arbitrarily or capriciously, then you should award Kiely Construction such sum as you believe will reasonably and fairly compensate it for any damages it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>sustained, and is reasonably certain to sustain in the future, as a result of the September 10, 1997 conditional approval, the January 12, 1999 approval of the Subdivision Improvements Agreement and/or the April 15, 1999 denial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">The damages must be just and have a reasonable basis in the evidence. The damages need not be mathematically exact, but there must be enough evidence for you to make <em>a reasonable estimate of damages without speculation </em>or guesswork. Recovery cannot be denied for damages simply because they are difficult to determine. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b6121 The jury awarded the following damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">Nature of Damages Amount</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">Lost investment value $100,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">Property devaluation 80,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">Costs expended 15,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-10\">Lost future investment 97,170</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">TOTAL $292,170</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">\u00b6122 While there may have been an evidentiary basis for awarding some of these damages whether the effects of the City Council\u2019s decisions were permanent or only temporary, there is no way to know whether the jury\u2019s verdict was based on its assumption that the damages were temporary or permanent. Confusion about the meaning of the jury verdict is compounded by Instruction No. 36 in which the jury was instructed that if it found a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Kiely was entitled to damages for \u201c[t]he reasonable value of the investment income lost and which will be lost in the future, property devaluation and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d However, the jury was also instructed in No. 36 that \u201c[i]f you find for Kiely Construction on its 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim, but you find that Kiely Construction has failed to prove actual damages, you shall return an award of nominal damages not to exceed $1.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">\u00b6123 The jury did find for Kiely on its 1983 claim but apparently found that it had not proven actual damages for investment income lost, property devaluation and out-of-pocket expenses. Therefore, it returned a verdict for violation of Kiely\u2019s civil rights in the amount of one dollar. The jury\u2019s failure to find damages for violation of Kiely\u2019s civil rights is totally inconsistent with its earlier determination that he had sustained specific losses for those elements of damage due to the City\u2019s arbitrary and capricious denial of his preliminary plat application.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u00b6124 After considering all of the circumstances, I would conclude that the jury\u2019s damage verdict was uninformed and necessarily speculative because of the posture of the case when the damage issue was submitted to the jury and the subsequent relief granted to Kiely which necessarily mitigated much of the damage on which the jury\u2019s verdict may have been based.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b6125 There is no way to know from the record whether the District Court took into account the extent to which Kiel/s actual damages were mitigated by its subsequent relief. Following the jury\u2019s award of damages, but prior to the District Court\u2019s judgment granting Kiely conditional approval, the City argued that any remedy granted by the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA, other than denial, should result in a reduction of the damage award. However, the District Court did not address or appear to consider this issue in its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b6126 For these reasons, I concur in part with the majority Opinion but dissent from that part of the Opinion which affirms both the jury\u2019s award of damages and the refusal of the District Court to reduce those damages in light of its affirmative relief granted to the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 76-3-625(2), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins in the foregoing concurrence/dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
