Hamilton, appealed to the District Court for the Sixteenth Judicial District in Treasure County where he received a nonjury trial <em>de novo. </em>Following that trial, he was again convicted of DUI. Hamilton appeals his conviction. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">\u00b62 Hamilton raises two issues on appeal. We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it admitted evidence of blood test results that were gathered approximately three horns after the alleged illegal act occurred?</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">\u00b64 2. Was the evidence before the District Court sufficient to support Hamilton\u2019s DUI conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AZu\">\u00b65 Hamilton was injured in a single car accident while traveling on Horse Creek Road in Treasure County, Montana, sometime before 12:50 a.m. on July 3, 2001. The road was wet and consisted of three compacted wheel tracks, separated by loose gravel, with barrow ditches on both sides. Hamilton attempted to navigate around a parked vehicle, which occupied part of the roadway, by switching from the right and center travel lane to the left and center travel lane. He lost control of his truck in the loose gravel and rolled his vehicle into the ditch on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>right-hand side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b66 Treasure County Sheriff, Steve Wilkins, was notified of the accident at approximately 12:50 a.m. and arrived at the scene at about 1:30 a.m. When he arrived at the scene, he found Hamilton in the overturned pickup truck, conscious and complaining of neck pain. Wilkins observed that Hamilton smelled of alcohol but found no alcoholic beverage containers in the truck. When asked by Wilkins, Hamilton admitted that he had been drinking at the Spring Creek Bar earlier that evening. An ambulance carrying two Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) arrived around 2:05 a.m. Both EMTs noted that Hamilton smelled of alcohol and testified to that effect at trial. Montana Highway Patrol Officer Jeff Sorenson arrived at the accident at 2:10 a.m. and began to conduct an accident scene investigation. Sorenson estimated that Hamilton was traveling approximately 40 miles per hour prior to the accident based on \u201cdrag marks\u201d and damage to the vehicle. He was of the opinion that Hamilton was driving too fast for the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b67 After being extracted from the vehicle by the \u201cJaws of Life,\u201d Hamilton was taken to the Hardin Hospital for treatment. The EMTs reported that Hamilton was conscious, disoriented as to time and place, and exhibited abnormal behavior en route to the hospital. Montana Highway Patrol Officer Steve Weisnewski greeted Hamilton at the hospital at around 3:10 a.m. and noted that Hamilton smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot and glossy eyes. Hamilton gave a blood sample at 3:54 a.m., which was sent to the Montana Crime Lab for analysis. Over three hours had passed since the Wilkins initially responded to the accident. The Lab determined that Hamilton had a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of 0.26 at the time the blood was drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b68 Following Hamilton\u2019s conviction in Justice Court and appeal to the District Court, a non-jury trial was held on April 25, 2001. The State offered testimony from seven witnesses during its case. Sheriff Wilkins, the two EMTs, and Officer Weisnewski testified that Hamilton smelled strongly of alcohol on the evening in question. Lynn Kurtz, an expert from the Montana Crime Lab, testified that while he could not be certain what Hamilton\u2019s BAC was when he was driving before the accident, Hamilton had to have consumed a large quantity of alcohol before the accident in order to have a BAC of 0.26 three hours later.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b69 On November 29, 2001, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, and found Hamilton guilty of driving while under influence of alcohol pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Hamilton was sentenced to six months in jail, with all but one day suspended, ordered to pay a $500 fine, and ordered to complete an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>alcohol treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b610  This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Enright, </em>2000 MT 372, \u00b6 21, 303 Mont. 457, \u00b6 21, 16 P.3d 366, \u00b6 21. A district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and absent an abuse of discretion, this Court will not overturn that court\u2019s ruling. <em>Enright, </em>\u00b6 21. We review the sufficiency of evidence to support a guilty verdict in a criminal case to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 289, \u00b6 41, 291 Mont. 501, \u00b6 41, 969 P.2d 925, \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err when it admitted evidence of blood test results that were gathered approximately three hours after the alleged illegal act occurred?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u00b612 Hamilton contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it admitted results of the blood test taken at the Hardin Hospital at 3:54 a.m. as evidence. He maintains that the three hours that elapsed between the time he was in physical control of his truck and the time the blood was drawn violated the requirement that a blood sample be taken \u201cwithin a reasonable time of the alleged act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u00b613 In Montana, it is unlawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle on public roadways while under the influence of alcohol. Section 61-8-401(1), MCA. The results of a blood test that is taken within a reasonable time of the alleged act give rise to an inference of intoxication at the time of the act. Section 61-8-401(4), MCA. This Court has not had the opportunity to consider what constitutes a \u201creasonable time\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\u00b614 When interpreting statutes, this Court\u2019s only function is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, \u00b6 19, 310 Mont. 396, \u00b6 19, 50 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 19 (citations omitted). While legislative intent must first be determined from the plain meaning of the words in the statute, when the plain meaning of a statute is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, we will examine the legislative history to aid our interpretation. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 19 (citations omitted). Moreover, in determining legislative intent, this Court will construe criminal statutes \u201cwith a view to effect their object and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>promote justice.\u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. Goeble, </em>2001 MT 73, \u00b6 17, 305 Mont. 53, \u00b6 17, 31 P.3d 335, \u00b6 17) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b615 In 1997, Montana\u2019s DUI statutes were amended in response to disparate district court interpretations of when blood tests were admissible as evidence that a person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Section 61-8-401(4), MCA (1995), prior to its amendment provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">(4) Upon trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person at the time alleged, as shown by analysis of the person\u2019s blood, urine, or breath, shall give rise to the following inferences ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Literal interpretation of the statute by some district courts created an impossible obligation for the arresting officer. While delay between the time a person was in control of his or her vehicle and the time a blood test was administered was inevitable, strict interpretation of the pre-1997 language could preclude a blood test taken 30 minutes after a person was stopped because the test would not literally establish what a person\u2019s BAC was at \u201cthe time alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b616 The Legislature amended the problematic language in 1997 to provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">(4) Upon trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person at the time of a test, as shown by analysis of a sample of the person\u2019s blood or breath drawn or taken within a reasonable time after the alleged act, gives rise to the following inferences:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">(c) If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, it may be inferred that the person was under the influence of alcohol. The inference is rebuttable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Section 61-8-401(4), MCA (amending \u00a7 61-8-401(4), MCA (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">\u00b617 The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s notes express that the language was intended to prevent the exclusion of blood test results simply because time had elapsed between the alleged act and the test. Specifically, the notes refer to adverse court rulings which suppressed blood tests that were taken more than two hours after arrest for the alleged act. The plain language and Senate Judiciaiy Committee\u2019s notes indicate that the Legislature intended to create a broad and flexible statute, and left determination of what constitutes \u201cwithin a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>time after the alleged act\u201d to the discretion of the courts. Furthermore, defining \u201creasonable time\u201d broadly effectuates the statute\u2019s object of keeping drunk drivers off Montana\u2019s roads and promotes justice. Therefore, we hold that the statute requires a court to look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a blood test was taken within a reasonable time of the alleged act. Those circumstances must necessarily include the foundation laid to establish the probative value of the test results and the purpose for which the results are admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b618 In this case, Hamilton was involved in a single-car accident on a rural road and treatment of his injuries took priority over establishing the level of his intoxication. The \u201cJaws of Life\u201d were required to extricate Hamilton from his vehicle. Once removed, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of his broken neck. When Hamilton arrived at the hospital, two hours had passed since Wilkins responded to the accident, and one and one half hours had passed since he first arrived on the scene. The blood test was taken forty minutes after Hamilton arrived at the hospital, as soon as it was practicable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b619 During cross examination, Kurtz admitted that various factors such as fatty foods in the stomach, the amount of alcohol consumed, when alcohol was consumed, and a person\u2019s drinking history can effect the absorption rate of alcohol. He opined that these factors make determination of Hamilton\u2019s exact BAC at the time he went off the road impossible to calculate. Hamilton suggests these factors, in combination with the three hour time lapse, make the blood test unreliable. However, it is important to keep in mind the purpose for which the test results were admitted by the District Court. The District Court made the following finding number 11 based on Kurtz\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Lynn Kurz, a forensic scientist with the Montana Crime Lab, testified to the test and indicated that although, because of many unknown variables, one cannot extrapolate backwards to determine a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of the accident, since Mr. Hamilton was incapacitated from approximately 1 a.m. to the time of the test at 3:54 a.m., he would have had to have consumed a large amount of alcoholic beverages prior to 1 a.m. in order to be at .26 at 3:54 a.m. Mr. Kurz also testified that an individual\u2019s blood alcohol usually peaks within a half hour to an hour and a half following consumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Based on that finding, the District Court concluded that the evidence was admissible for the following purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">16. The results of the test are relevant under Rule 402, M.R.Evid., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>because the test results, in conjunction with the other evidence, shows that Mr. Hamilton had had a great deal to drink prior to his accident, and this makes it more likely that his ability to drive was impaired as a result of such drinking which is an issue in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">17. While the State has not been able to show that Mr. Hamilton had any particular blood alcohol level at the time of the accident or when driving immediately preceding the accident, the State has shown that Mr. Hamilton had a good deal to drink prior to the accident....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b620 Rule 401, M.R.Evid., provides: \u201cRelevant evidence means any evidence having any tendency that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evidence is relevant if it will have any value, as determined by logic and experience, in proving the proposition for which it is offered. <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 43, 300 Mont. 381, \u00b6 43, 6 P.3d 453, \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b621  Because the test was not unreasonably delayed by the investigating officers, under the circumstances in this case, and because the test results were not used to draw any inference regarding Hamilton\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of his accident, but instead were considered by the District Court for the limited purpose set forth in Finding No. 11, which purpose was fully supported by the foundational testimony, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting and considering that evidence even though gathered approximately three hours after the act complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"AB-\">\u00b622  Furthermore, the results of the blood test, which indicated that Hamilton\u2019s BAC was at 0.26, when considered in combination with Kurtz\u2019s foundational testimony, tended to make it more probable that Hamilton was under the influence of alcohol when operating his vehicle and was relevant despite the fact the test was taken three hours after the accident. We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded the blood test was relevant and admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b623 Was the evidence before the District Court sufficient to support Hamilton\u2019s DUI conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\u00b624 Hamilton maintains that the District Court abused its discretion when it based his conviction on the evidence of the blood test alone. He brings to our attention multiple inconsistencies between Officer Sorenson\u2019s and Officer Weisnewski\u2019s testimony and inconsistencies between the District Court\u2019s findings and the record. However, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>conclude, based on the scope of our review, that the cited inconsistencies are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b625  The court heard four witnesses testify that Hamilton smelled strongly of alcohol; Sheriff Wilkins testified that Hamilton admitted he had been drinking prior to the accident; Officer Sorenson testified that Hamilton appeared to be intoxicated at the hospital; Hamilton demonstrated unusual behavior in the ambulance; Kurtz testified that Hamilton would have had to consume a large amount of alcohol prior to the accident to have a BAC of 0.26 at 3:54 a.m.; and Hamilton was unable to negotiate a parked car on the side of the road. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence before the District Court to support Hamilton\u2019s conviction for driving while under influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b626 Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
