Grossett alleges he has complied with all requirements of the said insurance policy and that the third-party defendant refuses to defend and to assume liability, if found.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Because the trial justice who sustained the demurrer was not available, pursuant to Rule 30A of the District Court Rules, Justice Tiffany was appointed to settle the Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">In its brief and particularly in argument, the third-party defendant concedes the only ground upon which the demurrer was sustained or could be sustained is that because the third-party defendant in its answer denied the existence of a valid contract, Grossett has failed to append a valid contract, or proof thereof, to his third-party declaration, as required by G.L. c. 231 \u00a7 7, clause 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">There was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Grossett well pleaded in his third-party declaration a valid contract of insurance and incorporated it in and attached it to his declaration. A demurrer admits all allegations well pleaded in a declaration and exhibits incorporated in and attached thereto. <em>Kapinos </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>334 Mass. 196, 197 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The demurrer is overruled and the action returned to the trial list of the Municipal Court of Dorchester.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
