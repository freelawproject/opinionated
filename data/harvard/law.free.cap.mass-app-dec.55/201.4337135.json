Both vehicles were non commercial vehicles, privately owned and lawfully registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Following-entry of the writ, the defendant filed a plea of abatement, setting forth that such suits for recovery were barred by the provisions of G.L. c. 90, \u00a7 34-0, the so called \u201cNo Fault Property Insurance Coverage Law.\u201d The defendant\u2019s plea and abatement was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The appellant\u2019s brief is extensive and cited a great number of cases. The basis of the appellant\u2019s argument is the validity of the police powers of both the Commonwealth and the Federal Government to foreclose the right of a person to bring suit to recover for tortious damage, and the right of the Legislature to formulate a plan allowing an injured party to obtain coverage for such damage without regard to his right to seek recovery against the party responsible for causing said damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">A close reading of the Property Insurance Statute, \u00a7 34-0 indicates that it is available without restriction or deterrent or qualification to all operators of motor vehicles within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The statute appears to be equitably and universally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>designed for equal protection, and no abuse of any rights of individuals appear to have been violated by the enactment of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">While the appellant\u2019s brief has been fully indexed and digested, and does raise many interesting issues of consideration, we fail to see that the principles involved in the property insurance No-Fault protection plan, differs from the theories expressed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in ruling valid the personal injury protection part, \u00a734-M of the No Fault Law in the case of <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>1971 Adv. Sheets 1129, 271 N.E. 2nd, 592, and on this basis, and for these considerations the decision of the justice of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
