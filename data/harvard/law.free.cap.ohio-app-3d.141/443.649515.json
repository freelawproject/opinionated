However, the University Heights judge recused and asked the common pleas court\u2019s administrative judge to assign the case to a different municipality. The administrative judge, upon the voluntary disqualification by the University Heights judge, transferred the case to the Lyndhurst Municipal Court. The Lyndhurst trial judge dismissed appellant Edmund Rothschild\u2019s traffic violation charge and assessed the costs to him. He appeals the costs assessment. However, our first concern is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Historically, this court has held that an administrative judge of the common pleas court on a trial judge\u2019s voluntary disqualification application is without authority to transfer or reassign a case unless specifically authorized by statute. See <em>Bedford v. Lacey </em>(1985), 30 Ohio App.3d 1, 30 OBR 38, 506 N.E.2d 224. We recently followed <em>Bedford v. Lacey </em>in <em>Rocky River v. Hughes </em>(Nov. 22, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76771, unreported, 2000 WL 1739220. There, we held that only the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio may reassign a case on a judge\u2019s voluntary disqualification from a case. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we vacate the Lyndhurst Municipal Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">\n<em>Judgment vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-13\">Karpinski, A.J., and Kilbane, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
