Hook\u2019s estate, appeals from a judgment of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas that dismissed Hook\u2019s appeal from a decision of the Industrial Commission of Ohio (\u201cIndustrial Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-17\">Hook was employed by the city of Springfield as a firefighter. In the course of his employment, he was involved with an industrial fire on August 27, 1984. In August 1997, Hook filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, alleging that he had been exposed to \u201casbestos and PCB\u201d while at the industrial fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">On October 20, 1997, the Administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) allowed Hook\u2019s claim for the condition of lymphoma-right axilla. Springfield appealed the Administrator\u2019s decision. On February 27, 1998, a District Hearing Officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) of the Industrial Commission denied Spring<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>field\u2019s appeal and allowed Hook\u2019s claim for the occupational diseases of lymphoma-right axilla, restrictive ventilatory impairment with dyspnea, sleep apnea, and endocrine abnormalities. Springfield appealed the DHO\u2019s decision and on March 27, 1998, a Staff Hearing Officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) of the Industrial Commission issued an order affirming an allowance for Hook\u2019s claim for all of the conditions allowed by the DHO except sleep apnea.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Both Hook and Springfield appealed the SHO\u2019s decision. The Industrial Commission heard the case and on June 15, 1998, issued an order disallowing Hook\u2019s claim. Hook appealed the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">While Hook\u2019s case was pending in the trial court, he died. On May 11, 2000, Gentis filed a motion, as the executor of Hook\u2019s estate, to substitute herself as the plaintiff-appellant in the trial court. Springfield and the BWC each filed motions to dismiss Hook\u2019s appeal, arguing that his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits had been extinguished by his death. On August 18, 2000, the trial court overruled Gentis\u2019s motion for substitution and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Gentis now appeals the trial court\u2019s decision and raises two assignments of error. We note that Springfield and the BWC filed separate appellee briefs in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u201cI. A worker\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits is not extinguished by his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Gentis raises three arguments in support of this assignment. First, she argues that this case should be governed by <em>State ex rel. Nossal v. Terex Div. of I.B.H. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 175, 712 N.E.2d 747. Second, she asserts that under Civ.R. 25(A)(1), an estate can be substituted for a deceased person. 'Third, she claims that pursuant to R.C. 2311.21 and 2305.21, a workers\u2019 compensation claim is not extinguished by an employee-claimant\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Gentis first argues that this case should be controlled by <em>Nossal. </em>Springfield and the BWC each argue that <em>Nossal </em>involves distinguishable facts from this case and that this case should be controlled by <em>State ex rel. Hamlin v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 21, 623 N.E.2d 35, and <em>Ratliff v. Flowers </em>(1970), 25 Ohio App.2d 113, 54 O.O.2d 213, 266 N.E.2d 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\"><em>Nossal </em>involved the award of death benefits to the surviving spouse of an employee who had died from an occupational disease. <em>Nossal, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 175, 712 N.E.2d at 747-748. While the employer was appealing a DHO\u2019s award of death benefits to the spouse, the spouse died. <em>Id. </em>at 175, 712 N.E.2d at 748. After the trial court dismissed the spouse\u2019s case due to her death, the administrator of the spouse\u2019s estate filed a new cause of action asking the Industrial Commission to pay the spouse\u2019s estate the amount of the accumulated death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>benefits from the date of the employee\u2019s death to the date of the spouse\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>When the Industrial Commission denied the administrator\u2019s request, the administrator filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. <em>Id. </em>at 175-176, 712 N.E.2d at 748. Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the [Industrial Commission] awards death benefits to the surviving spouse of a deceased employee, but the spouse dies before the funds are disbursed, accrued benefits for the period between the deceased employee\u2019s death and the spouse\u2019s death shall be paid to the spouse\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 712 N.E.2d at 749. The court, accepting reasoning from a dissent in a prior case, agreed that it would be illogical and unfair to deny benefits simply because a claimant had failed to live long enough to survive delays in the administrative process. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 712 N.E.2d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Gentis argues that <em>Nossal </em>\u201cdemonstrates that a worker\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits does not abate with his death.\u201d She claims that if the estate of a spouse can receive the spouse\u2019s death benefits, then the estate of an employee should be able to receive the employee\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">A close examination of the facts in <em>Nossal </em>reveals that they are distinguishable from the facts in the case before us. <em>Nossal </em>involved a claim for <em>death benefits </em>made by an employee\u2019s surviving spouse. The case before us involved a claim for <em>living benefits </em>made by the employee. As we state, <em>infra, </em>living benefits and death benefits are distinct and separate. Further, at the time the surviving spouse in <em>Nossal </em>died, her claim had been <em>granted </em>and the <em>employer </em>was appealing. At the time the employee in this case died, his claim had been <em>denied </em>and he, the <em>employee, </em>was appealing. Thus, our case should be distinguished from <em>Nossal. </em>See <em>Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Mayfield </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 70, 11 OBR 315, 464 N.E.2d 133 (noting distinction between an employer\u2019s right to appeal, after the employee\u2019s death, a grant of benefits to an employee and a deceased employee\u2019s estate\u2019s right to appeal, after the employee\u2019s death, a denial of benefits to the employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In <em>Ratliff, </em>an injured employee\u2019s second claim for living benefits was denied. <em>Ratliff, </em>25 Ohio App.2d at 113, 54 O.O.2d at 213, 266 N.E.2d at 849. While he was appealing the denial to the trial court, he died. <em>Id. </em>The trial court dismissed the action after the employee\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 54 O.O.2d at 213-214, 266 N.E.2d at 849. The appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201cIn the constitutional and statutory scheme of [workers\u2019] compensation in Ohio, benefits are payable to two separate and [distinct] classes[:] (1) To living employees and (2) to his dependents after his death. The right of an injured employee to recover exists separate and apart from that of dependents. The first arises at the time of injury and the second at the time of death. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>consequence, <em>if a claimant dies prior to an award, his estate can recover nothing from the fund.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted and emphasis added in part.) <em>Id. </em>at 114, 54 O.O.2d at 213-214, 266 N.E.2d at 849.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Concluding that the employee\u2019s widow had no rights against the workers\u2019 compensation fund in her capacities as the administrator of his estate or \u201cinsofar as this action is concerned\u201d as his dependent, the court held \u201cthat where there is a <em>denial </em>of benefits to an employee and upon appeal to the [trial court] he dies before disposition of the action, the action abates by force of the [workers\u2019 compensation] statutes[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 114, 116, 54 O.O.2d at 214, 215, 266 N.E.2d at 849, 850. The court concluded that the widow must initiate a proceeding at the administrative level on her separate claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In <em>Hamlin, </em>an employee\u2019s claim was denied and she died while her appeal of that denial was pending. <em>Hamlin, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 21-22, 623 N.E.2d at 35-36. Following the reasoning in <em>Ratliff, </em>the Supreme Court held that the employee\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund had been abated by her death. <em>Id. </em>at 22, 623 N.E.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">W\u00e9 find <em>Ratliff </em>and <em>Hamlin </em>to be controlling in the case before us. In each of those cases, as in the case before us, the employee\u2019s claim for living benefits had been denied and the employee was appealing at the time of the employee\u2019s death, whereas in <em>Nossal, </em>the widow\u2019s claim for death benefits had been granted and the employer was appealing at the time of the widow\u2019s death. Following the reasoning in <em>Ratliff </em>and <em>Hamlin, </em>we must conclude that the trial court correctly dismissed the case because Hook\u2019s claim for benefits abated at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In coming to this conclusion, we also reject Gentis\u2019s argument that <em>Ratliff </em>has \u201cno validity\u201d following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nossal. </em>In <em>Nossal, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly overruled <em>Breidenbach v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 138, 524 N.E.2d 502. <em>Nossal, </em>at syllabus. We believe that the Supreme Court would have explicitly stated that it was overruling <em>Ratliff </em>and <em>Hamlin </em>in its <em>Nossal </em>decision had it intended to do so. Because the court did not make such a statement, we will not conclude that <em>Nossal </em>overruled <em>Ratliff </em>and <em>Hamlin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Gentis next argues that under Civ.R. 25(A)(1), an estate can be substituted for a deceased person.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Civ.R. 25(A)(1) states, in part, that \u201c[i]f a party dies <em>and the claim is not thereby extinguished, </em>the court shall, upon motion, order substitution of the proper parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Staff Note to Civ.R. 25(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">\u201cAs far as the death of a party is concerned, Rule 25(A) neither affects, nor is affected by, the issue of whether the action \u2018survives\u2019 the death of a party during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the pendency of the action. Rule 25(A) operates only where \u2018survival\u2019 occurs, i.e., where the claim is not extinguished by death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As we concluded, <em>supra, </em>Hook\u2019s claim abated at the time of his death. Because such claim was extinguished, Civ.R. 25(A)(1) does not apply to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Gentis also argues that pursuant to R.C. 2311.21 and 2305.21, a workers\u2019 compensation claim is not extinguished by an employee-claimant\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">R.C. 2311.21 states generally that no pending action shall be abated by the death of one of the parties. In <em>Ratliff, </em>the court explicitly stated that R.C. 2311.21 was inapplicable to its holding that the claim had abated at the time of the employee\u2019s death by force of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. <em>Ratliff, 25 </em>Ohio App.2d at 116, 54 O.O.2d at 214-215, 266 N.E.2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">R.C. 2305.21 generally lists causes of action that survive the death of the person entitled to bring the cause of action or the person liable for such cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\u201c \u2018[T]he rights of injured employees and the dependents of killed employees to recover from or participate in the [workers\u2019 compensation] fund are neither constitutional rights, inherent rights, nor common-law rights, but are wholly statutory[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115, 54 O.O.2d at 214, 266 N.E.2d at 850. Further, if the right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund is not found in the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, the right does not exist. <em>Id. </em>Because the <em>Ratliff </em>and <em>Hamlin </em>courts concluded that an employee\u2019s claim abates at the time of the employee\u2019s death by force of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes, and because such statutes are completely controlling as to the right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund, we do not believe 'that R.C. 2305.21, a general statute, would cause an employee\u2019s claim to survive his death. Thus, Gentis\u2019s argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">\u201cII. Refusing to permit an injured worker\u2019s estate to continue a workers\u2019 compensation case violates both OH. Const. Art. II, Sec. 35 and Equal Protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Gentis raises two arguments under this assignment. First, she asserts that Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution would be violated if the estate would not be permitted to seek compensation for Hook\u2019s benefits after his death. Second, she argues that because employers are permitted to appeal an allowance of benefits to an employee-claimant after such employee has died, equal protection would be violated if the estate would not be permitted to appeal the disallowance of benefits to Hook after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution establishes the workers\u2019 compensation system in Ohio, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">\u201cFor the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment, <em>laws may be passed </em>establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contribution thereto by employers, and administered by the state, determining the terms and conditions upon which payment shall be made therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Gentis argues that Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution would be violated if the estate would not be permitted to seek compensation for Hook\u2019s benefits after his death. That provision of the Ohio Constitution does not establish an individual\u2019s right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund, but instead merely establishes the system itself in Ohio. Further, it specifically provides for laws to be passed to determine an employee\u2019s right to participate in the fund. Thus, Gentis\u2019s argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Gentis also argues that because an employer is permitted to appeal an allowance of benefits to an employee-claimant after the employee has died, equal protection would be violated if Hook\u2019s estate would not be permitted to appeal the denial of Hook\u2019s claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The Supreme Court has held that although an employee\u2019s death abates his cause of action for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under <em>Ratliff, </em>\u201can employer\u2019s appeal * * * from an adverse ruling by the Industrial Commission is not subject to dismissal due to the death of the employee during the pendency of the appeal.\u201d <em>Youghiogheny, </em>11 Ohio St.3d at 72, 11 OBR at 317, 464 N.E.2d at 135. The <em>Youghiogheny </em>court concluded that when an employee-claimant dies, the case should continue with the state proceeding in the employee-claimant\u2019s place because by allowing the case to continue, the employer can pursue its statutory right to appeal the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision and the state can attempt to protect the Surplus Fund from which improperly disbursed benefits are recovered (rather than from the deceased employee\u2019s estate) when an award of compensation is determined to be improper upon appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 11 OBR at 316-317, 464 N.E.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Legislative enactments are presumed to be constitutional. <em>State ex rel. Patterson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 201, 204, 672 N.E.2d 1008, 1010. \u201c \u2018[Discrimination against individuals or groups is sometimes an inevitable result of the operation of a statute. The mere fact that a statute discriminates does not mean that the statute must be unconstitutional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Roseman v. Firemen &amp; Policemen\u2019s Death Benefit Fund </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 443, 446-447, 613 N.E.2d 574, 577. The Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Ohio Constitutions apply, however, to all laws, including those enacted under Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; * * * nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201cAll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit, and they have the right to alter, reform, or abolish the same, whenever they may deem it necessary; and no special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted, that may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the general assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Equal protection does not require that laws apply universally to all individuals because \u201cthe legislature * * * must, if it is to act at all, impose special burdens upon or grant special benefits to special groups or classes of individuals.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Doersam v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 115, 119, 543 N.E.2d 1169, 1173. Instead, equal protection requires that similarly situated individuals be treated in a similar manner and that laws operate equally upon individuals identified in the same class. <em>State ex rel. Patterson, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 204, 672 N.E.2d at 1011, citing <em>Doersam, </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 119, 543 N.E.2d at 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Gentis argues that equal protection is violated because an employer is permitted to continue his appeal following an employee\u2019s death whereas an employee\u2019s estate is not permitted to continue the employee\u2019s appeal after his death. To violate the guarantees of equal protection, employers and employees would have to be similarly situated individuals within the same classification of persons. We do not believe that employers and employees are similarly situated, however, because they possess distinct, often competing, interests in the workers\u2019 compensation system. Employers are required to fund the system while employees and their dependents receive money from the system if they qualify to participate in it. Perhaps there would be a violation of equal protection if the estates of some employees were permitted to continue an appeal after the employees\u2019 deaths while the estates of other employees were not permitted to continue similar appeals after their employees\u2019 deaths. Gentis does not, however, make that argument. Because we conclude that Hook and his estate are not similarly situated to his former employer, a genuine equal protection issue is not presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-7\">Grady and Kerns, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b307-8\">Joseph D.
