And the court below subsequently gave judgment for the plaintiff, with leave to have execution thereof of the partnership property, if any, of the defendants, but not of the separate property of the defendant Hall, till the accounts should be taken, and the equities settled between the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-13\"><em>A. M. Watson, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARS\">cited and relied upon the case of McFadden <em>v. </em>Hunt, 5 W. <em>&amp; S. </em>468.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-14\"><em>Brady Grill, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV39\">In McFadden <em>v. </em>Hunt, the firm was indebted to McFadden, <em>as a partner. </em>Here, the indebtedness to Logan was not as a partner, but as an individual, for money loaned to the firm ; which distinguishes this case from the one cited. The Act of 14th April 1838 authorizes this suit.-</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b331-16\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b331-17\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">In this case, the legal plaintiff was also one of the defendants. At common law, such a suit could not be sustained. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>No one can, in the same action, be both plaintiff and defendant: 2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. 120; </em>2 <em>Marsh. </em>319; 6 <em>Taunt. </em>597 ; s. c. 1 <em>Mast </em>27; 1 <em>Roll. </em>176.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In McFadden <em>v. </em>Hunt, 5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>472, it was decided, that such an action derives no aid from the 1st section of the Act of 1838. That act provides for suits by one firm against another, where some of the partners are members of both firms. This was decided in Miller <em>v. </em>Knauff, in the District Court of Philadelphia, about the same time: 3 <em>Penn. L. J. </em>225. We are not disposed to change the construction given to the act, and do not think the special entry of the judgment in the case, takes it. out of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
