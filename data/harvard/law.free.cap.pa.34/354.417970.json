Grow, as auditor, who reported a re-statement of said account showing a balance for distribution in hands of said Marcus Black of $71,201.67, which report on the 24th Eebruary 1851, was confirmed by the court; that afterwards, on the 17th February 1857, the said court appointed Joseph Henderson and William Linn, auditors, to report a scale of distribution; who, on the 8th April 1857, did by their report to said court, make distribution of said balance to and among the legatees and distributees entitled thereto; and, <em>inter alia, </em>distributed to Cyrus Black, executor of Wilson Black, the sum of $1500, with interest thereon from August 25th 1846, and the sum of $6565.46, with interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>thereon from February 24th 1851; that afterwards, on May 21st 1857, by judgment and decree of said court, the said report was confirmed; and that said decree still remained in full force and effect, not vacated or satisfied, no payments having been made to the plaintiff on account thereof; and that thereby an action had accrued to plaintiff to demand and have of the defendant the said sums of $1500 and $6565.46, with the interest as aforesaid.

On the 17th February 1857, the account was referred to auditors, to report a scale of distribution. On the 8th\u201e April 1857, these auditors presented their report, making a distribution according to two schedules \u2014 1st. Of the specific legacies; and 2d, of the distributive shares of the residuary estate of Samuel Black \u2014 those in the 1st schedule to bear interest from August 25th 1846; and those in the 2d, from February 24th 1851; and those in each class, to be subject to any payments that might have been made on account thereof. Among those in the first schedule, was a specific legacy to Cyrus Black, executor of Wilson Black, of $1500; and in the same schedule, was a distributive share of $6565.46, to the same party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">The auditors reported that they had served personal notice on all the parties interested, residing in Washington county, and had made ne-wspaper publication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">It also appeared that, at the hearing, Joseph S.

It may be true, as a general rule, that want of jurisdiction may be taken advantage of at any time \u2014 but this does, not prove the propriety of ignoring such a plea in all cases, especially when the jurisdiction is <em>prim\u00e9 facie </em>general. Here, the plaintiff was nonsuited under an Act of Assembly by no means general, or applicable throughout the state. If there had been a verdict and judgment in the case, as there would have been, in a like case, in most of the districts in the state, on the pleas of \u201cpayment,\u201d and \u201c never indebted,\u201d and affirmed here, an awkward case would have followed an attempt to enforce payment of the matter sued for in another court. It is obvious, that the District Court had jurisdiction of the action of debt, but was ousted of it by the several statutes regulating the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court. There was no objection that this was not pleaded, and the question was discussed as if it had been \u2014 and hence there is no difficulty in this case, but a different practice would be advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The main and decisive question in the case is, as to the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Washington county. Had it exclusive power to enforce distribution, after settlement of the account of the executors of Marcus Black, deceased? Or, can an action at common law be maintained on the decree of distribution in the Orphans\u2019 Court, to recover the distributive share of a plaintiff, as attempted here ? These questions are <em>res adjudicaba, </em>and we will not discuss them. In Shollenberger\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>Harris </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>337, it was said, that the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, \u201c within its appointed orbit, is exclusive, and therefore necessarily as extensive as the demands of justice;\u201d and in Whiteside <em>v. </em>Whiteside, 8 <em>Harris </em>473, \u201cthat the Orphans\u2019 Court <em>alone </em>has authority to ascertain the amount of the decedent\u2019s property, and order its distribution among those entitled.\u201d The same, in substance, had been held in Kittera\u2019s Estate, 5 <em>Id. </em>422. So, in Ashford <em>v. </em>Ewing, 1 <em>Casey </em>213, it was also held', per Lewis, C. J., \u201c that an action at common law cannot be sustained, to recover a distributive share of an estate, against an administrator, although his account, exhibiting a specific balance against him, has been settled in, and confirmed by, the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d All the cases on the point are to be found referred to in the opinion of the learned judge in 'this last case, and the doctrine announced is clearly elucidated by them. The question must, therefore, be considered as settled, that the Orphans\u2019 Court had exclusive jurisdiction, and ample power, to enforce the payment of the distributive share sued for in this case ; and that the District Court were right in entering judgment of nonsuit against the plaintiff. No good reason can be given why the Orphans\u2019 Court should not be held to be a court of exclusive jurisdiction in such cases. It is possessed of chancery powers, and can proceed, according to chancery practice to make all such decrees, interlocutory and final, as may be necessary, in the administration of its appropriate duties, subject to review, on appeal to this court. It has power to enforce such decrees by attachment, sequestration, <em>fieri facias, testatum fieri facias, venditioni exponas, </em>and sale. On the score, therefore, of power and final process, there is no room for complaint. It has also the power to determine facts, as a court of equity, or to certify disputed issues of fact to the common law courts for trial. It seems to me, that it was eminently proper to determine, that within its \u201cappointed orbit\u201d it is a court of exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We do not think it necessary to discuss the question, whether there was, in substance, a final decree in this ease; if there was not, certain it is that this would have been a ground for nonsuit. Nor another position taken by the plaintiff in error, that the Act of Assembly authorizes a common law action for a legacy; this is not what was declared for here, and the question was not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The plaintiff in error can have all his rights, by simply proceeding in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Washington county. The delay occasioned by those in the District Court was neither the fault of the law, nor, perhaps, of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
