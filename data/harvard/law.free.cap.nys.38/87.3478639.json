Failing privity of contract or title in the plaintiffs to the demand in suit, the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Bliss, Code PI. \u00a7 234; Mosselman v. Caen, 1 Hun, 648; Davis v. Mayor, etc., 14 N. Y. 506; Weichsel v. Spear, 47 N. Y. Super. Ct. 223. And the argument that the objection should have been taken to the capacity to sue is unfounded. As natural persons, the plaintiffs of course had capacity to sue, in the absence of affirmative allegations to the contrary; and, if the demurrer had been placed upon the ground noted, it would have, of necessity, been overruled. Bank v. Donnell, 40 N. Y. 412; Insurance Co. v. Baldwin, 37 N. Y. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The allegation of trusteeship was merely a conclusion of law, and not alone thus objectionable; moreover, an erroneous conclusion, from the attendant averment upon which it appears to have been based. The fact that a person is constituted a collection agent does not authorize him, as trustee of an express trust, to bring an action upon the claim to be collected, in his own name. Pom. Bern. &amp; Bern. Bights, \u00a7 174, and cases cited. The plaintiffs were obviously not parties with whom the contracts in suit were made for the benefit of others, nor were they persons having title to the demand as the real parties in interest. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The judgments of the court below must be reversed, and the demurrer sustained, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
