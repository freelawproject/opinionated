The action is brought to recover the sum of $550, paid by the plaintiff to defendant for the good will, stock in trade, and lease of a saloon, upon the ground that the defendant falsely represented that the property in question was wholly free from incumbrances or debt of any nature or character, excepting a certain chattel mortgage for $950, and that that sum was all that was due upon the mortgage; that it was a lien on the saloon and fixtures only; that the receipts averaged over $25 daily; and that, by accepting certain assignments of a bill of sale and lease, plaintiff would be fully entitled to conduct, maintain, and carry on said saloon, subject only to said debt of $950 upon the saloon and fix<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>tures. Thereafter the plaintiff learned that the mortgage covered, and was also a lien upon, the lease and license, and that the sum of $1,440.10 was due, and a valid lien at the time of the sale, under the mortgage, and he was compelled to surrender the saloon to the mortgagee. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on the trial, the court, upon the motion of counsel for the defendant, granted a nonsuit, to which the counsel for the plaintiff excepted. The motion for a nonsuit was granted and made on the following ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201cThat plaintiff has not proved a cause of action, as he has not proved any false representations, or any known to be false, and made with the intent to deceive; and that he has not proved any damages, or that the representations were false in fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In reviewing a judgment upon a nonsuit, the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of every fact that the jury could have found from the evidence given, and to every legitimate inference that is warranted by the proofs. This disposition of a cause by a trial court is never warranted, unless it appears that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover after giving him the benefit of the most favorable view that a jury would be warranted in taking of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s theory with respect to the facts, so far as they were supported by the evidence, must be deemed to be established; and, where inferences are to be drawn from facts and circumstances not in themselves certain or incontrovertible, it is generally for the jury, and not for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">It appears, from the evidence, that one Connell stated to the plaintiff, in the jiresence of the defendant: \u201cHere is Mr. Peetsch [defendant]. I am only his agent. He is my boss.\u201d And also stated: \u201cThe earnings were $25 per day, the rent about $40, and the mortgage $950.\u201d That Mr. Sloan, a real-estate agent, who had the place from defendant for sale, introduced the plaintiff, and brought him to defendant\u2019s place, and he (Sloan), in defendant\u2019s presence, told plaintiff, when he suggested the necessity of having a lawyer examine the matter: \u201cIt is not necessary. The statement he [defendant] makes he is bound by it.\u201d And, when plaintiff asked as to the defendant\u2019s responsibility, Sloan said: \u201cMr. Gage, Mr. Peetsch is engaged in business, in a legitimate business, and he cannot afford to do anything that way.\u201d Whereupon plaintiff said: <em>\u201cI </em>understand, Mr. Peetsch, when I pay you $550, that I have invested in this place, subject to a mortgage of $950.\u201d And the defendant answered: \u201cThat is all.\u201d And plaintiff repeated: \u201cSubject to a mortgage of $950. Is that all against it?\u201d And defendant again replied: \u201cThat was all.\u201d Plaintiff thereupon paid the defendant the sum of $550, and received a receipt for the same, together with assignments of the bill of sale and lease, heretofore referred to. It was subsequently learned that the mortgage was not only for $950, but for all sums due at any time for goods.sold and advances made, and that, at this time, there was a due and valid lien against the place, including, the mortgage, of $1,440.10, for which sum and lien the plaintiff was obliged to surrender the saloon under the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The evidence clearly shows that the defendant took plaintiff\u2019s money, leading him to believe, and to rely upon the representations, that but $950 was due, when he knew the amount was much more-The defendant knew the mortgage was a valid lien, and an incumbrance against the saloon, for goods sold, in addition to the $950, and his omission to disclose that fact when asked by plaintiff was wrong, and he should not be allowed to retain the benefit so wrongfully procured. It is not only consonant with reason and justice, but clearly settled in this state, that a vendor possessed of knowledge of latent defects in his property, proposed to be sold, \u2022cannot honestly represent to an intending purchaser that it is free from such defects. Defendant\u2019s answer to plaintiff\u2019s inquiry was a false representation. It was not necessary for plaintiff to employ a lawyer and examine the mortgage on file. He had a right to rely upon defendant\u2019s statements and accept them as true. The essential elements of the action\u2014representations, .falsity, scienter, deception, and injury\u2014were proven, and it was error to nonsuit the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
