The indictment averred that the article and substance in question was made and produced in the state of Kansas. The defendant demurred to the indictment on the grounds (1) that the grand jury by which said indictment was found had no legal authority to inquire into the crime charged, by reason of its not being within the local jurisdiction of the county of New York; (2) that the facts stated in said indictment do not constitute a <em>crime; </em>(3) that said indictment states that the article or substance referred to therein had been made and produced elsewhere than in the state of New York, to wit, in the state of Kansas, which matter, if true, constitutes a legal justification and excuse for the acts charged in said indictment, and a legal bar to the prosecution. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant thereupon pleaded not guilty to the indictment. He was convicted upon the trial, and sentenced to pay a fine of 850.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-11\">Appeal from court of general sessions, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-12\">William D.

The section, in substance, provides that no restaurant keeper shall serve as food for his customers, or use for cooking purposes, any article or. substance made \u201cin violation of the provisions, of this article,\u201d namely, article second, relating to dairy products. The appellant insists that the words in question are limited to a legally punishable violation. The respondents contend that they embrace any article made contrary to the provisions of the act. We agree with the latter construction. The act defines its own intent. Section 26 is prefaced with this headline, \u201cManufacture and Sale of Imitation Butter Prohibited.\u201d Section 28 commences \u201cProhibited Articles not to be Furnished.\u201d Section 36 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201cObject and Intent of This Article. This article and each section thereof are declared to be enacted to prevent deception in the sale of dairy-products, and to preserve the public .health, which is endangered by the manufacture, sale and use of the articles or substances herein regulated or prohibited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Thus we have a distinct legislative declaration that the substance in question is deleterious, and that the object of the prohibition is to preserve the public health. The words were meant to cover the intent. \u201cMade in violation of the provisions of this article\u201d was simply a concrete expression meaning \u201cmade in the manner condemned by this article.\u201d To limit it to such making as could be punished by the courts would destroy the entire system. \u201cSuch construction of a statute,\u201d said Earl, J., in Pierson v. People, 79 N. Y. 433, \u201cshould be adopted as appears most reasonable, and best suited to accomplish the objects of the statute.\u201d The appellant insists upon a construction which would enable the proprietor of every hotel and restaurant in this state to serve with impunity what the legislature declares to be a deleterious substance, and thus, according to the legislative judgment, to jeopardize the public health. All the proprietor has to do, upon that construction, is to secure the condemned article elsewhere. If it is manufactured upon the other side of the boundary line of this state, he can injure the public health here with impunity. This construction is unreasonable. The prohibited article is none the less made in violation of the provisions of the agricultural law because made where those provisions have no binding force. \u201cViolation\u201d here means practical nonconformity, as well as punishable transgression. It is urged that section 26 favors the appellant\u2019s contention, because there also the sale of any such article \u201cin violation of the provisions of this section\u201d is forbidden, while the prohibition is coupled with the phrase (which -follows), \u201cwhether such article, substance or compound shaM be made or produced in this state or elsewhere.\u201d The appellant contends that the absence of the latter phrase in section 28 is significant. But still the question is as to the meaning, even in section 26, of the words, \u201cin violation of the provisions of this section.\u201d Unless they mean what we have suggested, namely, nonconformity to the manufacturing regulations of the section, the words which follow, and which are supposed to be significant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>have no force and are simply contradictory. The legislature surely never meant to embody in a single sentence such a provision as this: That no person shall sell any article made in this state in violation of the provisions of this section, whether such article be made in this state or out of this state. What the legislature really intended was to accentuate its previous meaning. The purpose was to prohibit the sale of goods of the condemned class. Lest'the expression, \u201cmade in violation of the provisions of this section,\u2019\u2019 should possibly be considered ambiguous, the words of legislative construction, \u201cwhether made or produced in this state or elsewhere,\u201d were added. Having used those words, not to amplify or extend the prohibition, but to construe and emphasize it, it was unnecessary to repeat such words of construction in the following twenty-eighth section. They were really unnecessary in section 26. They were equally unnecessary in section 28. Without them there was no genuine ambiguity. The violation contemplated was clear enough, namely, the production or sale or use of goods which the legislature deemed deleterious. But whatever possible doubt there might have been was set at rest by the words which we have called \u201cwords of construction.\u201d The expression, \u201cin violation of the provisions,\u201d etc., has precisely the same meaning in the one section as the other. The words themselves are the same. They mean the same thing without any words of construction, and they mean it none the less with such words of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We have no doubt that the defendant was properly convicted, and that the judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
