Another candidate was nominated for the position, and his name was directed to be written on all the ballots in a space left for that purpose. In casting the ballots the greater number of those voting erased one of the two names, but two were cast containing both names, with neither erased, and, discarding such ballots, neither nominee had enough to elect. <em>Eeld </em>that, in such case, the written name could not be considered as controlling the one printed in indicating the choice of the voter, and that the two ballots were properly rejected, and a new vote ordered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-13\">The Retail Coal Exchange of this city is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the state of New York, having, among other officers, a secretary, who, according to the by-laws, is to be elected annually at the first meeting in December of each year, which election is to be by ballot. On December 7, 1894, at a meeting of this corporation, nominations for officers for the year 1895 were made, at which Jeremiah Pangburn\u00a1 Jr., was nominated for secretary. The annual meeting was held December 21, 1894. The secretary brought to this meeting the printed list of nominees, whereon, for secretary, appeared the defendant\u2019s name, and following that name was a blank space of about half an inch. The chairman called for additional nominations for secretary, and the relator was then also nominated. The printed slips were distributed among the members, and the presiding officer announced the additional nominations made at this meeting, and directed \u201cthat the members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>would please write those in; that is, proceed to complete the ballot. * * * After which a recess was declared for the preparation of ballots.\u201d Under the by-laws, \u201ca majority vote of the members present and voting shall be necessary to elect, and the mode of taking a vote or ballot on any question shall be in such manner as the meeting shall decide.\u201d After the recess, ballots were cast, and the count showed that, of the 42 ballots cast, 21 had the printed name J. Pangburn, Jr., and the name Oscar Thorn in writing underneath it, with a line drawn through the name J. Pangburn, Jr.; 7 had the name J. Pangburn, Jr., in print, and the name Oscar Thorn in writing underneath it, with a line drawn through the name Oscar Thorn; 12 had the name J. Pangburn, Jr., in print, only; and 2 had the name J. Pangburn, Jr., in print, and the name Oscar Thorn in writing underneath it, with neither name crossed off, so that these two ballots read:</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b233-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Appeal from superior court of New York City.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-12\">Proceeding in the nature of quo warranto on the relation of Oscar Thorn against Jeremiah Pangburn, Jr., to determine the right to the office of secretary of the Retail Coal Exchange of the city of New York, a domestic corporation.

The action was tried by the court without a jury, and the decision, rendered was to the effect that the tellers erred in declaring the said two ballots defective; and from the judgment entered upon that decision, this appeal is taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b234-9\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The crucial question, therefore, is, were these ballots defective?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">The respondent contends that they were not, and in support of such contention cites the case of People v. Saxton, 22 N. Y. 310, which was followed in People v. Love, 63 Barb. 535. In the Sax-ton Case, there were three candidates for the office of county clerk, who were to be voted for upon separate printed ballots. Upon the printed ballots containing the names of the other candidates the name of Saxton appeared in writing. It was therein held, in regard to the intention of the voter, as to whether such a ballot should be counted in favor of the written or the printed name, that \u201cwriting a name upon a ballot in connection with the title of an office is such a designation of the name for that office as to satisfy the statute, although he omits to strike out a name printed upon it in connection with the same office. The writing is to prevail as the highest evidence of his intention.\u201d This is but another application of the well-settled rule that, where there is any repugnancy between the written and printed portions of an instrument, the written portion is to prevail over that which is printed. And where, as in that case, upon a ballot which contained the name of another candidate, a person wrote the name of the candidate Saxton, erasing the print<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ed name, there was no difficulty in getting at what was the intention of the voter.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">That case, however, is clearly distinguishable from the one at bar. -Here the nominations first made were all printed, and other nominations were permissible upon- the day of the election; and, the relator having been presented for the office of secretary, the direction of the president was that his name should then be written on the ballot which contained the printed names of all the other candidates; and, with a view of having all the ballots so arranged before they were cast for any candidate, a recess was ordered, and a \u25a0 direction by the chairman made as to the manner of making up the ballot. It is true that some of the members neglected to complete the ballots by writing in the name of Thorn; but the effect of this upon the validity of such ballots, when cast, we are not called upon to determine. The by-laws provide that the \u201cmode of taking a vote or ballot on any question shall be in such manner as the meeting shall decide.\u201d And the acquiescence of members in the direction of the president as to the manner in which the ballots were to be prepared before proceeding to an election must be regarded, in the absence of any other action by the meeting, as controlling. Be that as it may, however, the great majority of those present and voting proceeded to comply with the directions of the president by placing, in writing, under the printed name of the defendant, the name of the relator; and when the ballots were thus all prepared, as is shown by the result, many who desired to vote for Pangburn erased the name of Thorn written upon the ballot, and many who desired to vote for Thorn erased the printed name of Pangburn. On the two ballots in question both names appear, without either being erased; and, as there was no means of determining for whom these were intended, we think the inspectors of election were right in holding that they were defective, and should not be counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The distinction between the Saxton Case and this -is clear. In the former, the writing of the name raised the presumption that it was the voter\u2019s intention to vote for the man whose name he wrote upon the ballot, and it was the only means by which he could indicate such choice, while here the voter was directed to write the name of Thorn on the printed ballot before he could make his choice. In \u201e the Saxton Case the voter designated his choice by writing a name, while in this case he could only designate his choice by striking out a name. Under such circumstances, therefore, the mere writing of a name upon the ballot underneath the printed name for the same office could raise no presumption that the person writing it intended to vote for the one whose name appeared thereon in writing, as against the person whose name was printed. After both names were on the ballot, the choice of the voter was to be indicated by crossing out the one for whom he did not intend to vote. Unless this were done, there was nothing to indicate the voter\u2019s choice. It was error, therefore, to hold, upon the facts here appearing, that the written name took any precedence over the printed one. We think the inspectors were right in holding that the persons casting the disputed ballots had, under the mode prescribed, failed to indicate their choice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and there should be judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing the complaint, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
