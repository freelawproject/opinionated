Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 2863, 3215; Risley v. Bank, 83 N. Y. 318, 337; Davidsburgh v. Insurance Co., 90 N. Y. 526, 530) was removed by section 9 of the mechanic\u2019s lien law, which is as follows: \u201cAn action to foreclose a lien, provided for in this act, may be brought in a court not of record, which would have jurisdiction to render a judgment in an action upon a contract for a sum equal to the amount of the lien,\u201d etc.; and (2) whether or not, by a notice filed after the death of his contractor, the subcontractor may acquire a valid lien. The action was one in behalf of certain subcontractors against the owner of the premises and the administrator of the deceased contractor, to foreclose a lien, the amount of the alleged lien being less than $250. It was conceded that the notice of lien was filed after the decease of the contractor, and the court below thereupon directed the dismissal of the complaint with regard to both defendants; the grounds stated for such dismissal at the time involving the negative of the-questions above alluded to. The record, however, presents only the first of such questions for our consideration. Nothing in the mechanic\u2019s lien law (Laws 1885, c. 342) evinces legislative intention, by authorizing the prosecution of an action to foreclose a lien in courts not of record, to remove the inhibition of subdivision 5 of section 2863 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see, also, section 3215), and subdivision 3 of section 1286 of the consolidation act (chapter 410, Laws 1882), against the exercise of jurisdiction by the district courts in the city of New York in actions brought against an executor or administrator, as such. Such inhibition, therefore, being special and local in its operation, upon well-settled rules of statutory construction, prevails against the provisions of a general law with regard to which it is not plainly repugnant. Van Denburgh v. Greenbush, 66 N. Y. 1, 3; 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 422, and cases collated in note 3. It follows that the action was properly dismissed as against the defendant administrator. Obviously, the judgment appealed from w.as several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>with regard to the defendants. In so far as it proceeded from the want of jurisdiction it was in favor of the defendant administrator, and rightfully rendered. He could not litigate the validity , of the lien- claimed in the court below; and, in so far as the judgment determined the lien to be invalid, it was in favor of the defendant owner. From the last-mentioned judgment no appeal appears to have been taken, the notice of appeal being directed to the defendant administrator only. The defendant owner did not, so far as appears from the record, participate in this appeal, and without an appeal from the judgment in his favor any inquiry on our part concerning the conclusion of the court below that the notice of lien filed was a nullity would involve the decision of a moot case,\u2014a task which we are not bound to assume.
