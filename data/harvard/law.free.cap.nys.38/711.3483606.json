A verdict for the plaintiff was directed at the trial, against the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ant\u2019s objection, and, to the ruling, due exception appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\">It is clear that the court below entertained the action upon no other ground than the one last above alluded to. It was not even attempted to show that the defendant was the Lowey Company reorganized or consolidated with another corporation, pursuant to the provisions of the business corporation law (Laws 1890, c. 567, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 13, 17), in either of which events only the new corporation would assume the liabilities of the former by .operation of law (Thomp. Corp. \u00a7 365, etc.); and if, by succession to the rights and assets of the Lowey Company alone, the defendant, to that extent, was bound for the debts of its predecessor, for purely equitable reasons, the court, being without the jurisdiction of a court of equity, could not render the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">We do not deem it essential, upon this appeal, to go into the facts touching the claims against the Lowey Company, although there is room for contention as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action could prevail upon the evidence adduced. In our view, the judgment is well assailed, for the error which appears from the exception taken to the trial justice\u2019s withdrawal of the case from the jury. No motion was made by the defendant\u2019s counsel, after both sides had concluded the introduction of evidence, either for dismissal of the complaint, or for the direction of a verdict. It cannot therefore be urged that the defendant consented to a determination of the facts by the court. Its liability in this action, as well as the facts, was contested by the defendant, by answer and upon the trial. The only evidence, if any, of an assumption by the defendant of the Lowey Company\u2019s liabilities is to be found in the testimony of the plaintiff and of his brother William Lowey, called as a witness in the former\u2019s behalf; and so with regard to the evidence of the value of the chattels claimed to have been converted. Both witnesses were interested in the event of the action; the plaintiff obviously so, and his brother as a conceded stockholder in, and part owner of, the Lowey Company (Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N. Y. 191, 200, 25 N. E. 402), in whose hands the assets of the last-named company, or the proceeds of the sale of such assets, were applicable to the payment of that company\u2019s debts if the effort to charge the defendant with such debts should prove unavailing. The .credibility of these witnesses, therefore, was to be determined by the jury, notwithstanding that such credibility may not have been directly assailed or impeached. Elwood v. Telegraph Co., 45 N. Y. 549; Wohlfahrt v. Beckert, 92 N. Y. 490; Cady v. Bradshaw, 116 N. Y. 188, 22 N. E. 371; Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N. Y. 191, 200, 25 N. E. 402; 29 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Errors also appear in the admission and exclusion of evidence. It would be supererogatory, however, to discuss them, since they may not occur upon a retrial of the action, and\u2019 reversal of the judgment appealed from is imperative upon the error hereinbefore pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The judgments of the general and trial terms of the court below are reversed, and a new trial is ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
