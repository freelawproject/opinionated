They then offered him a note of one of their customers, drawn for $462, which they indorsed over to the defendant; and she, in turn, indorsed it and procured its discount. The defendant says that plaintiff\u2019s assignor then agreed that, if said note was not paid at maturity, the sum of $462 should be credited on defendant\u2019s debt due them, which was agreed to. Subsequent to the receipt by plaintiff\u2019s assignor of said $462, and before maturity of the note, they failed, making the plaintiff their general assignee. Action is now brought upon defendant\u2019s debt, and defendant alleges payment of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">If defendant paid plaintiff\u2019s assignor the $462 in the manner described by her, and then agreed that, upon their failure to pay said note upon its maturity, the said payments should be credited upon her account, of course, upon their failure to pay the note, said $462 should have been credited upon her debt, and such payment, in law, was made at the time of the actual delivery of the sum in question; and, that being prior to the assignment to plaintiff, it paid in full the defendant\u2019s debt, and consequently no cause of action could exist thereon in plaintiff\u2019s favor. This was the defendant\u2019s version of the transaction, and the jury believed it,-as they had a right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-9\">We find no error, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
