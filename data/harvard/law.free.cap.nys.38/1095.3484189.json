The evidence in the case shows, without contradiction, that the defendant was neither the owner nor the keeper of the dog by which the plaintiff was bitten. Nevertheless, the defendant was held liable as the owner, by reason of the construction which the trial court put upon the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">The comnlaint aliened that the defendant was a resident of Westchester county, in this state, and was, at the times set forth therein, \u201cthe owner of a certain dog.\u201d These allegations were admitted by the answer. The complaint went on to aver that on or about the 14th day of November, 1893, \u201cdefendant\u2019s said dog bit this plaintiff in the leg,\u201d to his damage in the sum of $5,000; that defendant had previous knowledge of the mischievous and vicious propensities of said dog; and that said injury was caused to the plaintiff, without any negligence on his part. These averments were all denied by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-14\">From this statement of the contents of the pleadings, it will be observed that, while the defendant admitted the ownership of a certain dog, he did not admit that he was the owner of the dog which was alleged to have bitten the plaintiff. Upon the trial, the proof showed that the dog which bit the plaintiff was owned, not by the defendant, but by a coachman in the employ of the defendant\u2019s mother; yet, notwithstanding the uncontroverted evidence to this effect, the trial judge charged the jury that the ownership of the dog, under the peculiar form of the pleadings, was admitted by the defendant. We think this view was erroneous, and that the error calls upon us to reverse the judgment. It is true that an action may be maintained to recover damages for injuries inflicted by a dog accustomed to bite mankind, against a person who keeps such an animal, even if he is not the owner. As Lc :-d Tenterden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1097\">*1097</page-number>said, in M\u2019Kone v. Wood, 5 Car. &amp; P. 1: \u201cThe harboring a dog about one\u2019s premises, or allowing him to be or resort there, is a sufficient keeping of the dog to support this form of action.\u201d But there was no evidence in the present case sufficient to render the defendant liable as the keeper of the dog which bit the plaintiff. The premises upon which the dog was kept by the coachman were occupied by the defendant\u2019s mother as a tenant, and it does not appear that defendant had any control over them whatever. He merely lived there with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">There was also an error in the admission of evidence, to which it is proper to call attention, lest it should be repeated upon another trial. The nlaintiff, against the objection and excention of the defendant, was allowed to testify that the majority of Irish setters, although generally very faithful about a house, were very snappish. The language of the learned trial judge, in overruling the objection to this testimony, shows that he entertained serious doubt as to its admissibility. We think it should have been excluded, in view of the fact that the witness himself admitted that he could not tell whether the dog which bit him was a real Irish setter or a mongrel, and there was no other witness in the case from whose testimony the particular breed of the dog could be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
