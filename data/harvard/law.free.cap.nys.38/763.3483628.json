The plaintiff and Ms co-partners consigned the piano to one John McCramm, for sale on their account, the piano to remain their property until sold by McCramm. The property was seized on an execution against McCramm and sold to the defendant. We tMnk it plain that the defendant acquired no title to the piano by the execution sale against McCramm. The ruling of the trial court in this respect was correct. But the value of the property was to be assessed by the jury. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony in that respect was not conclusive. The constable who made the sale, which, &lt;ff course, was at public auction, testified to the price realized at the sale. Subsequently, on the motion of the plaintiff, this evidence was stricken out. We think tMs was fatal error. It is settled by authority that the price which property realizes at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>public sale is evidence o\u00ed its value. Campbell v. Woodworth, 20 N. Y. 499; Grill v. McNamee, 42 N. Y. 44. For the error in excluding this evidence, and also in refusing to submit the question of value to the jury, the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
