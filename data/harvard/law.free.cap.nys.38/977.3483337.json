' The only inquiry on this appeal relates to the propriety of the allowance by the surrogate of a fee of $30 to a special guardian appointed for an infant in this particular proceeding, in which the amount allowed the special guardian was charged by the surrogate against the estate of Mr. Post in the hands of the executors of his will. It appears conclusively from the papers presented on this appeal that there was no necessity whatever, at any stage of the proceeding, for the appointment of a special guardian. The infant had no interest in the proceeding, as the appraiser reported to the surrogate, and as was: apparent from the beginning. The appraiser was appointed upon the petition of one of the executors, but the special guardian was not. Mr. Post\u2019s will had been proven, and was recorded in the surrogate\u2019s office. It appears from the provisions of the will that the testator\u2019s widow was entitled to a life interest in the whole estate,\u2014that is to say, to the net income after the payment of all taxes and other proper charges thereon,\u2014and that the infant\u2019s interest was only in remainder, and, as the appraiser found, not taxable at the then present time, it being not then ascertainable- to whom the interest in remainder would finally pass. This situation was plainly disclosed on the face of the will, to which reference was made in the petition of the executor for the appointment of the appraiser, and the whole question of the imposition of the tax was therefore one between the state and the executor and the life tenant. Under such circumstances, we think there was no necessity for, or propriety in, the appointment of a special guardian; for no contest could possibly arise in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>assessment proceeding, and under the provisions of the will, by which the infant\u2019s interest in remainder could be affected. The appointment of a special guardian, and the burdening of the estate with charges for his services, under such circumstances, is a matter which should not be authorized by the co'urt. Whatever discretionary power a surrogate may have to appoint a special guardian can only be exercised when some reason exists therefor. No such reason is shown here, because, on the face of the will, it was apparent that no tax under the transfer tax act could be levied upon the infant\u2019s interest in-remainder; and the order appealed from, of October 1, 1895, must be reversed, and the order of July 15,1895, modified by striking therefrom the allowance of $30 made to the special guardian. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
