It may, however, be proper to grant a bill as to some of the particulars referred to in those papers in order that the defendant may prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs, with leave to renew after issue joined.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
