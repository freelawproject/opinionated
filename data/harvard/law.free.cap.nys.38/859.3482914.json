J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYB\">The Code (section 538) gives the court authority to strike out a sham defense. It may not strike out a counterclaim as sham, for that is not a \u201cdefense,\u201d within the meaning of that section. Collins v. Swan, 7 Rob. (N. Y.) 94; Fettretch v. Mackay, 47 N. Y. 427. Nor can it strike out an answer which consists of a mere denial, for the reasons given in Thompson v. Railway Co., 45 N. Y. 468. But we' have no doubt of its authority, in a proper case, to strike out any affirmative defense, if it clearly appears that it is a false one. Bank v. Spencer, 76 N. Y. 156; Bank v. Inman, 51 Hun, 97, 5 N. Y. Supp. 457; Bank v. Rider, 74 Hun, 349, 26 N. Y. Supp. 490. The special term, therefore, had authority to strike out the defense contained in the fifth paragraph of the answer in this action, unless it is to be considered a \u201ccounterclaim.\u201d The pleader has not designated it as such. On the contrary, he has called it a \u201cdefense.\u201d There is a marked distinction recognized in the Code between a defense and a counterclaim. See sections 500 and 507; also, the definition of a \u201ccounterclaim\u201d in section 501. See, also, Fettretch v. Mackay, above cited. And, when the pleader designates the facts which he sets forth as a \u201cdefense,\u201d the court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>\u25a0conclude that he so intended them. He will not be at liberty. to \u25a0call them a \u201cdefense\u201d when he serves the answer, and a \u201ccounterclaim\u201d when a subsequent emergency or convenience makes the \u2022change desirable. Morris v. Chamberlin (Sup.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 702; Society v. Cuyler, 75 N. Y. 511; Acer v. Hotchkiss, 97 N. Y. 395-408.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The matter stricken out, therefore, must \"be treated as a defense, .and, as such, we have no doubt but that it was \u00e1 sham one. There .are hardly facts enough stated in it to constitute a defense. There is an averment that defendant sold and delivered to plaintiff certain bonds, of the value of $15,000, for which it is still indebted to defendant; but this is followed by the statement that \u201cplaintiff has not accounted to said defendant for the value of said bonds.\u201d Why should plaintiff account for their value if it had purchased the bonds? Such an averment is utterly inconsistent with the idea of a sale. There is no averment of a request, or of a price fixed, or of a promise by plaintiff to pay what the bonds were reasonably worth; no facts showing a sale, except what may be inferred from the use of the words \u201csold and delivered.\u201d Certainly, the pleader has not fairly and squarely set forth a contract of sale, and his suggestions of a liability on plaintiff\u2019s part to account to him for their value raises the serious question whether a sale was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">It is suggested by the appellant\u2019s points on this appeal that, \u201cif the bonds were originally delivered to the plaintiff as collateral, such a transaction would constitute a sale and delivery\u201d; and it is quite probable that the pleader had this same idea when he drew this part of his answer. Very clearly, it would be no defense to the action on the note that the plaintiff held bonds as security for its payment; and, just as clearly, a deposit of bonds as collateral security is not a sale of them. In opposition to this, the affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s cashier squarely and distinctly states that the bonds were never sold to the plaintiff; that they were deposited with it-as collateral security, for an indebtedness of which the note in suit was part; and that the averment, in the answer, of a sale and delivery of them, is absolutely and wholly false. This statement is in harmony with, and to some extent corroborated by, the averment in the answer that plaintiff has not accounted to defendant for the value of the bonds. The defendant does not specifically deny this statement, nor attempt to explain the real transaction concerning the bonds. He makes a new affidavit, to the effect that the statements in his answer are true, and adds nothing more to it. Such a response is altogether unsatisfactory, and leaves no doubt as to the propriety of the action of the special term. The defense, attempted to be set up was clearly sham and false, and was properly stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">The first paragraph of the answer denies, on information and belief, that the plaintiff is a banking association by the name set forth in the complaint. The second paragraph avers, on information and belief, that there is no such corporation as the \u201cFirst National Bank of Saratoga Springs,\u201d as alleged in the complaint. Neither of these is \u201can affirmative allegation that the plaintiff is not a corporation,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>and hence they raise no issue over that question. Code, \u00a7 1776;. Association v. Read, 93 N. Y. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The making and delivering o\u00ed the note to plaintiff are admitted, and no other allegation in the answer raises any issue over any material fact which plaintiff would have to prove to establish his claim against the defendant. All of the answer was frivolous, and judgment against defendant was properly ordered thereon. The order of\" the special term was right, and should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Order appealed from affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
