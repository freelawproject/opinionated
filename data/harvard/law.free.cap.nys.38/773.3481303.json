By the third clause of the policy the company agreed, at its option, to replace the glass, or to pay actual value of the glass broken. The policy further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-16\">\u201cWhenever necessary, the assured shall, at his own expense, remove any woodwork, gas fixtures, or other obstruction to the replacing of the glass.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">The plaintiff notified the defendant company that the glass in his store window was broken, and thereupon the company notified the defendant Hutkoff, with whom it had a contract for that purpose, to replace the broken pane. Hutkoff sent his workmen to replace the glass. They found that the gas pipes outside the window interfered with the work, and notified the clerks in the store that they would have to be removed. Plaintiff leased the store to one Pape, and the two men in charge of it were his employ\u00e9s.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-18\">The justice has found, on conflicting testimony, that the defendant Hutkoff\u2019s men worked at the pipes, and negligently detached two lengths, in the cellar and basement, so that, when the gas was lighted that evening, an explosion occurred, which caused the damage complained of in this action. A master is, ordinarily, liable to a third person injured through the negligence of his servant while acting within the scope of his employment. 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 804; Mott v. Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543, 547. \u201cThe test of the mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ter\u2019s responsibility for the act of his servant is, not whether such act was done according to the instructions of the master to the servant, but whether it is done in the prosecution of the business that the servant was employed by the master to do.\u201d Cosgrove v. Ogden, 49 N. Y. 255, 257. Here the duty of the servant was fixed by the contract of insurance, which placed the obligation of removing gas pipes and other obstructions upon the owner. This was known to all the parties interested. If,' therefore, Hutkoff\u2019s employ\u00e9s endeavored to remove the gas pipes, they acted, in so doing, neither within the scope nor within the course of their employment, and the defendants cannot be held liable for such acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The judgment, as rendered, against both defendants, is erroneous. The immediate employer of a servant is alone responsible for the \"latter\u2019s negligent acts. There cannot be two superiors severally responsible in such a case. Blake v. Ferris, 5 N. Y. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">' The judgment must be reversed as to each defendant, with costa to abide the event of a new trial, which is hereby directed. \u25a0 All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
