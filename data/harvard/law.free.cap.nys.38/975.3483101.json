The defense is practically a general denial. The case was fairly tried, and the evidence properly submitted to the jury, who found in favor of the plaintiff. The verdict must stand, unless we find some error of law. At the trial the plaintiff testified in detail to the work, labor, and services performed, arid their value. The question of the value of the plaintiff\u2019s service was material and important. One Goodrich was then called for the plaintiff, and, after testifying that he was a civil engineer for over 40 years, and knew the value of civil engineers\u2019 services, was asked, among others, these questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-14\">\u201cQuestion. You have heard all of the testimony in this suit, have you not? Answer. Most of it. Q. Can you answer my question now? Give us an estimate, from what you have heard of the testimony here, what these services were reasonably worth. (Objected to, as the question should be hypothetical. Question allowed. Exception.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">This was not error. It relates to a mere matter of form, and not of substance, and the question was, in effect, directing the attention of the witness, who was an expert, to the testimony of one witness on a single subject, and was not other in effect than if the counsel had recited the statements of services rendered by the party, and on that statement asked an opinion of their value. Seymour v. Fellows, 77 N. Y. 178; McCollum v. Seward, 62 N. Y. 316. The cases cited by the appellant are good law, and apply to a different class, but do not affect this question. We find no error, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
