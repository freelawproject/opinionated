There is no allegation in the moving papers that a bill of particulars is necessary to enable the defendant to prepare his answer; and it is quite evident that it is not, as he can deny, either expressly or upon information and belief, the allegations contained in the complaint. We think, therefore, that this motion was prematurely made, and that, at this stage of the action, the facts necessary to be alleged and proved were not before the court to justify the granting of a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. *</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
