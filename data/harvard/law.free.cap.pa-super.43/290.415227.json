Defendants testify that before these doors had been made, on July '31 they wrote a letter to the plaintiff company in which they called their attention to this fact: \u201cOur plan is after the usual construction and is according to the underwriters\u2019 specifications.\u201d You have had explained to you what the National Board of Underwriters is; an association composed .of insurance companies whose rules and regulations govern the method of insurance on certain buildings. Naturally, if you or I wanted to erect a factory and wanted insurance on it, we would be likely to inquire what the rules and regulations of the insurance companies were, so that we might procure insurance on our building. Now it appears that, under the rules of this underwriters\u2019 association, for fire doors white pine is required. You have had the rule read to you and the reason for the rule. Now, although nothing was mentioned about underwriters in the original contract; yet if, before the plaintiffs commenced to manufacture these doors, the defendant company should want to change the contract, or to require something additional in it, they could do so, being subject, of course, to any damages which might accrue to the plaintiffs by reason of an entire failure of the contract or by reason of a change in its terms. Now when the attention of the plaintiffs was called to the underwriters\u2019 specifications, it is for you to inquire and say what they should have done. If they were ignorant of the rules of the underwriters\u2019 association, ought they not, when their attention was thus specifically called to it, to have made inquiry, either of the defendants to inquire what was meant by that, or to have obtained a copy of the rules in order to ascertain what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>necessary? The plaintiffs, it- appeared, had no knowledge of any such association or of any such requirement and therefore they paid no attention to the letter. If they had, they would have had brought to their attention the fact that white pine was required to be inserted in fire doors, and the moment they were notified of that, it is for you to say as to whether their duty would not have been to have notified the defendants that, \u201cInasmuch as you require white pine, which is higher priced than yellow pine, there must be a change in the terms of our contract.\u201d On the contrary, they paid no attention to the letter. It is for you to say as to whether they did or did not fail in their duty in that respect. As they have testified that they know nothing about this association, should they just fold their hands and rely on the contract as it was written, or was it their duty to take the matter up after they received that letter and endeavor to inform themselves as to whether something had been omitted from the contract which the defendants now wanted inserted therein. If, because of their neglect to make that inquiry, this trouble has arisen, it is for you to say whether they or the defendants must suffer the loss.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXV\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiffs for $531.24.

The letter opens with the statement, \u201cWe need the following list of tin lined doors,\u201d and then enumerates a list of sizes and qualities, after which the following information is requested: \u201cKindly advise what</p>\n<p id=\"AQO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>you count these tin lined doors per square foot, same to be delivered f. o. b., Philadelphia. . . . We prefer having a price per square foot, as the sizes enumerated are not exact, as the building is not up and the openings are not made as yet.\u201d To this circular letter the plaintiff replied on June 13, \u201cCan furnish doors as pr. your inquiry f. o. b., Phila., Pa., at 16c. pr. sq. ft.\u201d Six weeks later, July 25, the defendant wrote: \u201cWe thank you for your proposition of the 13 ult. We would ask that you kindly book our order for the following to be shipped to Philadelphia,\u201d giving the details of the doors desired, and concluding \u201ckindly acknowledge receipt of the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\">The first letter of inquiry was not in form or substance an order for goods, and did not bind anyone. It accomplished its purpose in securing the desired information, and the defendant, with the knowledge of the price sug-' gested in the plaintiff\u2019s letter of June 13, then gave a definite order for the doors on July 25. The situation was so regarded by the defendant, and the letter of July 25 designated \u201cour order\u201d in the opening and closing sentences. The order was to be booked as of that time and was so regarded by the plaintiff who on the following day, July 26, accepted it by a letter as follows: \u201cWe have your order for doors and same will receive our earliest attention. We to-day place order for material for same, as we do not carry that in stock.\u201d All doubt on this phase of the case is settled by the defendant\u2019s letter of July 31, viz.: \u201cWe thank you for your letter of the 26 inst. in which you acknowledge receipt of our order of the 26 inst. Our plan is after the usual construction, and according to the Underwriters\u2019 specifications. Kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter, and advise approximately when we can expect shipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On August 7 the defendant again wrote: \u201cWe have no acknowledgment of our letter of 31st ult. Kindly advise whether you received this letter.\u201d To which the plaintiff replied on August 8: \u201cWe have your order and letter, and on account of oversight and absence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>writer failed to answer. We have ordered the material for the doors which we could not get here and will take two weeks at least yet to come in,\u201d etc. And on August 21: \u201cThe material has arrived and will start your doors on the 22nd, and will rush them through as fast as possible.\u201d The goods were shipped from Somerset, Pennsylvania, on August 27, from O. M. Weber Co. consigned to O. M. Weber Co., Philadelphia, with an order on which the freight was paid by the defendant. When they were received by the defendant, and after some of them had been inspected, all were rejected as not having been made of the proper material, and notice was given to the plaintiff that they were held subject to its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">The principal question is whether the contract was concluded at Philadelphia, where the goods were delivered f. o. b., or at Somerset, where they were manufactured. The trial judge held that the contract was made in Somerset, Pennsylvania, for the reason. that the defendant\u2019s order of July 25, and the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of July 26, constituted the contract between the parties. The letters f. o. b., Philadelphia, were intended to fix a price beyond which no charge could be made against the vendee either by shipper or carrier, and did not necessarily imply that they were to be delivered at Philadelphia as a consummation of the contract. The freight was paid by the appellant at destination and credit allowed on the prices quoted: Werner Saw-Mill Co. v. Ferree, 201 Pa. 405; Hatch v. Oil Co., 100 U. S. 124. The doors were rejected because they were made of yellow pine instead of white pine, yet white pine was not specified or mentioned in the original order, and they were made strictly in accordance with the terms of the order. The burden of proof was on the defendant to show that white pine was intended and that it should-have been so understood by the plaintiff. It was contended that, while there was nothing in the original order to call for white pine, yet in the letter of July 31 which was prior in date to the making of the doors, the attention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>of the plaintiff was called to the fact that certain requirements were exacted, viz.: \u201cOur plan is after the usual construction, and are according to the Underwriters\u2019 specifications.\u201d This it is urged was notice of a custom of trade which determined the character of the product. However, when the letter of July 31 was written, the defendant knew (by plaintiff\u2019s letter of July 26) that all of the material for the doors had been ordered; It is well settled that the trade customs which the law recognizes as governing the performance of a contract and controlling in such cases are only the law and trade customs of the place of performance of the contract: Guillon v. Earnshaw, 169 Pa. 463. This contract was both made and performed at Somerset, and if the particular trade custom alleged did not exist there by notorious, universal and well established usage or was actually known by the plaintiff, it would not avail as a defense. The existence of such a custom of trade and all knowledge of it was denied by the plaintiff. This raised a question of fact, which was fully and clearly explained and submitted to the jury both in the general charge and in the eleventh point and its answer. The plaintiff denied that it had any knowledge of any rules issued by an underwriters\u2019 association, and that no notice having been given to them of such an association in the original order, they were not bound by the specifications required by such rules. The effect of the lack of inquiry on this matter was so fully and carefully explained to the jury that the defendant has no ground of complaint. The case was tried and submitted with great fairness. We do not find any reversible error in the answers to the eleventh and nineteenth points for charge or in the instruction as to the effect to be given to the underwriters\u2019 specifications as a part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
