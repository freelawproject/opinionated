Code, \u00a7 187). As to Feagin, the jury found true the special circumstance allegations of first degree residential robbery and burglary, within the meaning of Penal Code section 190.2, subdivision (a)(17). In addition, both appellants suffered convictions for robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211), residential burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459), and assault with a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)). The jury found true allegations that appellants had personally used a firearm during the commission of the above offenses, within the meaning of Penal Code sections 12022.5 and 1203.06, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The jury deadlocked in the penalty phase as to Feagin, and the trial court declared a mistrial. The trial court sentenced Feagin to life in prison without possibility of parole, plus a consecutive four-year term for assault with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)). Ross was sentenced to 25 years to life, plus a consecutive 2-year term for the personal use of a firearm pursuant to Penal Code section 12022.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Feagin contends: \u201cI. The court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of a prior crime committed by Feagin. II. The court abused its discretion in removing Juror Kathy Perdue from the jury panel during its deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Ross contends: \u201cI. The trial court erred to appellant\u2019s prejudice by denying appellant\u2019s request to be tried by a separate jury, thus forcing appellant to be tried before a death qualified jury. II. The trial court abused its discretion when it removed Juror Kathy Perdue during deliberations. III. Appellant was denied his right to a public trial and to be present because the hearing regarding removal of Juror Kathy Perdue was conducted in chambers. IV. Pursuant to rule 13, California Rules of Court, appellant joins in coappellant Feagin\u2019s opening brief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">On April 29, 1988, Faye King was in the kitchen of her home, and her husband Howard was in the bedroom, when two men crashed through the bedroom door and yelled, \u201cthis is a robbery and we have cocked guns.\u201d Faye King attempted to call 911 but was ordered at gunpoint by the shorter of the two men, identified at trial as Ross, to hang up the phone and get on the floor. She complied. The taller man, identified at trial as Feagin, went into the bedroom and shot Howard in the chest with a .380-caliber handgun, killing him. Ross asked Feagin, \u201cdo you have any money?\u201d Feagin replied, \u201clots.\u201d The men fled from the location, taking from the home a .22-caliber pistol, the Kings\u2019 passports, and a Seiko watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">In addition to eyewitness identification, Feagin\u2019s fingerprints were found on the back door of the victims\u2019 residence. Ross\u2019s fingerprint was found on a newspaper inside the home, and shoe prints were discovered in the backyard of the King residence which could have been made by appellants\u2019 shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Several of the Kings\u2019 neighbors had observed a gold Cadillac belonging to Feagin and his aunt, Deana Thompson, driving slowly through the neighborhood the day before. They obtained the vehicle license plate number and gave it to police after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Deitric Gardner had known both appellants most of his life. On April 29, 1988, Deitric overheard Feagin and Ross speaking with a friend, Russell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>White. Feagin said, \u201cI just shot this nigga.\u201d Feagin stated that Ross had kicked the door down and told the lady to get on the floor. The lady tried to call 911. Feagin also said he got a watch and a .22-caliber gun, but no money. Deitric had previously observed appellant Feagin with a .380-caliber gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In August 1987, Feagin had tried to kill Deitric by pointing a nine-millimeter pistol in his face and pulling the trigger five times. The gun, however, did not fire. Deitric heard him say, \u201cman, I had him. I had him point blank dead. The gun just didn\u2019t go off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Pending trial, Deitric\u2019s brother, Henry Gardner, was in custody. Feagin confronted him and said, \u201cYour brother going to court on me.\u201d Several days later, Feagin and others assaulted Henry Gardner.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Appellants testified in their own defense. They denied being involved in the robbery and murder of Howard King. They claimed that they were in Woodland Hills on April 28, 1988, to visit a friend and then became lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">In an apparent attempt to explain Ross\u2019s fingerprints on the back door of the victims\u2019 residence and the appellants\u2019 possible shoe prints in the backyard, appellants claimed to have been chased by a car containing two or three young Black males. They drove down a dead-end street, abandoned the car, ran through several backyards, knocked on some doors, and yelled for help. After discovering that they were no longer being pursued, they returned to the Cadillac and drove back to Los Angeles. They gave an alibi defense for the evening of April 29, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Ross testified that after his arrest, he touched a newspaper in an interview room. Feagin denied trying to kill Deitric Gardner. He did admit that he pointed a gun at Deitric to embarrass and scare him. He claimed the gun was unloaded and inoperable. He denied being involved in the attack on Deitric\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">We first address the contentions raised by Feagin. Ross joins in these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">I. <em>Evidence of Prior Crime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-13\">Feagin\u2019s first contention, that the trial court erred in allowing Deitric Gardner to testify that Feagin tried to kill him in 1987, lacks merit. At trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>Feagin objected to the introduction of this evidence. After the court ruled that the statements Deitric had overheard were admissible against Ross as adoptive admissions, Ross took the position that he should be allowed to cross-examine Deitric about the incident in order to attack Deitric\u2019s credibility. Feagin urged that if the trial court were to allow the cross-examination, it should sever the trials, because as to him the evidence was more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Evidence that a witness is afraid to testify is relevant to the credibility of the witness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Warren </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 471, 481 [247 Cal.Rptr. 172, 754 P.2d 218].) An explanation of the witness\u2019s fear is relevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of the witness\u2019s credibility and is well within the discretion of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avalos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 232 [207 Cal.Rptr. 549, 689 P.2d 121]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1588 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 897].)  Here, the trial court weighed the probative value and prejudicial effect of the testimony pursuant to section 352 of the Evidence Code. It concluded that the episode would be too difficult to excise from the remainder of Deitric Gardner\u2019s testimony regarding Feagin\u2019s admissions and Ross\u2019s adoptive admissions. The trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201cits relevancy far outweighs any prejudicial impact to Mr. Feagin\u201d was well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Feagin correctly states the general rule that the reasons underlying the witness\u2019s fear are no longer relevant to establish or corroborate bias where the witness admits to bias against the party. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 39 [249 Cal.Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843], disapproved on another point in <em>In re Sassounian </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 535, 545 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 446, 887 P.2d 527].) The reason for the rule is obvious: it prohibits the prosecution from doing indirectly what it cannot do directly. Where cross-examination has shown bias or prejudice on the part of the witness, he or she cannot be rehabilitated by showing his bias is justified. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 193, 205 [75 Cal.Rptr. 257].)  Here, however, the evidence explained not only Deitric\u2019s state of mind, but also his demeanor in court and his prior actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 180, 187 [151 Cal.Rptr. 606]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Yeats </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 983, 986-987 [198 Cal.Rptr. 268]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Warren, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 471, 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>The testimony explained the fear Deitric felt when appellant\u2019s aunt followed him from the courtroom; his reaction to the assault on his brother in jail by Feagin two days after his earlier testimony; his reluctance to testify and inconsistent statements; his reasons for leaving a group in which he overheard statements when approached by appellants; and his reasons for hiding his face while testifying. The trial court properly balanced the probative value versus the prejudicial effect of the evidence. Moreover, in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt in this case, any error in this regard must be deemed to be harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">II. <em>Removal of Juror Perdue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Feagin\u2019s second contention (asserted by Ross as his second contention), that the trial court erred in dismissing Juror Perdue, also lacks merit. Penal Code section 1089 authorizes a trial court to dismiss a juror before the jury returns its verdict if the juror becomes ill or upon a showing of good cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>that the juror is unable to perform his or her duty. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 864 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].)  A trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 21 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 593, 859 P.2d 673].) A juror\u2019s inability to perform his or her functions, however, must appear as a \u201c \u2018demonstrable reality,\u2019 \u201d and bias may not be presumed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1477, 1484 [267 Cal.Rptr. 865].)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The court received two notes from the jury after several days of deliberation. One of the notes was from Foreperson Gunn, the other from Juror Perdue. The court notified the attorneys of the notes and suggested that the matters be addressed in chambers in the presence of counsel. There was no objection to the suggested procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The court, in chambers, read Foreperson Gunn\u2019s note regarding Juror Perdue to counsel and proposed to call the foreperson in and question her regarding her note.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no objection to the suggested procedure from the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Foreperson Gunn informed the court that Juror Perdue was not deliberating with the other jurors, not explaining her viewpoints, and indicated to the others that her mind was already made up and she was not going to change her mind, even on issues that had not yet been discussed. After questioning Foreperson Gunn, the court read Juror Perdue\u2019s note to counsel, then summoned Juror Perdue, and questioned her regarding her note, without objection by counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Juror Perdue stated she was concerned with racial prejudice directly related to the juror\u2019s opinions toward the defendants and their attorneys. She related a number of comments made by other jurors during the proceedings which she felt were attributable to racial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>After speaking with Juror Perdue, the court suggested that some, if not all of the other jurors be questioned to get their perspectives. Again, there was no objection by the parties. The court then interviewed Juror Cat\u00f3n, who denied hearing any comments by any of the jurors, other than Juror Perdue, that could be interpreted as racial bias. She indicated that Juror Perdue brought up issues related to the \u201c(Rodney) King\u201d incident and Juror Perdue\u2019s comment that \u201c. . . the police department are prejudiced against Black people . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The court then interviewed Juror Ruppert without objection by counsel. Juror Ruppert related that Juror Perdue would not explain why she thinks a certain way, and had brought up the King case saying, \u201cthe officers could be biased or they could have framed Mr. Ross.\u201d Juror Perdue indicated that the other jurors weren\u2019t going to be able to change her mind prior to the jurors\u2019 even discussing certain points, including any deliberations as to the codefendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">After the interview with Juror Ruppert, defense counsel objected for the first time to the continued examination of jurors in chambers, and requested that the proceedings be conducted in open court in the defendants\u2019 presence and that the jurors be sworn and examined by counsel. The court denied the requests and made findings on the record in support of the court\u2019s reasoning for continuing the matter in chambers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The court then interviewed the remaining eight jurors. A majority of the jurors confirmed that Juror Perdue was unwilling to participate in the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>discussions, refused to explain her thoughts and had brought up issues of police bias against Blacks, specifically referring to the Rodney King incident. It became apparent that at the time Juror Perdue announced that she had \u201cmade up her mind and could not be convinced to change her mind,\u201d the deliberations concerning one defendant had not been completed, deliberations as to the other defendant had not started and no votes had been taken on either defendant on any count or allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">After conducting the interviews in chambers, the court provided counsel with the opportunity to argue the matter in open court with their clients present but outside the presence of the jury. The court then made the findings of juror misconduct and excused Jurors Perdue,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Soloman and Belong.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury was instructed not to speculate as to the reasons the three jurors were excused. They were then instructed to start deliberations anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We find substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that Juror Perdue was unable to perform her functions as a juror as a demonstrable reality, in that she had prejudged the credibility of the police officers who had testified at trial and was unable to cast aside her personal bias in weighing the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 1485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>III. <em>Denial of Separate Juries</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Ross\u2019s first contention, that the trial court erred in denying his request that he be tried by a separate jury, is unavailing. He urges that joinder with Feagin, who was tried before a death-qualified jury, prejudiced him in that the removal of qualified jurors for cause on death penalty issues forced him to submit to a jury which was more prone to conviction. This position has been consistently rejected by our Supreme Court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Keenan </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 503 [250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 758 P.2d 1081]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 79-80 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 329, 342-353 [197 Cal.Rptr. 803, 673 P.2d 680]; <em>Hovey </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 1, 61-69 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Wimberly </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th <em>773, </em>794 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 152].) We are, of course, bound by our Supreme Court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">IV. <em>In-chambers Hearing Concerning Juror Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Ross\u2019s third contention, that the trial court denied his right to a public trial and to be present by conducting the hearing regarding juror misconduct in chambers, is equally unavailing.  A defendant waives his or her right to object to an in camera hearing between the judge and a juror by consenting to the procedure. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Siripongs </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 548, 573-574 [247 Cal.Rptr. 729, 754 P.2d 1306].)  Here, Ross consented to the in-chambers procedure for the first four jurors. At that point, he interposed an objection for the first time, but by then sufficient grounds for excluding Juror Perdue already existed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Even assuming the issue has not been waived, the proceeding involved here is not one which the public or the defendant has a right to attend. It has long been recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he trial of the action, so far as the term \u201cpublic trial\u201d is concerned, consists in the proceedings for the impanelment of the jury, the opening statements of counsel, the presentation of evidence, the arguments, the instructions to the jury and the return of the verdict,\u2019 but does not include conferences between court and counsel where \u2018the subject matter of the conferences between court and counsel was a question or questions of law, and not matters advanced for consideration of the triers of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 672, 685 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 758], citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Teitelbaum </em>(1958) 163 Cal.App.2d 184, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>206-207 [329 P.2d 157]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 905, 925-926 [111 Cal.Rptr. 295].) The accused is not entitled to be personally present during proceedings which bear no reasonable, substantial relation to his opportunity to defend the charges against him or her. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Siripongs, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 572; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 573-574 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776].)  Ross has made no effort to demonstrate that his absence from the in camera hearing impaired his ability to \u201cdefend the charges against him.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 309-310 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bloyd </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 333, 359-361 [233 Cal.Rptr. 368, 729 P.2d 802].)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Even assuming the Sixth Amendment public trial guarantee applies to the juror removal proceeding, the \u201cpresumption of openness\u201d is rebutted by a showing that exclusion of the public was necessary to protect some higher value such as the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial or the government\u2019s interest in preserving the confidentiality of the proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra, </em>4 Cal. 4th 376, 383, citing <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 39, 44-45 [81 L.Ed.2d 31, 37-38, 104 S.Ct. 2210].)  Here, the sensitive nature of the juror disclosures in this case would justify excluding the public.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Moreover, a partial closure, that is, exclusion of the public from a small part of a trial, does not constitute prejudice per se. <em>(Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 501, 512 [78 L.Ed.2d 629, 639-640, 104 S.Ct. 819] [exclusion from six weeks of jury voir dire]; <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra, </em>467 U.S. 39 [exclusion from entire pretrial suppression hearing]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sherlock </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 962 F.2d 1349,1357-1358 [temporary exclusion of defendant\u2019s family members from courtroom during testimony of rape victim]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 376 [doors locked for ninety minutes while the prosecutor completed his closing argument].)  In the instant case, the in camera proceedings lasted approximately two and a half hours, compared to the evidentiary phase of the trial which lasted over two months. We conclude that, as in <em>Woodward, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at page 376, the closure, if error at all, was at most a \u201ctrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>error,\u201d subject to evaluation under the standard enunciated in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065], and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Boren, P.

If it were tried, if it were to be\u2014if the court were to try to excise it out, for example, <em>there would be no explanation for why Deitric Gardner would back up and not be part of the group and Mr. Feagin drove up; or alternatively </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number><em>from the defense side, there would be no explanation as to why he backed up and had overheard the group in a distance instead of being part of the group.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHh\">\u201cAlso, there would be no explanation from the People\u2019s side as to <em>why he would come forward at this late stage in the proceedings', </em>and alternatively, from the defense side, there would be no explanation for <em>why he would fabricate it at this late stage of the proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AcW\">\u201cSo I think from both sides, both in terms of the People\u2019s efforts to bolster his credibility and the defense efforts to destroy his credibility, it seems to me this is highly relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"AUo\">\u201cThe incident involving his brother, Henry Gardner, <em>it seems to me [the] alleged incident would not be relevant at all, unless the prior incident were admissible, </em>because it is my understanding that Mr. Henry Gardner is going to testify that Mr. Feagin beat him up in the county jail and said allegedly, \u2018your family\u2019s a snitch.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AQW5\">\u201cAnd since this occurred before Mr. Deitric Gardner came forward with the\u2014attributing these statements to Mr. Feagin, there wouldn\u2019t be any explanation for what \u2018your family\u2019s a snitch\u2019 means unless Mr.\u2014the jury knew Mr. Deitric Gardner was going to testify to this alleged act of violence and in a potential penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"AJl\">\u201cI suppose with regard to that incident, perhaps the explanation could just be given that Mr. Deitric Gardner was going to be a witness in the penalty phase, but that would leave all sorts of speculation which might even be worse than the actual incident itself.</p>\n<p id=\"AFki\">\n<em>\u201cAnd furthermore, it also seems to me that the defense also would not be able to show bias and prejudice in general without this testimony because, as Mr. Atkinson correctly pointed out, Mr. Deitric Gardner in fact on page 119 denied that he disliked Mr. Feagin or that he had anything against Mr. Feagin or that he had any motive to see him locked up for as long as possible.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aj4g\">\u201cAnd I agree with Mr. Atkinson, <em>I don\u2019t agree that it would be either appropriate or feasible for the court to instruct the jury he is bias </em>[sic].</p>\n<p id=\"A9b\">\u201cFirst of all, the court always tells the jury that it is up to them to decide what the facts are and it is not up to the court to tell them who to believe and who not to believe, and if the court were to do so, <em>they would have no way of knowing how much weight to put on an instruction that Mr. Deitric Gardner is bias </em>[sic] <em>if they did not know what exactly it entailed or how to weigh and evaluate it. </em>So it seems to me it is highly relevant from all three sides, both from the People\u2019s side, from Mr. Feagin\u2019s side and from Mr. Ross\u2019 side that it is highly relevant, and in light of that, <em>I do believe it is so highly relevant that its relevancy far outweighs any prejudicial impact to Mr. Feagin.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-9\"> \u201cJudge Stoltz: It has been made clear to me in our deliberations that one juror, Kathy Perdue, does not feel comfortable following the jury instructions. I feel her decision is based on emotions and not on what the evidence tells her. She has admitted to this, and on two occasions has said that her mind was made up before certain issues were even discussed. I think this is a matter for your consideration. Thank you. Jean Gunn.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b761-10\"> \u201cYour Honor, I have a major problem with the deliberations. The other jurors are doing everything possible to assume guilt without giving the defendants the benefit of the doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">\u201cFrom the beginning of the trial I have overheard statements regarding the proceedings that have not been favorable toward the attorneys and the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"A3r\">\u201cBecause of this, I feel the deliberation process will not conclude to a verdict. I am concerned with the honesty of all the witnesses, which leaves me with 11 people with whom I cannot sway to consider any other alternatives besides the guilt of the defendants. I am concerned with the preconceived notions on the part of the other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"Alg\">\u201cI am really concerned with racial prejudice directly related to the jurors\u2019 opinions toward the defendants and their attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"An_W\">\u201cSigned, Kathy Perdue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> \u201cThe Court: Okay.

Well, it seems to me it would be very unfortunate and unproductive to have the attorneys in an adversary relationship with the jurors cross-examining them about their statements, and I think that that would be unwise and unproductive. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the court is\u2014first of all, I think this is also\u2014I still feel and I thought from the beginning, I still feel that it\u2019s more appropriate to handle this back in chambers, that is not something that would be helpful to see reported in the press as to\u2014we have gotten into very intimate details of the jury deliberations, which normally the court and attorneys are not privy to, and I think this is something which would be inappropriate to have in open court available to the public at this particular point in time where there may be articles criticizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>the jury deliberation or how certain jurors have acted, and I think that would be very unfortunate if that were to occur at this stage of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\"> \u201c[The Court:] I am making a finding of fact at this time that Kathy Perdue is evaluating the evidence based on her emotions and not on a rational analysis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A35\">\u201cThat she came in with a bias against police officers, and that she would not believe any member of the Los Angeles Police Department if it pertained to a statement or situation having to do with a Black person that is. That she was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"Afk\">\u201cThat she is unwilling and unable to participate in meaningful deliberations with the other jurors, and that further instructions to her at this time would not be productive.</p>\n<p id=\"ALy1\">\u201cThe other jurors have already read the instructions to her several times in an attempt to persuade her to participate in meaningful deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay_\">\u201cAlthough it helped on a temporary basis, she finally admitted that she was going to follow her emotions, and even if she intellectually believed a fact, if her emotions told her otherwise, she would not vote according to her intellectual analysis of the situation. But would vote according to her heart.</p>\n<p id=\"AB6\">\u201cI think that either one of those grounds either the prejudice or the inability to participate in meaningful jury deliberations either one by themselves would be good cause to remove her as a juror. I am going to remove her as a juror. <em>(t</em></p>\n<p id=\"A68X\">\u201c[The Court:] Now, Kathy Perdue denied these allegations. But I do not find her denials credible. I think they were self-serving and made simply to put herself in a better light.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b763-17\"> The court excused Juror Soloman for prejudging evidence and Juror Lelong for his inability to follow instructions particularly related to his looking up the term \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d There was no objection to excusing either of these jurors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> Based upon the information from the first four jurors alone, there was substantial evidence to justify removing Juror Perdue. The remaining eight jurors were then interviewed in camera over the defense objection.
