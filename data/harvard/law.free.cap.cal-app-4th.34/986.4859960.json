In support of the motion, plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>counsel submitted a declaration stating that plaintiff\u2019s ill health and other personal problems were the primary reasons for not complying with the order. The trial court found that those reasons did not constitute excusable neglect and tentatively decided to deny the motion. However, plaintiff\u2019s counsel then filed a supplemental declaration stating, contrary to the previous one, that the violation of the order was primarily his own fault. The trial court vacated the dismissal based on counsel\u2019s supplemental declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">On appeal, defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the dismissal. We agree and accordingly reverse the order vacating the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">On October 10, 1990, approximately two days before the statute of limitations would have run, plaintiff filed her \u201cslip and fall\u201d action against defendant Thrifty Corporation (Thrifty). She waited nearly two more years before serving the complaint. Thrifty promptly filed an answer. On September 3, 1992, Thrifty served plaintiff with a set of interrogatories, a document demand, and a request for a statement of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s responses to these discovery requests were due by early October 1992. Nevertheless, six months later, in April 1993, plaintiff still had not responded to the discovery, despite Thrifty\u2019s inquiry into the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">On April 27, 1993, Thrifty filed and served a motion to compel. Plaintiff did not oppose the motion and did not appear at the hearing. On May 26, 1993, the trial court granted the motion and ordered plaintiff to provide discovery responses within 20 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Although plaintiff received notice of the court\u2019s ruling, she did not comply with the order in any respect. Thus, on July 9, 1993, Thrifty served plaintiff with a motion to dismiss the action based on her failure to comply with the court\u2019s order. The motion was filed with the court on July 13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff did not oppose the motion to dismiss and did not appear at the hearing. On August 20, 1993, the trial court dismissed the action. Notice of dismissal was sent to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">On September 7, 1993, plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. A supporting declaration from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s counsel explained plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with Thrifty\u2019s discovery requests and the court\u2019s order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">\u201c4. In September, 1992, defendants propounded discovery on this attorney, and documents were sent by me to plaintiff[] for response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">\u201c5. Due to reasons of ill health of plaintiff and her husband, and other family and business emergencies of plaintiff, the discovery was not immediately researched and responded to, and I did not adequately track the timing for response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">\u201c6. Upon being reminded by defendant\u2019s attorneys that information was due from plaintiff, I contacted my clients to ascertain their problems in responding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">\u201c7. Ultimately, [i]n early 1993, defendant\u2019s counsel sought and obtained an order compelling response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">\u201c8. Due to the continuing ill health of plaintiff and her husband, and other family and business emergencies of plaintiff, the discovery was not immediately researched and responded to, and I did not adequately track the timing for response.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The declaration also explained the failure of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to attend the August 20 hearing on Thrifty\u2019s motion to dismiss: \u201cIn the present case my client\u2019s illness and other business and family problems caused an initial delay, but my having miscalendared the date for defendant\u2019s motion . . . resulted in my missing the hearing date of August 20, 1993.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Thrifty filed an opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate, and the matter was heard on October 19, 1993. At the hearing, plaintiff\u2019s counsel again emphasized that his client\u2019s personal problems caused the failure to comply with the discovery requests and the court\u2019s order: \u201cI am dealing with a plaintiff who has been severely incapacitated, who has had personal family health problems and family tragedies and business problems\u2014only some of which spring from the accident, but all of which lent themselves to not getting the information in time from the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">The court indicated that its tentative ruling was to deny the motion to vacate because plaintiff\u2019s evidence (i.e., her attorney\u2019s declaration) failed to establish that plaintiff\u2019s \u201chealth was in such a precarious condition that [s]he could not cooperate with you in responding to interrogatories.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>The court then suggested another option available to plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2014 that he file an \u201cattorney declaration of fault\u201d claiming that his own mistakes, not his client\u2019s personal problems, had caused plaintiff to violate the discovery statutes and the court\u2019s order. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel agreed to file such a declaration. The court postponed ruling on the motion to vacate and scheduled another hearing on the matter for November 19, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The day before the second hearing, plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a supplemental declaration in which he personally accepted blame for plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with Thrifty\u2019s discovery requests and the court\u2019s order. For example, the new declaration, unlike the first one, contained the following statements: \u201cI did not provide a level of counsel and support to my client that I would expect to receive if I were a client. [U . . . I ask that my client not be held responsible for decisions of a legal nature which she retained me to make.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By minute order dated November 19, 1993, the court granted plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Thrifty timely appealed from the order vacating the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">On appeal, Thrifty contends that the trial court erred in vacating the dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s case. We review that decision for an abuse of discretion.  \u201c[T]he term judicial discretion implies absence of arbitrary determination, capricious disposition, or whimsical thinking. It imports the exercise of discriminating judgment within the bounds of reason. To exercise the power of judicial discretion, all the material facts must be known and considered, together also with the legal principles essential to an informed, intelligent and just decision. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Deyo </em>v. <em>Kilbourne </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 796 [149 Cal.Rptr. 499].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe court may . . . relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. . . . Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief ... is accompanied by an attorney\u2019s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>or neglect, vacate any . . . resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney\u2019s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The first portion of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, providing that the court \u201cmay\u201d relieve a party from a dismissal, vests the trial court with the discretion to vacate a dismissal based on a party\u2019s or attorney\u2019s excusable neglect. Here, the trial court found that plaintiff\u2019s motion did not satisfy the excusable neglect standard; the evidence did not establish that plaintiff\u2019s poor health or other personal problems justified the violation of the discovery statutes or the court\u2019s order. Thrifty plainly does not take issue with this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The second portion of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, concerning the attorney affidavit of fault, is mandatory in nature: \u201cWhen a default [or dismissal] is the attorney\u2019s fault the court must grant a timely noticed motion for relief. The only limitation is when the court finds [that] the default [or dismissal] was not in fact the attorney\u2019s fault, for example when the attorney is simply covering up for the client. . . .\u201d <em>(Rogalski </em>v. <em>Nabers Cadillac </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 816, 821 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 286], citation omitted.) Thus, \u201c[t]he court must also find that the default [or dismissal] was actually caused by the attorney\u2019s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. . . .\u201d <em>(Billings </em>v. <em>Health Plan of America, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d 250 at p. 256, citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In this case, the evidence filed simultaneously with the motion to vacate the dismissal (i.e., the first declaration of plaintiff\u2019s counsel) was to the effect that the failure to comply with discovery obligations and the court\u2019s order was attributable primarily to plaintiff\u2019s personal problems. Although a calendaring error caused plaintiff\u2019s counsel to miss the hearing on Thrifty\u2019s motion to dismiss, we find no basis for concluding that his presence would have altered the outcome.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, to the extent plaintiff\u2019s counsel made any mistakes, in calendaring the hearing or otherwise, they did not \u201cactually cause\u201d the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Further, the evidence filed the day before the second hearing on the motion to vacate (i.e., the supplemental declaration of plaintiff\u2019s counsel) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>was, in the words of <em>Rogalski </em>v. <em>Nabers Cadillac, supra, </em>\u201cthe attorney . . . covering up for the client.\u201d (11 Cal.App.4th at p. 821.) Having attributed the dismissal to plaintiff\u2019s personal problems at the first hearing, counsel could not thereafter attempt to change the facts and blame himself. (Cf. <em>Hoover Community Hotel Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Thomson </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1130, 1141-1142 [213 Cal.Rptr. 750] [in summary judgment context, declarant\u2019s prior statement is binding despite subsequent conflicting statement; prior statement destroys all credibility of subsequent statement].) The trial court should have disregarded counsel\u2019s supplemental declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Because plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s mistakes, if any, did not cause the dismissal of the lawsuit, the trial court abused its discretion in vacating the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The order vacating the dismissal is reversed, and the trial court is directed to reinstate the order of dismissal. Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Spencer, P. J., and Vogel (Miriam A.), J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"> The hearing on the motion was originally scheduled for August 3 but was subsequently changed to August 20. On July 16, over a month before the new hearing date, Thrifty served plaintiff with a notice indicating that the hearing date had been changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-13\"> Plaintiff\u2019s counsel mistakenly calendared the hearing for <em>September </em>20, a month late.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> The supplemental declaration does not indicate the precise nature of counsel\u2019s alleged mistakes. Apparently, he claims that he should not have accepted his client\u2019s own word about her medical condition but should have had a medical expert determine if she was capable of responding to Thrifty\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\"> The order vacating the dismissal is appealable. <em>(Billings </em>v. <em>Health Plan of America </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 250, 253, fn. 1 [275 Cal.Rptr. 80].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> As of the August 20 hearing, plaintiff\u2019s discovery responses were 10 months overdue under the deadlines imposed by the original requests and were 2 months late under the court\u2019s order. Moreover, even if plaintiff had filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss, we can only assume that she would have made the same argument as on her later motion to vacate the dismissal: her personal problems prevented compliance with the discovery statutes and the court\u2019s order. Of course, the trial court found that explanation insufficient in ruling on the motion to vacate; the argument would have been equally unavailing if made in opposing the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
