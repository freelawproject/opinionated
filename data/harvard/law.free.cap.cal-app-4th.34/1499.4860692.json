Within 36 hours Bonset Soun had been identified as the gunman, had given a detailed confession, and had directed police to the rifle he had used. Soun was found guilty of first degree murder in the attempted commission of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i)) and two other felonies, and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. On appeal Soun does not question the sufficiency of the evidence admitted at trial to prove that he killed Khun. He argues;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-10\">(1) That the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress much of the evidence against him on the ground that the procedures by which he was detained or arrested were illegal and that the evidence had been the fruit of the illegality;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-11\">(2) That the trial court erroneously excluded proffered evidence that his motive to kill Khun had been something other than robbery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-12\">(3) That his self-incriminatory statement to a juvenile hall counselor should have been excluded on the ground it had been elicited in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1506\">*1506</page-number>(4) That the trial court erroneously refused to conduct a second hearing as to whether Soun was under the age of 18 years when he killed Khun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">We have concluded that none of Soun\u2019s assertions warrants reversal and that the judgment of conviction should be affirmed. We shall publish only our discussion of Soun\u2019s first assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The basic facts are essentially undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Soun (a young Cambodian) and five other Asian youths drove from Oakland to San Jose, on Saturday morning, in response to an acquaintance\u2019s request that they rob a gambling establishment for him. Their vehicle was a blue 1981 Toyota two-door sedan owned by one of Soun\u2019s confederates. Soun owned a rifle, and took it with him in the Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Once in San Jose, the six learned that the gambling establishment would not be a feasible robbery target and shifted their attention to Khun\u2019s video shop. They parked near the video shop and \u201ccased\u201d it, by entering the shop and asking Khun (also a Cambodian) if he had videotapes of a specified kind while looking for such details as whether the shop had surveillance cameras. A short time later, about 3:30 Saturday afternoon, Soun and three of his confederates reentered the store while the other two remained outside to serve as lookout and driver. Soun had loaded his rifle and took it with him into the shop; he later explained to police that he needed to be ready to shoot the shopkeeper should the shopkeeper have a gun of his own. Khun did not have a gun. The four youths demanded Khun\u2019s jewelry and money; when Khun professed reluctance and perhaps skepticism, Soun shot Khun three times in the chest. The four then ran from the shop, apparently without taking anything, and the six left the area in the blue Toyota. Soun initially rode in the trunk of the Toyota; on the freeway en route back to Oakland the driver stopped and Soun moved to the passenger compartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">By shortly before noon Sunday, July 8, 1990, Oakland police had found the blue Toyota, parked on an Oakland street, and were watching it. Within a few minutes Soun and his five confederates entered the car and began to drive away. They were stopped by Oakland police; San Jose police conducted interrogations, obtained detailed confessions from Soun and several of his confederates, collected additional evidence including the murder weapon, and filed charges against all six.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Several days later, while Soun was being held in juvenile hall, he told a counselor that \u201che was here for killing somebody, and that he had done it for a friend who needed money for a car . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1507\">*1507</page-number>The juvenile court subsequently determined that Soun had been an adult at the time he killed Khun. Three of Soun\u2019s five confederates were minors, who ultimately admitted the truth of Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petitions filed against them in juvenile court; the other two pled guilty in adult criminal proceedings. Only Soun went to trial. The prosecutor elected not to seek the death penalty. A jury found Soun guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery, attempted robbery, and first degree murder in the commission of attempted robbery, with enhancements for personal use of a firearm. Soun appeals from the ensuing judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\n<em>The Apprehension</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Soun argues that in seizing his person, transporting him to police headquarters, and holding him there for several hours the police violated the Fourth Amendment, that the violation tainted significant prosecution evidence assertedly attributable thereto, and that under the case law all such evidence should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Soun first moved to suppress the evidence, under Penal Code section 1538.5, during the preliminary examination. The magistrate denied Soun\u2019s motion. Soun renewed his motion in the trial court, which denied Soun\u2019s motion to present evidence in addition to the preliminary examination transcript. (Cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5, subd. (i).) The renewed suppression motion was submitted on the transcript alone, and the trial court denied the motion.  In this court we review the magistrate\u2019s explicit or implicit factual findings directly, to determine whether the findings were supported by substantial evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramsey </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 671, 679 [250 Cal.Rptr. 309]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 203, 214 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 657]); we then exercise our independent judgment to determine whether, on the facts found, the seizure of Soun\u2019s person was unreasonable within the meaning of the Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leyba </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 591, 597 [174 Cal.Rptr. 867, 629 P.2d 961]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramsey, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 679.)</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">So far as relevant to Soun\u2019s Fourth Amendment argument, the preliminary examination transcript reflects the following evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Khun\u2019s video store faced Fair Avenue near its intersection with McLaughlin Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">A witness named Hailu was working at a liquor store, on McLaughlin around the comer from the video store, on Saturday afternoon. At some time after 3 p.m. Hailu noticed a two-door blue \u201cJapanese\u201d car, with five to six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1508\">*1508</page-number>male people associated with it, parked in an unusual way in the liquor store\u2019s parking area: the car was backed against the fence between the liquor store and the video store. When Hailu saw the car its trunk was open and all of the five or six people were standing around the trunk. Hailu was \u201c80 percent sure they were Cambodians; 100 percent sure they were Asians.\u201d Hailu was concerned that they might have stolen property, or in any event that \u201csomething wrong was going on.\u201d As Hailu looked out, they closed the trunk. He yelled to them to \u201cleave the parking lot,\u201d and they got into the car and drove off to the left, toward Fair. Later in the day Hailu was interviewed by the police detectives assigned to the homicide investigation, Sergeants Robinson and Escobar; Hailu acknowledged that he may have told them he saw only three or four males get out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">A witness named Alcontar was driving his car on Fair, and had stopped at McLaughlin, at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday. Alcontar heard what he characterized as \u201ctwo gunshots,\u201d or possibly three, from his right. He looked to his right and saw \u201cfive kids,\u201d whom he described as Asian and probably Vietnamese males between twelve and eighteen years of age, running from the area of the video store toward a car parked near Fair. Alcontar believed he saw the \u201ckids\u201d carrying two weapons, one of which he described a \u201cshort and square\u201d automatic weapon and the other as a rifle. He also testified he saw \u201cone for sure,\u201d and that it was the rifle, carried by what appeared to be the oldest and second-tallest of the \u201ckids.\u201d Alcontar testified that the car\u2019s doors and trunk were open, and that he saw another person standing near the car. The \u201ckids\u201d got into the car which drove off away from Alcontar, and from McLaughlin, along Fair. Alcontar made his intended left turn on McLaughlin and continued toward his destination; the car he had seen apparently went around one or more blocks and pulled in ahead of Alcontar on McLaughlin. The two cars proceeded together to Story Road and then along Story Road to the point at which it intersects Highway 101. Along the way Alcontar seized a piece of paper and a pencil and wrote down the car\u2019s license number: he was confident of the first part of the number but not of the order of the last three digits. The number he wrote down was 1RCS525; it was the 525 of which he was unsure. Alcontar told the police that the car was maroonish or reddish in color. He testified at preliminary examination that the car was dirty and that it was \u201ca short, a little, small foreign car\u201d which \u201ccould have been an either Toyota or something small and square.\u201d He acknowledged he told the police it was a two-door car. The car, with what appeared to Alcontar to be five occupants, turned on the ramp to northbound Highway 101, which intersects Highway 880, the principal route from that area to Oakland, a short distance farther north. Alcontar continued on Story Road. Alcontar was interviewed by Sergeants Robinson and Escobar later that day, gave them the number he had written down, and told them the last three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1509\">*1509</page-number>digits could have been \u201c583 or something like that.\u201d Alcontar also told them that one or two of the \u201ckids\u201d had worn baseball caps \u201con backwards\u201d and that one of the caps was \u201cred . . . , possibly a 49er type.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">A witness named Kim was at work at a market on Fair, next door to the video store, on Saturday afternoon. About 3:30 p.m. he heard \u201ctwo loud noises.\u201d He looked outside and saw \u201cthree to four, four to five\u201d Asian males running from the area of the video store toward the comer of the parking area. The Asians appeared to be 18 to 20 years old, and one of them was carrying a gun. When he saw the gun, Kim ran to the video store, where he saw the owner lying on his back behind the counter, shot in the chest. Kim went back to his store and called 911; he was told the police had already been called, and in fact they arrived while he was on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">A witness named Durgin was at the Alano Club, on Fair beyond the market from the video store, on Saturday afternoon. He heard what he described as \u201cfour hammers or four pounds with a hammer,\u201d which were \u201cvery hard sounds.\u201d Initially he \u201chad no idea it was gunfire.\u201d He went to a window and saw four men taking a diagonal path across a parking lot from the area of the video store and market toward an opening between two fences, one of which separated the Alano Club from the market and the other of which paralleled Fair. It was Durgin\u2019s impression that the men were not running but \u201ckind of walking with a purpose or direction or a goal.\u201d Durgin could see a car beyond the fence which paralleled Fair and backed up to it; he believed the car was blue. The men \u201clooked like Mexican, but they were Oriental. [*fl] . . . [f] [Tjheir skin color wasn\u2019t what I expected from Oriental and their eyes weren\u2019t what I expected from Mexicans.\u201d According to Durgin, the tallest of the men\u2014he appeared to Durgin to be \u201creal\u201d or \u201cinordinately\u201d tall\u2014was carrying \u201cwhat looked like a pump-action type weapon of some kind.\u201d The same man was wearing \u201ca black or navy blue type baseball cap, kind of reminded me of the Oakland Raider\u2019s cap.\u201d The other three men were shorter, including \u201ca real tiny, tiny guy in the back.\u201d It was Durgin\u2019s impression that the men put something in the car trunk before they drove away. He did not get a license plate number. Durgin reported his observations to the police within a few minutes after he made them. At preliminary examination he acknowledged that he may have told the officers he believed the car was a Volvo \u201cor that type of car, little runny cars, . . . little dinky cars.\u201d \u201c[J]ust a boxy type of car . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">A San Jose police officer named Helder was the first officer to reach the scene; he heard the call at 3:42 p.m. As he arrived at the video store he noticed two individuals standing outside, one of whom handed Helder a piece of cardboard on which was written a partial license number 1RC_538 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1510\">*1510</page-number>and the words \u201cblue car, four people, young.\u201d By approximately 3:50 p.m. Helder had broadcast this information, together with his observations that there appeared to have been a robbery and that the victim was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">A witness named Crown testified that about 3:50 p.m. on Saturday he had been on the exit ramp from northbound Highway 101 to northbound 880, the route to Oakland from that area, when he saw a blue Toyota Cressida or Camry parked on the side of the ramp. \u201c[I]t was a four-door, and the back door was open. HQ And there was an individual with a large, what I believed to be a semi-automatic rifle in his hands running around toward the rear of the car on the passenger side.\u201d Crown saw at least two other people in the car. All of the people he saw were male Asians. Crown was unable to get a license plate number. He reported what he had seen to the highway patrol; San Jose police contacted him shortly thereafter and he discussed the case with them, telling them among other things that the individual with the gun had been about 5 feet 10 inches tall and in his 20\u2019s or younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">At San Jose police headquarters an officer named Kranich was on duty on Saturday; one of his duties was to monitor the computer system. As the information we have summarized was received, it was forwarded to Kranich\u2019s computer terminal. Kranich noticed the physical descriptions and the variations in license plate numbers reported by witnesses. Moving to a computer terminal with access to the Department of Motor Vehicles database of vehicle license plate numbers, Kranich ran the numbers as reported. Having received no match consistent with the described vehicle, Kranich \u201cdecided to begin trying some combinations, variations on the plate number reported by the witnesses to see if I could find a better match.\u201d He began to enter variations of the three reported license plate numbers of which he was then aware: 1RC_538, 1RCS585, and 1RCS525. He perceived that there was no conflict among the versions as to the letters RCS; he concentrated on the last three numeric characters. Concluding that 5\u2019s and 8\u2019s predominated, and attempting to allow for the impact of a \u201chuman emotion factor\u201d on \u201cvisual perception,\u201d Kranich decided to try various combinations of numeric characters 5 and 8. On about the fifth or sixth combination which the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) computer could link to a registered vehicle, Kranich got a 1981 Toyota registered to one Chantha Nhim at an address on Martin Luther King Way in Oakland. Vehicle color is not included in DMV computer records. Kranich knew from his own experience that the area in which Khun had been killed had a large Cambodian and Vietnamese population. The matchups of vehicle type and a surname which was \u201cpossibly of that same ethnic group,\u201d together with an address in Oakland toward which the vehicle had inferably been headed at last report, led Kranich to consider this \u201ca very likely candidate for further investigation\u201d; none of his other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>combinations, including at least one additional combination which he ran after he got his \u201cvery likely candidate,\u201d had returned a vehicle \u201cthat was close to the make and model reported by the witnesses.\u201d Kranich acknowledged at preliminary examination that he did not undertake to assure that he had exhausted all possible combinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The combination that had matched Nhim\u2019s vehicle was 1RCS558. San Jose police put this number, with the DMV description and Nhim\u2019s name and address, on police computers at 4:40 p.m. Saturday, adding a notation to the effect that the identification was not yet firm. This communication was subsequently referred to as an \u201call points bulletin\u201d or APB.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">A police lieutenant named Seaman was the on-call officer in the San Jose police bureau of investigations on Saturday afternoon. He was called at home, went to the scene of the killing, and then went to the police department homicide unit where he arrived about 6 p.m. At that time Seaman received copies of the police computer printouts including the APB. About 6:30 p.m. Seaman called witness Crown and discussed what Crown had seen on the Highway 880 on-ramp. Although Crown believed the car he had seen was a blue Toyota, which corresponded with some other witnesses\u2019 descriptions of the car at the murder site, Crown also said that the Toyota was a late model (1989 or 1990), was a Cressida or a Camry, and had four doors. Nevertheless Seaman believed this might have been the car other witnesses had seen at the murder site, and that it might indeed have been headed toward Oakland. From DMV records Seaman was able to determine that Nhim\u2019s Toyota was the model known as a Corolla.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Seaman then called the Oakland police watch commander, a lieutenant named Williams. Seaman testified at preliminary examination that \u201cI wanted to ask them to help us by going by the address of which the vehicle was registered to see if the vehicle was there so that we could determine whether it is in fact involved. [*U . . . tU I told him that our department had an investigation going, that, on a homicide that had just occurred, where several Vietnamese or Asian males had gone into a store and shot a man, and that \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [H \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HD [tjhey were seen leaving the scene in a blue Toyota, and that another witness had told me it was seen on the on-ramp to northbound Highway 880, with a possible rifle, and I asked him if he would have a patrol unit go by the residence and tell me if the vehicle was there and to contact me if they did find the vehicle . . . .\u201d Seaman\u2019s intent was to follow up from San Jose if the vehicle was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Williams promptly sent officers to the address on Martin Luther King; they did not find the described vehicle. Then Williams wrote the following \u201cInteroffice Letter,\u201d dated on Saturday, to other watch commanders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1512\">*1512</page-number>\u201cSubject: 187 Suspects and Vehicle/Re: San Jose P.D. Homicide Case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\">\u201cInformation from Lt. Seaman (S.J.P.D.-Homicide):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">\u201cAt 1540 hrs. [Saturday], six male Vietnamese or male Orientals drove to a residence in San Jose, walked into the complaintant\u2019s house and shot him six times in the chest with a rifle. It is believed that the rifle used was a semi-automatic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">\u201cShortly after the shooting, a 1981 Toyota, possible license of 1RCS558 (unsure of numbers), headed N/B on 880 freeway from the 101 exchange in San Jose. Possible vehicle is registered to NHIN [sic], Chantha of 1925 Martin Luther King Way, Oakland. That address and sur[r]ounding area was checked for suspect vehicle by Third Watch officers with negative results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">\u201cLt. Seaman can be contacted at (408) 277-5283 until 2400 hrs. on [Saturday] and would like to be notified if the vehicle is in Oakland (requests that units take no action).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">During Saturday evening San Jose police received a statement from a witness who believed the vehicle had been \u201cmaroonish\u201d and was a 1978 or 1979 Datsun 200SX.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Between 10 and 11 a.m. Sunday, an Oakland police sergeant named Sargent read Williams\u2019s letter to traffic division shift officers, including a motorcycle officer named Chew. Chew took a copy of the letter with him on patrol.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">At approximately 11:40 a.m. Sunday Chew drove past the Martin Luther King Way address and saw the 1981 Toyota with plate number 1RCS558. The car was blue. Chew reported his discovery to Oakland police dispatch, asked that Sargent make a telephone call to San Jose police, and then took up a position from which he could watch the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Sargent immediately called San Jose to talk to Seaman; the call was ultimately diverted to Sergeant Robinson who \\yas not contacted until 11:55 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Meanwhile, at approximately 11:50 a.m., Chew saw three or more Vietnamese or Southeast Asian males come from the area of Nhim\u2019s address and get into the Toyota. Chew radioed to the dispatcher that \u201cI\u2019m gonna need some units out here, this 187 vehicle is about to roll.\u201d The Toyota pulled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>away from the curb and traveled along Martin Luther King Way past Chew\u2019s position; Chew, who was in police uniform, followed it, and occupants of the Toyota turned to look at him. The Toyota then made several right turns, ultimately returning to and continuing past its point of origin on Martin Luther King Way. Meanwhile several police units had responded to Chew\u2019s call.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">At approximately 11:52 a.m., while Chew was following the Toyota, Sargent asked the dispatcher to tell Chew \u201con the air to make it a traffic stop, only, if they make a stop.\u201d In subsequent testimony Sargent explained that he had in mind the distinction between a car stop for a perceived traffic violation, using lights and siren only and with no more than one backup vehicle, and a full-scale felony car stop with multiple police vehicles, guns drawn, and other procedures calculated to control a potentially dangerous situation. Sargent\u2019s concern, as he explained it, was that a full-scale felony stop would create traffic dangers and unnecessarily exacerbate a situation in which he did not yet have an indication of what San Jose wanted done.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The dispatcher agreed to forward Sargent\u2019s message but it appears that Chew did not receive it (and it is not clear that it was transmitted) before the Toyota was stopped. In any event Chew had decided upon, and by 11:55 a.m. he and his backup officers had executed, a full felony stop: they stopped the Toyota and, with guns drawn, ordered all of the occupants to get out of the car and to lie prone on the street where they were briefly pat-searched and then handcuffed. The stop involved several police officers and vehicles, and essentially closed Martin Luther King Way to other traffic. There were six young Asian males, including Nhim and Soun, in the Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">San Jose police dispatch first contacted Sergeant Robinson, at home, at 11:55 a.m., as the Oakland officers were completing the stop of the Toyota. The dispatcher told Sergeant Robinson that \u201cOakland had a car stopped relating to our homicide\u201d and asked permission to release Sergeant Robinson\u2019s home telephone number so that Oakland could call him directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">An Oakland patrol sergeant named Fenton had responded to Chew\u2019s radio call for units; he arrived at the scene after the Toyota was stopped. When all six subjects had been handcuffed and placed in individual patrol cars, Fenton directed that the cars be moved to a nearby parking lot to wait for further instructions. Fenton then went to police headquarters, a short distance away, to find out what San Jose wanted done.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Between noon and 12:35 p.m., Sergeant Robinson and Fenton spoke twice by telephone. Sergeant Robinson wanted Fenton to describe, and to try to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>identify, the subjects. Based on Fenton\u2019s descriptions, Sergeant Robinson concluded that Oakland police had in fact found the perpetrators of the San Jose murder. Sergeant Robinson asked Fenton to move the six subjects to Oakland police headquarters, with their consent if possible or by arrest if necessary, to wait for Sergeant Robinson and his partner to arrive from San Jose.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">At approximately 12:37 p.m. the six subjects were moved to the homicide unit at Oakland police headquarters. At approximately 1 p.m. all of the subjects other than Soun were locked into separate interview rooms, and Soun was placed in a lieutenant\u2019s office which could not be locked but in which he was handcuffed to a chair. Sergeant Robinson and his partner arrived in the homicide unit at 3 p.m.; at 3:15 p.m. they secured Nhim\u2019s formal consent to a search of the Toyota; after examination of evidence and briefings by Oakland officers they began interrogating the subjects, one by one, at 4:50 p.m. The last interrogation in Oakland was concluded at 2:15 a.m. Monday; Sergeant Robinson and his partner then recovered the murder weapon from the home of one of the subjects. Throughout their stay at the Oakland homicide unit the six subjects were monitored regularly to assure that they were fed, made as comfortable as possible, and allowed to go to the bathroom as necessary. It appears, however, that none of the six subjects was afforded an opportunity to make telephone calls during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">At 4:30 a.m. Monday all the subjects were moved to San Jose.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Having heard this evidence, the magistrate patently concluded that Soun\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights had not been violated. The magistrate appears to have reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">(1) That insofar as the apprehension of Soun and his confederates may have amounted to no more than a temporary <em>detention, </em>it was sufficiently supported by evidence of an objectively reasonable suspicion that the subjects had been involved in criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">(2) That if and insofar as the apprehension may have amounted to an <em>arrest, </em>it was sufficiently supported by evidence of probable cause to arrest the subjects; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-9\">(3) That the subjects had in any event effectively <em>consented </em>to be transported to Oakland police headquarters and to be held there pending interrogation by the San Jose detectives, and thus (in the magistrate\u2019s words) \u201ceverything that comes after that is going to be admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">We agree with the magistrate that the procedures by which Soun and his confederates were taken into custody satisfied the requirements of the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>Amendment. Thus we need reach neither the issue of the subjects\u2019 asserted consent nor the question whether the various evidence Soun sought to suppress was attributable to the procedures by which he was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Any police restraint of the liberty of an individual either by physical force or by an assertion of authority to which the individual submits, in circumstances in which a reasonable person would have believed he or she was not free to leave, will constitute a state \u201cseizure\u201d of the individual within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. (Cf. <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari D. </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 621, 625-628 [113 L.Ed.2d 690, 697-698, 111 S.Ct. 1547]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 180 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521].) Such a seizure is normally characterized as either a \u201cdetention\u201d or an \u201carrest.\u201d <em>(In re James D. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 903, 911-912 [239 Cal.Rptr. 663, 741 P.2d 161]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gentry </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1266 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 742].) The distinction can be significant, inasmuch as the constitutional standard for a permissible <em>detention </em>\u201cis of lesser degree than that applicable to an arrest\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 384, 389 [124 Cal.Rptr. 536, 540 P.2d 632], italics in original): A detention \u201c \u2018may be undertaken by the police \u201cif there is an articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime\u201d . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re James D., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 911, quoting <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d <em>777, </em>784 [195 Cal.Rptr. 671, 670 P.2d 325]), while probable cause for arrest is said to exist only \u201cwhen the facts known to the arresting officer would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person arrested is guilty of a crime.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 410 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 389.) Thus in assessing the constitutional propriety of a seizure of the person it is essential initially to determine whether the seizure was a detention, or was an arrest, or was both a detention and, subsequently, an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The magistrate did not place this initial determination on the record of the preliminary examination, but as an integral part of our review we may infer a determination and assess whether the evidentiary record supports findings essential to that determination. Our review is simplified by the perception that there was no real dispute, on the preliminary examination record, as to most of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Unquestionably Soun and his confederates were seized, in the Fourth Amendment sense, as soon as Chew and his backup officers stopped their car. Soun argues that from that moment he was under arrest, and therefore the seizure was constitutionally permissible only if the officers had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>probable cause to arrest him. The Attorney General argues that at all relevant times the seizure was no more than a detention and thus subject to a lesser constitutional standard. We determine that the record supports a conclusion that Soun and his confederates were initially detained, and that the detention did not evolve into an arrest before the subjects were transported from the parking lot assembly area to Oakland police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">\u201c \u2018Detentions\u2019 \u201d have been summarily defined as \u201c \u2018seizures of an individual which are strictly limited in duration, scope and purpose . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(In re James D., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 911.) The term is often qualified by adjectives such as \u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201cinvestigative,\u201d but the terms are by no means self-executing: \u201cDetentions may be \u2018investigative\u2019 yet violative of the Fourth Amendment absent probable cause. In the name of investigating a person who is no more than suspected of criminal activity, the police may not carry out a full search of the person or of his automobile or other effects. Nor may the police seek to verify their suspicions by means that approach the conditions of arrest.\u201d <em>(Florida </em>v. <em>Royer </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 491, 499 [75 L.Ed.2d 229, 237, 103 S.Ct. 1319]; cf. <em>In re Dung T. </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 697, 714 [206 Cal.Rptr. 772].) Patently the permissible purpose of a detention is to investigate the suspicion of criminal activity on which the detention was predicated: \u201c[T]o permit a speedy, focused investigation to confirm or dispel individualized suspicion of criminal activity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gentry, supra, 7 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1267.)  \u201cA brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or <em>to maintain the status quo momentarily </em>while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 143, 146 [32 L.Ed.2d 612, 617, 92 S.Ct. 1921], italics added; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1, 13 [282 Cal.Rptr. 114].) But \u201c[t]he scope of the detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification, [f] The predicate permitting seizures on suspicion short of probable cause is that law enforcement interests warrant a limited intrusion on the personal security of the suspect. The scope of the intrusion permitted will vary to some extent with the particular facts and circumstances of each case. This much, however, is clear: an investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. Similarly, the investigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion in a short period of time. [Citations.] It is the State\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the seizure it seeks to justify on the basis of a reasonable suspicion was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure.\u201d <em>(Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, supra, </em>460 U.S. at p. 500 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 238]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bowen </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 269, 273 [240 Cal.Rptr. 466]; <em>In re Dung T., supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d at p. 715.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>Soun asserts that the Oakland police action was far too intrusive, and far too protracted, to be regarded as a detention. He points particularly to the evidence that he was removed from the car at gunpoint by a large number of police officers, was forced to lie on the ground, was handcuffed and placed in a patrol car, was transported from the site of the stop a distance of three blocks to a parking lot, and then was held at the parking lot for up to an additional thirty minutes, all without being told why he had been stopped or being permitted to communicate with his confederates.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">None of the evidentiary factors Soun cites would necessarily require a conclusion that Soun had been arrested rather than simply detained.  Courts have, for example, declined in particular circumstances to base a finding of de facto arrest on evidence that the officers stopped the individual at gunpoint <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 899 F.2d 833, 838-839), or required him or her to get out of a car (cf. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms </em>(1977) 434 U.S. 106, 109-111 [54 L.Ed.2d 331, 335-337, 98 S.Ct. 330]) and lie down on the pavement <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Buffington </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 815 F.2d 1292, 1300), or handcuffed him or her <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bowen, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at pp. 272-274; cf. <em>In re Carlos M. </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 372, 385 [269 Cal.Rptr. 447]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Bautista </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 684 F.2d 1286, 1289-1290), or placed him or her in a police car <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Parr </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 843 F.2d 1228, 1231), or transported him or her for legitimate police purposes short of booking or custodial interrogation <em>(In re Carlos M., supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 385; cf. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, supra, </em>460 U.S. at pp. 504-505 [75 L.Ed.2d at p. 241]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 390 [but transportation impermissible in the circumstances of record]), or held him or her for more than a minimal amount of time <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 675, 686-688 [84 L.Ed.2d 605, 615-616, 105 S.Ct. 1568] [20 minutes]; <em>In re Carlos M., supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 384, 385 [30 minutes]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 696, 709-710 [77 L.Ed.2d 110, 122, 103 S.Ct. 2637] [\u201cwe decline to adopt any outside time limitation\u201d (although 90 minutes would be too long in this case)]). \u201c[T]here is no hard and fast line to distinguish permissible investigative detentions from impermissible de facto arrests. Instead, the issue is decided on the facts of each case, with focus on whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation reasonably designed to dispel or confirm their suspicions quickly, using the least intrusive means reasonably available under the circumstances. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Carlos M., supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 384-385; cf. <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Baron </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 860 F.2d 911, 914 [\u201cwe consider the totality of the circumstances\u201d].)  We turn to a consideration of all the circumstances of the Oakland car stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Because the nature of the police officers\u2019 reasonable suspicions was itself a circumstance relevant to our inquiry, it is important to consider, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>outset, what a reasonable officer in the position of Chew and his colleagues would have suspected at the time of the automobile stop. Such a suspicion would have been based on a synthesis of information from two sources: the San Jose police communication (as relayed, with some inaccuracy as to details, by Williams\u2019s interoffice letter) and Chew\u2019s observations at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Williams\u2019s letter furnished all the information Chew had as he went to the field. From it a reasonable police officer would have suspected that, subject to verification of details, the described vehicle had been in some way involved in the shooting or with its perpetrators. Such an officer would also have understood that San Jose police were concerned with verifying the details and wished initially simply to find the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Chew did find the vehicle and, in substantial compliance with the instructions relayed in Williams\u2019s letter, he simply reported the find and initially waited for direction while watching the car from a short distance away.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">For whatever reason, Chew did not receive immediate direction. Approximately 10 minutes later he saw \u201cseveral\u201d (by which he meant \u201cthree or more\u201d) males, who appeared to be Vietnamese or Southeast Asian, come from in front of the address he had been given for Nhim and get into the car, which then pulled away from the curb. This was new information. Williams\u2019s letter had described the suspected assailants but had focused primarily on the car itself; on its face the letter neither contemplated nor provided for the possibility that three or more people who generally resembled the description of the six assailants would be seen using the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Chew\u2019s initial reaction was simply to follow the car while calling for backup police units. As he followed the car he made three additional observations: that there appeared to be <em>six </em>\u201cOriental^ or Vietnamese\u201d males inside the car, a number that exactly matched the reported number of assailants, that the car\u2019s occupants repeatedly looked back at Chew, and that the car made a full circle and passed its point of origin. To a reasonable officer in Chew\u2019s position, these observations would have strengthened a suspicion that the occupants of the car were the assailants described in Williams\u2019s letter, both because the numbers corresponded and because the reactions of its occupants reflected concern at Chew\u2019s presence and a motivation either to evade him or at least to determine whether he was in fact following them.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Chew decided to stop the car. He was \u201cconcerned of the activity going on inside the vehicle, based on the information that I received earlier, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>vehicle may have been involved in a homicide, and that the suspects were described as six Vietnamese male or Oriental males. And it appeared to be six male Orientals or Vietnamese inside the car, and that they were supposedly armed with a semi-automatic rifle, that concerned me. And I\u2014at that time I made the decision to stop and detain the occupants of the car, fearing if I didn\u2019t at that point, there was a possibility of the car fleeing.\u201d He was also concerned that once the car was stopped the occupants might flee on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In all these circumstances we cannot conclude that the means Chew chose to effect the detention elevated the initial detention to the status of a de facto arrest for Fourth Amendment purposes. Chew and his colleagues \u201cwere authorized to take such steps as were reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Hensley </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 221, 235 [83 L.Ed.2d 604, 616, 105 S.Ct. 675].) Chew concluded that to attempt to stop the car by means suitable to a simple traffic infraction\u2014in the prosecutor\u2019s words, \u201cjust pull up alongside and flash your lights and ask them to pull over\u201d\u2014\u201cwould not be technically sound as far as my safety or safety of other officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">We cannot fault Chew for his reasoning, or for proceeding as he did. In our view the initial stop, in the circumstances we have described, met the criterion of using the least intrusive means reasonably available under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Soun argues that even if the initial stop were regarded as a detention, the detention evolved into a de facto arrest when the individuals, seated in separate police cars, were moved three blocks to a parking lot that was known to police and had apparently been used by them, as an assembly area, on previous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">We cannot agree with Soun.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">By this time Fenton had arrived at the stop site. Once the individuals had been placed in separate cars, Chew showed Fenton the Williams letter. It was the first time Fenton had seen the letter; his watch had not been briefed on it. Fenton, a patrol division beat supervisor for that area, then as a practical matter took charge. He wanted to find out what San Jose wanted done, and decided to make his calls from Oakland police headquarters which was no more than five minutes\u2019 travel from the stop site. As he left for police headquarters, within a few minutes after the stop, Fenton directed that the six individuals be moved to the parking lot. Fenton was not asked, and did not volunteer, his reasons for moving the individuals, but another officer offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>reasons wholly consistent with the known circumstances and with common sense: She testified that Fenton \u201cdirected us to move to an assembly point because we were blocking the roadway and there [were] so many cars. [U ... [H It was typical procedure. [H ... PM It had nothing to do with the arrest situation. It was merely for officer\u2019s safety and to clear the roadway.\u201d A three-block transportation to an essentially neutral site for these rational purposes did not operate to elevate Soun\u2019s custodial status from detention to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Finally, Soun argues that the period of time for which he was held at the parking lot was unduly protracted and therefore must in any event be deemed to have amounted to de facto arrest. Again we disagree with Soun. The record reflects that Soun was at the parking lot for approximately 30 minutes. Fenton fully accounted for this period of time, testifying that he went to police headquarters, made initial contact with Sergeant Robinson, realized in conversation with Sergeant Robinson that he would need more exact information concerning the detained individuals, returned to the parking lot where he could obtain the information, again established communication with Sergeant Robinson, and then, as soon as he and Sergeant Robinson had concluded that the individuals should be interrogated, arranged to have the individuals moved to interrogation rooms at police headquarters. In short, Fenton diligently pursued a means of investigation reasonably designed to dispel or confirm his suspicions quickly. (Cf. <em>In re Carlos M., supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at pp. 384-385; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, supra, </em>470 U.S. at pp. 686-688 [84 L.Ed.2d at pp. 615-617].) The detention was no more protracted than was reasonably necessary for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We conclude that from the time the car was stopped until he was transported from the parking lot to police headquarters, Soun was in temporary or investigative detention and not under de facto arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The next question is whether the detention was permissible in the circumstances known to the detaining officers or to the officers who directed that the individual be detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">\u201c \u2018[I]n order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific and articulable facts causing him [her] to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he [she] intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity. Not only must he [she] subjectively entertain such a suspicion, but it must be objectively reasonable for him [her] to do so: the facts must be such as would cause any reasonable police officer in a like position, drawing when appropriate on his [her] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>training and experience [citation], to suspect the same criminal activity and the same involvement by the person in question. The corollary to this rule, of course, is that an investigative stop or detention predicated on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch is unlawful, even though the officer may be acting in complete good faith. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re James D., </em>supra, 43 Cal.3d 903, 914, quoting <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].) It is now clear that a detaining officer who is not personally aware of all the facts on which a reasonable suspicion might be based may nevertheless properly detain an individual on the basis of a direction or information transmitted by police officers who were personally aware of such facts. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Hensley, supra, </em>469 U.S. at pp. 231-232 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 614]; cf. <em>Restani </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d 189, 195-196 [91 Cal.Rptr. 429].)</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Soun argues that any detention effected by Chew and his colleagues in this case was constitutionally invalid for two reasons: first, because for want of witness consensus as to the description of the car or of any direct eyewitness recitation of its 1RCS558 license plate number, there was no sufficient factual basis for a reasonable suspicion of the car and its occupants; and, second, because San Jose police\u2019s Saturday communication to Oakland police did not request a detention or arrest and specifically requested that no action be taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">To the first point, Soun argues that \u201c[w]itness statements as to make, year and color of the robbery getaway car were widely divergent,\u201d that \u201c[t]he license plate number broadcast had not been reported by any witness, and was a number literally created by police,\u201d and that in sum the detention, based in substantial part on the DMV description of Nhim\u2019s car, was impermissibly based on \u201chunches and supposition.\u201d Soun asserts that the method Officer Kranich used \u201cgenerated no more than an investigative lead that should have been pursued by other means,\" and that it was \u201cunreasonable to detain the vehicle or its occupants without further information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Soun\u2019s argument is fatally flawed in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">First, his \u201chunches and supposition\u201d label substantially mischaracterizes intelligent and resourceful police work. This was not a simple case of a bungled theft, which might have lent itself to contemplative investigation as officers could fit it into their schedules: this was a cold-blooded murder, possibly committed with a semiautomatic rifle, which called for urgent investigation and resolution. The very fact that witnesses\u2019 excited perceptions of important details were so divergent might well have stymied the investigation, or at least have substantially delayed it while evidence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>perhaps the perpetrators themselves, were lost, had not the police been willing to apply logic to the divergent accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">A logical approach was made possible by the perceptions that all witnesses\u2019 accounts of the car were essentially consistent in three important respects: There was only one car with (presumably) only one license plate number; the car was a small foreign-made sedan (probably Japanese and possibly a Toyota, although also possibly a Volvo); and the first five characters of the license plate number were 1RCS5.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Once Kranich determined that none of the three reported numbers of which he was aware would provide a match that remotely resembled any of the witness-furnished descriptions, he went to hypothetical combinations of numbers. With only two numeric characters to be filled in, the police had only 100 possible combinations\u20141RCS500 through 1RCS599\u2014to run. Taking note of the predominance of 5\u2019s and 8\u2019s in witnesses\u2019 recollections of the license numbers, and taking account of the visual similarities between 5\u2019s and 8\u2019s, on the one hand, and the 3 (and to a lesser degree the 2) mentioned by separate witnesses, Kranich decided initially to try only combinations of 5\u2019s and 8\u2019s. Soun implies that this approach was \u201chaphazard\u201d but a more rational explanation is that it was a commendable attempt to save time: if Kranich\u2019s visual-similarities hypothesis was valid and his choice of 5\u2019s and 8\u2019s fortuitous, then he would be required to run only four combinations (1RCS555, 1RCS558, 1RCS585, 1RCS588) rather than one hundred; if he found no match he could run more combinations using other numbers. To his credit, Kranich did not limit himself to the last two characters but instead allowed for the possibility that all witnesses had mistaken the first of the final three numeric digits: thus he had eight combinations of 5\u2019s and 8\u2019s\u2014three 5\u2019s, three combinations of two 5\u2019s and an 8, three combinations of two 8\u2019s and a 5, and three 8\u2019s\u2014to run. He ran five or six of the combinations and encountered Nhim\u2019s car, which seemed to him a likely match because (1) it was a Toyota sedan, (2) Nhim\u2019s name sounded Asian and the crime had been committed in a primarily Asian neighborhood, and (3) Nhim\u2019s address was in Oakland and at least one witness had indicated the car was last seen headed in the general direction of Oakland. Kranich ran one more combination; he might have run many more\u2014up to one thousand, to account for all possible combinations of any three numeric characters\u2014 but Nhim\u2019s car was clearly the best match he had found: \u201cNothing else that was coming back at that time . . . was close to the make and model reported by the witnesses\u201d; the other returns \u201cmostly were American make cars . . . .\u201d In Kranich\u2019s own words (and even without hindsight) Nhim\u2019s car \u201cwould be a very likely candidate for . . . further investigation . . . .\u201d It is not clear whether, at this point, Kranich was aware of Crown\u2019s sighting on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number>the Highway 880 on-ramp. Although Crown\u2019s description of the Toyota he saw made it much newer, and of a different body style, than the car registered to Nhim, the sighting of the man with a rifle near the car tended to lend some weight to the assumption that the car involved in the crime was moving toward Oakland.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">That other San Jose officers agreed with Kranich that further investigation was what was called for is reflected in Seaman\u2019s communication to Williams that Oakland officers should simply undertake to locate the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">But this leads to the second flaw in Soun\u2019s argument: Contrary to his implication, Chew <em>had </em>\u201cfurther information\u201d by the time he detained Soun and his confederates. Chew had seen six Asian males in the car, and had observed their apparently self-conscious reactions to his presence. Soun correctly asserts that what Chew saw would not have been sufficient, in isolation, to warrant a detention, but of course Chew was not required to consider the information in isolation: The coincidence with descriptions of the assailants, and the use of a car which was, at least, \u201ca very likely candidate for . . . further investigation,\u201d was sufficient to justify the detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Soun\u2019s second point is, in essence, that the Oakland police had no legitimate business detaining him because the San Jose police had not <em>requested </em>that he be detained (and had, in fact, suggested that no action be taken). The difficulty with this point is similar to one of the difficulties with Soun\u2019s first point: it takes no account of actual events in Oakland on Sunday. Seaman\u2019s request, as relayed by Williams, patently contemplated that the Oakland police might find the <em>car, </em>and that the San Jose police should be permitted to take the investigation from there. But neither Seaman nor Williams could reasonably be understood to have given direction as to what to do if individuals who resembled the descriptions of the perpetrators should be found in juxtaposition with the car. Chew and his colleagues must be credited with a reasonable response to the situation as it actually developed. In any event the question whether the Oakland police did or did not respond to the wishes of the San Jose police would be essentially irrelevant to the dispositive question whether, on the basis of all <em>the, facts </em>known to him on the basis of both the San Jose communiqu\u00e9s and his own observations, Chew could with constitutional propriety seize Soun and his confederates. Unquestionably the answer is yes. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hensley, supra, </em>469 U.S. 221, on which Soun relies for this point, is distinguishable: <em>Hensley </em>is one of the substantial class of cases that demonstrates the principle that a police officer who receives a request or direction, through police channels, to detain named or described individuals may make a constitutionally valid detention, even without personal knowledge of facts sufficient to justify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>detention, so long as the facts known to the police officer or agency that <em>originated </em>the request would be sufficient. Here Chew himself knew facts sufficient to justify the detention; there was no occasion to look for or to rely on a request through police channels that Soun be detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Under our analysis the detention continued for approximately 45 minutes altogether, to the point at which Soun and his confederates were transported from the parking lot to Oakland police headquarters. Despite the diligence of Fenton and other Oakland officers in seeking further information from San Jose, nothing was developed either to confirm or to dispel the officers\u2019 suspicions until near the end of the period, when Sergeant Robinson and Fenton were able to discuss specific physical evidence and descriptions. The fact most of the witnesses in San Jose has described a car which was blue, like Nhim\u2019s, was not known to Chew when he made the stop but became known to Fenton from Sergeant Robinson. Fenton was also able to provide details of physical stature and dress\u2014including a reversed 49er\u2019s baseball cap\u2014which matched the information Sergeant Robinson had obtained from witnesses. By the end of the 45 minutes the officers\u2019 suspicions had been substantially confirmed and Sergeant Robinson had concluded\u2014and Fenton ultimately acknowledged that he agreed\u2014that they had probable cause to arrest all 6 of the occupants of the car for the murder of Khun.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We agree with the conclusion Sergeant Robinson and Fenton reached. To determine whether the facts known to them \u201cwould lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person arrested is guilty of a crime\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 410), we once again look to the totality of the surrounding circumstances and decide the case on its own facts. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Guajardo </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1738, 1742 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 21].) We have cataloged the facts known to the point at which Fenton talked with Sergeant Robinson. Their conversations provided direct comparisons between the information gathered from witnesses in San Jose and Fenton\u2019s observations of the car and its occupants in Oakland. Sergeant Robinson later testified that \u201c[t]he first thing that I noted right away . . . was that there were six suspects in the vehicle, and we had been informed by witnesses at the scene that there had been up to six people involved in the shooting. FU . . . FU I asked Sergeant Fenton if one of the taller individuals might be wearing a red 49\u2019er baseball cap backwards.\u201d A witness had mentioned the cap. Fenton replied that a tall individual was wearing such a cap; in his subsequent testimony Fenton recalled that Sergeant Robinson seemed rather excited by Fenton\u2019s reply. Fenton was also able to affirm for Sergeant Robinson that the six individuals appeared to be Asian. Sergeant Robinson recalled in testimony that \u201c[t]he witnesses at the scene of the shooting described some of the defendants to, as appearing to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>twelve years old in appearance, and others to be as old as eighteen to twenty years old. Sergeant Fenton stated that there was one individual in the car that appeared to be twelve years old ... .\u201d Fenton also told Sergeant Robinson that the vehicle was a metallic blue 1981 Toyota two-door sedan, a description which generally matched that given by several of the witnesses in San Jose.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Sergeant Robinson concluded, and told Fenton, \u201cthat I believed he had all of the suspects responsible for our shooting in San Jose.\u201d Sergeant Robinson therefore asked Fenton \u201cto ask and obtain voluntary consent from the . . . suspects to go to the Oakland Police Department to be fingerprinted and photographed, and wait until we could arrive to contact or make contact with him. [H I then told Sergeant Fenton that if that was not possible, and the suspects stated that they did not wish to do that, that I wanted him to arrest those individuals and transport them to the Oakland Police Department until I could arrive with my partner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Fenton undertook to obtain the voluntary consents Sergeant Robinson had asked him to seek, and testified that all of the individuals consented to be transported. Another officer\u2019s account differed from Fenton\u2019s, and the parties debate whether the evidence of record was sufficient, in the necessarily coercive circumstances at the parking lot, to support the magistrate\u2019s explicit finding that Soun and his confederates in fact consented. We need not resolve the point. Given that in the absence of consent the transportation to a police facility for interrogation would arguably have amounted to a de facto arrest (cf. <em>Dunaway </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 200, 211-213 [60 L.Ed.2d 824, 834, 99 S.Ct. 2248]; cf. also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 391-392), we conclude that at this point the arrest would in any event have been supported by sufficient probable cause. The facts known to the police in this case gave substantially more basis for \u201can honest and strong suspicion that the person arrested is guilty of a crime\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 410) than did the facts in <em>In re Dung T., supra, </em>160 Cal.App.3d 697, on which Soun relies. In <em>Dung T. </em>the perpetrators of a robbery had been described as six Vietnamese males in their early twenties riding in a Dodge automobile; two nights later police stopped a Dodge (which had been positively identified by a witness) which contained <em>eight </em>young Vietnamese males, including the minor, who was then fifteen years old. The Court of Appeal concluded that the officers\u2019 observations had been sufficient to detain but not to arrest: \u201cThe police had no detailed descriptions of the robbers other than their ages and nationalities. There were eight people occupying the car when it was stopped, but only six people were involved in the robbery. Thus at the time of the stop the police did not have probable cause to believe any one of the occupants of the car, including [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>minor], was guilty of the robberies.\u201d (160 Cal.App.3d at p. 713.) In this case the numbers, general ethnic appearance, specific articles of clothing, and ages specific to persons of particular statures all matched, and the stop was effected on the morning following the afternoon killing: the totality of these circumstances far more directly supported an honest and strong suspicion of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The seizure of Soun\u2019s person did not violate the Fourth Amendment.
