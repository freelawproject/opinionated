The superior court denied the gambler relief on other grounds, but we conclude the Board acted properly in excluding him as a convicted bookmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In June 1988, William Opdyk, a self-styled \u201cprofessional gambler,\u201d pleaded nolo contendere to one count of bookmaking, charged as a felony but reduced to a misdemeanor (Pen. Code, \u00a7 337a, subd. (1)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 5, 1991, after successfully completing probation, Opdyk\u2019s motion for ex-pungement (Pen. Code \u00a7 1203.4) was granted. After he was excluded from the simulcast wagering facility at Cal Expo in Sacramento, he requested an administrative hearing: The Board upheld his exclusion. He filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">For three reasons Opdyk suggests his conviction should not be used against him by the Board. First, it was by plea of nolo contendere. Second, it has been expunged. Third, he is now rehabilitated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will address these claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">1. In <em>Cartwright </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 762 [129 Cal.Rptr. 462, 548 P.2d 1134], the Supreme Court held that a conviction by plea of nolo contendere may not be used by a board to impose discipline in the absence of legislative authorization. The Legislature has largely abrogated <em>Cartwright </em>and now provides broad authorization for boards to impose such discipline. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a77.5 [defining conviction to include nolo contendere pleas], 480 [denial of license], 490 [suspension and revocation of license]; further unspecified references are to this code; Stats. 1979, ch. 876, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. pp. 3057-3058. See <em>Arneson </em>v. <em>Fox </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 440, 447 [170 Cal.Rptr. 778, 621 P.2d 817].)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1829\">*1829</page-number>Section 7.5 provides in relevant part: \u201cA conviction within the meaning of this code means <em>... a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere. </em>Any action which a board is permitted to take following the establishment of a conviction may be taken . . . when an order granting probation is made suspending the imposition of sentence, <em>irrespective of a subsequent order under the provisions of Section 1203.4 of the Penal Code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The Board is empowered to adopt rules which \u201cprovide for the exclusion or ejection from any inclosure where horseraces are authorized ... of any known bookmaker . . . [or] person who has been convicted of a violation of . . . any law prohibiting bookmaking[.]\u201d (\u00a7 19572.) The Board has adopted implementing regulations which track the language of section 7.5. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 1420, subd. (f), \u00a7 1980, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The statutes provide a clear legislative authorization to utilize convictions arising upon pleas of nolo contendere, bringing the Board outside of the <em>Cartwright </em>strictures. (See 2 Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Effect of Criminal Conviction on Professional Licenses, \u00a7 47.4, p. 1224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">2. Penal Code section 1203.4 in general terms provides that upon completion of probation a person may have his or her conviction expunged. It has long been held that an expungement of a bookmaking conviction does not relieve a person from the status of \u201cknown bookmaker.\u201d <em>(Epstein </em>v. <em>California Horse Racing Board, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.2d 831, 841.) But more importantly, the expungement statute \u201cwas never intended to obliterate <em>the fact </em>that defendant has been \u2018finally adjudged guilty of a crime.\u2019 ... It merely frees the convicted felon from certain \u2018penalties and disabilities\u2019 of a criminal or like nature.\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 872, 877-878 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 138], citations omitted. See <em>id. </em>at pp. 880-881 [discussing a line of cases which \u201cconsistently upheld denial of a license or the right to pursue a particular profession on the basis of an expunged conviction\u201d].) The Legislature has defined \u201cconviction\u201d to include expunged convictions. (\u00a7 7.5.) Opdyk cites no authority for the proposition that the statute granting the Board the power to exclude convicted bookmakers (\u00a7 19572) uses a definition of \u201cconviction\u201d other than the one provided by section 7.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1830\">*1830</page-number>3. \u201cIf the Board finds that the applicant is within one of the classes of persons who are prohibited from participating in parimutuel wagering and from being present within any racing inclosure, the Board <em>may, in its discretion, </em>make a further finding that the applicant\u2019s presence within the public inclosure would not be against the best interests of horseracing, and an exception should be made authorizing him to participate in parimutuel wagering in the future.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 1986, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">To the extent Opdyk contends his expungement automatically makes him \u201crehabilitated\u201d within the meaning of Board rules he is mistaken. The Board has the discretion to make such a finding, but need not. If the mere fact of expungement compelled the Board to find a person was rehabilitated, the language of section 7.5 regarding expungement orders under Penal Code section 1203.4 would be meaningless: no person whose conviction was expunged could be excluded. To the extent Opdyk contends the Board abused its discretion by <em>not </em>finding him to be \u201crehabilitated,\u201d he is mistaken: The record before the Board showed he continued to enter racing inclosures and gamble (winning substantial sums) despite his ineligibility, and he admitted having others run bets for him on one occasion. This demonstrates that he has flouted the Board\u2019s authority over horse racing and reflects an inability on his part to conform his gambling behavior to legal requirements, including the rules of the Board. Given this evidence, he did not carry his burden to prove he was \u201crehabilitated\u201d and therefore the Board did not abuse its discretion in declining so to find. (See <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>California Horse Racing Board, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.2d at pp. 842-843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">At oral argument Opdyk raised two other issues connected to his argument about rehabilitation. First, he pointed to testimony of two character witnesses. This testimony was not discussed in his brief. Second, he urges the case should be remanded because the Board failed to provide any notice of what standards it applies in making the determination that a person is or is not rehabilitated.  But \u201cA contention made for the first time in an appellant\u2019s reply brief, unaccompanied by any reason for omission from the opening brief, may be disregarded. . . .\u201d <em>(Diamond Springs Lime Co. </em>v. <em>American River Constructors </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 581, 609 [94 Cal.Rptr. 200], citation omitted. See <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1898) 120 Cal. 643, 644 [53 P. 24].) Perforce, issues raised at oral argument come too late.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1831\">*1831</page-number>But we are troubled by the failure of the Board to provide any guidelines determining rehabilitation, <em>vel non. </em>Section 482 commands that \u201cEach board under the provisions of this code shall develop criteria to evaluate the rehabilitation of a person . . . Dozens of boards have complied. (See list following 3A West\u2019s Ann. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code (1990 ed.) \u00a7 482, pp. 114-115.) If the State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind, the Office of Real Estate Appraisers and nearly 40 other agencies can formulate rehabilitation guidelines (Cal. Code, Regs., tit. 16, \u00a7 2291; <em>id,,, </em>tit. 10, \u00a7 3552), why can\u2019t the Horse Racing Board? We urge the Board to consider this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Blease, Acting P. J., and Raye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 22, 1995.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\"> Penal Code section 337a provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person, [\u25a0][] 1. Who engages in pool selling or bookmaking, with or without writing ... [^] ... is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than one year or in the state prison.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b904-8\"> Nowhere in Opdyk\u2019s brief do we find any attempt to defend the trial court\u2019s position that it makes any difference whether the crime is a misdemeanor or felony, but at oral argument counsel pursued the point. In view of the plain language of the relevant statutes, discussed <em>post, </em>we see no principled reason for making a distinction between felonies and misdemeanors. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7.5, 490, 19572 [reference to \u201cconviction,\u201d \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201cany law prohibiting bookmaking,\u201d not to \u201cfelony\u201d]; 2 Cal. Criminal Law (Cont.Ed.Bar 1994) Effect of Criminal Conviction on Professional Licenses, \u00a7\u00a7 47.5-47.6, pp. 1224-1226.) Opdyk makes no claim that exclusion of convicted bookmakers bears no substantial relationship to the activities regulated by the Board. (See <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>California Horse Racing Board </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 831, 835 [35 Cal.Rptr. 642] [bookmakers excluded since creation of Board in 1933; when a court decision invalidated the practice, the Legislature \u201cimmediately\u201d abrogated the decision.] See also <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>California Horse Racing Bd. </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 211, 218 [252 Cal.Rptr. 293].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-8\"> A more specific statute defines convictions used to discipline licensees: \u201cA board may suspend or revoke a license on the ground that the licensee has been convicted of a crime[.] <em>... A conviction within the meaning of this section means a plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere. </em>Any action which a board is permitted to take following the establishment of a conviction may be taken . . . <em>irrespective of a subsequent order under the provisions of Section 1203.4 of the Penal Code.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 490, italics added; see \u00a7 475, subd. (a)(2).) The similarity between sections 7.5 and 490 is explained by the fact that the former statute was enacted in the same measure which rewrote the latter. (See Stats. 1979, ch. 876, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3, pp. 3057-3058.) Although Opdyk possessed a racehorse owner\u2019s license which had been suspended, this case seeks redress only from the Board\u2019s act of excluding him from the track.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\"> Opdyk has filed a rehearing petition urging, inter alia, that he raised in his brief the issue that the case must be remanded due to the Board\u2019s failure to promulgate standards for rehabilitation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"Aik\">His heading regarding rehabilitation states, \u201cRespondent committed an abuse of discretion when it refused to determine that appellant was rehabilitated and should be allowed to wager.\u201d We do not find in this heading any due process claim or any mention of lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1831\">*1831</page-number>notice. The failure to head an argument as required by California Rules of Court, rule 15(a), constitutes a waiver. <em>(Live Oak Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Cohagan </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1277,1291 [286 Cal.Rptr. 198]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ladd </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 257, 262 [181 Cal.Rptr. 29]; <em>Lady </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1937) 19 Cal.App.2d 167, 168 [65 P.2d 76].)</p>\n<p id=\"AHR\">Moreover, the passage on which Opdyk relies begins, \u201cThe term \u2018rehabilitation\u2019 is not defined anywhere in the Business and Professions Code or the rules of the CHRB. In the absence of a standard for rehabilitation, respondent must produce some facts which link the evidence to the findings, and the findings to the order and which tells the courts \u2018whether and to what extent\u2019 appellant has not rehabilitated himself sufficient that he should not be allowed to wager.\u201d We took Opdyk at his word and explained what facts supported the Board\u2019s determination. It is true that he cited a case, <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Forestry </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 522 [192 Cal.Rptr. 693], which involved the propriety, <em>vel non, </em>of administrative determinations made without standards. But rather than make the argument that the lack of standards itself required a remand, Opdyk made the argument that \u201cin the absence of such standards respondent must produce some facts which link the evidence to the findings, and the findings to the order and which tells the courts \u2018whether and to what extent\u2019 appellant has not rehabilitated himself sufficient that he should not be allowed to wager.\u201d We addressed that argument. We are not obliged to make other arguments for him (see <em>Diamond Springs Lime Co. </em>v. <em>American River Constructors, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.3d at p. 608), nor are we obliged to speculate about which issues counsel intend to raise.</p>\n<p id=\"AoQ\">The purpose of requiring headings and coherent arguments in appellate briefs is \u201cto lighten the labors of the appellate [courts] by requiring the litigants to present their cause systematically and so arranged that those upon whom the duty devolves of ascertaining the rule of law to apply may be advised, as they read, of the exact question under consideration, instead of being compelled to extricate it from the mass.\u201d <em>(Landa </em>v. <em>Steinberg </em>(1932) 126 Cal.App. 324, 325 [14 P.2d 532].) For this reason the rehearing petition is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
