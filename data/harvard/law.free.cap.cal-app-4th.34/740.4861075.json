Although this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>must give deference to a trial court\u2019s finding of fact (see generally, <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Buena Engineers, Inc. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1500 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 903]), we find the error in this case turns on a question of law. The factual question as to whether the trial judge erred in finding respondent fully complied with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50, subdivision (b) is irrelevant. We hold as a matter of law respondent failed to comply with the prerequisites in filing its application for an order allowing service by publication. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">This case follows an earlier complaint involving the same parties and the same cause of action. The first complaint was dismissed on March 29,1992.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The present action arose in June of 1992 when respondent filed a second complaint alleging appellant\u2019s failure to repay a promissory note and seeking damages for common counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The parties agree appellant was not a resident of California at the time the second complaint was filed. Further, the parties agree appellant maintained a post office box in California at the time respondent filed its application for order for service by publication in the instant case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Despite respondent\u2019s knowledge of appellant\u2019s post office box, however, respondent indicated on its application to serve by publication it was unable to serve appellant by mail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50, subdivision (a) provides a \u201csummons may be served by publication if upon affidavit it appears to the satisfaction of the court... the party to be served cannot with reasonable diligence be served in another manner specified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>this article. . . Service by mail, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 415.30, is \u201canother manner specified in this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Respondent explained its failure to serve appellant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 by stating in its affidavit, \u201cDefendant\u2019s address unknown.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on respondent\u2019s assertion it could only serve appellant by publication, the judge granted respondent\u2019s request for an order for publication. Accordingly, notice of respondent\u2019s summons appeared in the Los Angeles Daily Journal beginning May 14,1993, and ran once a week for four successive weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">There is some debate as to whether respondent mailed appellant a copy of the correct summons and complaint in connection with the service by publication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant argues respondent erroneously sent him a status conference questionnaire pertaining to Levistre Management Systems, Inc. v. Pastrana, a case to which appellant has no affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Respondent\u2019s assertions concerning mailings to appellant are somewhat muddled. In its reply brief, respondent argues appellant admitted having received mail from respondent\u2019s attorneys concerning the action underlying this appeal. Respondent\u2019s brief also states respondent sent appellant a copy of the summons and complaint as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">In March 1994, however, during a hearing which followed the trial court\u2019s entry of a default judgment, respondent\u2019s attorney stated \u201cthere was no mailing because we did not ascertain any new address . . . .\u201d Two months later, in a related hearing, another attorney representing respondent stated respondent <em>did </em>mail appellant a copy of the summons and complaint. The latter attorney, however, admitted respondent mistakenly attached a portion of the Levistre status conference questionnaire to the summons and complaint mailed to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Despite the disagreement as to what, if anything, was mailed to appellant, the parties concur appellant did not respond to the published summons. Consequently, the trial court entered a default judgment against appellant on October 29, 1993, for the sum of $184,368.09 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>In February 1994, upon learning of the judgment against him, appellant petitioned the trial court to set aside or vacate the default judgment. The court, while listening to appellant\u2019s arguments, denied appellant\u2019s motion on both factual and procedural grounds. Factually, the court found respondent did all it could reasonably have done to serve appellant with notice. Procedurally, the court found appellant failed to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 473 because appellant\u2019s application for relief was not accompanied by a proposed answer to respondent\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In May 1994, appellant brought a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> again asking the court to vacate or set aside the previously affirmed default judgment. Once more, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion, basing its decision on both factual and procedural grounds. Factually, the judge stated respondent made every reasonable effort to communicate with appellant. Procedurally, the court said appellant was precluded from arguing the previously argued issue absent the introduction of new facts, new circumstances, or new law which did not exist at the time of the earlier hearing. Accordingly, the judge again dismissed appellant\u2019s claim. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">While the trial judge repeatedly exhibited a great deal of patience in considering appellant\u2019s arguments, the decision below must be reversed because the trial court erroneously granted the initial order for publication of summons upon which all subsequent proceedings, including the default judgment, depend. It appears respondent intentionally or unintentionally falsified the application for order for publication of summons by stating service could not be made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30, which authorizes service by mail.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the time respondent filed its application under 415.50, subdivision (b), respondent did not possess a residence or business address for appellant. However, at that time respondent did possess knowledge of a post office address for appellant and knew he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>was receiving mail at that post office address.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Respondent may have believed it could not comply with section 415.30 by mailing to a post office box,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> yet no case law or statute supports such a belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Judicial Council comment following Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50 states service by mail is not required \u201cwhere a defendant\u2019s whereabouts and his dwelling house or usual place of abode, etc. cannot be ascertained with reasonable diligence.\u201d (Judicial Council of Cal. com., Deering\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1991 ed.) \u00a7 415.50, p. 676.) However, we do not read this comment to exclude service by mail in the instant case. Although respondent could not ascertain appellant\u2019s \u201cdwelling house or usual place of abode,\u201d we believe the post office box falls into the \u201cetc.\u201d category. (See <em>Donel Inc. </em>v. <em>Badalian </em>(1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 327 [150 Cal.Rptr. 855] [where mailing of summons is reasonably feasible, any method of service less likely to provide actual notice is insufficient]; <em>Mullene </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co. </em>(1950) 339 U.S. 306, 315-318 [94 L.Ed. 865, 873-876, 70 S.Ct. 652] [for the same proposition]; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>$84,740.00 U.S. Currency </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 900 F.2d 1402 [in addition to service by publication, the government served defendants with a forfeiture complaint by sending two certified letters to defendants\u2019 post office box].)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Our finding a post office box is a sufficient address for compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 also is supported by case law interpreting the statutory predecessor to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50. Former Code of Civil Procedure section 413<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> required \u201ca copy of the summons and complaint to be forthwith deposited in the post office, directed to the person to be served, at his place of <em>residence. </em>...\u201d (Italics added.) At least two courts defined the term \u201cresidence\u201d not as the defendant\u2019s abode, but rather as \u201cthe address at which letters would be most likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>to reach the defendant.\u201d <em>(Sousa </em>v. <em>Freitas </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 660, 663 [89 Cal.Rptr. 485]; cf. <em>San Diego Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Goodsell </em>(1902) 137 Cal. 420, 427 [70 P. 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">This interpretation of \u201cresidence\u201d is relevant to our holding a post office box is a sufficient address for service under Code of Civil Procedure 415.30 because it demonstrates how statutory language and judicial comments should be read to achieve the statute\u2019s fundamental objective of serving notice on the defendant. Whenever possible, a statute should be interpreted as broadly as necessary to effectuate the statute\u2019s purpose. (See generally, <em>S.E.C. </em>v. <em>Rana Research, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 8 F.3d 1358, 1362 [interpreting language in Securities and Exchange Commision rule 10b-5 as broadly and as flexibly as necessary to accomplish the statute\u2019s purpose]; cf. <em>Western Oil &amp; Gas Assn. </em>v. <em>Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control Dist. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 408, 425 [261 Cal.Rptr. 384, 777 P.2d 157] [where a statute has two possible interpretations, courts should apply the more reasonable of the two].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Thus, based on respondent\u2019s failure to attempt service by mail pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30 prior to filing its application for order for publication of summons, we find the Code of Civil Procedure 415.50 motion was defective as a matter of law. Respondent knew appellant\u2019s post office address and that his mail was being picked up from that box. Yet respondent did not attempt to serve appellant by mail. Respondent\u2019s failure to attempt to serve appellant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 415.30<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> invalidated respondent\u2019s application for service by publication. (See generally, <em>Donel Inc. </em>v. <em>Badalian, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.3d 327, and <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Tr. Co., supra, </em>339 U.S. 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Because we find the Code of Civil Procedure 415.50 motion was defective as a matter of law, we need not address appellant\u2019s arguments concerning whether respondent mailed, or should have mailed, appellant a copy of the summons pursuant to section 415.50, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We hold, based on the respondent\u2019s failure to comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30, the section 415.50 motion was incorrectly granted as a matter of law and therefore service by publication was invalid in this instance. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s failure to file an answer to the improperly served complaint did not represent a default. It was error to enter default and beyond the power of the court to do so. The trial court had a legal duty, not merely discretionary power, to vacate the default it had erroneously entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">This cause is reversed and remanded with directions the trial court vacate the default and the default judgment, to then permit appellant to file an answer, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Applicant to receive costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Lillie, P. J., and Woods (Fred), J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> The first complaint, Transamerica Title Ins. Co. v. Hendrix (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1992, No. BC041253) was dismissed for two reasons: respondent counsel\u2019s failure to appear at an order to show cause hearing, and respondent\u2019s failure to file a proof of service on the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\"> Respondent admits, by reference, knowledge of the appellant\u2019s post office box in respondent\u2019s application for order for publication of summons. On the second page of the application, in response to a question asking why service could not be made on the appellant\u2019s dwelling house, normal place of abode, or usual place of business, respondent refers to the declaration of James R. Young. Mr. Young is a private investigator whose declaration states he located the post office box belonging to appellant and was told by postal employees the post office box was a \u201cgood address\u201d for the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-12\"> Code of Civil Procedure section 415.30, service by mail, establishes the following: \u201c(a) A summons may be served by mail as provided in this section.

As a result of counsel\u2019s statement, we have reexamined the record. Contrary to counsel\u2019s representation, however, we find the record irrefutably shows respondent knew of appellant\u2019s post office box on or prior to March 15,1993, the date on which James R. Young stated in a sworn declaration his investigation firm had located appellant\u2019s post office box address. Further, the record shows when respondent filed its application for order for publication of summons on March 18, 1993, respondent stated \u201cDefendant\u2019s address unknown.\u201d Thus, as March 15, 1993, unquestionably preceded March 18, 1993, we conclude respondent did in fact have knowledge of appellant\u2019s post office box prior to respondent\u2019s application for publication of summons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\"> During the May 11, 1994, hearing on appellant\u2019s second motion, respondent\u2019s counsel stated \u201cYour Honor, we were unable to serve Mr. Hendrix at a P.O. mail box.
