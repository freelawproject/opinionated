(See Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), specifically (c)(5).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On June 1, 1994, Brady pleaded guilty to the unlawful taking and driving of Jennifer Koslow\u2019s vehicle (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a)) on April 11, 1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also admitted he had suffered an earlier serious felony conviction (armed robbery, \u00a7\u00a7 211/12022.5) that qualified as a \u201cstrike\u201d under the \u201cthree strikes\u201d statute (\u00a7 667, subds. (d), (e)(1)) and had served a prior prison term. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) Brady stipulated to a total five-year term consisting of a four-year term for the current charge (based on doubling the middle term of two years under \u00a7 667, subd. (e)(1))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and an additional one year for the prison prior. On the prosecutor\u2019s motion the trial court dismissed a charge of receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496, subd. (a)) and another prison prior. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Brady waived the right to a probation report and was immediately sentenced pursuant to his agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Afterwards, Brady personally addressed the court, stating: \u201cI am just curious. When you sentenced me to the mid term of two years and doubled it to four, I\u2019ve got to do 80 percent of that. Is that right?\u201d When the court answered affirmatively, Brady questioned whether the \u201cyear for the prison prior\u201d falls under the same 80 percent rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The prosecutor and the court were of the opinion Brady would serve \u201c80 percent of any of the total term.\u201d In response to Brady\u2019s counsel\u2019s belief the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>law was unclear in that regard, because the one year could not be doubled (defense counsel thus thought the \u201c50 percent would apply\u201d), the court stated: \u201cWell, the way the law is written and there hasn\u2019t been any kind of interpretation of it, that it can be interpreted both ways. I think to be on the safe side\u2014I think that the best for you is to keep on top of it and after the four years has been served if there is any question still remaining as to how your year should be completed [as] to your good time credits[,] that should be brought up to the department of corrections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">On June 3, 1994, Brady filed a notice of appeal that stated it was \u201cbased on the sentence or other matters occurring after the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Brady appeals,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contending the trial court erred in ordering him to serve 80 percent of his prior prison term in addition to the term it imposed under the \u201cthree strikes\u201d statute. The gist of his arguments is that a correct interpretation of the words \u201cthe total term of imprisonment imposed\u201d in section 667, subdivision (c)(5) does not include application of the \u201c80 percent\u201d rule, which changes the credits certain recidivist prisoners may earn towards reducing their terms of imprisonment, to an enhancement not mentioned in section 667, i.e., a nonviolent or nonserious prior conviction enhancement. He specifically argues proper statutory construction reveals the Legislature did not intend by its enactment of section 667, subdivision (c)(5) to \u201centirely dismantle section 2931,\u201d but rather to leave prisoners, like him, the option of reducing that portion of their terms for nonserious and nonviolent felony convictions via \u201cgood behavior and willingness to work.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He thus asserts the application of section 667, subdivision (c)(5) to his</p>\n<p id=\"b67-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>People v. Brady</p>\n<p id=\"b67-2\">34 Cal.App.4th 65; 40 Cal.Rptr.2d 207 [Apr. 1995]</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">69</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">one-year enhancement violates the prohibition against ex post facto laws by decreasing the amount of credits he may earn and denies him his constitutional right to due process because the new \u201cthree strikes\u201d law failed to give him notice \u201ccomputation of good time credits would not apply to an enhancement for a prison prior. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We conclude the trial court did not err in stating the \u201c80 percent\u201d rule of section 667, subdivision (c)(5) would apply to Brady\u2019s one-year prison prior enhancement since that enhancement was included within his \u201ctotal term,\u201d and no ex post facto or due process violation is shown by such application.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\n<em>\u201cTotal Term of Imprisonment Imposed'</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Brady\u2019s assertions the specific language \u201cthe total term of imprisonment imposed\u201d contained in section 667, subdivision (c)(5), does not include his one-year enhancement for his prison prior (or any other nonviolent or nonserious prior felony conviction enhancement) and is somehow ambiguous simply ignore the plain language of that section, the intent of the Legislature in enacting that section, and the entire sentencing scheme of which that section is a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">As noted earlier, section 667, subdivision (c)(5) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law, if a defendant has been convicted of a felony and it has been pled and proved that the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions as defined in subdivision (d), the court shall adhere to each of the following: [&lt;JD . . . [U (5) The total amount of credits awarded pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 shall not exceed one-fifth of <em>the total term of imprisonment imposed </em>and shall not accrue until the defendant is physically placed in the state prison.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">apply to defendants not sentenced under a \u201cstrike,\u201d subdivision (d) of 2931 provides that section does not apply to \u201cany person whose crime was committed on or after January 1, 1983.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">We presume Brady, whose crime was committed in April of 1994, and the People, meant to refer to section 2933, which at the time of Brady\u2019s appeal provided for \u201cworktime credits\u201d earned (for up to 50 percent of a prison term) through various programs (see <em>In re Ramirez </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 931, 936 [218 Cal.Rptr. 324, 705 P.2d 897]; 3 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Punishment For Crime, \u00a7 1558, pp. 1861-1862), and which Brady would have been entitled to earn credits under but for his status under section 667, subd. (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">Brady has not contested his qualifying repeat offender status under the \u201cthree strikes\u201d statute nor raised any equal protection issues on this appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Culpepper * </em>(CaLApp.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Caruso </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 13, 20-21 [207 Cal.Rptr. 221]; <em>In re Bender </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 380, 386-390 [196 Cal.Rptr. 801].)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">\u2666Reporter\u2019s Note: Opinion (A066016) deleted upon direction of Supreme Court by order dated May 18, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>By its plain language, this subdivision pertains only to a repeat offender, and requires prison credits not be awarded in an amount exceeding \u201cone-fifth of the total term of imprisonment imposed.\u201d In other words, a section 667 recidivist prisoner, such as Brady, cannot earn more than 20 percent of his total time of imprisonment in conduct credits, requiring him to serve at least 80 percent of his total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Contrary to Brady\u2019s arguments, section 667, subdivision (c)(5) does not exist in a vacuum. It was enacted by the Legislature to amend an existing statute within the determinate sentencing law (DSL). In so doing, the Legislature is deemed to have been aware of the DSL and the sections it was amending, as well as the related regulatory scheme contained in Judicial Council rules on sentencing. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 950, 961 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 883 P.2d 974].)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The basic provisions of the DSL state that when a defendant is convicted of a felony and imprisonment is to be imposed, the trial court must apply the sentencing rules of the Judicial Council to select a term<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from among the lower, middle or upper term that is prescibed by statute for that offense and to impose any other term \u201cwhich is required by law to [be imposed] as an additional term.\u201d (See \u00a7 1170, subds. (a), (b).) Section 1170.1, subdivision (d) requires \u201cthe [trial] court [to] also impose the additional terms provided in . . . Sections 667, . . . [and] 667.5, . . . unless the additional punishment therefor is stricken . . . .\u201d Further, when imprisonment is based on two or more felonies, the total or \u201caggregate term of imprisonment for all these convictions shall be the sum of the principal term,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] the subordinate term, and any additional term imposed pursuant to Section 667, 667.5 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1170.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">From these basic provisions it is clear that enhancements, such as Brady\u2019s prior prison enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b), are included as part of a defendant\u2019s total prison sentence or term imposed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Tassell, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 90-91; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carter </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 370, 372 [163 Cal.Rptr. 475].) The addition of amended section 667 does not change these primary sentencing rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Given this existing sentencing scheme of which the \u201cthree strikes\u201d legislation is a part and the clear words of section 667, subdivision (c)(5), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>interpret the language \u201ctotal term of imprisonment imposed\u201d in that subdivision as meaning exactly what it says, i.e., that the total or entire term of imprisonment, or the aggregate term imposed, which includes any enhancements, whether mentioned in section 667 or not, is subject to the new credits limitations for persons who fall under the \u201cthree strikes\u201d law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">This interpretation comports with the express legislative intent stated for the enactment of the new \u201cthree strikes\u201d law since the inclusion of all enhancements within the definition of \u201ctotal term\u201d will help ensure \u201clonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Our interpretation is also supported by common sense, by dictionary meanings,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and by the usage of the phrase \u201ctotal term\u201d in the abstract of judgment forms, which are filed in a criminal case and also sent to the Department of Corrections, showing the computation of total time to be served by a prisoner for his crimes and enhancements together.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">We thus conclude the Legislature reasonably intended to include enhancements such as Brady\u2019s prior prison term enhancement within the phrase \u201ctotal term of imprisonment imposed\u201d for purposes of limiting prison credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\n<em>Ex Post Facto and Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Brady\u2019s constitutional claims the new statute did not give him fair notice his one-year enhancement could be included within the definition of \u201ctotal term\u201d imposed under section 667, subdivision (c)(5) and that such inclusion also constitutes an ex post facto violation are likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Although the imposition of punishment which, after commission of a crime, is increased or somehow made more onerous violates the ex post <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>facto clause of both the United States and California Constitutions (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9), \u201c \u2018[i]ncreased penalties for subsequent offenses . . . attributable to the defendant\u2019s status as a repeat offender . . . arise as an incident of the subsequent offense rather than constituting a penalty for the prior offense.

Such gave him notice that he would be treated more severely since he committed a new felony and had previously been convicted of a serious felony. That such \u201cstatus\u201d would subject him to subsection (c)(5)\u2019s credit limits was clearly spelled out.

(Stats. 1994, ch. 12, p. 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"AbC\">As pertinent to this appeal, subdivision (c)(5) of section 667 provides in part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law, if a defendant has been convicted of a felony and it has been pled and proved that the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions as defined in subdivision (d), the court shall adhere to each of the following: HO ... HD (5) The total amount of credits awarded pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 shall not exceed one-fifth of the total term of imprisonment imposed and shall not accrue until the defendant is physically placed in the state prison.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\"> On November 8,1994, section 1170.12 was enacted by the voters\u2019 passage of Proposition 184. (Added by initiative measure Prop. 184, \u00a7 1, operative if approved Nov. 8,1994.) Except for different section number and subdivision lettering, the substantive provisions of section 1170.12 are the same as those earlier added by the \u201cthree strikes\u201d legislation. Because Brady\u2019s crime was committed after the March 7, 1994, changes to section 667 but before the addition of section 1170.12, we apply the pertinent provisions of section 667 in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b65-11\"> Section 667, subdivision (e) provides in part: \u201cFor purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, and in addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply, the following shall apply where a defendant has a prior felony conviction: HQ (1) If a defendant has one prior felony conviction that has been pled and proved, the determinate term . . . shall be twice the term otherwise provided as punishment for the current felony conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b65-12\"> Although section 667, subdivision (g) prohibits use of prior convictions in plea bargaining, no argument is made that this provision has been violated in this case. The trial court did not strike Brady\u2019s prior serious felony, but rather used it as the basis to sentence under section 667, subdivision (e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b66-7\"> Brady does not challenge the total length of his prison sentence or complain of sentencing error other than claiming the trial court improperly ordered him to serve \u201c80 percent\u201d of his total term. Our reading of the sentencing transcript reveals the court did not explicitly order Brady to do so, but merely gave him an opinion of what prison time he would be serving.</p>\n<p id=\"Auug\">However, because the matter is fully briefed, without objection by the People on grounds Brady\u2019s claim is premature or that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before the Department of Corrections, and the legal issue is of statewide importance to the bench and bar, particularly for defense counsel in advising defendants about the consequences of the new \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, in the interests of justice and judicial economy we address the merits of the issue. We construe the court\u2019s imposition of sentence under section 667, based on Brady\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d of having one \u201cstrike\u201d against him, to impliedly include an order requiring prison credits be limited by the \u201c80 percent\u201d rule contained in subdivision (c)(5) of section 667 and address the merits of this appeal.

Subdivision (e)(1) merely prescibes the increased determinate term for persons such as Brady in the case presently being sentenced. (\u00a7 667, subd. (e).) Such term is \u201cin addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply....\u2019\u2019 (\u00a7 667, subd. (e).) Thus, as applied to Brady, this subsection merely requires his one-year enhancement be imposed in addition to the doubling of the term for the instant crime.
