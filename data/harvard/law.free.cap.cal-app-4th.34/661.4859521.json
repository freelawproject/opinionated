(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352.) The trial court found Haider was previously convicted of possession of a controlled substance. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11350, 11370, subds. (a) &amp; (c).) Haider appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>He contends (1) that the trial court erred in sustaining the prosecution\u2019s claim that the exact surveillance location was privileged, precluding cross-examination about the exact surveillance location, and denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of the officer who stated he saw appellant give someone rock cocaine and (2) that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ceja </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1134, 1138-1139 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 847 P.2d 55]), the evidence established that about 3:30 p.m. on November 11, 1993, Long Beach Police Officer Joseph Starbird saw Albert Alvarez give appellant some money and shortly thereafter saw appellant brush a small off-white rock into Alvarez\u2019s hands in an alley. The rock was later found to contain cocaine. It was about one-quarter inch long and about one-eighth inch wide and weighed .07 gram.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Officer Starbird observed the transaction from a rooftop that was about 100 to 120 feet from the alley. He used binoculars that made objects appear 10 times larger than their actual size. It was a sunny day. Between Officer Starbird and appellant was a six-foot high chain-link fence containing wooden boards. The building on whose roof Officer Starbird observed the transaction was two stories high, and the fence did not obstruct his view of the transaction since it was unnecessary for the officer to look through the fence. Appellant and Alvarez were dressed unlike each other and unlike other persons in the vicinity. When Officer Starbird and his partner approached appellant and Alvarez several minutes after Officer Starbird saw appellant brush the rock into Alvarez\u2019s hands, Alvarez dropped the piece of rock cocaine and a cocaine pipe. Appellant had $2 on his person. The street value of the cocaine was about $5.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In defense, appellant denied giving or selling any drugs to Alvarez. Appellant asserted he bought some rock cocaine in the alley, borrowed a pipe from Alvarez, smoked the cocaine, and returned the pipe to Alvarez.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The government has a privilege to refuse to disclose the exact location of a surveillance site if the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of that information outweighs the need for disclosure. <em>(In re Sergio M. </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 809, 813 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 701].) Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>statutory basis for the privilege to maintain the confidentiality of the surveillance location is Evidence Code section 1040,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that privilege has been analogized to the confidential informer identity privilege codified in Evidence Code section 1041.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 230, 235 [282 Cal.Rptr. 12]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1019 [252 Cal.Rptr. 779] [stating it is reasonable to afford even more protection to the confidentiality of a surveillance location than to the confidentiality of the identity of an informer since an informer may be able to hide].) If the court finds that a surveillance location is privileged, Evidence Code section 1042 provides the court must nonetheless make a finding adverse to the prosecution if the location is material to the defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>After an in camera hearing in the present case, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the surveillance location. The trial court stated: \u201c[T]he court finds the privilege to maintain the confidentiality of the exact location of the surveillance far outweighs the defendant\u2019s interest in the disclosure. The disclosure of the exact location would not constitute material evidence on the issue of guilt which would result in exoneration of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Officer Starbird\u2019s testimony at the in camera hearing indicated that disclosure of the surveillance location would likely endanger occupants of the building whose rooftop was used for surveillance and would impair further investigation of narcotics offenses. The officer\u2019s testimony at the in camera hearing further indicated that Officer Starbird\u2019s view of appellant and Alvarez when money and the rock cocaine were exchanged was completely unobstructed. The evidence at trial also established that Officer Starbird\u2019s view of both exchanges was unobstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">At trial, defense counsel was permitted to question Officer Starbird about the existence of any obstructions, Officer Starbird\u2019s distance from the fence, Officer Starbird\u2019s angle of vision in observing appellant at the time of the transaction, and whether Officer Starbird saw appellant from the front, back, left side, or right side. On cross-examination, Officer Starbird stated that when he saw appellant drop the rock into Alvarez\u2019s hands, the officer was looking at appellant\u2019s left side, appellant was holding his right hand in a blade shape, appellant brushed the rock into Alvarez\u2019s hands with his left hand from a height just below appellant\u2019s shoulders, Alvarez\u2019s hands were about 12 to 14 inches lower, appellant was about 5 feet 9 inches tall, Alvarez was a couple of inches shorter, appellant was about 12 feet east of the fence, part of the fence was between the officer and appellant, the fence did not in any way block the officer\u2019s view of appellant\u2019s body, the officer was 100 to 120 feet from the fence, his angle of vision was about 30 degrees, Alvarez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>stood closer than appellant to Pacific Coast Highway, Alvarez\u2019s right side was closest to Pacific Coast Highway, and Alvarez\u2019s back faced east. Appellant made no showing that there was any observation site on a rooftop of a 2-story building at a distance of 100 to 120 feet from the place where appellant and Alvarez stood when the exchanges occurred from which Officer Starbird would have been unable to see the transactions if the officer\u2019s angle of vision was approximately 30 degrees and appellant\u2019s left side was closest to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1231 [251 Cal.Rptr. 28], a First Appellate District case, a police officer testified that, using binoculars, he saw a number of transactions in which something was apparently exchanged for money and that he believed the transactions involved narcotics. He stated his observation point was about 50 yards from the defendant, the day was somewhat overcast, and his view was unobstructed. The trial court upheld his assertion that under the official information privilege, the precise surveillance location should not be disclosed. The Court of Appeal held that the surveillance location was material because the defense needed that information to test the officer\u2019s observation and that the officer\u2019s testimony should therefore have been stricken. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1235-1236.) Unlike the situation in <em>Hines, </em>in the present case, as previously noted, the officer\u2019s observations occurred on a sunny day, the officer observed the exchanges from a closer location, and the officer testified that he saw an off-white rock being brushed into Alvarez\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery, supra, </em>205 Cal.App.3d 1011, another First Appellate District case, the court held that the surveillance location was material to test the only observation of a sale of narcotics because, apart from the officer\u2019s testimony, there was no other direct evidence of the sale since the purchaser was not detained and the transaction was not photographed or otherwise memorialized. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1022.) In contrast to <em>Montgomery, </em>in the present case the purchaser was detained and was observed discarding a piece of rock cocaine as the officers approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d 230, Division Five of this court held that the precise surveillance location was not material because the officer stated that from behind a building he observed a drug transaction without binoculars under good lighting from a distance of 15 feet, the officer saw the defendant give a small object later identified as rock cocaine to the buyer, who, as in the present case, was apprehended within several minutes after the transaction, the defendant admitted that he contacted someone who wanted to buy drugs on the date of the buyer\u2019s arrest, and the defendant did not prove or offer evidence that there was some point within 15 feet to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>rear of the building from which the officer could not have observed him because of an obstruction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 237-238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In <em>In re Sergio M., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 809, a Sixth Appellate District case, the Court of Appeal held the surveillance location was not material because, using 35-power binoculars from a distance of less than 100 yards, the officer had an unobstructed view of the minor on a sunny day and no one else in the area was dressed similarly to the minor. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 814.) The court explained that, although there were locations within 100 yards of the minor from which the officer\u2019s view of the minor would have been obstructed, there were at least two locations at that distance from which one could see what the officer claimed to have seen. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Garza </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 148, 151 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 11], another Sixth Appellate District case, an officer who was 40 or 50 feet away and across the street from the defendant and another man observed both men attempting to flag down cars at night by yelling \u201c \u2018coke,\u2019 \u201d waving, gesturing, and whistling. The officer broadcast detailed descriptions of both men and their activities. Based on the description of him, the defendant was apprehended. He had four bindles of cocaine in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In <em>Garza </em>the Court of Appeal held that the exact surveillance location was not material because, if the officer\u2019s view had been obstructed or the officer had been too far away to hear the men, the officer would not have been able to describe the men and monitor their activities. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garza, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 154-155.) In determining what showing is necessary to establish that a surveillance location is material, the <em>Garza </em>court relied on the analysis of <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(D.C. App. 1992) 607 A.2d 490, 497, which held: \u201c[T]he defendant is obliged to show not only that there are locations in the area from which the view is impaired or obstructed, but also that there is some reason to believe that the officer was making his observations from such a location. Without some reason so to believe, the existence of obstructed locations is logically irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We find the holdings in <em>Sergio M. </em>and <em>Garza </em>persuasive. However, <em>Garza </em>appears to read <em>Walker </em>as holding that a reasonable possibility of exoneration is necessarily shown by evidence that at some point within the area surveilled the officer could not have viewed the defendant because of some obstruction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garza, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 154.) We do not read <em>Walker </em>as so holding. In stating that the defendant did not offer any evidence that there was some point within 15 feet to the rear of the building from which the officer could not have observed the defendant because of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>obstruction, the court did not hold that such evidence would necessarily render the surveillance location material. Instead, the court was merely describing an additional reason to support its conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the exact surveillance location was not material. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 237-238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">A determination of whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in deciding that an exact location of a surveillance site should not be disclosed depends on the facts of the particular case. We do not read <em>Hines </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>as holding that whenever a surveillance location is relevant to test an officer\u2019s ability to observe, the location must be disclosed. Such an approach would render the privilege nugatory. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d 230, Division Five of this court rejected the defendant\u2019s assertion that, under <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Hines, </em>the surveillance location is always material, explaining: \u201c[I]f we adopt defendant\u2019s analysis, the trial court would be required to strike testimony in any case in which a confidential surveillance location is used regardless of its materiality under the facts of the particular case. We do not believe that such a mechanical result is either justified or mandated by law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Since the record of the in camera hearing and the trial established that Officer Starbird had an unobstructed view of the drug transaction with high-powered binoculars on a sunny day, the trial court properly sustained the privilege under Evidence Code section 1040 to maintain the confidentiality of the exact location of the surveillance site, properly did not make a finding adverse to the prosecution under Evidence Code section 1042, subdivision (a), and properly did not strike Officer Starbird\u2019s testimony. The officer\u2019s refusal to disclose the exact location of the surveillance site did not deprive appellant of a fair trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garza, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at pp. 153-155; <em>In re Sergio M., supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at pp. 813-815; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at pp. 234-239; see <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>U.S., supra, </em>607 A.2d at p. 497.) In view of the questions defense counsel was permitted to ask Officer Starbird regarding his observation of the transaction, reasonable cross-examination was allowed. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Although appellant had only $2 on his person when arrested, the evidence that, using binoculars, Officer Starbird saw Alvarez give appellant some money and soon thereafter saw appellant brush into Alvarez\u2019s hands an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>off-white rock later determined to contain cocaine and that the officer\u2019s view was not obstructed by the fence constitutes substantial evidence that appellant sold or gave away cocaine. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cornejo </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 637, 659-660 [155 Cal.Rptr. 238].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Fukuto, Acting P.
