Schreidel (Schreidel) in her action for damages arising out of alleged violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, sometimes known as the California Lemon Law (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Honda contends the jury\u2019s verdict is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">Schreidel purchased a new manual transmission 1989 Honda Prelude (the car) in October 1989. Within the first 2,000 miles of use, Schreidel experienced difficulty with the clutch. While stopped in traffic, she was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>shift from neutral into first gear. She continually tried to take her foot off the clutch and reshift, as recommended in the owner\u2019s manual. She was unable to move for one-half to one full minute. Cars started beeping behind her and she \u201cstarted to panic.\u201d Eventually she got the car into first gear. This was unlike ordinary misshifting experiences where one can successfully shift by taking the foot off the clutch and trying again. This happened numerous times, with cars honking and people shaking their fists at her on about 10 additional occasions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\">When she informed the selling dealer of the problem, Schreidel was told the car was \u201cbreaking in.\u201d She brought the car into authorized Honda repair facilities on six separate occasions between January and December 1990. Nevertheless, the problem continued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">In addition, in September 1990, a new problem appeared. When Schreidel depressed the clutch pedal, it would come back about half way and stick there for a while, then pop back up, hitting the bottom of her foot. Although both problems were the subject of repair attempts, the problems became \u201cprogressively worse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Schreidel\u2019s fianc\u00e9 also experienced the shifting and the clutch sticking problems and was a passenger several times when the clutch pedal stuck while Schreidel was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Schreidel found the clutch problem \u201cvery annoying\u201d and she worried about it happening. \u201cIt took my mind off of the road a lot of times because all of a sudden it\u2019d start popping again.\u201d She avoided long-distance drives, and in fact borrowed her fianc\u00e9\u2019s car on 15 to 16 days for out-of-town or long trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Schreidel had her car serviced at Scott Robinson Honda and complained about the problems. The mechanics could not duplicate the problems but adjusted the clutch a number of times. Scott Robinson replaced certain components of the clutch as a goodwill gesture. The repair record indicated the clutch had been replaced. The clutch replacement did not eliminate the shifting problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Experiencing the clutch pedal sticking on one occasion, Schreidel drove into a Chevron station. George Conley, a mechanic at the station, observed the clutch pedal sticking and talked to Scott Robinson Honda on the telephone at Schreidel\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Schreidel presented expert testimony of Louis Nanos, an automotive consultant. He testified that he inspected Schreidel\u2019s car and observed both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>problems. He videotaped the pedal sticking problem from inside the engine compartment as well as inside the passenger area. There was no evidence that Schreidel rode her clutch and the clutch system was clean and well-maintained. On a test drive he experienced the problem of being unable to shift into first gear without violent force. This was not misshifting, and was not a blocking phenomenon caused by synchronizers designed to stop shifting too quickly. Based upon his review of the Honda work orders, the deposition testimony of the Honda\u2019s field investigator, his own 18-year experience in the field, and his examination and inspection of the car, Nanos opined the problems were caused by the slave cylinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Schreidel called the customer relations department of Honda regarding her complaints. Judy Wilson called the dealership\u2019s service manager for information and entered into her records that the \u201ccustomer came in with supposed clutch problem,\u201d and \u201cproblem is customer.\u201d The records contained information that Schreidel was leasing the car and needed to get out of it. Schreidel requested Honda to buy back the car or sell her a new one a little cheaper. But the customer relations department could not help her because they were only authorized to offer to fix the problem. They were not authorized to do anything about a buy-back. Ms. Wilson advised the dealer \u201cnot to repair unless problem found,\u201d and closed the file. The department\u2019s records contained an entry referring to the theory that \u201ccustomer is trying to get out of car, closing file.\u201d Schreidel\u2019s letter to the president of Honda was turned over to Ms. Wilson. Ms. Wilson wrote Schreidel telling her that Honda would do nothing further unless Honda found a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Schreidel instituted arbitration proceedings where she introduced a videotape which demonstrated the clutch pedal was sticking. Honda\u2019s field investigator did not contact Schreidel until about two days before the arbitration hearing in May, although Schreidel had advised Honda about the proceedings in February. The field investigator asked to see the car, but only to fix it, so Schreidel declined. The videotape showed the investigator that the sticking problem was \u201ca fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In October Schreidel traded the car in at a Nissan dealership. The price she received was deducted from Schreidel\u2019s damages. The Nissan used car manager testified that before the car was resold, a Honda representative picked up the car and when it was returned told him Honda had put in a new clutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Honda maintained at trial that Schreidel was experiencing a normal operation of a vehicle with synchromesh in first gear. The synchromesh system was designed to prevent the gears from grinding. The owner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>manual discussed a means to prevent gears grinding. Kenneth Illman, Honda\u2019s field representative, observed the clutch pedal sticking for the first time in the videotape shown at the arbitration hearing and at trial admitted that the problem was either in the throwout bearing or the slave cylinder, parts of the clutch system, and that replacing the entire system would cure the clutch sticking problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The jury rendered a special verdict entitling Schreidel to judgment for actual damages including accrued interest in the amount of $8,272 together with statutory penalty damages in the amount of $16,544. She was awarded costs, including attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Honda appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Contentions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">Honda contends:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">1. \u201cThe trial court erred when it denied Honda\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">2. \u201cThere was no objective evidence presented by plaintiff to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">3. \u201cThe jury should never have been permitted to hear the speculative opinions of plaintiff\u2019s expert, Mr. Nanos, which [were] objected to by the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">4. \u201cThere is a lack of substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s award of civil penalties against Honda.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">Schreidel contends:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">1. \u201cAmple evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of substantial impairment of \u2018use,\u2019 \u2018value\u2019 or \u2018safety\u2019 to Schreidel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-14\">2. \u201cMr. Nanos expressed proper, not \u2018speculative,\u2019 opinions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-15\">3. \u201cThe jury properly awarded a civil penalty under Civil Code section 1794.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">1. <em>The Requirements of the Song-Beverly Act, The Lemon Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The Lemon Law, Civil Code section 1793.2, requires the manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty to maintain sufficient service and repair facilities to carry out the terms of those warranties. (\u00a7 1793.2, subd. (a)(1)(A).) Service or repairs of nonconforming goods must be commenced within a \u201creasonable time,\u201d and completed within 30 days unless the buyer agrees in writing to the contrary. (\u00a7 1793.2, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (d) provides: \u201c(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the manufacturer or its representative in this state does not service or repair the goods to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either replace the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the buyer, less that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the discovery of the nonconformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">\u201c(2) If the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle, as that term is defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 1793.22, to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle ... or promptly make restitution to the buyer. . . . However, the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement, and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">\u201cNonconformity\u201d is defined as \u201ca nonconformity which substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle to the buyer or lessee.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1793.22, subd. (e)(1).) The term is similar to what the average person would understand to be a \u201cdefect.\u201d <em>(Ibrahim </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 887 [263 Cal.Rptr. 64].)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The Act provides that a buyer who is damaged by a failure to comply with their obligations under the Act, or under an implied or express warranty, may bring an action for damages and other legal and equitable relief. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1794, subd. (a).) \u201cIf the buyer establishes that the failure to comply was willful, the judgment may include, in addition to the amounts recovered under subdivision (a), a civil penalty which shall not exceed two times the amount of actual damages. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1794, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">In regard to the <em>willful </em>requirement of Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (c), a civil penalty may be awarded if the jury determines that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>the manufacturer \u201cknew of its obligations but intentionally declined to fulfill them.\u201d <em>(Ibrahim </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. 894.) There is no requirement of blame, malice or moral delinquency. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, \u201c. . . a violation is not willful if the defendant\u2019s failure to replace or refund was the result of a good faith and reasonable belief the facts imposing the statutory obligation were not present.\u201d <em>(Kwan </em>v. <em>Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 174, 185 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (e) permits penalties when the consumer goods at issue are new motor vehicles and the buyer establishes a violation of the restitution or replacement provisions of section 1793.2, subdivision (d). It contains no willfulness requirement but does not apply if the manufacturer maintains a third party dispute resolution process which complies with section 1793.22. In such a case, a manufacturer may still be liable for a willful violation under section 1794, subdivision (c). <em>(Jernigan </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 488, 492-493 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 348].)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">A plaintiff cannot recover both types of penalties for the same violation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1794, subd. (e)(5).) The record does not reveal the basis of the penalty award in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">2. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports a Finding of Substantial Impairment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Due to the intermittent problems, Schreidel avoided using her car for long trips, thereby reducing its usefulness and value to her. There is no question that a delay in shifting into first is similar to stalling, a dangerous situation on the highway. (See <em>Ibrahim </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., supra, </em>214 Cal.App.3d at p. 883 [vehicle\u2019s engine tended to surge or die unexpectedly, once on railroad tracks].) Schreidel experienced panic when she could not shift into first gear. She felt as though she never had a new car. The problems were becoming worse as the car aged. Schreidel had lost confidence in the car and attempted to replace it. The jury could determine that the value of the goods to this particular buyer was substantially impaired. <em>(Champion Ford Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Levine </em>(1981) 49 Md.App. 547, 553 [433 A.2d 1218, 1222].)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The issue of whether the problems constituted substantial impairment is one for the trier of fact. <em>(U.S. Roofing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Credit Alliance Corp. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1431, 1445 [279 Cal.Rptr. 533] [similar term used in Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 2608]; <em>Champion Ford Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Levine, supra, </em>49 Md.App. at p. 553 [433 A.2d at p. 1222].) The jury was instructed that \u201c[a] nonconformity in the manufacture of a vehicle means a defect in material or workmanship of a factory-installed part.\u201d Also, it was instructed that plaintiff had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>car suffered from one or two nonconformities and \u201c[a]ny such nonconformity or nonconformities must have substantially impaired the use, value, or safety of the vehicle to plaintiff during the express warranty period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">There is no indication in the record that Honda requested additional instructions on the issue of nonconformity. However, in argument, Honda\u2019s counsel underscored the significance of the term, \u201csubstantially.\u201d \u201cAnd substantially means exactly essentially what it says. The law says it means it\u2019s a major defect. It must be major. It can\u2019t be minor, can\u2019t be trivial. It must be major.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The thrust of Honda\u2019s appeal is that the problems Schreidel had with her car did not <em>substantially </em>impair its use, value or safety. Honda claims Schreidel failed to meet her burden of proof on this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Honda contends the legislative history indicates the law was intended to address major, not minor, problems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Schreidel <em>(Crawford </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 427, 429 [45 P.2d 183]), we find substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that the nonconformities resulted in substantial impairment of the use, value and safety of Schreidel\u2019s car for purposes of the Lemon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">3. <em>The Testimony of Schreidel\u2019s Expert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Honda contends Nanos\u2019s testimony and expert opinion was based on speculation and was inadmissible because he did not conduct scientific testing, disassembly of the car or conduct any independent investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">An expert\u2019s opinion is admissible if, \u201cBased on matter (including his special knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education) perceived by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>or personally known to the witness or made known to him at or before the hearing, whether or not admissible, that is of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject to which his testimony relates, unless an expert is precluded by law from using such matter as a basis for his opinion.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Sierra Boat Co. </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 325 [145 Cal.Rptr. 47], expert testimony was properly excluded because it was to be based upon speculation. The expert was to testify as to the probable speed of a vehicle before impacting a boat trailer. He intended to base his estimate upon an assumption about the vehicle\u2019s path between the impact with the boat trailer and a second impact with a pole. However, there had been no evidence presented in the trial of any sliding or rolling of the vehicle prior to the second impact. The court said, \u201cIt is apparent that the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence would have been speculative, conjectural and remote in nature . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 338.) \u201cIt is well settled that an expert\u2019s assumption of facts contrary to the proof destroys the opinion. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Nanos testified as to his 18- or 19-year background in the field of automotive repairs and mechanics; he was an automotive mechanic, service manager, service and parts director, body shop manager, dealership training coordinator and warranty administrator. Nanos had extensive experience with Honda automobiles and with clutch systems identical or similar to that of the 1989 Prelude. Nanos now had his own business called Automotive Consumer Services and had testified in court as a qualified expert witness on automobile safety matters 42 times.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Nanos personally examined Schreidel\u2019s car, observed the shift pedal problem she had been complaining about, videotaped the problem, inside the car and inside the engine compartment, and drove the car and experienced the problem with shifting into first gear. Based upon his observations, an examination of the repair order history, the Honda service manual and some independent service manuals for Hondas, and his experience with the mechanics of clutches, Nanos opined the clutch system was causing the shifting problem and the pedal binding was caused by the master cylinder push rod or the slave cylinder binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Honda fails to identify the supposed speculative basis of Nanos\u2019s conclusion, but ridicules the \u201ctouch test,\u201d in which Nanos discerned that the slave cylinder was binding. Honda complains of the absence of scientific tests or disassemblage to demonstrate the exact cause of the problems. Contrary to Honda\u2019s assertions, Nanos\u2019s opinion that the problems Schreidel experienced with the car were due to a defective clutch system was based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>evidence introduced at trial and upon his own firsthand observation. He did not rest his opinion upon unsupported assumptions. Nanos opined there was a defective slave cylinder; it was not necessary to pinpoint the exact mechanical detail within the slave cylinder of the clutch system to prove Schreidel\u2019s case. The contention that Nanos\u2019s opinion was wild speculation is totally meritless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">\u201cThe opinion of an expert is admissible when based upon his special knowledge and upon matter perceived by him or made known to him at the hearing \u2018that is of a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion . . . .\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 801.) An expert may not base his opinion on conjecture . . . but may identify a causative force by a process of eliminating other causes .... The strength of his assumptions affects the weight rather than the admissibility of his opinion. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sundlee </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 477, 484-485 [138 Cal.Rptr. 834]; citations omitted [expert testified arson fire caused by time-delay device which was consumed in the fire].)</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">4. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Jury Finding of Civil Penalties.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The basis of Honda\u2019s argument regarding its nonliability for civil penalties is the state of Honda\u2019s <em>knowledge </em>regarding the defects. Honda claims the record shows that its mechanics were unable to duplicate the problems Schreidel described and that Schreidel herself was unable to duplicate the problems for them while at the dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The jury was instructed on the meaning of \u201cwillful\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201cIf you find that defendant [Honda] failed to comply with its obligations under the law previously read to you and if you determine that the failure to comply was willful, your verdict may include a civil penalty against such defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201cThe word willful when applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted and as used in these instructions, simply implies a purpose or willfulness to commit the act or to make the omission in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">\u201cThe word willful does not require an intent to violate the law nor does it require an intent to injure or damage another or to acquire an advantage over another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>\u201cIn making this determination you may consider whether defendant [Honda] knowingly failed to follow its obligations to plaintiff required by law including whether it unreasonably failed to replace the subject vehicle or refund the purchase price when obligated to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Honda does not challenge the correctness of the instruction, but argues that the only knowledge Honda had was that Schreidel\u2019s complaints could not be duplicated by their authorized Honda dealers. Honda points out that it offered to repair the condition once a Honda representative viewed the expert\u2019s videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">What Honda ignores in the record, however, is that the problems were admittedly intermittent, that Schreidel had brought the problems to the dealership\u2019s attention on six separate occasions, and that an independent service station mechanic reported his observation of the pedal sticking problem to the dealership. Honda\u2019s attempts to duplicate the problems were minimal and, even after Schreidel brought the matter to arbitration and demonstrated the problem, Honda only offered to repair, not replace, the car as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The record demonstrates that Honda made no serious attempt to discover the cause of Schreidel\u2019s complaints. Rather, the record shows that Honda tended to attribute ulterior motives to Schreidel and failed to diagnose the problems even though Schreidel brought the car into a Honda dealership for repair over an 11-month period on 6 separate occasions. In late September 1990, the service manager at the dealership advised Schreidel that the matter was out of his hands and that a field representative would contact her. Despite repeated calls and letters, no representative contacted her or examined the car until May 1991, two days before an arbitration hearing Schreidel had instituted to obtain a replacement. Then the representative asked to look at the car in order to fix it, not to replace it. The customer relations department characterized her complaints as a customer problem and closed its file when the dealership could not duplicate her complaints. No procedure was ever instituted to replace her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The statute requires the manufacturer to either \u201cpromptly replace\u201d a new vehicle which it is unable to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, or make restitution to the buyer. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1793.2, subd. (d)(1) and (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The jury was properly instructed and substantial evidence supports its finding that Honda willfully failed to comply with its obligation to replace or make restitution, thereby entitling Schreidel to an award of penalties in</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>addition to damages. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1794.) (6) Section 1794 also authorizes an award of attorney fees to the consumer who prevails. Such fees are properly awarded for her appellate efforts and should be set by the trial court upon remand. <em>(Morcos </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 924, 927 [275 Cal.Rptr. 187, 800 P.2d 543]; <em>Suman </em>v. <em>BMW of North America, Inc. </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1, 13 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 133].)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Judgment affirmed. The matter is remanded to the trial court to set an amount for Schreidel\u2019s attorney fees on appeal. Schreidel is awarded costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Kitching, Acting P. J., and Luke, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-14\"> The record does not contain the complaint or other pretrial matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-16\"> The record does not contain these motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-10\"> Honda turns to out-of-state cases. In <em>Mercedes-Benz </em>v. <em>Garten </em>(1993) 94 Md.App. 547 [618 A.2d 233], the court found that a delayed upshift, which was caused by an emissions control device, was in fact the way the 1990 300E was designed. Honda points out that the court stated, in discussing whether the car breached the warranty of fitness for ordinary purposes, that there was no evidence, other than Mr. Garten\u2019s fear of being hit from behind by speeding cars, that the 1990 300E was unsafe in any way. However, the court did not address the meaning of substantial impairment for purposes of the Lemon Law. The court simply held Garten could not recover under the Lemon Law because he waived any remedy by trading the automobile in to another dealer instead of returning it as required by Maryland\u2019s law.
