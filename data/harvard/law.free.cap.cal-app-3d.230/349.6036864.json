(a)(2)), the father had been convicted of a felony of such a nature as to prove his unfitness to have future custody and control of minors (\u00a7 232, subd. (a)(4)), minors\u2019 parents were mentally disabled and likely to remain so in the foreseeable future (\u00a7 232, subd. (a)(6)), and minors had been in out-of-home placement under supervision of the department of public social services for a one-year period (\u00a7 232, subd. (a)(7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">After conducting a hearing on the petition, the Riverside County Juvenile Court found all the above-described allegations to be true. The court also found that the parents had failed and would fail in the future to maintain an adequate parental relationship with minors, that reasonable reunification services had been provided for the parents, that return of minors to their parents would be detrimental to minors, that it was in the minors\u2019 best interests to be freed from the parents\u2019 custody and control, and that permanent severance of the parental relationship was the least detrimental alternative to secure minors\u2019 best interests. Consequently, the court entered an order declaring minors free from parental control and custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">II., III. A.-C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Necessity of Reversal</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">The father contends that we must reverse as to him if one finding made by the juvenile court is not supported by substantial evidence. He cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the following language in <em>In re Jack H. </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 257, 269 [165 Cal.Rptr. 646], to support his contention: \u201cError as to any of the trial court findings impermissibly taints its exercise of discretion affecting this most fundamental civil right; therefore, any one alone is sufficient for reversal. <em>(In re Carmaleta B., </em>[1978], 21 Cal.3d 482, 495-496 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514].)\u201d As we explain below, we conclude that this broad language, when examined in context and in light of <em>In re Carmaleta B., </em>does not require that we reverse because of our holding that the trial court erred in finding that the minors came within the description of section 232, subdivision (a)(4), as applied to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In <em>In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 482, the trial court had found that five children were entitled to be declared free of their mother\u2019s control and custody since each of them came within the descriptions of subdivisions (a)(2) and (a)(6) section 232, but had made no finding that return of minors to the mother\u2019s home would be detrimental to them, as required pursuant to section 4600. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 485, 488, 496.) Our Supreme Court held that the finding under subdivision (a)(6) was not supported by the evidence and that the subdivision (a)(2) finding was supported as to only four of the five children; it also pointed out that a finding of detriment was absolutely essential in a section 232 case. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 492, 495.) The court reversed and remanded the case \u201cfor a determination of the finding of detriment and a redetermination of whether the section 232 petition should be granted.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">After setting out its holding, the court further stated: \u201cIn a case such as this where fundamental rights are affected by the exercise of discretion by the trial court, we recognize that such discretion can only be truly exercised if there is no misconception by the trial court as to the legal basis for its action. Thus, where, as here, some of the grounds for the trial court\u2019s action have been determined on appeal to be supportable and other grounds unsupported, the matter should be remanded for the trial court\u2019s redetermination of the ultimate issue on the proper grounds.\u201d <em>(In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 496.) This language might be tortured to support the father\u2019s sweeping contention, (though it speaks of \u201csome\u201d invalid findings), that any one invalid finding mandates reversal. However, the Supreme Court in <em>Carmaleta B. </em>went on to explain that, if the hearing court had concluded the mother was not mentally ill and had realized that its judgment would separate the siblings, it might well have reached a different result. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It stated that it could not conclude that the erroneous findings were \u201csurplus-age\u201d or that there was \u201cno real doubt\u201d as to the decision the trial court would have reached in the absence of the erroneous findings. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>suggests that the court was in reality engaging in a \u201charmless error\u201d type analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Only five subsequent cases have referred to the <em>Carmaleta B. </em>discussion set out above. In none of them has <em>Carmaleta B. </em>been given the broad scope that the father urges here. Four of the cases involve either a lack of the absolutely essential finding of detriment or an invalid finding of detriment. None include any holding on the question of a required remand to the trial court for redetermination of the ultimate issue if some but not all of a court\u2019s findings under section 232, subdivision (a) are in error. <em>(In re Geoffrey G. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 412, 422 [159 Cal.Rptr. 460]; <em>In re Jack. H., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p. 266-269; <em>Adoption of Christopher S. </em>(1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 433, 436-440 [242 Cal.Rptr. 866]; <em>In re Randi D. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 624, 629, fn. 3 [257 Cal.Rptr. 421].) The fifth case involves a failure of a magistrate to exercise discretion in a criminal case to determine whether a defendant might cross-examine a witness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 796, 802-803 [207 Cal.Rptr. 846].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In <em>In re Jack H., </em>the court stated in dicta that invalidity of \u201cany one [finding] alone\u201d would be sufficient for reversal, but it actually held that all of the grounds upon which the court had found the children entitled to be freed from the custody and care of their mother were invalid, and also held that the trial court\u2019s finding of detriment was based on an erroneous conception of the meaning of detriment under section 4600. <em>(In re Jack H., supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at pp. 263-269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Based on the above analysis, we determine that the purpose of the above quoted language in <em>Carmaleta B. </em>was to emphasize that a finding of detriment must be made pursuant to section 4600, and that such finding must be supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record, rather than to establish a per se rule that an order severing parental rights must be reversed and remanded for redetermination if the court erred in finding that a minor came within the description of any one of a number of alleged statutory grounds under subdivision (a) of section ^32.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We conclude that there is ample evidence in the record to support a finding of detriment in this case as to both minors, and that there is no \u201creal doubt\u201d that the juvenile court would have reached the same decision in this case absent the erroneous finding under section 232, subdivision (a)(4) that the father had committed a felony which rendered him unfit to parent. <em>(In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 496.) Consequently, we hold that there is no ground upon which to reverse and remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Hollenhorst, Acting P.
