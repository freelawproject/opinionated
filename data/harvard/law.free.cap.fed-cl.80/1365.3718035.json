That section gives relief to a taxpayer when an item of income previously included in gross income is repaid in a year in which the tax rate is lower. Quaker cited payments it made in settlement of an antitrust suit brought by its suppliers of crude oil and argued that those payments retroactively increased Quaker\u2019s cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) in past years, and thus supported retroactive recalculation of taxes previously paid. The Court of Federal Claims agreed. We <em>reverse in part.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"af--dedup-0\">A <em>Section 13Jpl</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">\u201cIncome taxes must be paid on income received (or accrued) during an annual accounting period.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>340 U.S. 590, 592, 71 S.Ct. 522, 95 L.Ed. 560 (1951). Annual accounting calculates tax due on events taking place during the taxable year without regard to events in prior or subsequent years. Under the \u201cclaim of right\u201d doctrine, the taxpayer must include an item of income over which it has a claim of right, or full control, even if that right is imperfect\u2014that is, even if the taxpayer may have to give up, or repay, that income down the road. \u201cShould it later appear that the taxpayer was not entitled to keep the money, ... he would be entitled to a deduction in the year of repayment; the taxes due for the year of receipt would not be affected.\u201d <em>United States v. Skelly Oil Co., </em>394 U.S. 678, 680-81, 89 S.Ct. 1379, 22 L.Ed.2d 642 (1969). The offset afforded by the claim of right doctrine can become imperfect if \u201cthe tax benefit from the deduction in the year of repayment [differs] from the increase in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>taxes attributable to the receipt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681, 89 S.Ct. 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Congress passed \u00a7 1341 to make the taxpayer whole in cases where the tax rate is lower in the year of repayment than in the year of original receipt. Section 1341 \u201capplies when a taxpayer repays money in a current year that belongs to someone else, but was money that [the taxpayer] received and included in gross income in a prior year.\u201d <em>Culley v. United States, </em>222 F.3d 1331, 1332 (Fed.Cir.2000). The title of the section is: \u201cComputation of tax where taxpayer restores substantial amount held under claim of right.\u201d The provision operates in the following contingency:</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">If</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">(1) an item was included in gross income for a prior taxable year (or years) because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-7\">(2) a deduction is allowable for the taxable year because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year (or years) that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item or to a portion of such item; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-8\">(3) the amount of such deduction exceeds $3,000....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a). In that event, the taxpayer \u201cis entitled to either the equivalent of a refund for income tax paid in the earlier year, or a deduction from income in the year of repayment, whichever is more beneficial to the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Chernin v. United States, </em>149 F.3d 805, 815 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">To qualify for \u00a7 1341 relief, the taxpayer must satisfy various non-textual requirements, two of which are relevant here. First, \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s obligation to repay must arise out of the specific \u2018circumstances, terms and conditions\u2019 of the transaction whereby the amount was originally included in ... income.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Comm\u2019r, </em>756 F.2d 44, 47 (6th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Paid v. Comm\u2019r, </em>67 T.C. 286, 289-91, 1976 WL 3655 (1976)). This has been called the \u201csame circumstances\u201d test. Second, the deduction must be \u201callowable\u201d under a provision of the Code other than \u00a7 1341. <em>See Skelly Oil Co., </em>394 U.S. at 683, 89 S.Ct. 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Section 1341 is further limited by the so-called \u201cinventory\u201d exception, which precludes relief for \u201cany deduction allowable with respect to an item which was included in gross income by reason of the sale\u201d of inventory or stock in trade. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">\n<em>B. Quaker\u2019s Claim for Relief.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">Quaker refines and blends crude oils, and sells its petroleum products to consumers. In 1994, Quaker was sued in a class action by its suppliers of Penn Grade crude. The suppliers charged that, beginning in 1981, Quaker fixed crude oil prices, and lowered and maintained them, in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. Quaker settled with the class in December 1995 for $4.4 million, of which $2.9 million was paid to the suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">On its 1995 and 1996 tax returns, Quaker deducted the settlement payments as \u201cother deductions,\u201d a treatment the IRS did not challenge. Later, Quaker filed amended tax returns seeking a refund under \u00a7 1341 on the theory that its taxable gross income for the years 1981 through 1995 had been overstated by $4.4 million, the cost of settling the class action lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">The IRS disallowed Quaker\u2019s claim for \u00a7 1341 relief. Quaker challenged that determination in the Court of Federal Claims, contending that: if it had incurred the settlement costs during the years when it was buying Penn Grade crude from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>suppliers, its COGS would have been higher and its gross income lower by a corresponding amount; the settlement payments established that Quaker no longer had an unrestricted right to its prior understatement of COGS; \u00a7 1341 applies to the settlement payments, which paid or restored to its suppliers an item included in gross income, ie., understated COGS. The Court of Federal Claims granted Quaker\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on that claim (the only claim then left in the case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>). <em>Pennzoil-Quaker State Co. v. United States, </em>62 Fed.Cl. 689 (2004). The government appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The Federal Circuit has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Adams v. United States, 471 </em>F.3d 1321, 1324 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">The government argues chiefly that \u00a7 1341 relief is unavailable (1) because Quaker fails to link its settlement payments to its understatement of COGS and (2) because (even if Quaker otherwise satisfies the elements of \u00a7 1341(a)) the inventory exception bars relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">We agree that Quaker\u2019s claim fails because the settlement payments did not arise from the same circumstances as Quaker\u2019s past understatement of COGS. Moreover, even if Quaker\u2019s claim did not suffer that fatal flaw, relief under \u00a7 1341 would be barred by the inventory exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">\u201cThe \u2018claim of right\u2019 interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to [the annual accounting] period, and is ... deeply rooted in the federal tax system.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>340 U.S. at 592, 71 S.Ct. 522. Section 1341 is an exception to the claim of right doctrine. The \u201csame circumstances\u201d test, formulated by the Tax Court, \u201cprovides appropriate, workable limits\u201d to that exception. <em>Dominion Res. Inc. v. United States, </em>219 F.3d 359, 367 (4th Cir.2000). The limitations are that \u201c \u2018the requisite lack of an unrestricted right to an income item permitting deduction must arise out of the circumstances, terms, and conditions of the original payment of such item to the taxpayer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pahl, </em>67 T.C. at 290).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">An example of the rule in practice is <em>Bailey, </em>in which the taxpayer received dividends, salary, and bonuses as the officer of a corporation, and later paid a civil penalty for violating an FTC order in the work he did for the company. The taxpayer claimed that his payment of the penalty restored an item of income included in his gross income in previous years. The Sixth Circuit invoked the \u201csame circumstances\u201d test to deny \u00a7 1341 relief, reasoning that the FTC penalty \u201carose from the fact that Bailey violated the consent order, and not from the \u2018circumstances, terms, and conditions\u2019 of his original receipt of salary and dividend payments,\u201d and that \u201cthe amount of the penalty was not computed with reference to the amount of his salary, dividends, and bonuses, and bears no relationship to those amounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>The \u201csame circumstances\u201d test likewise barred relief in <em>Uhlenbrock v. Commissioner, </em>67 T.C. 818, 1977 WL 3755 (1977). There, the executor of estate received compensation (as executor) and funds (as legatee); subsequently, the IRS assessed the estate and found the executor partly liable for additional taxes (as both transferee and fiduciary of estate). The Tax Court held that \u00a7 1341 did not apply to the executor\u2019s share of the assessment because his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-4\">receipt of commissions and his liability for payment of the penalty were separate and distinct transactions; unquestionably, he would have incurred the liability, even if he had received no commissions. Moreover, the amount he received from the estate as commissions bore no relationship to the amount he became obligated to pay the United States</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 823. Similarly, in <em>Kraft v. United States, </em>991 F.2d 292 (6th Cir.1993), the court barred application of \u00a7 1341 where the item included in income (medical fees from Blue Cross) \u201cdid not arise out of the same circumstances, terms and conditions\u201d as taxpayer\u2019s restitution payment for fraud (to Blue Cross). <em>Id. </em>at 295. <em>See Reynolds Metals Co. v. United States, </em>389 F.Supp.2d 692, 702 (E.D.Va.2005) (denying relief where corporation\u2019s revenues in prior taxable years \u201cbore no relationship to the amount it became obligated to pay for environmental clean-up\u201d in later year, which was \u201cthe result of the enactment of retroactive environmental laws\u201d); <em>Griffiths v. United States, </em>54 Fed.Cl. 198, 202 (2002) (concluding that taxpayer\u2019s settlement of claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty arising out of her business had \u201cno connection\u201d to consulting fees she received after selling the business).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In short, where the later payment arises from a different commercial relationship or legal obligation, and thus is not a counterpart or complement of the item of income originally received, the \u201csame circumstances\u201d test precludes application of \u00a7 1341. <em>Cf. Dominion Res., Inc., </em>219 F.3d at 368 (finding same circumstances test satisfied where public utility\u2019s \u201cauthorization from regulatory authorities to collect [the charges] and its obligation to repay [portions of the charges] arose from ... liability to the federal government for deferred income taxes,\u201d even though the utility did not repay the same customers who paid the original charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Quaker characterizes as follows the connection between the item previously included in its gross income (understatement of COGS) and the item recently restored (the settlement payments):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">[F]rom 1981 to 1995 [Quaker] purchased Penn Grade Crude from independent oil producers who were later plaintiffs in the ... class action.... [T]hese plaintiffs alleged that Quaker underpaid on its purchases (i.e., the \u201corigin of the claim\u201d is Quaker\u2019s 1981 to 1995 purchases of crude oil from the independent oil producers).... [T]he payment at issue related to Quaker\u2019s singular transactional relationship with [its crude oil suppliers].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Quaker Br. at 39. The government argues that this connection does not satisfy the same circumstances test, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Quaker fails the test because the two transactions are not complementary in terms of (1) the theory of deductibility, (2) the taxpayer\u2019s tax treatment, or (3) the underlying transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">(1) Section 1341 \u201capplies only if \u2018a deduction is allowable\u2019 for the year in question. In other words, the \u2018item\u2019 referred to in \u00a7 1341 must qualify for a deduction under some other portion of the Code.\u201d <em>MidAmerican Energy Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>271 F.3d 740, 743 (8th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Wi-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number><em>cor, Inc. v. United States, </em>263 F.3d 659, 662 (7th Cir.2001)). The parties agree that Quaker can deduct the settlement payments as \u201can ordinary and necessary [business] expense\u201d pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162. The IRS did not dispute that treatment in Quaker\u2019s initial filings for 1996 and 1997. But COGS, the item Quaker claims was included in its gross income, is not deductible. \u201cThe cost of goods sold, if underreported, is not a deduction from income. Rather it is an expenditure which, when correctly stated, the taxpayer is entitled to subtract from his or her gross receipts in the process of computing gross profit and, thus, total income.\u201d <em>United States v. Fawaz, </em>881 F.2d 259, 264 (6th Cir.1989); <em>see In re Lilly, </em>76 F.3d 568, 572 (4th Cir.1996) (\u201csuch costs cannot logically be treated as deductions from gross income\u201d); <em>Metra Chem. Corp. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>88 T.C. 654, 661, 1987 WL 49292 (1987) (COGS is not treated as deduction from gross income, but rather is \u201csubtracted from gross receipts to arrive at gross income\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">(2) It follows that Quaker\u2019s claim contains a big\u2014and fatal\u2014conceptual defect: for purposes of the \u201citem included\u201d requirement under subsection (a)(1), Quaker treats the $2.9 million as COGS; but for purposes of \u201cdeduction allowable\u201d requirement under subsection (a)(2), Quaker treats it as a settlement payment. There is thus a disconnect between the purported item included in gross income (understatement of COGS) and the item restored (a negotiated lump sum payment to settle a lawsuit). This problem is intractable: COGS cannot be deducted, and settlement payments are not included in gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">(3) There was no restoration at work here. Quaker received funds from its petroleum product customers; Quaker subsequently passed some of those funds to its crude oil suppliers under the settlement agreement. We need not decide whether restoration requires the repayment of a sum calculated according to the same principles, in respect of the same transaction, paid to the same person; here, the sum was calculated to meet the needs of a different transaction with payment to another party altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The government makes this argument forcefully, and Quaker largely concedes that it has not \u201crestored\u201d a sum to the same party on account of the same transaction or series of transactions. Instead, Quaker argues that because the term \u201crestoration\u201d appears nowhere in the text of \u00a7 1341\u2014but only in the title\u2014there is no restoration requirement at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">True, \u201cthe title of a statute ... cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.\u201d <em>Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corrs. v. Yeskey, </em>524 U.S. 206, 212, 118 S.Ct. 1952, 141 L.Ed.2d 215 (1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But restoration is a requirement of \u00a7 1341 imposed by the courts, which we decline to revisit. <em>See Culley v. United States, </em>222 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed.Cir.2000). (explaining that taxpayer \u201cmust also show that the $3 million he <em>restored ... </em>related to items included in his gross income in [the prior taxable year]\u201d and that \u201cit appeared he had an unrestricted right to those items in [that year]\u201d (emphasis added)); Che<em>rnin v. United States, </em>149 F.3d 805, 816 (8th Cir.1998) (\u201cWe therefore conclude that under section 1341(a)(2), funds must actually be repaid to establish that the unrestricted right to those funds has been lost.\u201d); <em>Reynolds Metals, </em>389 F.Supp.2d at 699 (noting the \u201csimplicity embodied\u201d by \u00a7 1341 \u201cso that taxpayer is restoring an amount previously received to his boss, an estate, a partnership or a trust, for example\u201d); <em>see also Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation </em>\u00a7 12A:127 (2007) (\u201cA taxpayer\u2019s relief un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>der Section 1341 resides in the computation of the tax for the year for which he may be allowed the deduction of the amount <em>restored.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Moreover, the Treasury regulation that interprets \u00a7 1341\u2014which is \u201cbinding so long as [it] implement[s] congressional mandate in some reasonable manner and [is] not arbitrary, capricious or manifestly contrary to the Internal Revenue Code,\u201d <em>Suzy\u2019s Zoo v. Comm\u2019r, </em>273 F.3d 875, 881 n. 7 (9th Cir.2001)\u2014speaks directly to a restoration requirement. Titled <em>\u201cRestoration </em>of amounts received or accrued under claim of right,\u201d the regulation explains that \u00a7 1341 applies \u201c[i]f ... the taxpayer is entitled ... to a deduction ... because of the <em>restoration </em>to another of an item which was included in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income for a prior taxable year (or years) under a claim of right.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1341-l(a) (emphasis added). The regulation goes on to define \u201crestoration to another\u201d as \u201ca restoration resulting because it was established after the close of such prior taxable year (or years) that the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item (or portion thereof).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Accordingly, we hold that Quaker cannot invoke \u00a7 1341 for its settlement payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Section 1341 does not apply here for an alternative reason: the inventory exception. The inventory exception precludes \u00a7 1341 relief for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4I\">any deduction allowable with respect to an item which was included in gross income by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade of the taxpayer (or other property of a kind which would properly have been included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the prior taxable year) or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(b)(2). Significantly (for a reason set forth infra), the inventory exception is inapplicable</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahl-dedup-1\">if the deduction arises out of refunds or repayments with respect to rates made by a regulated public utility ... if such refunds or repayments are required to be made by the Government, political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality referred to in such section, or by an order of a court, or are made in settlement of litigation or under threat or imminence of litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">Quaker and the government read the inventory exception to say different things. For purposes of analysis, the relevant language is in the following three phrases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">[A] any deduction allowable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-12\">[B] with respect to an item which was included in gross income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-13\">[C] because of the sale or other disposition of ... property such as inventory</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">The controversy is over which phrase, [A] or [B], is modified by [C].</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">Quaker argues that [C] modifies [A], and therefore that the exception applies only where the \u201cdeduction in the current year is allowable \u2018by reason of the sale or other disposition of <em>[inventory]\u2019\u2014i.e., </em>an inventory-type deduction such as sales returns, allowances and similar items.\u201d Quaker Br. at 46. If this reading is correct, Quaker\u2019s claim withstands the exception because its proposed deduction (for class action settlement expenses) does not stem from a return of sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">The government argues that [C] modifies [B], and therefore that the exception applies when the \u201citem of gross income received in a prior year ... was attributable to the taxpayer\u2019s sale of products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>properly classified as inventory.\u201d Government Br. at 54. Under this interpretation, Quaker\u2019s claim would be disallowed because the \u201citem included in gross income\u201d\u2014an understatement of COGS\u2014is attributable to Quaker\u2019s sale of inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In aid of its interpretation, Quaker points to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 462, which was enacted the same year as the inventory exception (and repealed three years later). Essentially, \u00a7 462 allowed retailers to estimate future sales returns and set aside a reserve account based on those estimates; retailers could then deduct the amount placed in the reserve account from their taxable income. Quaker contends that the legislative history illustrates that the inventory exception was designed to assure that taxpayers could not obtain relief under <em>both </em>sections 1341 <em>and </em>462. Accordingly, argues Quaker, the inventory exception applies only when the taxpayer\u2019s proposed deduction is based on sales returns or allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Quaker also relies on the Treasury Regulation, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">[T]he provisions of section 1341 ... do not apply to deductions attributable to items which were included in gross income by reason of the sale or other disposition of stock in trade of the taxpayer ... or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer\u2019s trade or business. This section is, <em>therefore, not applicable to sales returns and allowances and similar items.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1341-l(f) (emphasis added). Quaker reads the underlined phrase to say that the inventory exception applies exclusively to \u201csales returns and allowances and similar items.\u201d Quaker Br. at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">\u201cOur first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">The wording of the inventory exception is clear as a grammatical matter. A modifying phrase attaches to its closest referent; so phrase [C] (\u201cbecause of the sale ... of ... inventory\u201d) would ordinarily modify phrase [B] (\u201cwhich was included in gross income\u201d). Accordingly, if the \u201citem was included in gross income for a prior taxable year\u201d because of the sale of inventory, then the inventory exception precludes section 1341 relief. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1). The Treasury Regulation, which recites the inventory exception and infers \u201ctherefore\u201d that \u00a7 1341 provides no relief for transactions in inventory, is not to the contrary. The word \u201ctherefore\u201d means \u201cas a consequence [or] it must follow.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, <em>The Elements of Legal Style </em>141 (1991). The Treasury Regulation can be made to say no more than that \u201csales returns and allowances and similar items\u201d are examples of situations where the inventory exception applies; they do not delimit the exception. <em>Mertens, </em>a leading tax treatise, explains that the inventory exception \u201cis not limited to sales returns, but [rather] the Regulations use this merely to provide an example of the inventory exception. For example, amounts for which the taxpayer is liable due to a patent infringement fall within this exception if the infringement is related to the inventory goods.\u201d <em>Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation </em>\u00a7 12A-.130 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">Moreover, if the inventory exception were limited to sales returns and allowances, it would have been unnecessary to carve out public utilities\u2019 refunds or repay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>ments in the final sentence of \u00a7 1341(b)(2). A \u201csales return\u201d is defined as \u201cmerchandise given back to the seller because of defects,\u201d while a \u201csales allowance\u201d is defined as a \u201creduction in the selling price of goods because of a particular problem <em>(e.g., </em>breakage, quality deficiency, incorrect quantity).\u201d <em>Dictionary of Accounting Terms </em>387, 386 (3d ed.2000). A public utility\u2019s government- or court-ordered rate refund is neither of those things. Quaker\u2019s narrow interpretation of the inventory exception would therefore render the public utility exception to the inventory exception superfluous\u2014an impermissible reading. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (\u201cIt is ... a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Finally, the plain language of \u00a7 1341 makes no reference to \u00a7 462. We are therefore unconvinced that the legislative history of \u00a7 462 can bear the weight Quaker gives it.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that the inventory exception applies where the item was included in gross income because of the sale of inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">COGS, or cost of sales, is \u201cthe price of buying or making an item that is sold.\u201d <em>Dictionary of Accounting Terms </em>110. Over a given period, it is calculated as the dollar value of beginning inventory, plus purchases, less the dollar value of ending inventory. <em>Id. </em>at 111. In short, COGS is a measure of inventory sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Quaker claims that by underpaying for crude oil, it overstated its gross income. That is another way of saying that it underpaid for inventory and thereby overstated its inventory sales. The <em>sale </em>of inventory is inextricably linked to the purchase of inventory <em>to sell. </em>Therefore, even if Quaker could make the link between its understatement of COGS and its subsequent settlement payments, the inventory exception would bar relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is <em>REVERSED IN PART.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Costs to appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-16\">. On appeal, the government does not dispute the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of Quaker in the amounts of $254,401 for tax year 1996 and $1,907,545 for tax year 1997. Accordingly, that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-11\">. Quaker also brought a claim for tax relief in connection with benefit payments it made to coal miners who were disabled by black lung disease. At the summary judgment stage, Quaker no longer contested the government\u2019s opposition to its black lung claim; accordingly, the Court of Federal Claims entered summary judgment for the government on that claim, a ruling Quaker does not challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b835-13\">PROST, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AI1\">concurring-in-part.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">I join the majority opinion with respect to part II, and therefore concur in the result. I believe the inventory exception applies to exclude from 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a) the transactions in this case, as clearly explained by the majority opinion. I would, however, reverse solely on that ground because I have some doubts about the government\u2019s position with respect to the initial applicability of \u00a7 1341 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">As an initial matter, I believe that the \u201citem\u201d included in gross income refers here to Quaker\u2019s \u201cgross income derived from business,\u201d as set forth in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61. Just as the cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) is a component in the calculation of income, not a separate deduction, the \u201citem\u201d at issue in this case refers to Pennzoil-Quaker State Company\u2019s (\u201cQuaker\u2019s\u201d) business income as a whole; COGS comprises one component of that income. When the settlement payment resulted from underpayment of COGS\u2014a transaction affecting the item included in income\u2014the requirements of \u00a7 1341(a) were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">The government argues for, and the majority adopts, a requirement that the item included in income, to which \u00a7 1341 applies, must itself qualify for a deduction. But any requirement for such a close rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>tionship between the item included in income and the later deduction finds little support in the statute or case law. The statute simply requires a deduction allowable \u201cbecause ... the taxpayer did not have an unrestricted right to such item.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341(a). I read no requirement that the item itself qualify for a deduction, but rather understand the statute to require only that the deduction be a result of a change in the taxpayer\u2019s right to the item. Indeed, in many circumstances, the \u201citem\u201d included would result from receipts that increased the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income in a prior year; such receipts would never constitute the basis for a deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Case law addressing the relationship between the item included in income and the later deduction offers little guidance. Reliance on <em>MidAmerican Energy Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>271 F.3d 740 (8th Cir.2001), seems misplaced where that decision merely characterized a prior decision from the Seventh Circuit, <em>Wicor, Inc. v. United States, </em>263 F.3d 659 (7th Cir.2001). In <em>Wicor, </em>the court was discussing whether <em>anything </em>in the case qualified as a deduction, not whether the item included in income could qualify for a deduction. <em>Id. </em>at 662. I have no doubt that COGS is merely one component in the computation of income from business. But the unavailability of a deduction for COGS does not mean that \u00a7 1341 cannot apply to transactions involving COGS. In short, neither the statute nor the case law requires the type of relationship argued by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Here, Quaker took an ordinary business expense deduction as a result of settling a lawsuit that challenged the price Quaker paid for raw goods. Quaker made the settlement payment because it owed more money than it paid for those goods; as a result, it did not have an unrestricted right to the full income it had stated in earlier years. As I read the statute, this course of events satisfies \u00a7 1341(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Finally, I see no requirement for a \u201crestoration\u201d in the statute such that the taxpayer claiming treatment under \u00a7 1341 must return money to a party that had previously given the taxpayer money. Unlike the majority, I do not read <em>Culley v. United States </em>to establish any restoration requirement. 222 F.3d 1331 (Fed.Cir.2000). Rather, the taxpayer in that case undoubtedly made a restoration\u2014by returning money to the parties that had paid the taxpayer initially. <em>Id. </em>at 1335. The only two issues, therefore, were whether the restoration <em>related </em>to the items included in gross income, and whether it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to the item in the prior year. <em>Id. </em>The court explicitly limited its analysis to the latter question of the appearance of an \u201cunrestricted right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, I do not read this case as establishing a restoration requirement under \u00a7 1341. Nothing in the statute limits its applicability to repayment of prior receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Having rejected the grounds upon which the government relies for its position in this case, I would hold that Quaker can invoke \u00a7 1341 for its settlement payments. As the majority explains, however, the inventory exception of \u00a7 1341(b) precludes favorable tax treatment for Quaker in this instance. Therefore, I join the majority in reversing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
