Barbara Snyder (\u201cSnyder\u201d)) $804,323.90 under the National Vaccine Compensation Program (\u201cProgram\u201d). <em>Zatuchni v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>73 Fed.Cl. 451 (2006). The government concedes that $250,000 was properly awarded as a death benefit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(2), but asserts that the remaining $554,323.90, representing compensation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(l), (3), and (4) for vaccine-related injuries suffered by Snyder prior to her death, may not be awarded because the death benefit is the sole remedy for a petitioner who dies as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>the administration of a vaccine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Snyder received a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine on February 10, 1992, at the age of 45. The Court of Federal Claims summarized the events that followed her vaccination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">Within two weeks of the vaccination, Ms. Snyder developed ... a rash, swollen lymph nodes, a fever, and severe pain throughout her joints and muscles. Soon thereafter, Ms. Snyder experienced other symptoms, which her physicians diagnosed as continuing chronic arthralgia and [fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) ] attributable to the rubella portion of the MMR vaccination.!<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] Over the next 13 years, Ms. Snyder\u2019s physical condition deteriorated rapidly and significantly---- [She] found it impossible to continue working ... [e]ventually[ ] ... ambulated only with a walker, ... [and] required a nurse\u2019s aid to assist her with daily living functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-8\"><em>Zatuchni v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>73 Fed.Cl. 451, 452-53 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">On January 31, 1994, Snyder filed a petition for compensation with the Program. As detailed in <em>Snyder v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>No. 94-58V, 2005 WL 1230787, at *3-*5 (Fed.Cl. Spec.Mstr. May 6, 2005), the government conceded on May 2, 1994, that Snyder\u2019s chronic joint pain was caused by the MMR vaccination; Snyder, however, also sought compensation for her other symptoms, and obtained several stays of her petition in order to gather expert testimony in support of her claims and to pursue settlement discussions with the government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result of these delays, Snyder\u2019s petition remained pending before the special master until May 6, 2005, when her petition was denied for failure to demonstrate that the MMR vaccination caused her symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at *20.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Neither party was aware, however, that Snyder had died on April 28, 2005, several days before the special master\u2019s decision. Following the resolution of a brief procedural challenge pursuant to Rule 25(a)(1) of the Rules of the Court of Federal Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d), Zatuchni was substituted as a party for Snyder and appealed the special master\u2019s determination. <em>Snyder v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>69 Fed.Cl. 390 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">On February 9, 2006, the Court of Federal Claims reversed the special master\u2019s determination, concluding that Snyder had met her burden to demonstrate that her symptoms were caused by the vaccine. The court remanded the case to the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>master to determine the amount of compensation to which her estate was entitled and whether Snyder\u2019s death was vaccine-related. <em>Zatuchni v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human </em>Servs., 69 Fed.Cl. 612, 622-24 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The special master issued a decision on remand on May 10, 2006, concluding that Snyder\u2019s death had been vaccine-related, and that her estate was therefore entitled to the $250,000 death benefit provided for under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(2). <em>Za-tuchni v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. 94-58V, 2006 WL 1499982, at *6 (Fed. Cl. May 10, 2006). The special master also found -that Snyder would have been entitled to compensation in the amount of $554,323.90 for her vaccine-related injuries during her lifetime, including actual expenses incurred, pain and suffering, and lost income between the time of the vaccination and her death. <em>Id. </em>at *7-*8. The special master concluded that as a matter of law, however, such compensation could not be paid to her estate because her vaccine-related injury claims did not survive her death. <em>Id. </em>at *9-26. Accordingly, the special master awarded appellant $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">On appeal, the Court of Federal Claims reversed the special master\u2019s determination as to the claim for pre-death vaccine-related injury compensation. <em>Zatuchni v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>73 Fed.Cl. 451, 459 (2006). It concluded that Snyder\u2019s injury claims did not abate upon her death, and accordingly awarded her estate $804,323.90, consisting of the $250,000 death benefit and compensation for injuries during her lifetime in the amount of $554,323.90. <em>Id. </em>The government appeals the award of the latter amount. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The instant appeal requires us to determine whether the petitioner may receive the compensation for medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering provided for under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(1), (3) and (4), in addition to the $250,000 death benefit provided for under \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(2). The opinion below held that such compensation may be awarded; the government contends on appeal that such compensation may not be awarded because the death benefit is the sole remedy for a petitioner who dies as a result of the administration of a vaccine, and that claims for compensation under \u00a7 300aa-15(1), (3), and (4) do not survive the death of a vaccine-injured person under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">The question of whether compensation under these subsections may be paid to the petitioner\u2019s estate following her vaccine-related death presents a question of statutory interpretation, and requires an analysis of the text and structure of the applicable statute. <em>Cf. Seymour v. Principi </em>245 F.3d 1377, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2001) (addressing the survivability of claims for veteran\u2019s benefits under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151); <em>Richard v. West, </em>161 F.3d 719, 722 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201c[Claimant\u2019s] statutory argument cannot overcome the clear intent expressed by the structure and language of the statutory scheme at issue\u2014that a veteran\u2019s claim to disability benefits terminates at death.\u201d). We review de novo the judgment of the court below on this question. <em>Markovich v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>477 F.3d 1353, 1355-56 (Fed.Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">The Program was established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>1986, Pub.L. No. 99-660, tit. Ill, 100 Stat. 3743, 3755 (1986) (\u201cVaccine Act\u201d). As we have previously noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-4\">Congress instituted this compensatory program because the traditional civil tort actions against vaccine manufacturers were producing undesirable results both with respect to the victims and the vaccine industry. Congress found that the traditional tort system was not working for victims because it resulted in lengthy delays, high transaction costs, and sometimes no recovery. Similarly, the high cost of litigation and difficulty of obtaining insurance was undermining incentives for vaccine manufacturers to remain in the vaccine market. In sum, Congress was concerned with the instability and unpredictability in the childhood vaccine market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-5\"><em>Lowry v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>189 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citing H.R. Rep. 99-908, at 6-7, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6344, 6347-48 <em>(\u201cHouse Report </em>\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">As its structure reflects, the Program was \u201cintended to be expeditious and fair\u201d and \u201cto compensate persons with recognized vaccine injuries without requiring the difficult individual determinations of causation of injury and without a demonstration that a manufacturer was negligent or that a vaccine was defective.\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 12, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6353; <em>see also id. </em>at 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6354. (\u201cThe Committee anticipates that the speed of the compensation program, the low transaction costs of the system, the no-fault nature of the required findings, and the relative certainty and generosity of the system\u2019s awards will divert a significant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation.\u201d). \u201cAny person who has sustained a vaccine-related injury, the legal representative of such person if such person is a minor or is disabled, or the legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table\u201d may file a petition under the Program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-14 (Vaccine Injury Table).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Causation is \u201cpresumed\u201d where \u201can injury or condition listed in the Vaccine Injury Table begins to manifest itself within the time specified in the Table for the vaccine in question.\u201d <em>Hines v.

A petition for compensation arising out of a vaccination administered before October 1, 1988 (a \u201cpre-Act\u201d petition), must have been filed within 28 months of that date, and, in any event, \u201cno such petition may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>filed if the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant aggravation of such injury occurred more than 36 months after the date of administration of the vaccine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-16(a)(l). A petition for compensation arising out of a vaccination administered after October 1, 1988 (a \u201cpost-Act\u201d petition) must be filed within 36 months of the onset of symptoms; \u201cif a death occurred,\u201d a petition must be filed within 24 months of the death and no more than 48 months after the onset of symptoms. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-16(a)(2)-(3). In turn, once a petition is received, a special master of the United States Court of Federal Claims must issue a decision within 240 days (with some time excepted), and stays are generally limited.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The types of compensation available to a petitioner under the Program are listed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15. Section 300aa-15(a) addresses post-Act petitions, such as the petition at issue here; subsection (b) addresses pre-Act petitions. Subsection (a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">Compensation awarded under the Program to a petitioner under section 300aa-ll of this title for a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1,1988, shall include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">(1) (A) Actual unreimbursable expenses incurred from the date of the judgment awarding such expenses and reasonable projected unreimbursable expenses which ... result from the vaccine-related injury for which the petitioner seeks compensation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">(B) Subject to section 300aa-16(a)(2) of this title, actual unreimbursable expenses incurred before the date of the judgment awarding such expenses which ... resulted from the vaccine-related injury for which the petitioner seeks compensation....[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">(2) In the event of a vaccine-related death, an award of $250,000 for the estate of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-12\">(A) In the case of any person who has sustained a vaccine-related injury after attaining the age of 18 and whose earning capacity is or has been impaired by reason of such person\u2019s vaccine-related injury for which compensation is to be awarded, compensation for actual and anticipated loss of earnings determined in accordance with generally recognized actuarial principles and projections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-13\">(4) For actual and projected pain and suffering and emotional distress from the vaccine-related injury, an award not to exceed $250,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-15(a). Subsection (b) incorporates by reference most of the categories of compensation established in subsection (a), but is structured somewhat differently, does not permit recovery of unreimbursa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>ble expenses incurred before the date of judgment, and contains a stricter limit on the amount of compensation that may be awarded for several other categories of compensation. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-4\">Compensation awarded under the Program to a petitioner under section 300aa-ll of this title for a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine before October 1, 1988, may include the compensation described in paragraphs (1)(A) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section and may also include an amount, not to exceed a combined total of $30,000, for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">(1) lost earnings (as provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-6\">(2) pain and suffering (as provided in paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this section), and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-7\">(3) reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs (as provided in subsection (e) of this section!) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-8\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-15(b). The Act also provides that compensation will be paid in no more than 3,500 pre-Act cases. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-11(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">The question presented here is whether a petitioner who has suffered a vaccine-related injury and dies from vaccine-related causes while her petition for compensation under \u00a7 300aa-15(a) is pending may recover, in addition to the death benefit provided under \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(2), compensation under subsections (a)(1), (3), and (4). Based on the statutory text and structure outlined above, we answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Most important, the text and structure of \u00a7 300aa-15(a) indicate that the death benefit provided by subsection (a)(2) is not the exclusive remedy where a petitioner has experienced both a vaccine-related injury and a vaccine-related death. First, subsection (a)(2) is not set off from the subsections dealing with compensation for expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering; to the contrary, it is listed between and alongside those provisions, which supports an interpretation in which the death benefit is simply one of several types of compensation that are available in an appropriate case. Second, and perhaps most crucially, the text of subsection (a) as a whole does not, as the government maintains, provide any indication that the death benefit in (a)(2) is the only compensation that may be paid in a \u201cdeath case,\u201d whereas the compensation provided for in subsections (a)(1), (3), and (4) may be paid only in an \u201cinjury case\u201d in which the injured party is still living. Subsection (a) begins with the directive that \u201c[cjompensation ... <em>shall include </em>the following,\u201d and proceeds to list four categories of available compensation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-15(a) (emphasis added). The government argues, however, that despite this inclusive opening language, subsections (a)(1), (3), and (4) state that they provide only compensation for expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering caused by a \u201cvaccine-related injury,\u201d whereas subsection (a)(2) states that it provides $250,000 to an estate only \u201c[i]n the event of a vaccine-related death,\u201d and that this phrasing supports the conclusion that compensation under all four of these provisions is not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">This argument does not withstand scrutiny. Put simply, the fact that a vaccine-related death followed a vaccine-related injury in a particular case does not alter the fact that certain expenses were incurred, wages lost, or pain and suffering endured in the interim, and these damages are no less related to or caused by a vaccine-related injury within the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>of subsections (a)(1), (3), and (4) simply because the vaccine-injured person in question is no longer living. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300-15(a). Thus, it is in no way inconsistent with the text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(a) to award compensation under subsections (a)(1), (3), and (4) for damages that \u201cresulted from\u201d or were sustained \u201cby reason of\u2019 a vaccine-related injury in addition to the death benefit provided for under subsection (a)(2) \u201c[i]n the event of a vaccine-related death.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To the contrary, this is the reading of \u00a7 300aa-15(a) that most naturally flows from its text and structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">This interpretation of \u00a7 300aa-15(a) is confirmed by an analysis of \u00a7 300aa-15(b). The government conceded in oral argument that these two provisions, while differently structured and addressed to different categories of petitions (pre-Act rather than post-Act petitions), should be interpreted consistently with respect to the question of whether compensation for a vaccine-related injury can be awarded after the death of a vaccine-injured person, as neither the statute itself nor the legislative history provides any indication that Congress intended to reach a different result on this point in pre-Act and post-Act cases.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree, and further find that the text and structure of subsection (b) make even more explicit that both \u201cinjury\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>and \u201cdeath\u201d compensation may be available in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Section 300aa-15(b) provides that, in a pre-Act case, compensation \u201cmay include the compensation described in paragraphs (1)(A) <em>and </em>(2) of subsection (a) of this section <em>and may also include </em>... lost earnings [and] pain and suffering\u201d as described in subsections (a)(3) and (4). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-15(b) (emphasis added). Although recovery for lost earnings and pain and suffering (along with attorney\u2019s fees) are capped at $30,000 for a pre-Act recovery under subsection (b), the underscored text establishes beyond cavil that, in a pre-Act case, the statute provides that the death benefit in paragraph (2) may be paid to an estate alongside compensation for post-judgment expenses, lost earnings, and pain and suffering. If we are to read subsections (a) and (b) in parallel, then, the interpretation of subsection (a) outlined above must be adopted here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, as the government\u2019s concession underscores, nothing in the language or structure of the Vaccine Act indicates that Congress intended to provide vaccine-related injury compensation in addition to the death benefit in pre-Act cases but not in post-Act cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Moving beyond \u00a7 300aa-15 itself, the government argues that several other provisions of the statute demonstrate that the Vaccine Act as a whole draws a distinction</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">between vaccine-related injury claims and vaccine-related death claims that precludes a finding that any petitioner might be awarded the compensation contemplated here. Primary reliance is placed on \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A), which describes who \u201cmay ... file a petition for compensation under the Program,\u201d and \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(2), which provides that \u201c[o]nly one petition may be filed with respect to each administration of a vaccine\u201d (the \u201csingle petition rule\u201d). While we are mindful that \u201c[statutes must be read as a whole,\u201d <em>United States v. Atlantic Research Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2331, 2336, 168 L.Ed.2d 28 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), we do not find the government\u2019s arguments on these points to be compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Based on its reading of \u00a7 300aa-11(b)(1)(A), the government contends that because the right to file a claim after the death of a vaccine-injured person is limited to the \u201cthe legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine,\u201d it is apparent that \u201ca person who dies <em>before </em>the filing of a petition cannot request compensation for a vaccine-related injury.\u201d Reasoning from this conclusion, the government argues that vaccine-related injury claims thus do not survive the death of the vaccine-injured person. The government\u2019s reading of this provision goes too far. We need not decide whether \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>would permit the estate of a person who suffered vaccine-related injuries but died of a non-vaccine-related cause to file a petition for vaccine-related injury compensation, and thus express no view on that point;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this provision, however, plainly does not dictate that a properly filed petition by the estate of a person who suffered both vaccine-related injuries and a vaccine-related death (and thus had standing to file under \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A)) may not contain a request for any and all of the types of compensation listed in \u00a7 300aa-15(a). Similarly, as in this case, if a petition is properly filed by a person who suffered a vaccine-related injury, but that person dies of vaccine-related causes while her claim is pending, \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A) does not prevent\u2014directly or by implication\u2014the legal representative of the estate of such a person from requesting each of the categories of compensation listed in \u00a7 300aa-15(a) after they have been properly substituted for the deceased petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">In a related argument, the government contends that the single petition rule of \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(2) also supports its view that the Vaccine Act makes a bright-line distinction between \u201cinjury\u201d cases and \u201cdeath\u201d cases. The government argues that, as a result of this rule, if a vaccine-injured person were to file a petition and receive compensation under \u00a7 300aa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>15(a)(1), (3), and (4) during his lifetime, and were subsequently to die as a result of his vaccine-related injuries, a second petition and recovery under \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(2) would not be permitted. Because it would not be possible to recover both the death benefit and vaccine-related injury compensation under those circumstances, the government contends that the statutory structure contemplates that there are \u201ctwo separate types of petitions\u2014a vaccine injury petition or a vaccine-related death petition\u201d and that the \u201cpursuit of the two separate claims in a single petition\u201d is \u201cprecluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">We, of course, agree that a second petition seeking the death benefit would not be permitted under the circumstances just described; that result is clearly dictated by the single-petition rule in \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(2). It does not follow, however, that because recovery of both the death benefit and vaccine-related injury compensation is not possible in one scenario that it is not possible under another quite different scenario, such as that presented by the instant appeal. As the description above indicates, the Program contains several limitations and trade-offs that restrict recovery, including the statute of limitations, the filing requirements of \u00a7 300aa-ll, the single petition rule, the limitation on the number of pre-Act petitions for which compensation may be awarded, and limits on the amount of compensation that may be paid under certain subsections of \u00a7 300aa-15. Many of these limitations appear to be driven by concerns about the difficulty of establishing causation for injuries or deaths after a significant lapse of time, or about the adequacy of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9510, to cover all petitions that might be filed under the Program. Whatever them origin, that these limitations prevent certain individuals who have undoubtedly suffered as a result of a vaccine from receiving full (or any) compensation is beyond question. Given, however, what we view as the plain meaning of \u00a7 300aa-15\u2014that recovery under \u00a7 300aa-15(a)(l) through (4) is permitted where appropriate\u2014we do not believe that these limiting provisions require us to set aside that meaning here and hold that such a recovery is never possible simply because these limiting provisions indicate that it would be unattainable under certain circumstances, nor do we feel that such a result is either \u201cabsurd\u201d or inconsistent with the text, structure, or spirit of the Vaccine Act as a whole.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Moreover, we note that if the government\u2019s arguments are taken to their logical conclusion, all recovery would be denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>here. The government contends that \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A) and 300aa-ll(b)(2), read together, indicate that a petition may be filed for either a vaccine-related injury or a vaccine-related death, but not for both, and that the compensation available is determined by the identity of the filer: if an estate files, it may only receive a death benefit; if an injured person files, she may only receive injury-related benefits. In this case, however, Snyder filed her claim for vaccine-related injury compensation while she was alive, and the single-petition rule bars the filing of any additional petitions related to the administration of her MMR vaccine. In this scenario, the most logical outcome under the government\u2019s reading of the statute would be to conclude (1) that because Snyder\u2019s estate did not \u201cfile\u201d the claim at issue here within the meaning of \u00a7 300aa-11(b)(1)(A)\u2014but rather has been substituted for the deceased Snyder in order to continue her original petition\u2014it cannot recover anything in connection with her petition; (2) that this petition should therefore be denied; and (3) that because no further petitions may be filed, no recovery is available to the estate. We recognize, of course, that the government has chosen to concede in this appeal that Snyder\u2019s estate is entitled to recover a death benefit, but the result that would follow from an endorsement of the logic of the government\u2019s position\u2014a result that we do not believe is required under the statute\u2014 underscores the imprudence of reading \u00a7 300aa-ll(b) as controlling the types of compensation available rather than, as its text provides, simply describing who \u201cmay ... file a petition for compensation under the Program.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-11(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Given the posture of this case, we also note that there is no procedural difficulty presented by the substitution of a deceased petitioner\u2019s legal representative following a vaccine-related death that prevents us from reaching the result contemplated here. RCFC 25(a)(1) provides that \u201c[i]f a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties.\u201d The Rule also details the procedural requirements for effecting the substitution. RCFC 25. In this case, substitution was made pursuant to this procedure, and while the government contested whether the petitioner\u2019s motion for substitution was timely in light of certain delays in the probate process, this procedural question was resolved in favor of the petitioner and is not challenged here. <em>Snyder v.

The government also argues that Congress\u2019s intent to limit compensation \"[i]n the event of a vaccine-related death\u201d to the death benefit provided in subsection (a)(2) is evidenced by the fact that this subsection is the only one that makes reference to a payment made to an \u201cestate.\u201d We do not view this language in the same light. Read in context, this language seems to establish only that, where a vaccine-related death has occurred, the $250,000 should be paid directly to the deceased individual's estate, and not to some other entity or person, such as a surviving spouse. Similarly, while subsections (a)(1), (3), and (4) do not state that an estate may receive the compensation described therein, neither do they state that only a living vaccine-injured person may do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. In fact, the amendment history of subsection (b) confirms that subsections (a) and (b), as currently written, should be read as providing the same types of compensation in appropriate cases (with one exception). As passed, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(b) restricted recovery in pre-Act cases to \u201cthe compensation described in paragraphs (1)(A) and (2) of subsection <em>(a)\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>to post-judgment expenses and the death benefit. Pub L. No. 99-660, \u00a7 2115(b). In 1987, subsection (b) was amended to expand the categories of compensation available. Rather than simply state which of the types of compensation described in subsection (a) are available in a pre-Act case, this revision instead incorporated subsection (a) by (indirect) reference by providing that compensation in a pre-Act case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-8\">may not include the compensation described in paragraph (1)(B) of subsection (a) <em>[i.e., </em>pre-judgment expenses] and may include attorney's fees and other costs included in a judgment under subsection (e) <em>[i.e., </em>costs and fees], except that the total amount that may be paid as compensation under paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a) <em>[i.e., </em>lost wages and pain and suffering] and included as attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs under subsection (3) may not exceed $30,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Pub L. No. 100-203, \u00a7 4303(e). In essence, subsection (b) was amended to mirror subsection (a) in terms of the types of compensation available, with the exception of the denial of pre-judgment expenses; compensation under all other provisions of subsection (a) was thus made available in a pre-Act case, but compensation for lost wages, pain and suffering, and costs and fees was capped at $30,000. In 1989, subsection (b) was amended again to read as it does today. The legislative history indicates that this last amendment, however, was \"only intended to clarify the amount of damages\u201d available in light of \u201csome confusion about the allowable compensation,\u201d and \u201crepresents no change in policy from the Act\u201d as previously written. H.R. Rep. 101-247, at 514, <em>reprinted in </em>1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1906, 2240. As this legislative history indicates, the current version of subsection (b) is intended to make the connection between the types of compensation available under subsections (a) and (b) even more explicit than was the case in 1987. In sum, then, because both the text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>of subsection (b) and the associated legislative history indicate that subsection (b) is intended to be\u2014with some limited and explicit exceptions\u2014a reflection of subsection (a), subsection (b) is properly read as a guide to the types of compensation available under subsection (a) in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">. This reading of subsection (b) also disposes of the government\u2019s contention that the use of the conjunction \"or\u201d in the first sentence of subsection (a), which notes that compensation will be paid \"for a vaccine-related injury or death,\u201d is intended to indicate that \"injury\u201d compensation <em>or </em>\"death\u201d benefits, but not both, may be paid in a particular case. As subsection (b) demonstrates, this language simply describes the two broad categories of compensation available, which are then further detailed in the subsections that follow, and in no way indicates that an award of one category of compensation precludes an award of the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b902-4\">. The dissent states that our demurer here indicates that we are \"troubled by the possibility of this anomalous result.\u201d Dissent at 1327 n. 5. To the contrary, we are simply declining to decide a question not presented in the case before us. Moreover, we do not find \u201ctroubling\u201d or \"anomalous\u201d the possibility that \u00a7 300aa-l 1(b)(1)(A) would bar the estate of a person who died of non-vaccine-related causes from filing a petition for vaccine-related injury compensation. As noted below, <em>infra </em>at 1321-23, \u00a7 300aa-l 1(b)(1)(A) is simply one of several trade-offs and limitations in the Program, and we express no view on the policy choices reflected in those provisions. By contrast, it may be noted that the federal common law approach offered by the dissent appears to conflict directly with \u00a7 300aa-l 1(b)(1)(A). The dissent\u2019s approach would allow a vaccine-related injury claim to survive in <em>all </em>cases\u2014regardless of the cause of death or whether a petition was filed before or after death\u2014and thus would permit a new petition for vaccine-related injury compensation to be filed by the estate of a person who did not die from a vaccine-related cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The dissent appears willing to endorse such a result in order to \"harmonize the federal scheme with the state alternative\u201d in light of what the dissent perceives as Congress's intent to \"replace\u201d state law remedies with the compensation scheme provided by the Program. Dissent at 1331. The dissent reasons that \"[a] rule in favor of survivorship of vaccine-related injury claims would preserve the Vaccine Act as an effective substitute for the state tort system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This reflects a misreading of the Act. Not only, as the dissent recognizes, are claimants permitted to opt-out of or withdraw from the Program under several circumstances in order to seek remedies in state court, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-11(a)(2)(A), 21(a)-(b), but the Act also explicitly preempts state laws that \"prohibit[] an individual from bringing a civil action against a vaccine manufacturer for damages for a vaccine-related injury or death if such civil action is not barred\u201d under the Program. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-22(e). In short, the Act does not \u201creplace\u201d or provide a \"substitute for\u201d state law remedies; rather, it provides an alternative forum of first resort designed to \u201cdivert a significant number of potential plaintiffs from litigation.\u201d <em>House Report </em>at 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6354. Where compensation is not available under the Program, or is seen by the claimant as unsatisfactory for any reason, however, the Act expressly contemplates that claimants will seek state-law remedies. Thus, faced with a scenario in which compensation is not available under the Program, the appropriate response is not to expand the scope of the Act in order to \"harmonize\u201d the Act with state law, but rather to follow the unambiguous language of the Act and allow the claimant to proceed to state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b903-5\">. The government further contends that the statute of limitations provided in \u00a7 300aa-16(a)(2) and (3), which distinguishes between petitions arising out of \"a vaccine-related injury\u201d and cases in which \"a death occurred as a result of the administration of [a] vaccine,\u201d also supports its view that the Program generally distinguishes between \u201cinjury\u201d cases and \"death\u201d cases. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-16(a)(2)(3). First, we note, again, that these provisions are in no way inconsistent with a system in which petitions for both vaccine-related injury compensation and a death benefit are permitted. (Such a petition would simply fall into the category of cases in which \"a death occurred as a result of the administration of [a] vaccine.\u201d) Second, the legislative history indicates that the statute of limitations\u2014including the distinction drawn between \"vaccine-related injury\u201d cases and cases in which \"a death occurred\u201d\u2014is more readily explained by a concern with avoiding \"difficult individual determinations of causation\u201d in connection with Program petitions, and thus does not necessarily reflect a broader goal of separating \"injury\u201d cases and \"death\u201d cases. <em>House Report </em>at 12, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6353; <em>see also id. </em>at 13, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6354.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b904-4\">.

Without any basis in the statutory text, the majority holds that the Vaccine Act provides for survivorship. In my view, the Vaccine Act is entirely silent as to issues of survivorship. The majority\u2019s approach is contrary to established authority recognized explicitly in eight circuits, and implicitly by the Supreme Court, that surviv-orship is determined as a matter of federal common law when the statute does not explicitly address the question. The majority offers no reason for ignoring this established rule in favor of an untenable construction of the Vaccine Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">This issue arises against a background of pervasive concern about the survival of personal injury claims. At common law, personal injury claims, unlike claims for injury to property, did not survive, but abated upon the death of either the plaintiff or the defendant. <em>See, e.g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 900(a) &amp; cmt. a. (1979); <em>see also </em>Wex S. Malone, <em>The Genesis of Wrongful Death, </em>17 Stan. L.Rev. 1043, 1044 (1965). The modern approach, however, has been to reject the common law rule and allow survivorship. <em>See </em>W.

It is well established that in construing a statute, a court may not \u201cdraw on some unexpressed spirit outside the bounds of the normal meaning of\u2019 the words used in the statute. <em>Addison v.

Any construction of section 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A) to provide affirmatively for survivorship of injury claims, however, would be plainly incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">First, the text of section 300aa-11(b)(1)(A) simply does not address whether a claim for a vaccine related injury survives and can be pursued by the estate of the injured person. The standing language provides that the legal representative of a person \u201cwho has sustained a vaccine-related injury\u201d may file a petition for compensation only if the injured person \u201cis a minor or is disabled.\u201d This language does not address whether a legal representative of a deceased, previously-injured person may file a petition for compensation. The standing provision also authorizes \u201cthe legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table\u201d to bring \u201ca petition for compensation.\u201d This provision of section 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A) clearly refers to a claim for the death benefit provided in section 300aa-15(a)(2) and does not authorize any action with respect to a person who has suffered a vaccine-related <em>injury </em>before death. In addition, there is not a shred of legislative history that would support a construction of section 300aa-11(b)(1)(A) as explicitly providing for sur-vivorship of vaccine-related injury claims, nor does the majority claim that any exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">Second, it is significant that section 300aa-ll does not use language similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>that used in other federal or state statutes that do provide for survivorship. Those statutes use terminology such as \u201cnot abate\u201d or \u201csurvive\u201d to preserve causes of action after death. For example, Congress has explicitly provided that any \u201ccivil action for damages commenced by or on behalf of the United States or in which it is interested <em>shall not abate </em>on the death of a defendant but <em>shall survive and be enforceable </em>against his estate as well as against surviving defendants.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2404 (emphases added). Similarly, the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, in providing for survivorship, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\">Any right of action given by this chapter to a person suffering injury <em>shall survive to his or her personal representative, </em>for the benefit of the surviving widow or husband and children of such employee, and, if none, then of such employee\u2019s parents; and, if none, then of the next of kin dependent upon such employee, but in such cases there shall be only one recovery for the same injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 59 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The vast majority of state statutes also utilize such language. <em>See </em>3 Stuart M. Speiser <em>&amp; </em>James E. Rooks, Jr., <em>Recovery for Wrongful Death, </em>app. A (4th ed.2005) (collecting state statutes). The Vaccine Act contains no similar language addressing the issue of survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Third, and perhaps most significantly, a strained interpretation of section 300aa-11(b)(1)(A) to provide for survivorship would create an anomalous, arbitrary, and unfair result that Congress cannot have intended. The language of the Vaccine Act authorizes an action only by \u201cthe legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">As the government points out, if this language were construed to provide for survival, a petitioner\u2019s claim for vaccine-related injury would survive <em>only </em>if the petitioner died from vaccine-related causes, since the language refers only to \u201cthe legal representative of any person who died as the result of the administration of a vaccine set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the petitioner died of unrelated causes, section 300aa-ll(b)(l)(A) could not be read to provide any standing for the petitioner\u2019s personal representative, and the vaccine-related injury claim would apparently abate. This would leave such a petitioner\u2019s estate no basis for any compensation at all, even though the petitioner would have suffered vaccine-related injuries and associated costs during his or her life. There is no basis in the policy of the Vaccine Act to distinguish, in terms of the availability of compensation for pre-death injury, between a person who suffers a vaccine-related injury and subsequently dies as a result of the vaccination, and a person who suffers the same vaccine-related injury but dies of unrelated causes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress cannot possibly have intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>such a result, and nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended this result. It would be a further stretch to imagine that Congress not only intended such a distinction, but chose to embody it in statutory language that purports only to confer standing on a legal representative to seek the statutory death benefit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Perhaps recognizing that section 300aa-11(b)(1)(A) cannot be read as providing for survivorship, the majority appears to base its finding of survivorship on a negative inference from another provision of the Vaccine Act, section 300aa-15(b), which governs compensation available for so-called pre-Act injuries, that is, those arising from vaccinations administered prior to the 1988 effective date of the Vaccine Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Maj. Op. at 1318-20. However, the majority plainly misreads this section as providing for survivorship. Like section 300aa-11(b)(1)(A), section 300aa-15(b) does not address the issue of survivorship, and it does not use the language \u201csurvive\u201d or \u201cnot abate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The plain language of section 300aa-15(b) limits the compensation available with respect to vaccinations administered prior to the effective date of the Vaccine Act by imposing a $30,000 cap on the total compensation for pain and suffering, lost wages, and attorneys\u2019 fees, while otherwise making available in pre-Vaccine Act cases all of the same categories of compensation available in post-Vaccine Act cases under section 300aa-15(a): medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and the statutory death benefit (in addition to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, as provided in section 300aa-15(e)). The majority relies heavily on the use of the word \u201cand\u201d in section 300aa-15(b) (referring to injury compensation \u201cand\u201d the death benefit) to reach the conclusion that the same individual may recover both compensation for injury and a death benefit. It then appears to read the same conjunctive language into section 300aa-15(a). Maj. Op. at 1319-20. But section 300aa-15(b), in describing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>types of compensation recoverable, like section 300aa-15(a), obviously refers to the various types of compensation recoverable by the <em>class </em>of individuals entitled to sue, not the compensation recoverable by each <em>individual </em>claimant. This is necessarily the case because individuals still alive cannot be entitled to the death benefit under section 300aa-15(a)(2). Moreover, the right of any individual claimant to recover is governed explicitly by section 300aa-ll, not by section 300aa-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">This is made clear by section 300aa-15(b) itself. That section refers, with respect to eligibility to receive compensation, back to the standing provision of section 300aa-ll, specifying the amount of \u201cCompensation awarded under the Program to a petitioner under section 300aa-ll of this title for a vaccine-related injury or death.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(b). Section 300aa-11 governs the right to recovery of the individual claimant. As discussed above, section 300aa-ll tells us nothing about survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Because nothing in the Vaccine Act addresses the issue of survivorship, the issue is properly addressed as a matter of federal common law. \u201c[T]he inevitable incompleteness presented by all legislation means that\u201d it is the \u201cresponsibility of the federal courts ... \u2018to declare ... rules which may be necessary to fill in interstitially or otherwise effectuate the statutory patterns enacted in the large by Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Little Lake Misere Land Co., </em>412 U.S. 580, 593, 93 S.Ct. 2389, 37 L.Ed.2d 187 (1973) (quoting Paul J. Mishkin, <em>The Variousness of \u201cFederal Law\u201d: Competence and Discretion in the Choice of National and State Rules for Decision, </em>105 U. Pa. L.Rev., 797, 800 (1957)); <em>see also Montana v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1269, 1274 (Fed.Cir.1997) (\u201cIf the [relevant federal] statutes are silent ... the federal courts must \u2018fill the interstices of federal legislation according to their own standards.\u2019 Therefore, if no federal statute supplies the rule of law, the court must determine whether to create federal common law or to incorporate state law as the rule of decision.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., </em>440 U.S. 715, 727, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">The issue of survivorship is among the background legal principles for which judicial gap-filling is appropriate. The Supreme Court has impliedly held,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and eight circuits have explicitly held,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>common law determines survivorship where the statute is silent as to the issue. Commentators agree. \u201cIn some statutes creating a federal right of action Congress provides <em>explicitly </em>that the action will survive the death of a party. <em>In the absence of a provision of this kind the court must look to federal common law.\u201d </em>7C Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1954 &amp; n. 12 (3d ed.2007) (footnotes omitted and emphases added). Ample authority from the Supreme Court and eight circuits supports this well-established proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">For example, in <em>United States v. NEC Corp., </em>11 F.3d 136 (11th Cir.1993), the original plaintiff, Williams, had brought a qui tarn action against the United States under the False Claims Act, seeking a portion of the recovery the government obtained from the defendant as a result of information he had provided. <em>Id. </em>at 137. The court first determined that \u201cneither the F[alse]C[laims]A[ct] nor its legislative history reveals the drafters\u2019 intent with respect to survivability. We thus turn to federal common law for guidance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held, as a matter of federal common law, that the qui tarn claim survived Williams\u2019 death. <em>Id. </em>at 139. Likewise, courts have applied a similar analysis to conclude that the survival of actions under other federal statutes, for example, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Truth in Lending Act, is governed by federal common law. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>876 F.2d 832, 834 (10th Cir.1989) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act); <em>Smith v. No. 2 Galesburg Crown Fin. Corp., </em>615 F.2d 407, 413 (7th Cir.1980) (Truth in Lending Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Although widely recognizing that federal common law governs, the courts have not clearly articulated the governing rule with respect to survivorship of personal injury claims under the Vaccine Act or more generally. One option would be to adopt the applicable state law rule. <em>See, e.g., Robertson v. Wegmann, </em>436 U.S. 584, 590-91, 98 S.Ct. 1991, 56 L.Ed.2d 554 (1978). However, that option is not appropriate in this case. Although not all \u201c[cjontroversies directly affecting the operations of federal programs ... require resort to uniform rules,\u201d <em>Kimbell Foods, </em>440 U.S. at 727-28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>99 S.Ct. 1448, the creation of a uniform federal rule is particularly appropriate in cases, such as this, that directly concern \u201cthe duties of the Federal Government,\u201d <em>Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 630, 642, 101 S.Ct. 2061, 68 L.Ed.2d 500 (1981). In this context, the need for uniformity in the vaccine compensation program is also demonstrated because Congress chose to allow adjudication of claims under the program only in the United States Court of Federal Claims, a single, uniform, national court. Resort to state law to determine survival of claims under the Vaccine Act would be inappropriate. <em>See Carlson, </em>446 U.S. at 23-25, 100 S.Ct. 1468 (finding survival of <em>Bivens </em>claims governed by a uniform federal rule in favor of survival rather than state law); <em>Shyface v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>165 F.3d 1344, 1351 (Fed.Cir.1999) (holding that standard for proof of causation under Vaccine Act must be determined as a uniform federal rule rather than by adopting state law).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Although it is not appropriate to adopt the differing rules of individual states, it is appropriate to follow the approach adopted by the vast majority of states. Nearly every state now provides for survivorship of personal injury claims by statute, rejecting the common law rule that personal injury claims do not survive death. <em>See </em>3 Speiser &amp; Rooks, <em>supra, </em>app. A; <em>see also </em>Keeton et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 126 (\u201c[Vjirtually every state today has some form of survival statute, the exact provisions of which vary but the gist of which is to permit a personal injury action to continue after the death of either the plaintiff or defendant.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In a closely related context, the Supreme Court has explained that the sweeping rejection by the states of a common law doctrine argues strongly that the common law doctrine should also be rejected as a matter of federal common law. At common law, there was no cause of action for wrongful death. <em>See Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 380, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 (1970). In <em>Moragne, </em>the Supreme Court recognized, as a matter of federal common law, a cause of action for wrongful death in federal admiralty jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 90 S.Ct. 1772. The Court held that despite the common law refusal to recognize such a claim, \u201cthe work of the legislatures has made the allowance of recovery for wrongful death the general rule of American law, and its denial the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 90 S.Ct. 1772. Based in large part on the widespread enactment of state statutes creating a cause of action for wrongful death, creation of a similar federal common law action was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 390-92, 90 S.Ct. 1772. It is appropriate to follow a similar approach with respect to survivorship of injury claims, since the states by statute have almost uniformly rejected the common law rule that personal injury claims do not survive death. Indeed, it is particularly appropriate to follow the approach of <em>Moragne </em>because the common law doctrines rejecting survivor-ship and wrongful death actions, while distinct, are related both in historical origin and practical consequence. <em>See </em>Malone, <em>supra, </em>at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">A rule in favor of survival is also consistent with the objectives of the Vaccine Act with respect to both compensation of injured individuals and protection of vaccine manufacturers. The Vaccine Act includes an opt-out provision which requires that individuals harmed by a vaccine submit a claim under the vaccine program, but allows a claimant to reject the program award and instead bring a private action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>under state law against a vaccine manufacturer or administrator.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-ll(a)(2)(A). A rule in favor of survivorship of vaccine-related injury claims would preserve the Vaccine Act as an effective substitute for the state tort system. As noted earlier, in all or nearly all states, the state tort system that Congress sought to replace with the vaccine compensation program, for claims of vaccine-related injuries and death, provides for survival of personal actions. A rule in favor of survivorship would harmonize the federal scheme with the state alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">I would hold that, because the statutory language does not specify whether claims under the Vaccine Act survive, this issue is properly governed by federal common law, and that claims for vaccine-related injury accruing prior to death survive the death of a claimant. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s refusal to apply well-established law, but concur in the result that allows the estate of this petitioner to recover.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-16\">. Unlike the Vaccine Act, some statutes do expressly preclude survivorship, eliminating the need to turn to federal common law to resolve the issue. <em>See, e.g., </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151; <em>see also Seymour v. Principi, </em>245 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\"[Ijt follows directly from the language of section 1151 that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>claim for disability under section 1151 is extinguished by a veteran's death.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-8\">.

While not necessary to its result, the majority suggests that if a petitioner secured a judgment for a vaccine-related injury, and subsequently died as a result of the same vaccination, that person's legal representative might not be able to recover the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>death benefit because of section 300aa-11(b)(2), which provides that \"[o]nly one petition may be filed with respect to each administration of a vaccine.\u201d <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 1320. This is clearly not the purpose of the single petition rule, which was intended to prevent a petitioner from evading the limitation on compensation for pain and suffering by filing multiple petitions for the same vaccine-related injury. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.
