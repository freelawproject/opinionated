Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>964 (1996). Appellant Mola Development Corporation (\u201cMola\u201d) owned a controlling interest in Charter Savings Bank (\u201cCharter\u201d). Merit Savings Bank (\u201cMerit\u201d) merged into Charter in 1988. After the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989) (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), the merged institution was seized and liquidated for failure to comply with FIRREA\u2019s regulatory capital requirements. Mola urges on appeal that a contract existed between Mola and the government with respect to the treatment of regulatory goodwill and that there was a taking. The government\u2019s cross-appeal asserts a statute of limitations defense. Because we reject the government\u2019s limitations defense and conclude that there was no contract concerning the treatment of regulatory goodwill and no taking, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Mola entered the financial services business in 1984 by acquiring a controlling stake in a financially troubled savings and loan, Orange Coast Savings and Loan Association, which it renamed as Charter after the acquisition. After this successful merger, in 1987, Mola hired consultants to identify another troubled financial institution that could serve as a suitable merger partner for Charter. In 1986, the government expressed concern about the financial condition of Merit, and, on December 15, 1987, it proposed that Merit be placed on a bidding schedule for sale in June 1988. In November 1987, Mola\u2019s consultants selected Merit as the best merger partner for Charter, and in December 1987 Mola and Charter advised Merit\u2019s board of directors of Mola\u2019s interest in having Merit merge into Charter. Mola notified the government of the proposed transaction the next day. Mola and Merit entered into a formal agreement regarding the terms of a merger between Merit and Charter on January 15,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Thereafter, in early 1988, representatives of Mola and the government discussed the terms for regulatory approval of the proposed merger, which required authorization by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (\u201cFHLBB\u201d). At these meetings, Mola requested that the government classify the merger as supervisory and that it allow Mola to make a non-cash contribution, rather than contributing cash, to bring the merged entity into compliance with capital requirements. Neither request was granted at that time, and the government representatives indicated opposition to allowing Mola to fund the merged entity through a non-cash contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">Mola and Charter filed a formal application with the FHLBB seeking approval of the proposed merger between Charter and Merit on April 19, 1988. Among other provisions, the application provided for use of the purchase method of accounting and amortization of any resulting goodwill over a period not to exceed twenty-five years, provisions which were consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and standard FHLBB policy at the time, and that required no regulatory forbearances. The merger application also included a list of six regulatory forbear-ances requested by Mola and Charter, none of which concerned the regulatory treatment of goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">The government and Mola continued to disagree as to the level of cash contribution that would be required from Mola to complete the merger. On May 20, 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>the government indicated that the merger would be approved only with a cash contribution sufficient to meet regulatory minimum capital levels. The government indicated that it would not accept any of Mola\u2019s six requested forbearances, and explicitly indicated that \u201cCharter will maintain capital at minimum required levels without the non-cash contribution.\u201d J.A. at 200404. The government denied Mola\u2019s request for a new forbearance to exclude operating and capital losses and other liabilities assumed due to the acquisition of Merit from the calculation of the amount of cash required to bring the merged entity into regulatory compliance. Mola also requested that the merger be officially designated as supervisory, which as Mola indicated in a telephone call to the FHLBB on May 24,1988, it was seeking in order to facilitate \u201cuse of net operating losses for tax purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200404-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">On June 24,1988, the FHLBB, by letter, gave preliminary approval for the merger between Charter and Merit, and the merger closed on July 29, 1988, although no formal resolution was adopted by the FHLBB to approve the merger. The government classified the merger as supervisory, as Mola had requested. An internal FHLBB memorandum noted that \u201cin order for Mola to utilize the benefits of a tax free reorganization and the net operating loss carryforwards of Merit, the Bank Board has deemed Merit a Supervisory Case for the purposes of this acquisition, in a certificate dated June 24, 1988.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200411. The FHLBB\u2019s approval letter did not mention regulatory treatment of goodwill. The only regulatory forbearance mentioned in the approval letter stated that \u201c[t]he calculation for the cash contribution shall exclude scheduled items of Merit as of September 30, 1987,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 200389, which allowed Mola to avoid counting certain of Merit\u2019s problem loans in calculating the cash contribution, allegedly for a two-year period. No document purports to be a written agreement between the FHLBB and either Mola or Charter. In particular, the government did not enter into any assistance agreement with Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">In the year after the merger, as a result of an FHLBB examination, Charter was designated as a \u201ctroubled institution\u201d in a letter dated July 31, 1989. The FHLBB imposed restrictions on Charter\u2019s ability to increase its assets or liabilities. The letter also noted, in criticizing Charter\u2019s business plan, the probability that Charter would not be in compliance with stricter tangible capital requirements that would soon be imposed by legislation (that is, FIRREA).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">FIRREA was enacted into law on August 9, 1989, and required the new Office of Thrift Supervision (\u201cOTS\u201d) to promulgate implementing regulations within ninety days. OTS promulgated regulations that became effective on December 7, 1989. <em>See </em>Regulatory Capital, 54 Fed. Reg. 46,845 (Nov. 8, 1989). Charter was not in capital compliance under the new regulations when they became effective and, as a result, was seized by OTS on June 15,1990, and subsequently liquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Mola initiated this action in the Court of Federal Claims on December 5, 1995, urging that the implementation of FIRREA breached a contract between Mola and the government and that the government had also taken Mola\u2019s property when it retained a \u201csurplus\u201d resulting from the liquidation of Charter. The Court of Federal Claims denied a motion by the government to dismiss based on statute of limitation grounds, but granted summary judgment in favor of the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>ment on the merits, finding that there was no contract relating to the treatment of goodwill and that there had been no taking. <em>Mola Dev. Corp. v. United States, </em>74 Fed.Cl. 528, 541-42, 545-46 (2006). Mola appeals the judgment on the merits, and the government cross-appeals, challenging the denial of its motion to dismiss on statute of limitation grounds. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3), and review the decisions of the Court of Federal Claims on the motion to dismiss and summary judgment motion without deference. <em>Guardian Indus. Corp. v. United States, </em>477 F.3d 1368, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Claims against the government under the Tucker Act are subject to a six-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. The government argues that the statute of limitations began to run when FIRREA was enacted, on August 9, 1989, and that the claims here were untimely because they were filed more than six years later, on December 5, 1995. This position was rejected in our recent decision in <em>Bank of America, FSB v. Doumani, </em>495 F.3d 1366 (Fed.Cir.2007). There we approved the reasoning of the Court of Federal Claims in <em>Bank of America, FSB v. United States, </em>51 Fed.Cl. 500, 506 (2002), that the mere passage of FIRREA on August 9, 1989, did not trigger the limitations period for <em>Winstar </em>claims. <em>Bank of Am., </em>495 F.3d at 1372.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are bound by this holding in <em>Bank of Ame\u00f1ca, </em>and we therefore reject the government\u2019s argument. Mola\u2019s cause of action did not accrue on the date of the passage of FIR-REA.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">Alternatively, the government urges that the Court of Federal Claims erred in holding that the limitations period did not begin to run until after FIRREA\u2019s implementing regulations became effective, on December 7, 1989.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government urges that the statute of limitations can begin to run before FIRREA\u2019s implementing regulations were adopted, and that the statute of limitations in this case did begin to run before the regulations were adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">The government is correct that the statute of limitations can begin to run before the adoption of FIRREA\u2019s implementing regulations. The <em>Bank of Ame\u00f1ca </em>court, approving the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 reasoning, clarified that \u201cactivity before FIRREA\u2019s effective date can indeed start the clock\u201d as to the limitations period. <em>Bank of Am., </em>495 F.3d at 1372. However, it also approved the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 reasoning in that case, 51 Fed.Cl. at 506-09, that some of the government\u2019s actions in that case did not trigger the running of the limitations period. There the government had argued that the triggering actions were an August 31, 1989, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>regulatory bulletin requiring all thrifts to plan for the implementation of FIRREA and a letter, also dated August 31, 1989, indicating the government\u2019s intent to delay approval of a merger based on FIRREA. We held that these actions were insufficient to initiate the limitations period because they \u201cdid not contain a requirement for [the thrift] to take specific action contrary to its existing contract.\u201d <em>Bank of Am., </em>495 F.3d at 1372. The <em>Bank of America </em>court also approved the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 reasoning that a subsequent October 6,1989, letter that approved the delayed merger on the condition of full compliance with FIRREA\u2019s capital requirements, 51 Fed.Cl. at 510, did initiate the limitations period as to Bank of America\u2019s claim because the condition of compliance with FIRREA was necessarily inconsistent with the alleged contract. <em>Bank of Am., </em>495 F.3d at 1372 (\u201c[T]he earliest letter sufficient to cause a breach carried the date of 6 October 1989.\u201d). That letter, however, was sent within the six-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">The government here asserts that its July 31, 1989, letter, which designated Charter as a troubled institution and imposed immediate restrictions on Charter, initiated the limitations period for Mola\u2019s claim. The Court of Federal Claims rejected this argument, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">To the extent the July 31 letter imposed an immediate harm on Charter, such harm was not due to an accelerated application of FIRREA____Rather, the harm resulting from the July 31 letter\u2014 limitations on growth and restrictions on increases in assets or liabilities\u2014 stemmed from Charter\u2019s poor operating performance reflected in the April Report of Examination. These limitations did not purport to be an acceleration of FIRREA....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-8\"><em>Mola Dev. Carp., </em>74 Fed.Cl. at 541. This finding was not clearly erroneous. Thus, although the July 31 letter imposed immediate restrictions on Charter, these restrictions related to ongoing concerns about Charter\u2019s management, operating margins, level of tangible capital, and business plan and were not based on the impending enactment of FIRREA.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Because we agree with the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 finding that the July 31, 1989, letter did not trigger the running of the statute of limitations, we fail to see how Charter\u2019s September 14, 1989, response to the government\u2019s letter, suggesting that the government\u2019s position was inconsistent with the terms negotiated at the time of the merger, could be sufficient to trigger the initiation of the limitations period. While it is clear that Charter was concerned that as a result of FIRREA the government would not continue to allow goodwill as an aspect of regulatory capital, the government had not yet taken any action in this regard. Moreover, Charter reiterated in its September 14, 1989, letter that, in the absence of implementing regulations, it was not yet required to comply with the new FIRREA capital requirements. Although Charter\u2019s September 14 letter suggested that the action taken in the government\u2019s July 31 letter resulted from a premature application of FIRREA, Charter\u2019s erroneous assertion that this was the basis for the government\u2019s action does not change the fact that the government\u2019s action was not based on FIRREA. Rather, as the Court of Federal Claims found, Charter\u2019s attempt in the September 14 letter, \u201cto shift the blame for the problems identified in the April Examination from its own previous operating difficulties to future requirements emanating from FIRREA\u201d did nothing to alter the fact that the government had not yet imple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>merited FIRREA\u2019s restrictions on regulatory use of supervisory goodwill, either generally or with respect to Charter. <em>Id. </em>at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Under these circumstances, the statute of limitations was not triggered until the FIRREA implementing regulations became effective on December 7, 1989. Since this action was filed less than six years later, the statute of limitations does not bar the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Mola urges that the Court of Federal Claims erroneously granted summary judgment as to its takings claim. \u201cIn analyzing a takings claim, a court must first determine what was taken.\u201d <em>Branch v. United States, </em>69 F.3d 1571, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1995). Mola does not argue, as have previous <em>Winstar </em>plaintiffs, that the government took a contractual right to particular regulatory treatment of goodwill. [Bl.Br. 27] Indeed, this theory has been soundly rejected. <em>See Castle v. United States, </em>301 F.3d 1328, 1342 (Fed.Cir.2002) (establishing a broad rule that the breach of any contractual rights regarding regulatory treatment of goodwill does \u201cnot constitute a taking of the contract\u201d so long as \u201cthe plaintiff[ ] retain[s] the full range of remedies associated with any contractual property right [it] possessed\u201d); <em>accord Bailey v. United States, </em>341 F.3d 1342, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2003). We have also established that the seizure of an insolvent bank for liquidation does not constitute a taking. <em>See Bailey, </em>341 F.3d at 1347 (\u201c[I]t is well established that it is not a taking for the government to close an insolvent bank and appoint a receiver.\u201d (quoting <em>Branch, </em>69 F.3d at 1575)).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Mola appears to argue that even if Charter was insolvent at the time it was seized by government regulators, there ultimately was a \u201c$6,232,301.00 surplus net income from the liquidation of Charter,\u201d that this alleged surplus belonged to Mola, and that it was taken by the government. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27. We have recognized that if a surplus were to exist after the liquidation of a seized institution and the satisfaction of all of the institution\u2019s liabilities, the institution\u2019s prior owners would have a property interest in such a surplus. <em>See Bailey, </em>341 F.3d at 1347. Mola, however, has identified no evidence of a surplus of Charter\u2019s assets over its liabilities. The $6,232,301 figure Mola cites appears on a profit and loss statement, and indicates income during the liquidation in that amount. However, the receiver\u2019s statement of assets and liabilities states that at the time of its seizure Charter\u2019s liabilities exceeded its assets by more than sixteen million dollars. Mola has failed to establish any surplus that was taken by the government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">Mola also challenges the entry of summary judgment in favor of the government as to its breach of contract claim, arguing that there was a contract relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>to regulatory treatment of goodwill, which was breached by the implementation of FIRREA. \u201cIn order to prevail in a <em>Wins-tar </em>case a plaintiff ... must establish that a contract existed with the government whereby the government was \u2018contractually bound to recognize the supervisory goodwill and [particular] amortization periods.\u2019 \u201d <em>Franklin Fed. Sav. Bank v. United States, </em>431 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Winstar Corp. v. United States, </em>64 F.3d 1531, 1541-42 (Fed.Cir.1995), <em>aff'd, </em>518 U.S. 839, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996)). To prove the existence of a <em>Winstar </em>contract, like any other contract with the government, \u201cfour basic requirements must be met: (1) mutuality of intent to contract; (2) lack of ambiguity in offer and acceptance; (3) consideration; and (4) a government representative having actual authority to bind the United States in contract.\u201d <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>344 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">This court has previously explained the type of evidence needed to prove the government\u2019s intent to enter into a <em>Winstar </em>contract. We have emphasized that \u201cregulatory proclamations are insufficient to create contractual obligations because ... \u2018[m]ere approval of the merger does not amount to [an] intent to contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357 (quoting <em>D &amp; N Bank v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2003)). \u201cAn agency\u2019s performance of its regulatory or sovereign functions does not create contractual obligations.\u201d <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>331 F.3d at 1378-79; <em>see also Cain v. United States, </em>350 F.3d 1309, 1315-16 (Fed.Cir.2003). Rather, \u201cthere must ... be a clear indication of intent to contract and the other requirements for concluding that a contract was formed.\u201d <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>331 F.3d at 1378. A plaintiff must provide \u201csomething more than a cloud of evidence that could be consistent with a contract to prove a contract and enforceable contract rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1377. In other words, \u201csomething more\u201d than mere regulatory approval of the merger must be shown. <em>See id. </em>at 1379-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">At the same time, we have recognized that a formal written agreement is not necessary to prove the existence of a <em>Winstar </em>contract when there is other adequate evidence of the government\u2019s intent to form a contract. <em>See Fifth Third Bank of W. Ohio v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1221, 1231-32 (Fed.Cir.2005). In <em>Fifth Third, </em>we held that, even in the absence of any formal document purporting to be an agreement between the institution and the government, the documentary evidence, including a merger application, an FHLBB resolution, and a letter recommending conditional approval of the merger, constituted an agreement as to the treatment of goodwill because an explicit agreement for the treatment of goodwill had been negotiated with respect to each of four consecutive mergers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Mola here points to no evidence of any negotiations about the regulatory treatment of goodwill that could serve as evidence that the government agreed to a goodwill contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, Mola argues that its negotiation for the FHLBB\u2019s designation of the merger as \u201csupervisory\u201d is sufficient evidence of the government\u2019s intent to form a contract with respect to regulatory treatment of goodwill. This court rejected a similar argument in <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>that \u201clabeling a merger \u2018supervisory,\u2019 alone, ... tell[s] us nothing about the government\u2019s intent to contract.\u201d 331 F.3d at 1380. Mola nonetheless asserts that the negotiation over the supervisory designation was in effect a negotiation over the treatment of goodwill because such a designation was necessary, under the prevailing regulations, to allow use of the purchase method of accounting, the only accounting method that would recognize goodwill as an asset for regulatory purposes. We disagree with Mola\u2019s construction of the regulations, and thus need not decide the question of whether Mola could prevail under a contrary construction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The regulations themselves do not address the purchase method of accounting, though the regulations do set forth the standards for regulatory compliance. Section 563.13(b)(7)(i) provided that, <em>\u201cafter any </em>merger; consolidation, <em>or purchase of assets </em>and assumption of liabilities ... the regulatory capital requirement of the continuing institution is computed ... based on the combined assets, investments, base liabilities, and increased liabilities of the merged and continuing institutions.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 563.13(b)(7)\u00a9 (1988) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The purchase method of accounting is addressed in detail in the FHLBB\u2019s internal Memorandum SP-24 (December 29, 1981). That memorandum provides for two different methods of accounting when a merger or purchase of assets occurs: the pooling method, which aggregates the assets and liabilities of the merging entities, and the purchase method, which calculates combined assets as if the dominant entity purchased the acquired entity by assuming its liabilities. Mola is correct that of the two available methods of accounting, only the purchase method, and not the pooling of assets method, allowed goodwill to be recognized as an asset of the merged entity-</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Memorandum SP-24 provides that regulators would consider the economic reality of the combination in order to determine which accounting method to allow, and the purchase method of accounting was allowed, among other situations, when \u201c[o]ne association with financial strength or significant size acquires or bails out small or weaker associations.\u201d J.A. at 200788. Nothing in Memorandum SP-24 suggests that whether the merger has been designated as supervisory is even relevant, let alone determinative, of the availability of the purchase method of accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">Mola correctly points out that 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 563.13(b)(7)(iii) provided that \u201cthe provisions of this paragraph (b)(7) of this section may be superseded\u201d by FHLBB, if it determined that a \u201cconsolidation, merger, or purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities ... is instituted for supervisory purposes.\u201d In other words, the regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>allowed the FHLBB to grant regulatory forbearances, as to the requirements of section 563(b)(7)(i) discussed above, in the case of supervisory mergers and to suspend otherwise-applicable regulatory capital requirements. There is no showing in this case that any forbearances provided for the treatment of goodwill.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">Thus, the regulations and memorandum do not support Mola\u2019s assertion that the supervisory designation was necessary to utilize the purchase method of accounting. The use of the purchase method of accounting in this case was consistent with Memorandum SP-24 and GAAP and did not require forbearances or the designation of the merger as supervisory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Mola also argues that the government must have intended to form a contract with respect to regulatory treatment of goodwill because Charter would not have had sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements absent the inclusion of goodwill in its regulatory capital calculation. This court has already rejected this argument in <em>D &amp; N Bank. </em>While imminent regulatory noncompliance may help to establish that negotiated forbearances were contractual, <em>see Fifth Third, </em>402 F.3d at 1232-33, the mere risk of regulatory noncompliance absent use of the purchase method of accounting does nothing to establish the existence of a goodwill contract, <em>D &amp; N Bank, </em>331 F.3d at 1380. In the absence of other evidence indicating the government\u2019s intent to contract, the mere fact that the government approved a merger that, without inclusion of goodwill in Charter\u2019s regulatory capital calculation, would have left Charter\u2019s capital level below the regulatory minimum does not establish any contract to maintain this treatment of goodwill. <em>See id. </em>at 1380 (\u201cEven if D &amp; N would have been instantly insolvent and out of regulatory compliance were it not allowed to treat goodwill as regulatory capital, that fact tells us nothing about the government\u2019s intent.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Finally, Mola argues that it was granted a two-year forbearance with respect to the regulatory treatment of certain of Merit\u2019s problem loans, that this forbearance was contractual, and that the government breached this contract. As the government points out, whether or not there was such an agreement with respect to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>forbearances regarding certain of Merit\u2019s problem loans, Mola has failed to demonstrate that such a breach of contract claim was presented before the Court of Federal Claims in this case, and it is too late to assert it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">We affirm the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 denial of the government\u2019s motion to dismiss because the statute of limitations did not bar Mola\u2019s action. We also affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of the government as to Mola\u2019s takings and breach of contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">.

The FDIC\u2019s decision to voluntarily dismiss its claims does not amount to a concession that any excess recovery belongs to Mola, rather than the government, as Mola asserts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b921-5\">. The dissent, Diss.

Mola's present argument in this regard rests on the affidavit of Munjit Johal, a former official of at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and a consultant to Mola at the time of the merger. This affidavit suggests that a supervisory designation was required, pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 563.13(7)\u00a9 &amp; (III) (1988), to use the purchase method of accounting in a merger to create goodwill as a book asset. Because the proper interpretation of these regulations is an issue of law, expert testimony relating to this question, such as the affidavit of a former government official, \"should not be received, much less considered.\u201d <em>Rumsfeld v. United Techs. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 1361, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2003). We therefore afford no weight to this affidavit in construing the regulations. Instead, we look to the regulations themselves and related documents to interpret the regulatory requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b923-6\">. The FHLBB's practice of granting forbear-ances as to mergers designated as supervisory was routinized to some extent by Memorandum SP-37a, which \"established three categories of potential forbearances: (i) standard forbearances that will be granted; (ii) for-bearances that may be granted on a case-by-case basis if circumstances so justify; and (iii) forbearances that will not be granted.\u201d <em>Mola Dev. Corp., </em>74 Fed.Cl. at 544.

We need not reach the government\u2019s contention that Mola lacks standing to assert a <em>Winstar </em>breach of contract claim because Mola was not a party to any agreement with the government regarding regulatory treatment of goodwill, even if Charter was a party to such a contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b924-8\">NEWMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AcH\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">I concur in the court\u2019s holding that the complaint of Mola Development Company was filed within the six-year limitations period of the Tucker Act. However, the court errs in ruling that there was no contract between Mola and the federal bank authorities. The arrangement whereby Mola agreed to contribute a total of $3.5 million in cash upon merger with the insolvent Merit Savings Association, and the government agreed to classify this merger as a supervisory case, was fully agreed, recorded, and implemented, in accordance with ordinary contract principles. The extensive written exchanges, along with the agency documentation, produced an integrated contract that is not distinguishable in its premises from the contract in <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996). The circumstances and documents left no doubt that a contract including supervisory goodwill was intended and formed, to implement government\u2019s program created with the sole purpose of encouraging healthy thrifts to acquire insolvent ones in order to reduce the government\u2019s liability to the failing banking industry. The Court of Federal Claims erred in its holding that there was no contract and no liability. I respectfully dissent from my colleagues\u2019 affirmance of this decision, on this court\u2019s finding that no single document contains all of the contract conditions and the mistaken understanding of the government\u2019s approval of the merger as a supervisory case for accounting purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">As discussed in <em>Winstar, </em>between 1981 and 1983 approximately 435 thrift institutions had failed and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) was exhausting its insurance fund. In this critical situation, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) encouraged solvent banks and thrift institutions to salvage insolvent thrifts. As the Court explained in <em>Winstar, </em>the government\u2019s liability was substantially reduced when insolvent thrifts were enabled to remain in operation, as compared with the cost of federal liquidation. 518 U.S. at 847-48, 116 S.Ct. 2432. Thus the government provided substantial incentives, including accounting procedures that achieved paper compliance with capital requirements; these procedures were manifested in the \u201cpurchase method\u201d of accounting for liabilities that were designated as \u201csupervisory goodwill,\u201d accompanied by long-term amortization and various other concessions and forbear-ances. The Court remarked particularly on the accounting treatment of supervisory mergers, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-13\">[T]he principal inducement for these supervisory mergers was an understand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>ing that the acquisitions would be subject to a particular accounting treatment that would help the acquiring institutions meet their reserve capital requirements imposed by federal regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">518 U.S. at 848, 116 S.Ct. 2432. The Court explained that the purchase method of accounting implemented recognition of supervisory goodwill and enabled the merged entity to meet capital requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-5\">Under GAAP there are circumstances in which a business combination may be dealt with by the \u201cpurchase method\u201d of accounting.... The critical aspect of that method for our purposes is that it permits the acquiring entity to designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired as an intangible asset called \u201cgoodwill.\u201d ... Goodwill recognized under the purchase method as the result of a FSLIC-sponsored supervisory merger was generally referred to as \u201csupervisory goodwill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 849, 116 S.Ct. 2432.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">FIRREA ended this system, and prohibited the use of supervisory goodwill and long-term amortization to meet capital requirements. Many of the acquired thrifts fell out of compliance, and were seized and liquidated by the government; in <em>Winstar </em>the Court ruled that the enactment and implementation of FIRREA breached the government\u2019s contractual obligations incurred in authorizing such acquisitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Such a breach occurred here. The contract between Mola and the federal government was an integrated combination of various documents involving the government, Mola and its subsidiary Charter, and the insolvent Merit Savings Association. Mola agreed to contribute approximately $2.5 million in cash to the merged Charter/Merit thrift institution, plus an additional $1 million to Merit\u2019s shareholders, and the government agreed to classify the merger as \u201csupervisory.\u201d Although the panel majority states that \u201cthe FHLBB\u2019s approval letter did not mention regulatory treatment of goodwill,\u201d maj. op. at 1374, the majority\u2019s conclusion is inaccurate, for the classification as \u201csupervisory\u201d achieves the regulatory treatment of goodwill. As the record shows, this treatment was essential to Mola\u2019s agreement to acquire the insolvent Merit thrift institution, and essential to the merged institution\u2019s compliance with capital requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">The contractual arrangement between Mola and the government involved various documents, including Mola\u2019s H-(e)3 application, filed on April 19, 1988. The H-(e)3 application included a \u201cConsolidated Charter &amp; Merit Balance Sheet\u201d that listed supervisory goodwill as an asset valued at $10,996,000 as of December 30, 1987. In paragraph (g) of the H-(e)3 application, entitled \u201cAccounting Procedures,\u201d Mola stated the condition \u201cto record the acquisition of Merit as a purchase transaction under generally accepted accounting principles ... and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 72 (\u2018FASB No. 72\u2019).\u201d The record shows FASB No. 72 as the Financial Accounting Standards Board standard 72 for \u201cthe amortization period of goodwill.\u201d Paragraph (g) also states that \u201cidentifiable intangible assets acquired\u201d include \u201cFASB No. 72 goodwill.\u201d The H(e)3 application compiled the information that the record showed to be under discussion as the offer from Mola to merge the insolvent Merit into Mola\u2019s solvent subsidiary Charter, through a supervisory acquisition. Mola\u2019s H-(e)3 application included the purchase method of accounting based on supervisory goodwill and long-term amortization.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>The progress of the negotiations was recorded in various government documents, as in <em>Winstar. </em>A FHLB San Francisco (FHLBSF) memorandum dated May 18, 1988, by Supervisory Agent Mr. Paula, records the \u201cgoodwill to be carried on the books\u201d of the merged Charter/Merit institution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">It is important to note that when the total amount of goodwill to be carried on the books of the resulting institution, $10,996,000, is subtracted [from $22,758,-000], the capital of the resulting institution falls to $11,762,000 or 2.6 percent of liabilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">FHLBSF Memo, at 3. A letter dated June 7, 1988 to the FHLBSF Office of General Counsel specifically addressed the question: \u201cShould the Federal Home Loan Bank Board issue a certificate deeming Merit Savings Bank a supervisory case for the purposes of the subject application?\u201d The FHLBSF letter stated that \u201cthe applicant has requested that Merit be deemed a supervisory case by the Bank Board and that the subject acquisition be considered as being instituted for supervisory purposes.\u201d The FHLBSF letter recommended that \u201cthe Secretariat of the Bank Board deem Merit a supervisory case.\u201d Letter at 3. The FHLBSF letter also stated that Mola\u2019s request for forbearance from the minimum capital requirement would not be approved except for Merit\u2019s \u201cScheduled Items.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There followed the FHLB\u2019s letter to Mola dated June 24, 1998, stating that Mola\u2019s H-(e)3 application was approved subject to these \u201cScheduled Items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Approximately a month after the government\u2019s approval of the H-(e)3 application, a FHLBSF memorandum dated July 26, 1988, entitled \u201cCharter Savings Bank ... Negotiations for Application H-(e)3 for the Acquisition of Merit Savings Bank,\u201d summarized the circumstances leading to the approval of the merger. This memorandum reported discussions of the merger terms in at least six meetings over the period from May 5, 1988 to May 24, 1988. The memorandum stated that on May 19, 1988 the FHLBB presented six conditions that it required, and that Mola responded on May 20, 1988 during a conference call by modifying the second condition, adding a seventh condition, and accepting the other conditions. The seventh condition was: \u201cThe acquisition is being instituted for supervisory purposes.\u201d Mola\u2019s proposed modification of the second condition was rejected by the FHLBSF on May 23, 1988, and on May 24, 1988 Mola acquiesced in the rejection and accepted condition two in its original form, but insisted on condition seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">The Bank Board agreed to condition seven, and the FHLBSF memorandum of July 26, 1988 states that on May 24, 1998 the parties reached agreement and that \u201c[t]he Bank Board will provide the necessary certification indicating that this acquisition falls within the requirements of a supervisory case.\u201d Mola testified during trial that \u201c[o]n June 24, 1998, [Mola] got the approval letter from the Federal Home Loan Board, and on that same date, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board issued a certificate deeming Merit a supervisory case.\u201d The testimony was undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">The merger of Charter and Merit closed on July 29, 1988, with the supervisory goodwill of the merged institution valued at $15,741,000 on the date of the merger. Both Mola and the government included goodwill in the accounting of Charter\u2019s regulatory capital, until December 7, 1989, the effective date of FIRREA. Thereafter the merged institution was prohibited from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>utilizing the purchase method of accounting, and without the goodwill asset the institution was immediately out of capital compliance. Charter was seized and liquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">The government\u2019s liability for breach of contract on these premises was established by <em>Winstar. </em>Despite this clear precedent, my colleagues now rule that there was no contract, no obligation, and no liability, because no single document contained all of the terms of the transaction. Indeed, that was the <em>Winstar </em>situation, where the Court ruled that the total documentation comprised an integrated contract. The Court described such arrangements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-5\">[T]he [FHLBB] resolutions, Forbearance Letters, and other documents setting forth the accounting treatment to be accorded supervisory goodwill generated by the transactions were not mere statements of then-current regulatory policy, but in each instance were terms in an allocation of risk of regulatory change that was essential to the contract between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-6\"><em>Winstar, </em>518 U.S. at 909, 116 S.Ct. 2432. In <em>Fifth Third Bank of Western Ohio v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1221, 1235 (Fed.Cir.2005), this court held that even in the absence of a single formal document stating the entire agreement between the institution and the government, the documentary evidence constituted an agreement concerning supervisory goodwill, the court \u201c[a]nalyzing not only the contemporaneous documents but also the circumstances surrounding the transactions[J\u201d 402 F.3d at 1229. As in <em>Fifth Third Bank, </em>\u201cthe evidence demonstrates that in light of the discussions between the Government and the acquiring thrift with regards to protections affecting capital requirements, including supervisory goodwill, the parties agreed that the acquiring thrift was to be given the favorable accounting treatment of supervisory goodwill and amortization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The panel majority appears to mistake the undisputed evidence, for my colleagues state that \u201cMola here points to no evidence of any negotiations about the regulatory treatment of goodwill that could serve as evidence that the government agreed to a goodwill contract.\u201d Maj. op. at 1378. This is contrary to the record, and contrary to <em>Winstar </em>precedent. The facts herein differ from those <em>in. D &amp; N Bank v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1374 (Fed.Cir.2003), on which the majority relies, for \u201cD <em>&amp; </em>N ... simply submitted an application for approval of the merger, and the Bank Board accepted it,\u201d and this court found that \u201cthere was no negotiation between D &amp; N Bank and the Bank Board that resulted in approval of the merger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1379. In contrast, Mola\u2019s acquisition of Merit incurred multiple rounds of negotiation, with supervisory goodwill as an essential component that was negotiated and agreed. As the Court discussed in <em>Winstar, </em>it was well understood that absent accounting for supervisory goodwill there would be little reason for a healthy bank to assume the liabilities of an insolvent bank, when such assumption would render it immediately insolvent and in danger of receivership. The Court explained the purposes of supervisory goodwill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-9\">Supervisory goodwill was attractive to healthy thrifts for at least two reasons. First, thrift regulators let the acquiring institutions count supervisory goodwill toward their reserve requirement under 12 CFR \u00a7 563.13 (1981). This treatment was, of course, critical to make the transaction possible in the first place, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>because in most cases the institution resulting from the transaction would immediately have been insolvent under federal standards if goodwill had not counted toward regulatory net worth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">518 U.S. at 850, 116 S.Ct. 2432.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The panel majority errs in ruling that the approval of a supervisory merger \u201cdoes not establish any contract to maintain this treatment of goodwill,\u201d maj. op. at 1380, for that is what a supervisory merger is about.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> My colleagues appear to mistake the purchase method of accounting. <em>See, e.g., First Commerce Corp. v. United States, </em>335 F.3d 1373, 1377 n. 1 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201cWhen the purchase method is used to account for a merger, any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the thrift\u2019s net assets is recorded as goodwill.\u201d). Mola\u2019s negotiations leading to designation as a \u201csupervisory case\u201d were targeted to this purpose. <em>See Franklin Fed. Sav. Bank v. United States, </em>431 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2006) (\u201cThe thrifts desired to use the \u2018purchase\u2019 method of accounting, under which the newly created thrift could designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of all acquired assets as an intangible asset called \u2018supervisory goodwill,\u2019 and claim it as an asset for purposes of computing regulatory capital.\u201d); <em>Fifth Third Bank, </em>402 F.3d at 1224 (same). The panel majority\u2019s further holding that 12 CFR \u00a7 563.13, cited <em>supra </em>in <em>Winstar, </em>does not concern the purchase method of accounting is also off the mark, for the accounting use of supervisory goodwill to meet the reserve requirements under 12 CFR \u00a7 563.13 was \u201ccritical to make the transaction possible in the first place.\u201d 518 U.S. at 850, 116 S.Ct. 2432.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">A contract was formed as it was in <em>Winstar. </em>Mola\u2019s H-(e)3 application, the negotiations, the issuance of the certificate of \u201csupervisory case,\u201d and the various confirming documents, verified the contractual arrangement. <em>See, e.g., Fifth Third Bank, </em>402 F.3d at 1235 (\u201cThe totality of the evidence and the circumstances demonstrate that the parties intend to and did create contractual obligations which included the utilization of supervisory goodwill as an accounting treatment for capital compliance.\u201d); <em>La Van v. United States, </em>382 F.3d 1340, 1346-47 (Fed.Cir.2004) (holding that an implied-in-fact contract was established between the government and the acquiring thrift \u201c[a]s evidenced by an internal memorandum, the treatment of goodwill was at the epicenter of the conversion process\u201d); <em>LaSalle Talman Bank, F.S.B. v. United States, </em>317 F.3d 1363, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201cThese arrangements concerning goodwill [including a Financing Agreement and a Bank Board Resolution] and the infusion of capital from various sources enabled Taiman in 1986 to meet the existing capital requirements.\u201d); <em>California Fed. Bank v. United States, </em>245 F.3d 1342, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2001) (holding that even without an assistance agreement or a supervisory action agreement, the factual records of the case including various correspondence, memoranda and bank board resolutions show intent to contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>with the government for specified treatment of goodwill). The panel majority\u2019s criticism that \u201cno document\u201d contains the entire contract does not defeat the formation of a contract. A similar procedure was discussed in <em>Caroline Hunt Trust Estate v. United States, </em>470 F.3d 1044, 1050 (Fed.Cir.2006), where this court affirmed that the acquiring institution made an offer to the government in its H-(e)3 application, and that a contract ensued when the terms were negotiated and accepted. \u201cWhether a bargained-for exchange occurred depends on the surrounding factual circumstances.\u201d <em>Hometown Financial, Inc. v. United States, </em>409 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2005) (affirming the district court\u2019s holding that \u201cthe correspondence, memoranda, forbearance letters, and regulatory maintenance and dividend agreement gave rise to a contract which included provisions addressing goodwill\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The record establishes that there was a bargained-for exchange, and that the ensuing contract was breached by the subsequent enactment of FIRREA and the seizure and liquidation of Charter. I must, respectfully, dissent from the court\u2019s holding that there was no contract and no breach.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-7\">.
