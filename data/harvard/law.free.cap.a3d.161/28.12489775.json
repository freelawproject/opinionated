We hold that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Yolanda Harris, the appellee, filed a one-count complaint for medical\n   negligence against Women First OB/GYN Associates, LLC (\"Women First\"), the appellant, and LaKeischa McMillan, M.D., an obstetrician-gynecologist (\"OB-GYN\") employed by Women First.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Harris alleged that Dr. McMillan negligently performed a laparoscopic hysterectomy, causing an injury to her left ureter, and that Women First was liable for Dr. McMillan's negligence under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   . There was no claim of independent negligence against Women First. Women First and Dr. McMillan filed answers; they were represented by the same counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Discovery proceeded and the case was set in for a jury trial to begin on December 7, 2015. On December 1, 2015, the parties filed a stipulation, signed by counsel, that Dr. McMillan was an \"employee\" of Women First and was \"acting within the scope of her employment\" \"at all times while ... treating [Ms. Harris][.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial commenced as scheduled. At the very outset, before the venire was brought in, defense counsel told the court that \"through some discussions just before trial we've decided to dismiss Dr. McMillan. So the only defendant would be [Women First.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court responded, \"Okay.\" In case the court had not seen it, defense\n   counsel referenced the filed stipulation that Dr. McMillan had been acting within the scope of her employment at all relevant times. Nothing more was said about the dismissal of Dr. McMillan that day. Motions and jury selection took up the rest of the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the beginning of the second day of trial, before the jury was brought in, the court clerk informed the judge that defense counsel \"had a question about stipulation as to Defendant [Dr. McMillan].\" Addressing counsel, the judge stated, \"I'm told by [the clerk] that there's a question about the\n   language of the stipulation regarding Dr. McMillan's portion being dismissed.\" Defense counsel responded that there was no written stipulation about that. Both counsel said the stipulation could be done \"orally.\" Counsel for Ms. Harris then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   So the plaintiff dismisses with prejudice the claims against Dr. Lakeischa McMillan ... [i]ndividually. The stipulation is that at all times, she was acting as an employee, agent and servant of Women First ... and that they are responsible for any actions of Lakeischa McMillan, M.D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Counsel agreed that the jury would be instructed that Dr. McMillan was acting as an employee, agent, and servant of Women First. There was no ruling sought or made by the court. A docket entry made that day states, however: \"Plaintiff's oral motion dismisses the claims with prejudice as to defendant Lakeischa McMillan MD-Granted.\" There is no separate written order memorializing the court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Harris testified that Dr. McMillan performed the laparoscopic hysterectomy on April 8, 2010. Unlike a traditional hysterectomy, in which the physician opens the patient surgically, a laparoscopic hysterectomy is performed by creating small incisions through which a laparoscope is inserted and used to carry out the procedure. Several days after the hysterectomy, Ms. Harris noticed fluid leaking from one of her incisions. The leaking stopped but sometime around April 21, 2010, when she had a follow up visit with Dr. McMillan, she began to experience discomfort when urinating and with bowel movements. These problems persisted and she also developed abdominal bloating and hardness. At the beginning of May 2010, her primary care physician referred her to a urologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The urologist diagnosed Ms. Harris with an injured left ureter, the tube-like structure that connects the left kidney to the bladder. The injury was causing urine to escape her left ureter and fill her abdomen. Ms. Harris was referred to radiologist Stephen Karr, M.D., at Holy Cross Hospital, to perform a pyelogram. From that study, Dr. Karr determined the location of the injury to the left ureter and placed a\n   nephrostomy tube and collection bag, redirecting urine from the left kidney. The tube and bag remained in place for five and a half months, until the injury healed. Ms. Harris then underwent surgery to reattach her left ureter to her bladder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Harris called Richard Luciani, M.D., an OB-GYN, and Barry Aron, M.D., a urologist, as expert witnesses. They testified that Dr. McMillan breached the standard of care in performing the laparoscopic hysterectomy, causing the injury to the left ureter and the need for subsequent treatment and surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We shall discuss the details of their testimony in addressing Question III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the close of Ms. Harris's case, Women First moved for judgment. Defense counsel argued that the dismissal with\n   prejudice of Ms. Harris's claim against Dr. McMillan operated as a release or an adjudication upon the merits in favor of Dr. McMillan; and because Dr. McMillan was \"the sole agent for which Women[ ] First could be held vicariously liable[,]\" there could be no liability against Women First as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Harris's lawyer responded that the dismissal with prejudice was not a release or an adjudication upon the merits. The claim against Dr. McMillan simply was \"drop[ped]\" \"without consideration,\" and the dismissal was not intended to extinguish Ms. Harris's claim against Women First. He maintained that the dismissal along with the written stipulation that Dr. McMillan was acting as an employee of Women First and within the scope of her employment were \"a culmination\" of \"discussions and negotiations\" with defense counsel, who knew that Ms. Harris had no intention to preclude liability on the part of Women First.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, he asked the court to\n   exercise its revisory power under Rule 2-535 and \"nunc pro tunc reinstate the claim against Dr. McMillan[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In rebuttal, counsel for Women First argued that Ms. Harris's intent in dismissing Dr. McMillan with prejudice was not relevant; and the court did not have revisory power to reinstate her claim against Dr. McMillan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court directed counsel to submit written memoranda the next day in support of and opposition to Women First's motion for judgment. Counsel did so. In her opposition, Ms. Harris asked as an alternative that, if the court were inclined to grant the motion, it revise the dismissal to one without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court denied the motion on the morning of the following trial day. It concluded that Ms. Harris's negligence claim against Women First remained viable even though she had dismissed her claim against Dr. McMillan with prejudice. It noted that under Maryland law, Ms. Harris could have sued Women First under a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   without suing Dr. McMillan at all. It ruled that the voluntary dismissal with prejudice of Dr. McMillan was neither a release nor an adjudication upon the merits in favor of Dr. McMillan so as to preclude vicarious liability on the part of Women First and found that Ms. Harris did not intend to foreclose her claim against Women First by dismissing her claim against Dr. McMillan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court went on the say that even though it had denied the motion for judgment and it was not necessary for it to exercise revisory power to change Ms. Harris's \"motion to dismiss to one without prejudice[,]\" it had the power to do so. It then proceeded to do so:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I don't believe I need to [exercise revisory power] based on the ruling I've made, but so the record is clear, I do believe that I do still retain revisory power, because this was the plaintiff's action, it is not a judgment that has been entered,\n   and it is an interlocutory proceeding, as I understand the statute and the case law, so that it is clear that this Court has found that the plaintiff's claim for respondeat superior does remain active, notwithstanding the action of the dismissal, which I believe was fully part of a negotiating discussion that was between plaintiff and defendant.\n   I am going to exercise revisory power and amend [Ms. Harris's] motion to dismiss [Dr. McMillan] as a motion to dismiss without prejudice, because I do not believe that the facts in any way support [Ms. Harris's lawyer's] having endeavored to undermine the claim of [their] client as on the cusp of the trial beginning and was in response to the issue of if and when any judgment might be obtained and Dr. McMillan's ability to pay that judgment individually.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court directed the clerk to enter a new, separate docket entry amending Ms. Harris's \"motion to dismiss as to Dr. McMillan individually without prejudice[.]\" That entry states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Court revises plaintiff's motion/stipulation at [previous docket entry] and is amended to dismiss as to Dr. McMillan individually without prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There was no written order dismissing Ms. Harris's claim against Dr. McMillan with or without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its case, Women First called Dr. McMillan, who defended her care, and three expert witnesses: Craig Dickman, M.D., an OB-GYN; Harry Johnson, M.D., an OB-GYN and urogynecologist; and Stanley Redwood, M.D., a urologist. As with Ms. Harris's experts, we shall discuss their testimony when we address Question III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After Women First rested its case, it renewed its motion for judgment on the grounds previously asserted. The court denied the motion. Over objection, Ms. Harris's lawyer called Dr. Karr as a rebuttal witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The jurors returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Harris, finding that Dr. McMillan had negligently caused the injury to Ms.\n   Harris's left ureter and that Women First was liable to Ms. Harris for Dr. McMillan's negligence. They awarded Ms. Harris $426,079.50 in damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Women First filed a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\"JNOV\"), arguing, on the same grounds raised in its motion for judgment, that the case should not have been submitted to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Women First requested, in the alternative, a new trial. The parties filed several memoranda in support and opposition. The court held a hearing and issued an opinion and order denying the JNOV motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, Women First presents three questions, which we have rephrased as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I. Did the trial court err by denying Women First's motions for judgment and for JNOV?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by revising Ms. Harris's motion to dismiss Dr. McMillan to be\n   \"without prejudice\" rather than \"with prejudice\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   III. Did the trial court err by permitting Ms. Harris to call Dr. Karr as a hybrid fact and expert rebuttal witness?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We answer these questions in the negative and shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Women First contends Ms. Harris's dismissal with prejudice of her negligence claim against Dr. McMillan discharged any vicarious liability of Women First, as a matter of law. It argues that, in Maryland, a voluntary dismissal with prejudice is an \"adjudication [up]on the merits\" in favor of the party being dismissed, and when that party is an employee, the dismissal precludes\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability on the part of the employer. Therefore, Ms. Harris's voluntary dismissal of her claim against Dr. McMillan with prejudice foreclosed her claim against Women First, regardless of whether Ms. Harris intended that effect, and the court erred in denying its motions for judgment and JNOV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. Harris responds that when there is no claim of independent liability on the part of the employer, but only of liability under\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   based on the employee's wrongdoing, a dismissal with prejudice of the claim against the employee without a settlement or exchange of consideration is not a release of claims or an adjudication upon the merits and therefore does not foreclose the plaintiff's claim against the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Whether the court erred in denying Women First's motions for judgment and JNOV is a question of law that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Walter v.

General partners sued a lender for declaratory and injunctive relief to forestall foreclosure on a deed of trust. After injunctive relief was denied, they sought court approval to voluntarily dismiss their claims without prejudice, under former Rule 582. That rule required a party to obtain leave of court to voluntarily dismiss a claim and stated that the court's order \"shall specify whether dismissal is with or without prejudice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2323935\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/33/231/\">\n    33 Md.App. at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20A.2d%20109\">\n    364 A.2d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting former Md. Rule 582(a)). Over the general partners' objection and without a hearing on the merits, the circuit court dismissed their complaint\n   <em>\n    with prejudice\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    without prejudice\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In holding that the circuit court lacked authority to do so, we stated: \"A dismissal\n   with prejudice is a final adjudication and it is fundamental that an action can be finally adjudicated over objection of the plaintiff only after a hearing on the merits or through imposition of sanctions for default or conduct proscribed by law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2323935\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/33/231/\">\n    33 Md.App. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20A.2d%20109\">\n    364 A.2d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (additional citations omitted). Women First seizes upon this language, but the case is distinguishable. It did not involve tort liability or vicarious liability, and given its procedural posture, the most our comment about a \"final adjudication\" can be taken to mean is that the dismissal of the general partners' claims with prejudice, precluding them from re-filing the same suit, had the same effect on them as a final adjudication of their claims. The general partners could do nothing more to pursue relief. We did not say that the dismissal with prejudice was an adjudication upon the merits of the claims that were dismissed nor did we analyze the effect, if any, the dismissal with prejudice would have on anyone else.\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bryan,\n   </em>\n   we were concerned with the collateral estoppel effect of a verdict and settlement in a New York case on a Maryland case that shared a common party. A driver and passenger involved in an automobile accident sued Bryan, another driver involved in the same accident, in a New York court. The case was bifurcated and the jury returned a verdict against Bryan on liability. Before the damages phase of the trial began, the parties settled: Bryan paid $30,000, and the plaintiffs dismissed their claims with prejudice. Bryan then sued his uninsured motorist carrier in a Maryland court, claiming that the accident was caused by a phantom driver. The carrier moved to dismiss on the basis of collateral estoppel on the issue of liability. The circuit court granted the motion, and we affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We held that the New York jury's liability verdict against Bryan, combined with the settlement and dismissal of the claims against him with prejudice, which \"operate[d] at a minimum, as a bar to further action on the same claim [,]\" had preclusive effect against him in his claim against the carrier.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3997514\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/205/587/\">\n    205 Md.App. at 603, 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3997514\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/205/587/\">\n    45 A.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, in that case we were not addressing the effect, if any, of a voluntary dismissal with prejudice only, and in particular whether it operated as an adjudication upon the merits. We also were not addressing vicarious liability. We were addressing the effect of an actual adjudication upon the merits on the issue of negligence resulting in a verdict, but not a judgment, followed by a settlement and dismissal with prejudice, on a later claim brought by the person whose negligence had been actually adjudicated. The case is not particularly helpful to our analysis for these reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Semtek\n   </em>\n   , which involves\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , is somewhat helpful but, as we later shall explain, does not advance Women First's position. In\n   <em>\n    Semtek,\n   </em>\n   an action for inducement to breach a contract and various business torts was brought in a California state court and then was removed to a California federal district court based on diversity of citizenship. The defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that the claims were barred by California's two-year statute of\n   limitations. The federal district court granted the motion and entered an order of involuntary dismissal, under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 41(b), including (at the defendant's request) language that the dismissal was \" 'on the merits' \" and \" 'with prejudice.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    531 U.S. at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff brought the same claims against the same defendant in a Maryland circuit court, within Maryland's three-year statute of limitations. The defendant moved to dismiss on the ground of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , arguing that the\n   federal district court's involuntary dismissal of the claims was an adjudication upon the merits, which is an element of that defense. The circuit court granted the motion, and this Court affirmed. After the Court of Appeals denied a petition for writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court took the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The defendant advocated that Rule 41(b) gave the federal district court's dismissal order preclusive effect. That rule provides, with certain exceptions, that unless the court orders otherwise, an involuntary dismissal \"operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 41(b). The Supreme Court observed that in the context of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   , an \"adjudication upon the merits\" ordinarily means an adjudication that \" 'pass[es] directly on the substance of [a particular] claim' before the court.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    531 U.S. at 501-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19, Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   , at 161 (1980)). The meaning of \"adjudication upon the merits\" has gradually changed with time, however, often being applied to judgments that do not pass on the merits. For example, the Court noted, the involuntary dismissal of a claim in one state court on the ground of that state's statute of limitations usually does not have preclusive effect when the same claim is brought in another state court that has a different statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In ascertaining the meaning of \"adjudication upon the merits,\" the Court looked to Rule 41(a), which governs voluntary\n   dismissals. That rule \"makes clear that an 'adjudication upon the merits' is the opposite of a 'dismissal without prejudice[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 505,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Neither Rule 41(a) nor Rule 41(b) uses the \"with prejudice\" nomenclature.) The Court determined that the \"primary meaning of 'dismissal without prejudice' \" in Rule 41(a)\"is dismissal without barring the plaintiff from returning later, to the same court, with the same underlying claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . So the only effect of the California federal district court's involuntary dismissal of the plaintiff's claims was to bar the plaintiff from refiling those same claims in that same court. Its effect was not to operate as an adjudication upon the merits for purposes of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ultimately, the Court decided that the claim preclusion effect of an involuntary dismissal by a federal district court sitting in diversity is a matter of federal common law; and because \"state, rather than federal, substantive law is at issue there is no need for a uniform federal rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    531 U.S. at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To discourage forum shopping in the federal courts, the Court adopted \"as the federally prescribed rule of decision ... the law that would be applied by state courts in the State in which the federal diversity court sits[,]\" unless incompatible with federal interests.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 508-09,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

An order that is an adjudication upon the merits under Rule 41(b), so as to prevent the same plaintiff from re-filing the same claim in the same court, is not necessarily\n   an adjudication upon the merits for preclusive effect, as an element of the substantive law of the defense of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . In other words, context matters. We shall keep this in mind as we consider the cases Women First cites to support its position that the dismissal with\n   prejudice of Ms. Harris's claim against Dr. McMillan precluded her from recovering against it based on\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   and the cases Ms. Harris cites for the opposite position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Women First places greatest reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Harrison v.

There, the plaintiff brought suit in a North Carolina state court against her former supervisor (Walls), for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and against their former employer (Edison), for those torts under\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   . She also included direct claims against Edison for wrongful discharge and negligent retention. Edison removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. Walls filed a counterclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff and Walls entered into a settlement by which each agreed to voluntarily dismiss his/her claim against the other \"with prejudice,\" by stipulation. Edison did not know about the stipulation until it was filed. Upon learning of it, Edison moved for summary judgment on the claims against it, arguing that the plaintiff's dismissal with prejudice of her claims against Walls precluded her from recovering against it on those claims, as any liability it could have on those claims was solely derivative. The court granted the motion as to the derivative battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, but denied the motion as to the direct claim of negligent retention. It also granted a motion to dismiss the wrongful discharge claim and certified that there was no just reason to delay for purposes of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Edison on the battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.

Specifically, when the dismissal with prejudice of the agent is not given in exchange for consideration and the merits of the tort claim against the agent have not actually been adjudicated before the dismissal, neither sound legal principles nor the policy underlying\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   supports the conclusion that the dismissal with prejudice eliminates any vicarious liability on the part of the principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   , in an agency relationship, the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   operates to impose liability upon the principal for the agent's tortious conduct committed within the scope of the agency; therefore, a finding that the agent committed a tort is a necessary predicate for the principal to be held liable. To obtain a judgment against the principal, however, the plaintiff need not\n   <em>\n    sue\n   </em>\n   the agent and the agent need not be held liable individually. It is sufficient that the plaintiff sue the principal and put on evidence proving the agent's tortious conduct. If the fact-finder determines that the agent committed a tort and did so while acting within the scope of the agency, the principal will be liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Because the liability of the principal is wholly derivative, that is, it is a function of status and stems entirely from the tortious conduct of the agent, not from any tortious conduct by the principal, there only can be one recovery, regardless of whether both are sued or only the principal is sued.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chilcote v.

And, as in\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's release of her tort claim against the agent necessarily precludes the imposition of liability\n   against the principal.

It is usual that the release by a plaintiff of her claim against a defendant, which is a thing of value, will be given in exchange for a thing of value, ordinarily money, given by that defendant. When a principal's potential liability in tort derives solely from the tortious conduct of his agent, as is the case when the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   applies, it makes sense to treat the release of the agent as if it were an adjudication upon the merits in his favor and therefore in favor of the principal.

The risk of double recovery is not a concern because the plaintiff has not received anything of value. The dismissal with prejudice is simply the procedural mechanism to permanently remove the agent as a defendant in the case when it was not necessary to include him as a defendant in the case to begin with. It is not \"an affirmative finding of non-negligence [,]\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20Va.%2045\">\n    273 Va. at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637512\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/302/\">\n    639 S.E.2d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as there is no substantive determination underlying it. And the purpose behind the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   -to ensure that upon a showing of agency there will be two sources of recovery instead of one-certainly would be defeated by treating the procedural dismissal with prejudice as if it were a substantive finding of no negligence, thus reducing the plaintiff's sources of recovery from two to none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   To be sure, in Maryland, the dismissal with prejudice of any defendant, including an agent, bars the plaintiff from bringing a second action against that defendant on the same claim,\n   <em>\n    Roane v.

Our concern is with the effect of a dismissal with prejudice of one defendant, an agent, on a second defendant, his principal, however. In that context, when the alleged wrongful conduct of the agent is still open for determination by the fact-finder in the action against the principal, it is immaterial that the plaintiff is barred from bringing a second action against the agent. (Indeed, if it were material, the plaintiff could not recover from the principal without suing the agent.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The legal effect of a dismissal with prejudice of an agent on his principal should be guided by whether the dismissal is a procedural device used to drop the agent as a defendant or has a substantive basis, such as an adverse decision on the\n   merits, the release of the plaintiff's claim, or an exchange of value. In this case, the dismissal with prejudice simply removed Dr. McMillan from the case, without more. Had the parties intended that her removal would preclude Ms. Harris from pursuing her claim against Women First, they could have stated so expressly. (It is obvious that that would not have happened, however.) Otherwise, the legal effect of Ms. Harris's voluntary dismissal with prejudice of her claim against Dr. McMillan was not to preclude her from continuing to pursue her\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim against Women First. That claim remained viable. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Women First's motion for judgment or motion for JNOV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Women First's second contention concerns the trial court's exercise of revisory power to convert what it termed Ms. Harris's \"motion to dismiss\" her claim against Dr. McMillan from a dismissal \"with prejudice\" to a dismissal \"without prejudice.\" It argues that Ms. Harris never moved to dismiss her claim against Dr. McMillan; rather, she presented the court with a stipulation of dismissal that was approved by the parties. It further asserts that any revisory power the court had was governed by Rule 2-535(b) and that Ms. Harris did not file a written motion, which must be done for the court to exercise its revisory power under that rule. Finally, it maintains that even if Ms. Harris had filed such a motion, she was not entitled to relief under that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Ms. Harris responds that the court properly exercised its discretion to revise her motion to dismiss to one without prejudice under Rule 2-602(a) because there was no final judgment at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The proceedings central to this issue, which we have described above, are not a model of clarity. Counsel for Ms. Harris did not file a stipulation of dismissal signed by Ms. Harris and by Dr. McMillan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 2-506(a). He presented an oral stipulation, with which counsel for Dr.\n   McMillan agreed; and did not expressly request leave of court to voluntarily dismiss the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 2-506(c). From the wording of the docket entries, however, it seems that the court treated the oral stipulation as a motion for leave to dismiss the claim against Dr. McMillan with prejudice, which it \"[g]ranted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   After Women First moved for judgment at the close of Ms. Harris's case and the court called upon the parties to file memoranda, Ms. Harris's counsel asked as an alternative form of relief (if the court were inclined to grant the motion for judgment) that the dismissal with prejudice already\n   \"[g]ranted\" by the court be revised to a dismissal without prejudice. In ruling on the motion for judgment, the court expressly determined that the dismissal with prejudice of the claim against Dr. McMillan did not insulate Women First from liability. It also granted the alternative relief, however. The court did not prepare a written order of dismissal, with or without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The contention Women First advances lacks merit for several reasons. First, we have affirmed the court's primary ruling, that Ms. Harris's dismissal with prejudice of her claim against Dr. McMillan did not compel the entry of judgment in favor of Women First as a matter of law. So, whether the court abused its discretion by revising the \"motion to dismiss\" from one with prejudice to without prejudice is of no consequence. Without any revision by the court, the ruling on the motion for judgment was correct and the case against Women First properly proceeded to the jury for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Second, Rule 2-535(b) is completely irrelevant. It governs the court's power, in a civil case, to revise a final judgment more than 30 days after the judgment was entered. In a civil case against multiple parties, there can be no final judgment until the claims by and against all parties have been adjudicated. Md. Rule 2-602(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the revision that\n   Women First complains about was made, the claim against it was not yet adjudicated, so there was no final judgment, let alone an enrolled final judgment. At most, the court was revising its interlocutory oral ruling approving the dismissal with prejudice of the claim against Dr. McMillan only, which means it was acting under Rule 2-602(a)(3), and therefore had full revisory power.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baltimore Police Dept. v.

The Court explained that \"a voluntary dismissal by stipulation, which is not presented to the court for approval is not an order of court and therefore is not a judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 488,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/#p487\">\n    103 A.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, if counsel for Ms. Harris and Dr. McMillan had signed and filed a voluntary stipulation of dismissal of the claim against Dr. McMillan (with or without prejudice), the separate document requirement would not have been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   We think it plain that the trial court granted leave for Ms. Harris to voluntarily dismiss her claim against Dr. McMillan with prejudice and then, as a fall back to its ruling on the motion for judgment, without prejudice. Docket entries were\n   made of these rulings. Nevertheless, there never has been a\n   document signed either by the court or by the clerk of court memorializing these rulings and therefore constituting a final judgment under Rule 2-601(a).

He explained that in removing the uterus the physician cauterizes and severs the left uterine artery, which crosses over the left ureter. To do so in this case, Dr. McMillan used a \"harmonic scalpel,\" which is a surgical instrument that coagulates blood and also cuts tissue by means of jaw-like appendages and friction-generated heat. The harmonic scalpel is capable of burning tissue within a 3 millimeter radius. Dr. Luciani opined that Dr. McMillan failed to properly locate Ms. Harris's left ureter and use appropriate techniques to move it a safe distance from where she was applying the harmonic scalpel to sever the left uterine artery. As a consequence, she caught the left ureter in the jaws of the harmonic scalpel, or within it s burn radius, damaging it at the level where the left uterine artery crossed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Dr. Aron, Ms. Harris's urology expert, testified in greater detail about the cause of the injury to Ms. Harris's left ureter. He reviewed the pyelogram Dr. Karr performed and read the images as showing an \"obstruction\" and leak in the left ureter \"at the level of the uterine artery.\" He opined that the obstruction and leak were created when Dr. McMillan \"clamped\" the left ureter \"in the tip of the harmonic [scalpel]\" while severing the left uterine artery, both \"burn[ing]\" and \"cut[ting]\" the left ureter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   These expert witnesses testified on December 8 and 9, 2015, respectively. On the night of December 9, 2015, counsel for Women First took the\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition of Dr. Redwood, its own urology expert, for use at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   On December 10, 2015, Women First called Dr. Dickman, its OB-GYN expert, who opined that Ms. Harris sustained a delayed-onset injury caused by a disruption of the blood supply to the left ureter during the hysterectomy, which would have been undetectable at the time of surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Women First then called Dr. Johnson, its urogynecology expert. Before Dr. Johnson could testify regarding the pyelogram performed by Dr. Karr, and before Women First played Dr. Redwood's\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition, Ms. Harris's counsel objected to their testimony. He argued that they were about to opine that the injury to Ms. Harris's left ureter was in fact located\n   in a lower area on the ureter and that that location suggested that Dr. Karr caused the injury in the course of performing the pyelogram, which was an entirely different opinion than the one they had expressed in their pre-trial depositions. (Their prior opinion had been in accordance with Dr. Dickman's opinion.) He complained that Ms. Harris had not been given any prior notice of this change in the defense experts' opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Ms. Harris's counsel moved the court\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to restrict Drs. Johnson and Redwood to giving the opinion they originally\n   expressed in pre-trial depositions and to prohibit them from opining that Dr. Karr had caused the injury to Ms. Harris. He conceded that he did not provide the pyelogram images to defense counsel until after Drs. Johnson and Redwood had given their pre-trial depositions and that they were entitled to change their opinions based on the new material. He maintained, however, that defense counsel was obligated to notify him in the event of such a change, which he did not do. He further directed the court's attention to a letter he had sent to defense counsel on November 16, 2015, asking to be notified if and when Dr. Redwood or Dr. Johnson changed their opinions in response to the pyelogram images. Defense counsel did not respond to that letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Counsel for Women First countered that the objection to Dr. Redwood's testimony was waived because it was not raised when his\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition was taken on December 9, 2015, and disputed that Dr. Johnson's testimony had \"chang[ed][.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The court denied the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   but permitted Ms. Harris's counsel to cross-examine Dr. Johnson on the issue, which he later did. Drs. Johnson and Redwood each testified that the pyelogram did not show an injury to the left ureter where the left uterine artery crossed it. Rather, it showed an intact left ureter all the way to \"the entry point of the ureter into the bladder [,]\" which is \"2 or 3 centimeters\" below the point where the uterine artery crosses it and \"away from where Dr. McMillan was working\" with the harmonic scalpel. Dr. Redwood opined that the leak of iodine contrast from Ms. Harris's left ureter into her abdomen, captured in images from the pyelogram, was an injury \"created by [Dr. Karr] during [the pyelogram] procedure [,]\" specifically, by Dr. Karr's inserting a needle and catheter in the left ureter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Meanwhile, after Dr. Johnson testified but before the defense rested its case, Ms. Harris sought to call Dr. Karr as a fact and expert rebuttal witness to testify that Drs. Johnson and Redwood were misinterpreting the pyelogram. Counsel for Women First objected, arguing that Dr. Karr's testimony\n   would not be true rebuttal, as Ms. Harris's counsel had had ample reason to anticipate that Drs. Johnson and Redwood would disagree with Dr. Aron's interpretation of the pyelogram, and it was Ms. Harris's counsel's fault that the pyelogram images were not provided farther in advance. Counsel for Women First also objected on the ground that Ms. Harris had not designated Dr. Karr as an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The court granted Ms. Harris's request, relying in part on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Riffey v.

Second, the initial act of injecting the contrast iodine into the kidney could not have caused a leakage at the point observed in the pyelogram in an otherwise intact ureter; one would \"typically see a leak\" in the area \"around the needle that ... we've put into the kidney\" when the leak is caused by \"inject[ing] a lot of pressure [.]\" He demonstrated that the pyelogram images did not depict an intact ureter past the point of the leak and obstruction and clarified that Drs. Redwood and Johnson had misinterpreted the pyelogram images by mistaking \"shadow[s]\" captured by the images and the catheter needle \"extending\" outside and beyond the ureter for the ureter itself. He stated that his written report of the pyelogram procedure clearly identified the locus of the leakage and obstruction and could not be properly read to mean the left ureter was intact until \"just before the bladder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Women First argues that Dr. Karr's testimony was not proper rebuttal evidence because it \"did not rebut any\n   <em>\n    new matter\n   </em>\n   raised by [Women First] in its case-in-chief[.]\" (Emphasis in Appellant's Brief.) Specifically, Drs. Redwood and Johnson \"interpreted the same pyelogram [study] and opined regarding the same issues of location and causation\" of the injury to Ms. Harris's left ureter as Dr. Aron and therefore did not present any \"new matter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Ms. Harris did not designate Dr. Karr as an expert witness before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Ms. Harris counters that the court properly permitted Dr. Karr to testify as a rebuttal witness, because in their testimony Drs. Redwood and Johnson expressed two entirely \"new\" opinions that were not disclosed before trial and therefore could not be addressed in her case-in-chief: (1) that her left ureter \"was completely intact from the kidney all the way down to the bladder\"; and (2) that the injury to her left ureter was caused by Dr. Karr. Ms. Harris does not address whether the court should have allowed Dr. Karr to testify as an undesignated expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   It is within the discretion of the trial court to admit rebuttal testimony.\n   <em>\n    Riffey v.

Murphy, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Maryland Evidence Handbook\n   </em>\n   104 (Matthew Bender, 4th ed., 2010). The opinions of Drs. Redwood and Johnson expressed at trial included previously undisclosed and unanticipated \"new matter\" that Dr. Karr's testimony \"direct[ly] repl[ied] to\" and \"contradict[ed.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Women First does not dispute that in their pretrial depositions Drs. Redwood and Johnson agreed with Dr. Aron about the location of the injury to Ms. Harris's left ureter; and Women First's only theory of defense before trial was that the\n   defect to Ms. Harris's left ureter was a delayed-onset injury caused by a disruption of the blood supply to the ureter during the hysterectomy. Nor does Women First dispute that it did not inform Ms. Harris's counsel that Drs. Redwood's and Johnson's opinions had changed after their pretrial depositions, even though defense counsel had received the November 16, 2015 letter from Ms. Harris's counsel requesting any such information. Thus, the opinions Drs. Redwood and Johnson expressed at trial about the pyelogram images showing that Ms. Harris's left ureter was intact (uninjured) past the point identified by Dr. Aron until its entrance into the bladder and the leakage of iodine contrast from the left ureter were a surprise to Ms. Harris. They supported undisclosed novel defense theories that Ms. Harris could not have anticipated before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Dr. Karr's rebuttal testimony explained that Drs. Redwood and Johnson had misidentified other structures on the pyelogram images as Harris's left ureter, and that the left ureter was not intact to its entry point to the bladder. He also explained that he observed the leakage defect in Harris's left ureter before inserting a catheter and thus could not have caused the defect in that manner. These opinions exclusively and directly addressed the new matters first raised by Drs. Redwood and Johnson in their trial testimony; they did not echo Dr. Aron's opinion in Ms. Harris's case-in-chief. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion by permitting Dr. Karr to testify as a rebuttal witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Moreover, it was within the court's discretion to permit Dr. Karr to testify as a rebuttal witness even though Ms. Harris did not designate him as an expert prior to trial.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.
