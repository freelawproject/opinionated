We further conclude that the court should have dismissed the plaintiff's original complaint, rather than permit her to replead, after it determined that the doctrine of absolute immunity applied to her entire complaint. Accordingly, the form of judgment is improper, and we, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter with direction to render a judgment of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court set forth the following relevant facts in its memorandum of decision as to the defendants' first motion to strike. \"The plaintiff and ... Stephen Bruno were divorced in 2008 by order of the Danbury Superior Court .... [In her complaint,] [t]he plaintiff alleges that on February 24, 2014, a hearing was held in Danbury Superior Court in her dissolution of marriage action on a postjudgment motion brought by her former husband involving court-ordered alimony and support payments. The plaintiff alleges that an employee or representative of [the defendants] ... appeared at this hearing in response to a subpoena issued by her former husband's attorney. The plaintiff further alleges that the defendants' employee made certain statements at this hearing and produced two letters issued by the defendants that he 'caused to be entered into evidence,' both of which, the plaintiff claims, were defamatory to\n   her. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants intentionally and wrongfully allowed their employee to testify at the hearing and produce the letters in question, and that these actions have given rise to several causes of action against them for damages.\n   \"The plaintiff claims that as a result of the defendants' actions or, alternatively, as a result of the defendants' failure to contest the subpoena and take actions to block her former husband's efforts to compel their employee's testimony, they are liable to her .... The plaintiff seeks compensatory, general, punitive, and consequential damages from the defendants for these alleged transgressions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the basis of the aforementioned letters and the employee's testimony, both of which the plaintiff believed contained defamatory statements about her, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants in seven counts: (1) defamation by libel per se, (2) violation of the Connecticut Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-975 et seq., (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress, (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (5) violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., (6) vicarious liability, and (7) negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendants, thereafter, filed a motion to strike each count that had been filed against them on the ground that they were entitled to absolute immunity due to the applicability of the litigation privilege. The plaintiff then filed a responsive pleading. Subsequently, the defendants filed a reply memorandum in which they argued, in part, that the court's subject matter jurisdiction was implicated by the doctrine of absolute immunity. On January 5, 2015, the court granted the defendants' motion to strike each count of the complaint on the ground of absolute immunity, concluding\n   that the litigation privilege applied. The court, however, did not address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Given that the court had granted the defendants' motion to strike, the plaintiff exercised her option to replead and filed an amended complaint pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 10-44. In her amended complaint, she alleged the following causes of action against the defendants: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) violation of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-815 et seq., (4) defamation by libel per se, (5) violation of the Connecticut Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act, General Statutes \u00a7 38a-975 et seq., (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (7) violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., (8) vicarious liability, and (9) negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to the amended complaint, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on all counts of the stricken complaint and requested, in the alternative, that the court strike counts three through nine of the amended complaint on the ground that it failed to cure the deficiencies in her original complaint. The defendants also requested summary judgment on the two new counts of the amended complaint, set forth as counts one and two, on the basis that they were time barred by the limitation set forth in the defendants' contract of insurance with the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court granted the motion and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The dispositive issue raised by the plaintiff concerns her claim that absolute immunity implicates the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction. She contends that the court erred by not ordering the defendants to file a motion to dismiss rather than permit them to raise\n   the issue of absolute immunity and the court's subject\n   matter jurisdiction in a motion to strike. We agree with the plaintiff's contention that absolute immunity implicates the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction.

Here, once the defendants raised the issue of absolute immunity, based on the application of the litigation privilege, and the court then determined that the plaintiff's initial complaint was barred by the doctrine of absolute immunity, the court should have dismissed the case against the defendants, essentially treating the motion to strike as a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   Practice Book \u00a7 10-30 (a) (1) (\"[a] motion to dismiss shall be used to assert ... lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter\"); see generally\n   <em>\n    Branford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Monaco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063660\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/48/216/\">\n    48 Conn.App. 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=709%20A.2d%20582\">\n    709 A.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (although \"[t]he defendants asserted their claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction as a special defense ...

[T]he possibility of incurring the costs and inconvenience associated with defending a [retaliatory] suit might well deter a citizen with a legitimate grievance from filing a complaint. ...

For example, we have concluded that absolute immunity bars claims of intentional interference with contractual or beneficial relations arising from statements made during a civil action. See\n   <em>\n    Rioux\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730066\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/338/#p343\">\n    283 Conn. at 350-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20304\">\n    927 A.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (absolute immunity applies to intentional interference with contractual relations because that tort comparatively is more like defamation than vexatious litigation). We have also precluded claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from statements made during judicial proceedings on the basis of absolute immunity. See\n   <em>\n    DeLaurentis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Haven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545038\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/220/225/#p263\">\n    220 Conn. 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263-64,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20A.2d%20807\">\n    597 A.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).

In reviewing these cases, it becomes clear that, in expanding the doctrine of absolute immunity to bar claims beyond defamation, this court has sought to ensure that the conduct that absolute immunity is intended to protect, namely, participation and candor in judicial proceedings, remains protected regardless of the particular tort alleged in response to the words used during participation in the\n   judicial process.

The witness is not charged with the duty of determining whether the information sought is relevant or material. Such questions are solely the province of the trial court ... and the witness cannot be held liable in a civil suit for his answer. ... To hold otherwise would be manifestly unfair to the witness, who often, but not always is untrained in legal matters, timid, and appears at the behest of some third party.\" [Citations omitted.] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As explained by the trial court in its memorandum of decision as to the defendants' first motion to strike, \"the parties' respective pleadings set forth the following undisputed facts. First, the plaintiff's former husband attempted to introduce the evidence in question during a part of the hearing related to alimony. The plaintiff did not object to introduction of the letters into evidence at this time but did object to the witness' testimony on relevancy grounds. The court ... agreed and sustained the plaintiff's objection to the witness' testimony on the ground that it was not relevant to this question [of alimony]. [Counsel for the plaintiff's] former husband ... then attempted to introduce the ... testimony [of the defendants' representative]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   later in the same hearing on the court's consideration of 'shelter expenses,' which the court permitted. Given these facts, and considering the rule that relevancy must be generously construed, the court finds that the statements were relevant to the matters at hand. The court therefore finds that the oral testimony of the defendants' employee and the contents of the two letters provided by him at the hearing are covered by the doctrine of absolute immunity.\" We agree with the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendants produced documents and provided testimony specifically in response to the subpoena issued by the plaintiff's former husband. The defendants' testimony and disclosures were made in a formal judicial proceeding, and they were relevant to that proceeding. Therefore, we conclude the court properly determined that the documents and testimony are protected by the doctrine of absolute immunity, as applied to the litigation privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We further conclude, however, that, because absolute immunity protects a party from suit and implicates the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction, once the trial court determined that the doctrine of absolute immunity applied in this matter, it should have dismissed the plaintiff's original complaint against the defendants. The plaintiff should not have been given the opportunity to replead because the court was without jurisdiction to permit a repleading. Accordingly, any action taken after the court determined that absolute immunity applied to all of the plaintiff's causes of action against the defendants is void; the court had no jurisdiction.
