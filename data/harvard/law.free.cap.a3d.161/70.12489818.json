Appellants consist of plaintiffs represented by three different groups of law firms: 1) the Law Offices of Peter\n   Angelos (\"LOPA plaintiffs\" or \"LOPA\"); 2) Goodman, Meagher &amp; Enoch, LLP and Clifford Cuniff; Ashcraft &amp; Gerel (\"GME/Cuniff/A &amp; G Plaintiffs\"); and 3) Skeen, Goldman, LLP (\"Goldman Plaintiffs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants were plaintiffs in asbestos-related litigation against MCIC Inc. (formerly McCormick Asbestos Company, \"MCIC\"). In a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on May 20, 2005, appellants sought, for the second time, additional insurance coverage and proceeds pursuant to a 1994 settlement agreement with appellees, MCIC and its insurers: United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (\"USF &amp; G\"); Royal Insurance Company (\"Royal\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liberty Mutual Insurance Company; Continental Insurance Company (\"Continental\");\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (\"Hartford\"). Appellants brought claims against appellees for negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, and fraud by concealment. Specifically, appellants claim that the appellees fraudulently obtained the settlement by intentionally misrepresenting the extent of MCIC's available insurance coverage, and that the appellees knew that their misrepresentations regarding the available coverage were false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August 2012, appellees filed motions for summary judgment, arguing that appellants' claims were time-barred pursuant to the three-year statute of limitations in Maryland Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellees argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that appellants were on inquiry notice of their claims as early as 1997 or 1998, shortly after this Court published its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Porter Hayden Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    116 Md.App. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=348%20Md.%20205\">\n    348 Md. 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=703%20A.2d%20147\">\n    703 A.2d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 20, 2012, the circuit court dismissed appellants' claims on the basis that they were time-barred. Appellants present several questions for our review,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which we have rephrased as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Did the circuit court err in finding that, as a matter of law, the appellants' claims were barred by the statute of\n   limitations because appellants were on inquiry notice of the misrepresentations as early as 1997?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment without permitting appellants to conduct additional discovery?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We answer the first question in the negative, and need not decide the second. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellants Litigate\n    <em>\n     Abate I\n    </em>\n    while MCIC and Its Insurers Pursue Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   MCIC, which was founded in 1934, sold and installed asbestos insulation products. By the early 1970s, it was clear that asbestos was hazardous, and MCIC ceased selling and installing asbestos-containing products in approximately 1973.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the late 1980s, several law firms, including those representing appellants, collectively filed several thousand lawsuits against MCIC asserting personal injury claims resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products. In April 1990, the cases of 8,555 plaintiffs were consolidated for trial (\"\n   <em>\n    Abate I\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Abate I\n   </em>\n   lawsuit was pending, MCIC and its insurers pursued settlement of the lawsuits against MCIC. On February 14, 1992, MCIC's attorney, John Nagle III, Esq. (\"Nagle\"), wrote a letter to LOPA attorney Thomas Friedman, Esq. (\"Friedman\"), with an attached schedule of all available insurance policies sold to MCIC. The schedule contained a note claiming that the list was prepared by USF &amp; G on behalf of MCIC, and the information provided was \"based primarily on secondary evidence of coverage.\" The schedule also contained two columns under the heading \"products coverage,\" one listing \"per person limit[s],\" and the other listing \"per occurrence limit[s].\" Framing the settlement discussion in terms of available \"products coverage\" had, as we will explain, a significant impact on the amount of coverage appellants received in settlement, as well as on the eventual causes of action in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 27, 1992, Friedman responded, submitting a total demand of $19,527,900. Mr. Friedman concluded his letter saying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   From the insurance information you supplied, it appears that your client may, in a best case scenario, not have\n   sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy our demand.\n   <em>\n    Under these circumstances, we are prepared to recommend in settlement of all our claims the total amount of your insurance coverage.\n   </em>\n   It is imperative, therefore, that you determine as expeditiously as possible the exact amount of insurance coverage and that our tender is submitted to your principal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Emphasis added). Notably, Friedman recommended seeking all available coverage, and not just \"products coverage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 8, 1992, the jury found MCIC strictly liable for asbestos-related injuries suffered by foreseeable users and foreseeable bystanders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Settlement discussions pertaining to damages ensued, with counsel for MCIC repeatedly stating that there were \"limited assets available to MCIC,\" and that bankruptcy proceedings or a settlement with another claimant could likely impact the amount appellants could recover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 7, 1992, Nagle sent a letter to Friedman enclosing a revised schedule of insurance (dated November 6, 1992) that was, in most respects, identical to the earlier version. The schedule identified the \"per person\" and \"per occurrence\" limits as \"products coverage.\" Nagle indicated that he was providing the information \"as it [was] related to [him] by USF &amp; G,\" noting that \"no physical copies of policies of insurance exist with respect to coverage provided to MCIC by its various insurers over the decades,\" and explaining that \"the policies were disposed of prior to the time when MCIC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   was first named as a defendant,\" and \"[a]ll reasonable efforts have been made to locate such policies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    The 1994 Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 14, 1993, Baltimore City Circuit Court Administrative Judge Joseph H.H. Kaplan held a conference to discuss settlement. Nagle had requested the conference so that MCIC could propose to pay approximately $13 million, all of MCIC's remaining insurance coverage, to settle all of the cases pending against MCIC. At the conference, appellants' attorneys requested all of the policies that the insurers had ever issued to MCIC, but counsel for the insurers claimed that the policies could not be produced for review. Nagle insisted that the approximately $13 million offer represented MCIC's remaining insurance assets. Appellants' counsel insisted on reviewing the policies before accepting any settlement, and Judge Kaplan instructed the insurers to provide whatever policy documents they possessed in anticipation of future settlement discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    The Nagle Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 15, 1993, Nagle sent a letter to appellants' counsel with \"insurance coverage documents\" attached, which he indicated were \"recently provided to [him] by the respective carriers of MCIC, Inc.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We shall refer to these documents as the \"Nagle Documents.\" The letter stated that Royal had not yet provided him with policy information, but that he would deliver those documents once he received them. The letter also included two tables which summarized the \"limits of each carrier and\n   MCIC (exclusive of Royal).\" The letter concluded that the total amount of coverage available was $12,300,000.00 with $11,877,054.90 remaining.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Royal, unable to locate a copy of any insurance policy it sold to MCIC, wrote a letter to Nagle on October 21, 1993, conceding that, although it could not locate them, it had, in fact, issued insurance policies to MCIC. Royal provided a schedule that listed the policies it issued to MCIC and concluded that the total amount of coverage it provided to MCIC was $1,200,000 based on the \"Bodily Injury Limits\" of $25,000/50,000 for the first two years and $50,000/100,000 for the remaining 11 years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Royal reiterated that it did not possess any copies of actual policies, and therefore it claimed that the information it provided was \"extremely sketchy.\" Nagle forwarded Royal's letter to appellants' counsel on October 21, 1993.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Contents of the Nagle Documents-Types of Coverage and Limits of Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Nagle Documents included Declaration sheets\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the available policies, which were standard Comprehensive General Liability (\"CGL\") policies. The Declaration sheets themselves distinguished the available limits of liability. For example, the USF &amp; G Declaration sheet provided maximum limits to the insured for bodily injury in the following ways: $300,000 each occurrence; and $300,000 in the aggregate. The section titled \"Limits of Liability\" provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The total liability of the Company for all damages ... because of bodily injury sustained by one or more persons as the result of any one occurrence shall not exceed the limit of bodily injury liability stated in the declarations as applicable to \"each occurrence.\" Subject to the above provision respecting \"each occurrence,\" the total liability of the\n   Company for all damages because of (1)\n   <em>\n    all bodily injury included within the completed operations hazard\n   </em>\n   and (2)\n   <em>\n    all bodily injury included within the products hazard shall not exceed the limit of bodily injury liability stated in the declarations as \"aggregate.\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis added). This language explains that a standard CGL policy provides an aggregate limit for bodily injury claims that fall under the \"products hazard\" or \"completed operations hazard.\" Both of these hazards fall within the \"products coverage\" umbrella. By only imposing aggregate limits for the specifically mentioned bodily injury claims, the policies implicitly permitted non-aggregated limits for \"non-products coverage\" claims. The distinction between \"products coverage\" and \"non-products coverage\" is at the heart of appellants' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Reaching the Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 2, 1993, Judge Kaplan convened a second settlement conference. At that conference, Nagle stated that, having provided the Nagle Documents, he had now offered all insurance coverage, primary\n   as well as excess, in exchange for full settlement and relief from further defense obligation. Nagle admitted that the Nagle Documents were incomplete, but insisted that the total amount of unused and available coverage for MCIC was $13,077,054.90, based on the insurers taking a worst case scenario in calculating that sum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Appellants' counsel insisted on substantiating that the Nagle Documents included all available policy documents, arguing that they needed to verify the limits of MCIC's coverage or the total remaining coverage before agreeing to settle. To address these concerns, the parties agreed that the insurers would provide affidavits that stated that MCIC's total remaining coverage was approximately $13 million, that the appellees were tendering the limits of remaining unpaid funds,\n   <em>\n    and that\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the appellees were not aware of any other applicable or available coverage\n   </em>\n   . Judge Kaplan directed the parties to begin drafting a settlement agreement that would include these affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On August 10, 1994, Judge Kaplan approved the settlement agreement for $12,351,000 which both the appellants and appellees signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 2.2 of the settlement agreement provided, at a minimum, a contractual cause of action if more insurance coverage was found.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The Defendant agrees that if in addition to the insurance coverage disclosed by Insurers and confirmed by their affidavits ... other insurance is discovered which would be applicable to claims made, the Defendant will promptly notify Participating Plaintiffs' Counsel and arrange for a pro rata distribution to them for payment to the Plaintiffs ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Attached to the settlement agreement were affidavits from each of the appellees, stating: (1) \"a diligent and thorough search\" had been made for MCIC's insurance policies; (2) those searches produced information leading each insurer to report the amounts of coverage listed in the settlement agreement; (3) there was no indication that there were any other policies or coverages available other than what was represented; and (4) there was no indication that the stated limits and unpaid funds were other than what was represented. An additional affidavit, provided by Robert I. McCormick, Treasurer of MCIC, stated that, as of April 30, 1994, the assets of MCIC had a total value of $299.89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Porter Hayden\n    </em>\n    and an Alternative Theory of Claim Classification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On August 29, 1997, this Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    116 Md.App. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). There, Commercial\n   Union provided liability insurance to Porter Hayden, a company that installed insulation containing asbestos.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commercial Union's policies for Porter Hayden only provided \"premises-operations\" coverage, or coverage for bodily injury that occurred during the installation or operations process-not to be confused with \"Products Hazard\" or \"products coverage\"-coverage for injuries resulting from exposure to completed, hazardous products.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    at 687-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting the narrow scope of coverage in its policy, Commercial Union argued that it had no duty to defend Porter Hayden in asbestos litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We disagreed. The complaints and allegations against Porter Hayden showed that some plaintiffs alleged they had been exposed to asbestos during installation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    at 691-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that, \"it is evident that Porter Hayden could be held liable for the manner in which it conducted\n   <em>\n    its operations in installing\n   </em>\n   the asbestos-containing products. In that light, it is not solely covered by the 'Products Hazard' insurance it declined to purchase.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The \"Products Hazard\" insurance is concerned with injury occurring after possession of the goods or the product has been relinquished or the operation has been completed or abandoned. The nature of some of the allegations in the Master Complaint, however, concern exposure and injury occurring during the operation, such as the emission of asbestos dust during the installation process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   We affirm the ruling ... that, as a matter of law, there is a potentiality that the asbestos-related claims are covered and that there is, therefore, a duty on Commercial Union to defend and, depending on the ultimate findings on the merits, potentially to indemnify.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    at 692-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"294761\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/116/605/\">\n    698 A.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ramifications of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   were immense to asbestos litigants, and appellants took notice.

One of the representations made by MCIC, Inc. and its insurers was that there was a limited amount of insurance available to pay to victims of asbestos-related disease. In fact, each of the insurers signed affidavits set [ting] forth the limited amount of money available to MCIC, Inc. for asbestos-related claims. This representation was the major reason we entered into this agreement and recommended to our clients settlements for such small amounts. Also, this was the primary reason we stopped naming MCIC as a defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   It has recently come to my attention\n   <em>\n    that information provided by the insurers may be inaccurate\n   </em>\n   , and additional insurance funds may be available under the terms of the policies.

His notes indicated that at the meeting, the LOPA attorneys\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   explained that recent court decisions had interpreted old policies containing provisions for contractors general liability so as not to have any total limit on the policies.

For\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   , LOPA hired Scott D. Gilbert, Esq., an expert in insurance law, to prepare a report (the \"Gilbert Report\") evaluating the application of the insurance policies. LOPA filed the Gilbert Report, dated May 1998,\n   with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to explain its theory of recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the Gilbert Report, Gilbert noted that, \"None of these policies has an aggregate limit for 'nonproducts' claims .... The language of the Travelers Policies follows the standard form language used by the Insurance Services Office (\"ISO\"). Since 1973, ISO has written standard CGL form policies used by insurers throughout the United States.\" After establishing that the policies at issue were standard CGL policies, where \"nonproducts\" claims such as operations claims are not subject to aggregate limits, Gilbert discussed the\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The Maryland courts have adopted the view that asbestos installation claims are nonproducts claims not subject to aggregate limits.

Therefore, based on its expert's report, LOPA knew, no later than May of 1998, that\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   had created a new theory of recovery under standard CGL policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    LOPA Files a Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and Receives the \"Chapper Documents\" in Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On June 11, 2002, LOPA sent a letter to appellees arguing that there was additional insurance coverage beyond what was provided in the 1994 settlement agreement. LOPA cited the section of the settlement agreement which required MCIC to promptly notify appellants of newly discovered coverage and stated: \"We believe that such additional coverage does now, in fact, exist.\" LOPA attached a copy of the order in the\n   <em>\n    Wallace &amp; Gale\n   </em>\n   case, and noted that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   As you will see in that opinion, asbestos contractors, such as Wallace &amp; Gale and MCIC, are afforded much more extensive\n   coverage under standard CGL policies than what you and the other insurance carriers represented in the Settlement Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In light of the Wallace &amp; Gale decision and your familiarity therewith, we assume that you have undertaken a review of your policies and discovered that additional coverage now exists to fully compensate all previous ... and pending claims against your insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Enclosed ... is a copy of the ... cases which, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, should receive additional compensation because additional insurance is now available ....

In the motion, LOPA requested the court to order each insurance company to tender all insurance coverage available, or in the alternative, to pay the LOPA plaintiffs an equitable amount taking the new insurance coverage into account. On October 30, 2002, the LOPA plaintiffs and appellees entered into a Standstill and Tolling Agreement, agreeing to halt litigation while they discussed LOPA plaintiffs' claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   This agreement was amended several times, extending the tolling of limitations for a total of 334 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On April 26, 2004, MCIC responded to a LOPA discovery request and produced over one thousand pages of what appellants have designated as the \"Chapper Documents.\" The Chapper Documents consist of various correspondence, notes,\n   and memoranda generated between MCIC and its insurers from June 1981 through November 1994. According to LOPA, the Chapper Documents demonstrate that MCIC knew as early as 1985 that appellants had claims for operations coverage because many of the plaintiffs were exposed to asbestos during installation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Almost two years after LOPA filed its Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement under seal, the Non-LOPA plaintiffs learned of LOPA's motion.

The court explained its holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Assuming that the development of a new legal theory of coverage amounted to a \"discovery\" of the \"fact\" that additional coverage existed under the settled policies, such discovery by MCIC occurred no later than 1998 when the Angelos plaintiffs' counsel met with counsel for MCIC, explained their legal theory of recovery and opined that the Insurers owed more under the Settlement Agreement than the amounts represented in their affidavits. Upon MCIC's discovery of this additional \"other insurance,\" the Angelos plaintiffs could have brought their Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement. They sat on their claim, however, until October 17, 2002, over a year after the analogous limitations period for contract actions had lapsed. Ultimately, Plaintiffs have \"failed to act with due diligence in the pursuit and enforcement of [their asserted] rights,\" and prejudice is demonstrated by their failure to bring their Motion to Enforce within the length of the analogous limitations period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (Citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Appellants appealed and a panel of this Court affirmed in an unreported opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

When we filed the reported opinion in the\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   case in August of 1997, and that case became part of the public domain, any Maryland attorney whose practice involved asbestos litigation and insurance coverage for such cases was on notice that there might be nonproducts liability, and correspondingly, insurance coverage for such nonproducts liability, that exceeded the liability coverage previously assumed to be applicable. The Gilbert report makes [it] clear that by May of 1998, this development in the asbestos field was widely known, and that the prospect of insurance coverage that was not subject to aggregate limits was not ignored by asbestos plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9442201\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/275/223/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Appeals subsequently denied appellants' petition for writ of certiorari.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The complaint, and its subsequent history, form the basis for this appeal. In the operative complaint, LOPA alleged that MCIC and its insurers had committed: 1) negligent misrepresentation, 2) fraudulent misrepresentation, and 3) fraud by concealment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   By virtue of these misrepresentations and concealments, LOPA argued, the appellees settled with appellants\n   for sums not representative of the full amount of MCIC's available insurance coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In early 2007, the circuit court permitted the non-LOPA plaintiffs to intervene and file complaints of their own.

A\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    r\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749942\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/203/606/#p652\">\n    203 Md.App. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749942\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/203/606/#p652\">\n    40 A.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of fraud, the court explained that, \"being 'on notice' means having knowledge of circumstances which would cause a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiffs to undertake an investigation which, if pursued with reasonable diligence, would have led to knowledge of the alleged fraud.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    O'Hara v.

The court found that although the Nagle Documents consisted of fragmentary policy materials, the Declaration pages and other forms made clear the nature and scope of the policies insuring MCIC. In reviewing three largely complete policies, the trial court found that \"each of those policies\n   contains the exact same language relating to the products hazard, the completed operations hazard, the occurrence definition, and the limits of liability. Each provides for an aggregate limit for claims within the completed operations and products hazards.\" The court explained that, because the form explicitly states the circumstances in which aggregate limits do apply, inferentially, these aggregate limits do not apply to any other form of coverage. After establishing what appellants could and should have understood from the Nagle Documents, the court turned to the issue of when the appellants should have been on notice of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the third time, a Maryland court found that the date we decided\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   put these appellants on notice that they had claims against the appellees. The circuit court found that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Regardless of what they may or may not have known prior to\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   about the legal categorization of asbestos-related injuries for purposes of insurance coverage, all plaintiffs' counsel are charged with knowing that such injuries could be covered under non-products CGL provisions after its publication on August 29, 1997.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The trial court rejected the notion that the appellants had raised a genuine dispute of material fact sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. Instead, it found that possession of the Nagle Documents, coupled with the publishing of\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   , put appellants on notice that the settlement agreement and the incorporated affidavits were wrong. Because appellants filed their claims more than three years after being on inquiry notice of those claims, the trial court granted summary judgment against appellants based on limitations.

In its October 3, 1997 letter, Angelos wrote to MCIC that, \"It has recently come to my attention that the information provided by the insurers may be inaccurate, and additional insurance funds may be available under the terms of the policies.\" By suspecting that the insurers had provided \"inaccurate\" information and that additional funds were possibly available, Angelos's letter establishes that he was aware of the harm to his clients in October 1997-they deserved more money.

The Gilbert Report relied on\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   , and stated that \"Maryland courts have adopted the view that asbestos installation claims are nonproducts claims not subject to aggregate limits.\" By May of 1998, LOPA was arguing for nonaggregated limits from operations coverage in other court cases-but not this case. LOPA recognized that a standard CGL policy provided nonaggregated limits for injuries sustained during installation. The suspicions LOPA raised in its October 3, 1997 letter were now confirmed, proving that LOPA was on inquiry notice that it had been harmed by appellees' misrepresentations. Consequently, limitations began to run for LOPA no later than May 4, 1998 when Gilbert filed his report.\n   <em>\n    Lumsden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"144575\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/358/435/#p442\">\n    358 Md. at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"144575\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/358/435/#p442\">\n    749 A.2d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Despite extensive media coverage of Mandel's possible mail fraud, the Court held that the plaintiffs had no way of recognizing that Mandel had also defrauded them into selling their Marlboro stock at a depressed price. The Court emphasized the fact that inquiry notice needed to relate to the Marlboro stock fraud itself. \"Notice of the fraud alleged here would require,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , awareness of a possibility, to a degree warranting further investigation, that the veto message was designed to cover the real motive for the veto.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 304,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059808\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/280/#p302\">\n    503 A.2d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \"[i]t [was] at least debatable\n   whether reasonable persons by November 21, 1975, should have considered that the message might have been a sham,\" the Court remanded the case for a fact-finder to make that determination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059808\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/280/#p302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Court of Appeals' analysis in\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   focused entirely on what the plaintiffs knew or could have known, and what the plaintiffs did or should have done prior to the issuance of the federal indictments. This makes sense because an inquiry notice analysis hinges upon what the plaintiffs can know and whether their actions are reasonable. In\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   , the Court held that the only way the plaintiffs could have known of their claims against Governor Mandel and the Kovens Group was to know the true motive behind vetoing the racing bill. The sale of stock provided no indication of fraud-but the sale of stock whose value had been artificially depressed by an intentional scheme did provide an indication of fraud. The challenge for the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   was that Governor Mandel's motive, and not the purchase of the stock, gave rise to inquiry notice. The sale of the depressed stock resulting from the conspiracy, and not the sale of the\n   stock in and of itself, created the actionable harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    O'Hara\n   </em>\n   , the appellants here could independently verify two important facts after\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   : 1) whether they should have received additional coverage stemming from the insurance policies; and 2) whether the statements made in the affidavits and settlement agreement, that all applicable insurance coverage had been tendered, were false. The appellants knew they had not received proceeds under operations coverage, but learned that operations coverage was available when we published\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   . Appellants knew or should have known almost immediately that something was amiss. They knew that they had never received any proceeds under non-products (operations) coverage and therefore had not\n   received all available insurance proceeds as appellees had expressly represented. In short, appellants knew or should have known as early as the release of\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   in August of 1997, or at the latest, in May of 1998 when LOPA filed the Gilbert report, that they had tort claims based on misrepresentations. Whereas Governor Mandel's subjective intent could not possibly have been known and therefore alleged until outside sources revealed those facts, here,\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   made clear both the injury and the misrepresentation. After we published\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   , reasonable people in the position of these appellants would have undertaken an investigation to determine whether they had legal recourse. Specifically, appellants were on notice that appellees' misrepresentations were negligent or reckless. Thus, there are no disputed material facts a jury could find that would change that the appellants here were on inquiry notice, at the very latest, in May, 1998.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellants Incorrectly Rely on\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    to Argue that They Could not Have Known About the Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Appellants also argue that the unreported opinion in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   held that there was no evidence of fraud in this case-at least, not until appellants received the Chapper Documents. In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , a panel of this Court stated that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   There was, however, no evidence of knowingly false representations proffered to Judge Kaplan, who rejected the plaintiffs' vague accusations of fraud, noting, \"As of 1994, no Maryland court had determined whether personal injury claims arising from exposure to asbestos ... fell outside of the products/completed operations hazard and were subject only to per occurrence limits.\" Aside from suspicion and speculation, there was nothing presented to Judge Kaplan\n   to support the plaintiffs' bald assertion that the Insurers\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   in 1994 what the courts were going to decide in 1997 regarding asbestos coverage under CGL policies. The only evidence offered by the appellants to support the accusation of fraud is the fact that some or all of\n   the Insurers currently concede that the MCIC policies contained unaggregated operations coverage, as did, apparently, all standard CGL policies of the time. But there was no evidence that any of the Insurers would have made such a concession prior to the\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   decision, let alone any evidence that any of the Insurers (or, for that matter, any persons anywhere) were of that opinion at the time the Insurers executed the affidavits attached to the 1994 settlement agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Slip op. at 24-25. Appellants argue that, if the panel in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   held that there was no evidence of fraud pending the appeal of the Motion to Enforce, they could not have been on inquiry notice prior to receiving the Chapper Documents. As we have explained, appellants did not need to know about the knowing or intentional misrepresentations to be on inquiry notice of their fraud claims-they only needed to know about the harm which resulted from the false statements. Not only do they conflate actual knowledge of fraud with mere inquiry notice, but the holding in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   does not reach that far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In stating that there was \"no evidence of knowingly false representations proffered to Judge Kaplan,\" the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   panel meant just that-the Motion to Enforce and its supporting documents did not contain any evidence of knowingly false representations. The panel simply stated that, at that point, the appellants had not sufficiently alleged fraud. Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   panel did not discuss inquiry notice, reasonable investigations, or rely on any law in the context of recognizing fraud. In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   panel did hold that, \"appellants were on inquiry notice of their potential [contract] claims for additional insurance coverage under the 1994 settlement agreement well over three years before they filed their respective motions to enforce in 2002 (and beyond).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2059808\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/305/280/#p302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 23. The\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   panel held that the publication of\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   placed appellants on inquiry notice of their contract\n   claims. \"Once on notice of one cause of action, a potential plaintiff is charged with responsibility for investigating, within the limitations period, all potential claims and all potential defendants with regard to the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875125\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/114/169/#p188\">\n    114 Md.App. at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875125\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/114/169/#p188\">\n    689 A.2d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A logical extension of the inquiry notice doctrine allows us to conclude that when the plaintiffs were on inquiry notice of their contract claims, they were also on inquiry notice of their misrepresentation tort claims. Indeed, there are substantial policy reasons underlying our conclusion that appellants' contract and tort claims-all arising out of the same facts-should have the same accrual date for limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    Appellants Cannot Rely on CJP \u00a7 5-203 to Further Toll Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Appellants argue that \u00a7 5-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides a basis to toll limitations in this case. Section 5-203 provides, \"If the knowledge of a cause of action is kept from a party by the fraud of an adverse party, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   We have stated that, \"the complaint relying on the fraudulent concealment doctrine must also contain specific allegations of how the fraud kept the plaintiff in ignorance of a cause of action, how the fraud was discovered, and why there was a delay in discovering the fraud, despite the plaintiff's diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875125\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/114/169/#p188\">\n    114 Md.App. at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875125\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/114/169/#p188\">\n    689 A.2d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Even if we assume that the appellees intentionally lied in their affidavits and in the settlement agreement, they could not have hidden from appellants that\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   allowed them to recover under operations\n   coverage, or that\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   revealed actionable negligent or reckless (fraudulent) misrepresentations. In fact, appellees did provide appellants with fragmentary, yet sufficient, documentation to notify them that the policies at issue were standard CGL policies; after\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   , that documentation was sufficient to put them on inquiry notice of their claims. Therefore, appellants cannot rely on\n   \u00a7 5-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article to toll limitations. In our analysis, appellants have no right to claim, under the circumstances in this case, that the appellees fraudulently prevented them from discovering their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   We hold that appellants were on inquiry notice of their negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation claims as early as when we published\n   <em>\n    Porter Hayden\n   </em>\n   , and at the latest, when LOPA filed the Gilbert Report. The trial court correctly concluded that appellants' claims are barred by the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.
