On appeal, the defendant makes a variety of claims challenging the court's rulings on his motion to open the judgment of strict foreclosure and motion to dismiss the underlying strict foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After reviewing and considering the record in this case, the briefs and the arguments of the parties on\n   appeal, we conclude that the court properly denied the defendant's motion to open because once the law day passed the title of the property vested in the plaintiff and not the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489230\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/764/#p652\">\n    170 Conn.App. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489230\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/764/#p652\">\n    155 A.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"[a] critical factor to be recognized in connection with a motion to reopen a judgment of strict foreclosure is that the motion must be heard, and not merely filed, prior to the vesting of title\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). We also conclude that the defendant's challenge to the court's denial of his motion to dismiss based on the plaintiff's standing lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    PNC Bank, National Association, was also named as a defendant but is not involved in this appeal.
