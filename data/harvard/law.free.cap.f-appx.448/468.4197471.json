Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely \u201cnotice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). A document may be construed as a notice of appeal only if it \u201cclearly evinces the party\u2019s intent to appeal.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A pleading that both seeks to appeal and to obtain relief from the district court does not clearly evince an intent to appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-22\">Both of the pleadings Lewis evidently intended to serve as notices of appeal also sought postjudgment relief from the district court. <em>See Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., </em>332 F.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir.2003). Those pleadings therefore did not clearly evince an intent to appeal, and were ineffective to serve as notices of appeal. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. Because there is not effective notice of appeal, we lack jurisdiction over Lewis\u2019s appeal. <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-23\">Lewis moves for leave to supplement his brief and to have his case placed under seal. Because we lack jurisdiction over the appeal, Lewis\u2019s motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED. MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
