On appeal, Avalos asserts for the first time that the government breached its plea agreement with him by not recommending that he receive full credit for acceptance of responsibility and that the breach amounted to plain error. Avalos maintains that the government\u2019s express \u2018 promise in the plea agreement to recommend that he receive such credit included the implicit promise not to seek enhancement for obstruction of justice because such an enhancement generally precludes a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. He contends that, at sentencing, the government adopted the guidelines sentence range calculation set forth in the presentence report (PSR), which did not include a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, by recommending a sentence of 108 months of imprisonment, thereby breaching the provision in the plea agreement requiring it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>recommend that he receive full credit for his acceptance. Avalos asserts that the inclusion of the plea agreement provision in the PSR did not sufficiently fulfill the government\u2019s promise to recommend that he receive full credit because the government urged the opposite at sentencing. He insists that the breach of the plea agreement was clear and obvious error, that the error affected his substantial rights, and that the error seriously affected the fairness of his sentencing. Avalos concludes that he is entitled to specific performance of the plea agreement and that we should vacate his sentence and remand this case for resentencing before a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Avalos\u2019s appeal waiver does not prevent him from raising his claim that the government breached the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Keresztury, </em>293 F.3d 750, 756-57 (5th Cir.2002). As Avalos did not raise this claim in the district court, however, we review it for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428-33, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To establish plain error, Avalos must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 1429. If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error, but we shall do so only if such error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The inclusion in the PSR of the government\u2019s recommendation that Avalos receive full credit for acceptance of responsibility satisfied the government\u2019s promise to make such a recommendation. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). The government had a duty at sentencing \u201cto insure [sic] that the court ha[d] complete and accurate information concerning the defendant, thereby enabling the court to impose an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, the government\u2019s tendering as exhibits the documents obtained by the probation officer was an \u201ceffort to provide relevant factual information\u201d that was not \u201ctantamount to taking a position on the sentence\u201d and did \u201cnot violate the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Even though the government did restate the guidelines sentence range found by the probation officer and, as required by the plea agreement, recommended a sentence at the low end of that range, this occurred after the district court had already overruled Avalos\u2019s objection to the enhancement for obstruction of justice and denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Therefore, the government\u2019s statement cannot be interpreted as an attempt to persuade the district court to apply the enhancement for obstruction of justice and deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. \u201cConsidering the absence of any argument by the government regarding the\u201d application or denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u201cor of any express promise in the plea agreement that the government\u2019s statement plainly violated, the sentence is not plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211-12. Avalos\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>408 F.3d 222 (5th Cir.2005), <em>United States v. Valencia, </em>985 F.2d 758 (5th Cir.1993), and <em>United States v. Villarreal-Rodriguez, </em>356 Fed.Appx. 759 (5th Cir.2009), is misplaced because, in each of those cases, and unlike in the present case, the government breached the plea agreement by affirmatively advocating a position contrary to one it had promised to make in the plea agreement. <em>See Munoz, </em>408 F.3d at 227; <em>Valencia, </em>985 F.2d at 760-61; <em>Villarreal-Rodriguez, </em>356 Fed.Appx. at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
