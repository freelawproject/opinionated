He also raised claims against appointed counsel and the judge who oversaw his criminal proceedings. The district court dismissed Haddix\u2019s suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted after concluding that the issues raised in his original and amended complaints were barred by immunities and <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We conduct a de novo review of a \u00a7 1915(e)(2) dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Hale v. King, </em>642 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.2011). Although the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, he must nonetheless allege sufficient facts to establish a valid claim to meet this standard. <em>City of Clinton, Ark. v. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., </em>632 F.3d 148, 152-53 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In his brief to this court, Haddix insists that his conviction is invalid due to the improper actions of the defendants, but he does not assert that his conviction has been overturned or even dispute the district court\u2019s determination that this conviction was still outstanding. Haddix has shown no error in connection with the district court\u2019s <em>Heck </em>determination. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. He likewise has shown no error in connection with the district court\u2019s determination that certain defendants were entitled to sovereign, prosecutorial, and judicial immunity, nor has he shown that the district court erred by considering the immunity issue. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 423, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). As the district court concluded, Haddix\u2019s claims against his appointed attorneys fail because these individuals were not proper parties to this suit. <em>See Mills v. Criminal Dist. Court No. 3, </em>837 F.2d 677, 679 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b524-40\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
