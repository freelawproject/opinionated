He argues that the district court erred by considering rehabilitation in determining his sentence. He also argues that the district court failed to explain why the sentence chosen was necessary to promote rehabilitation. The Government moves for summary affir-mance, asserting that Garcia\u2019s arguments are foreclosed. In the alternative, the Government seeks an extension of time to file an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Garcia\u2019s first argument, that the district court erred by considering rehabilitation, is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). However, as the Government correctly points out, we have held that the limitations on the consideration of rehabilitation at issue in <em>Tapia </em>do not apply in a revocation proceeding. <em>See United States v. Breland, </em>647 F.3d 284, 287-90 (5th Cir.2011). Therefore, this argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">However, because Garcia\u2019s appellate brief raises a second argument that is not foreclosed, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is denied. As we see no need for further briefing, the Govern- . ment\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file an appellate brief is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Although Garcia generally objected to the reasonableness of the sentence, we conclude that he failed to preserve his specific argument that the district court failed to adequately explain why the sentence imposed would promote rehabilitation. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). Therefore, we review for plain error. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). However, we conclude that any error in failing to adequately explain the reasons for the sentence does not warrant relief under plain error review because Garcia cannot show prejudice. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 261-65 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
