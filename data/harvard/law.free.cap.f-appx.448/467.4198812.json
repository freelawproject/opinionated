The district court imposed a 78-month prison sentence, in the middle of the guidelines range. On appeal, Weldon challenges only the increase to his offense level for obstruction of justice, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support it. The district court determined that the adjustment was warranted based on a finding that Weldon attempted to escape from custody. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; comment, (n. 4(E)). We review for clear error and will not reverse unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros, </em>112 F.3d 1272, 1279 (5th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-22\">While under arrest and in a police car, Weldon unbuckled his seatbelt and that of his codefendant. Weldon asked his code-fendant, among other things, whether the codefendant\u2019s window was down and whether a police officer had refastened the codefendant\u2019s seatbelt. He also explained to the eodefendant that the police officers might \u201cpursu[e] a chase\u201d and predicted that one of the two was \u201cgonna get away.\u201d Although an officer eventually refastened the seatbelts, Weldon\u2019s conduct in unbuckling them together with his statements suggesting that he intended to escape provided sufficient support for the district court\u2019s finding that Weldon attempted to escape and thus obstructed justice. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; comment, (n. 4(E)). The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>trict court committed no clear error; accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
