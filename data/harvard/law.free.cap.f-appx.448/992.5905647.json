Alvarez challenges, for the first time, the validity of his guilty plea and the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">Alvarez is barred from challenging a plea of guilty that he \u201cinvited\u201d the district court repeatedly to accept. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006). Although Alvarez wavered about whether he fled the United States to escape the harms allegedly threatened by his codefendants or to avoid sentencing for his crime of wire fraud, Alvarez never wavered in his decision to plead guilty for failing to appear. Alvarez stated that he wanted to plead guilty five times in response to being told that he had to forfeit his right to trial and his defense of duress; he would be deported; his sentence would run consecutive to the time imposed for his fraud crime; he faced a possible sentence of 10 years of imprisonment; and he was going \u201cto do more [time] for fleeing than if he hadn\u2019t fled.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Alvarez reaffirmed his decision a sixth time after he agreed to .the factual basis proffered by the prosecutor. And Alvarez never moved the district court to permit him to withdraw his plea. Alvarez cannot petition the district court to accept a plea of guilty and then protest its validity on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-21\">Alvarez\u2019s sentence is proeedurally reasonable. Alvarez complains that the district court failed to consider whether he fled the United States under duress, but Alvarez waived that defense by pleading guilty. Moreover, \u201cwe cannot say ... that the [district] court ... erroneously \u2018ignored\u2019 or failed to consider ... [mitigating] evidence ...,\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007), that was not brought to its attention. At sentencing, Alvarez argued only that he \u201cdeserve[d] some credit\u201d for returning to the United States voluntarily, which the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>trict court reasonably rejected because Alvarez eluded federal agents for more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">We AFFIRM Alvarez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
