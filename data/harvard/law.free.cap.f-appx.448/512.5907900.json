(\u201cLighthouse\u201d) and First Premium Insurance Group, Inc. (\u201cFirst Premium\u201d) entered into a marketing services contract. We are asked to decide whether the forum selection clause in their contract, selecting a state court, is enforceable. We find that the clause is enforceable and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lighthouse\u2019s suit against First Premium. In addition, we dismiss Lighthouse\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s decision to remand to state court First Premium\u2019s suit against Lighthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">Resting on diversity jurisdiction, Lighthouse sued First Premium in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, seeking a declaratory judgment under Louisiana law that First Premium had breached and was entitled to no further fees under their contract. First Premium then sued Lighthouse in the 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany, of the State of Louisiana, seeking a declaratory judgment that their contract was enforceable under Louisiana law, that First Premium did not breach, and that Lighthouse was bound to pay First Premium a fee under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">First Premium filed a motion to dismiss the federal complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(3) of the <em>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, </em>seeking to enforce the forum selection clause. The forum selection clause specified that any suits related to the contract were to be brought solely in Louisiana\u2019s 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany. The district court (Africk, J.) granted First Premium\u2019s motion to dismiss the federal complaint and dismissed the case without prejudice to Lighthouse filing its claims in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">Lighthouse then promptly removed the state-filed case to the federal district court. The district court granted First Premium\u2019s motion to remand to state court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), citing its prior decision, for want of jurisdiction with respect to any legal action or proceeding relating to the parties\u2019 contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Lighthouse timely appealed the district court\u2019s orders in both cases, here consolidated for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Turning first to the dismissal of Lighthouse\u2019s suit against First Premium, we review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to enforce a forum selection clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court did not specify whether its dismissal of Lighthouse\u2019s suit was pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(3) of the <em>Federal Rules of Civil </em>Procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Our de novo review under either Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(3) requires us to view all the facts in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Moreover, under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(3), the court is permitted to look at evidence in the record beyond simply those facts alleged in the complaint and its proper attachments.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Federal law determines whether a district court must enforce a forum selection clause.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Forum selection clauses are presumptively enforceable, and \u201cwhere a litigant ... attempts to have a case dismissed based, on a contractual provision requiring suit to be filed in state court, the forum-selection clause should be upheld unless the party opposing its enforcement can show that the clause is unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A forum-selection clause may be deemed unreasonable where the party challenging application of the clause makes a \u201cclear showing\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">(1) the incorporation of the forum selection clause into the agreement was the product of fraud or overreaching; (2) the party seeking to escape enforcement \u201cwill for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court\u2019 because of the grave inconvenience or unfairness of the selected forum; (3) the fundamental unfairness of the chosen law will deprive the plaintiff of a remedy; or (4) enforcement of the forum selection clause would contravene a strong public policy of the forum state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">The forum selection clause here read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">The agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Louisiana without reference to principles of conflicts of law. [Lighthouse] irrevocably and unconditionally submits in any legal action or proceeding related to this agreement or for recognition of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany, State of Louisiana.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>First Premium\u2019s general counsel drafted the marketing services contract that included this forum selection clause. The general counsel was also a shareholder of the company and the brother of First Premium\u2019s President.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Lighthouse argues that the forum selection clause is unreasonable and should not be enforced on the basis that (1) there is a constitutional right to diversity jurisdiction, and trial before a court in the forum and venue designated by the contract will deprive Lighthouse of a court free of \u201cLocal Bias\u201d;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) the incorporation of the forum selection clause in the contract resulted from the drafting attorney\u2019s violation of Louisiana\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct for attorneys and from fraud and overreaching; and (3) enforcement of the clause would contravene a \u201cstrong public policy\u201d of the State of Louisiana set forth in its Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> None of those arguments is availing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">First, Lighthouse\u2019s argument that it has a constitutional right to have disputes related to its contract with First Premium heard in a federal court pursuant to the court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction is not properly before us as it was not raised in the court below.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even if it were properly before this court, Lighthouse\u2019s first argument is without merit. The United States Constitution does not preclude parties to a contract from waiving their rights to have contract-related disputes heard in federal court. In more than one case, this court has reviewed a forum selection clause that purported to give state courts exclusive jurisdiction over actions connected to the contract and held that the forum selection clause was an enforceable waiver of a party\u2019s right to have disputes connected to the contract heard in a federal forum.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">To the extent that Lighthouse is arguing that it did not knowingly and willingly waive its right to be heard in a federal court, it is not supported by the record. Lighthouse contends that its waiver was not knowing and voluntary because First Premium\u2019s general counsel failed to highlight for Lighthouse the forum selection clause and other specific provisions in the parties\u2019 contract. This contention is unavailing. Under Louisiana law: \u201c[a] person who signs a written instrument is presumed to know its contents and cannot avoid its obligations by contending that he did not read it, or that it was not explained or that he did not understand it.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, Lighthouse cannot maintain that it did not knowingly and willingly waive diversity jurisdiction on the basis that First Premium\u2019s general counsel did not discuss the forum selection clause with Lighthouse or warn Lighthouse of the clause\u2019s existence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Second, assuming, without deciding, that a violation of Louisiana\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct for attorneys would provide a basis for this court to deem the forum selection clause in the parties\u2019 contract unreasonable, no evidence in the record supports Lighthouse\u2019s claim that the incorporation of the forum selection clause into the parties\u2019 contract resulted from a violation of Louisiana\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct for attorneys.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The first two Rules of Professional Conduct cited by Lighthouse are Rule 1.7, \u201cConflict of Interest: Current Clients,\u201d and Rule 1.8, \u201cConflict of Interest: Current Clients: Specific Rules.\u201d Rule 1.7 states that \u201ca lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rule 1.8 states that, as a general rule, \u201c[a] lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security, or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Lighthouse argues that First Premium\u2019s general counsel violated those two rules because he \u201cchose to represent both [Lighthouse and First Premium] by drafting a contract for both of them to sign, when he knew he had a ... pecuniary interest [as a shareholder of First Premium] which gave him a clear and present conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, Lighthouse\u2019s Director of Marketing has affirmed that the general counsel was \u201cthe attorney for First Premium,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and there is no evidence in the record that the general counsel ever undertook to give legal advice to Lighthouse or purported to draft the contract on Lighthouse\u2019s behalf. As First Premium notes, even if Lighthouse subjectively believed that First Premium\u2019s general counsel was also Lighthouse\u2019s attorney, such a belief would not be reasonable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The third Rule of Professional Conduct cited by Lighthouse is Rule 4.3. That rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer\u2019s role in a matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding. The lawyer shall not give legal advice to an unrepresented person, other than the advice to secure counsel, if the lawyer knows or reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>should know that the interests of such a person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interests of the client.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In this case, there is no evidence that the general counsel ever stated or implied to Lighthouse that he was disinterested or that he gave any legal advice to Lighthouse. Nor is there any evidence that Lighthouse misunderstood his role as counsel for First Premium, let alone any evidence that he knew or should have known that Lighthouse misunderstood his role.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As First Premium notes, no authority supports Lighthouse\u2019s contention that First Premium\u2019s general counsel provided legal advice to Lighthouse merely by drafting the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The fourth Rule of Professional Conduct cited by Lighthouse is Rule 8.4(c): a lawyer may not \u201c[ejngage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> There is no evidence that the general counsel made any false or misleading statements to Lighthouse. To the extent that Lighthouse\u2019s argument is based on the general counsel\u2019s failure to point out or explain the forum selection clause to Lighthouse, First Premium\u2019s general counsel did not have a fiduciary relationship with Lighthouse that would give rise to a duty to convey that information under Louisiana law.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Lighthouse has not demonstrated that the forum selection clause was incorporated into the parties\u2019 contract due to a violation of Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Because Lighthouse has not demonstrated that enforcement of the forum selection clause in the parties\u2019 marketing services contract would be unreasonable, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lighthouse\u2019s suit against First Premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">We next turn to the district court\u2019s decision granting First Premium\u2019s motion to remand its suit against Lighthouse to Louisiana state court. \u201cCongress has severely circumscribed the power of federal appellate courts to review remand orders.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> According to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), \u201can order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d However, the Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u00a7 1447(d) must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with \u00a7 1447(c), so that only remands based on grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c) are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, as this court has previously explained, we \u201clack[ ] jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447 if the district court based its remand order on either a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a defect in removal procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e will only review remand orders if the district court affirmatively states a non-1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>In this case, the district court stated explicitly that its decision to remand First Premium\u2019s suit was based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, one of the grounds specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The district court did not \u201caffirmatively state[][any] non-1447(c) ground for remand.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order of remand, and Lighthouse\u2019s appeal from that order is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Lighthouse\u2019s suit against First Premium is AFFIRMED, and Lighthouse\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s order remanding to state court First Premium\u2019s suit against Lighthouse is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
