(\u201cBAC\u201d) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-24\">In June 2007, Ausar-El obtained a loan from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (\u201cCountrywide\u201d) to purchase property located in Wetumpka, Alabama. Ausar-El executed a promissory note and mortgage that gave Countrywide the right to foreclose on the property in the event of default. After Countrywide assigned its rights in the promissory note and mortgage to BAC, Ausar-El defaulted and BAC foreclosed on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-25\">Ausar-El filed this action against BAC in July 2010. His complaint alleges that BAC violated the Fair Debt Collection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) and provisions of the Alabama Code by failing to properly verify his debt before foreclosing on the property. The district court dismissed Ausar-El\u2019s complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Ausar-El now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.Sd 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). A <em>pro se </em>complaint is construed more liberally than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers. <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990). However, we may not \u201cserve as de facto counsel for a party, or ... rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The FDCPA was enacted by Congress to \u201celiminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692(e). Ausar-El\u2019s complaint alleges that BAC violated \u00a7 1692g of the FDCPA by providing him with unsworn photocopies of his mortgage, promissory note, and payment history in verification of his debt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court concluded that BAC is not a \u201cdebt collector\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1692g and dismissed Ausar-El\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">A \u201cdebt collector\u201d is a term of art in the FDCPA. It is expressly defined to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Significantly, the statute also provides that \u201c[f]or the purpose of section 1692f(6)\u201d a debt collector \u201calso includes any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alteri-us, </em>\u201cthe expression of one thing implies the exclusion of others.\u201d <em>Alltel Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. City of Macon, </em>345 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, an enforcer of a security interest only qualifies as a \u201cdebt collector\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 1692f(6). <em>See Montgomery v. Huntington Bank, </em>346 F.3d 693, 700 (6th Cir.2003) (explaining that \u201can enforcer of a security interest ... falls outside the ambit of the FDCPA for all purposes, except for the purposes of \u00a7 1692f(6)\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">Ausar-El\u2019s complaint alleges that BAC violated \u00a7 1692g in connection with its enforcement of a security interest it held in his property. For the reasons explained above, BAC was not acting as a \u201cdebt collector\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 1692g. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>not err in dismissing Ausar-El\u2019s FDCPA claim for failure to state claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Ausar-El\u2019s complaint also alleges that BAC violated multiple provisions of the Alabama Code, namely \u00a7\u00a7 6-5-102, 6-5-104, 7-2-302, 7-8-309, and 7-3-501. However, the complaint contains no factual allegations in support of those claims. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Ausar-El\u2019s state law claims. <em>See Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. </em>As<em>traZeneca Pharm., LP, </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\">. Section 1692g(b) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in [\u00a7 1692g(a)] that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed ... the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt ... and <em>a copy of such verification ... is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
