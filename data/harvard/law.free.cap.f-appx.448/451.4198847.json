California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Pruitt has filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Pruitt\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>sessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The record reveals a clerical error in the judgment. The district court orally imposed restitution in the amount of $1,384,015.26. Although this sum is correctly reflected in the monetary penalties section of the written judgment, the judgment\u2019s payment schedule incorrectly lists the restitution amount as $1,384,115.26. This case is therefore REMANDED for the correction of this clerical error. Fed. R.Crim. P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERROR.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
