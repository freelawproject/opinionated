Reversible error has been shown; we affirm Smith\u2019s conviction but vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">While on patrol a little after 1:00 a.m., Officer Aaron Campbell observed Smith\u2019s car twice swerve out of his lane and almost hit the curb and then make a \u201cwide turn\u201d into a lane reserved for oncoming traffic. Suspecting a drunk driver, Officer Campbell initiated a traffic stop and was soon joined by Officer Glenn Thompson and his K-9 \u201cpartner\u201d Dusty. After checking Smith\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration and investigating whether Smith had out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>standing warrants, Officer Campbell wrote Smith citations for failing to maintain a single lane and failing to wear a seatbelt. Officer Campbell then asked Smith and his two passengers to exit the car so Smith could sign the citations and so Dusty could do a free-air sniff of the outside of the car. Smith and his passengers stepped out of the car and \u2014 12 minutes after Smith was stopped and before Smith signed the citations \u2014 Dusty alerted, indicating that he detected the scent of illegal drugs in the car. Officer Thompson searched the car and found crack cocaine and a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">On appeal, Smith challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that (1) Officer Campbell lacked probable cause to stop his car; (2) Officer Campbell unreasonably prolonged the traffic stop when he asked Smith and his passengers to exit the car; and (3) no probable cause existed to search his car because the particular dog used was unreliable. In considering the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Nunez, </em>455 F.3d 1223, 1225 (11th Cir.2006). We also construe the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">A traffic stop constitutes a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1012, 175 L.Ed.2d 620 (2009). It is well-established, however, that a police officer \u201cmay conduct a brief investigative stop of a vehicle ... if the seizure is justified by specific articulable facts sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether reasonable suspicion existed, we look at the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of an objectively reasonable police officer. <em>See Nunez, </em>455 F.3d at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Construing the facts in the light most favorable to the government, Officer Campbell saw Smith swerve out of his lane three times; Campbell suspected that Smith was intoxicated. Because this suspicion was supported by specific articula-ble facts sufficient to cause an objectively reasonable officer to conclude that Smith was driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, Officer Campbell was justified in making the initial traffic stop. See <em>Lopez-Garcia, </em>565 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Once a legitimate traffic stop is made, an officer \u201cmay request a driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, run a computer check, and issue a citation\u201d so long as the detention \u201clast[s] no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Pruitt, </em>174 F.3d 1215, 1219-20 (11th Cir.1999). When the duration of a traffic stop is \u201centirely justified by the traffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such a stop,\u201d a simultaneous dog sniff of the car does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 125 S.Ct. 834, 837, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005) (explaining that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred when, during a 10-minute traffic stop, an officer walked a drug-sniffing dog around the outside of the car while another officer wrote a citation).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Although Smith contends that Officer Campbell asked him to exit the car solely to conduct the dog sniff, the district court found that Officer Campbell routinely asks drivers to exit their cars to sign citations, particularly if he suspects \u2014 as he did in this ease \u2014 that the driver had been drinking. Nothing evidences that this factual finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See Nunez, </em>455 F.3d at 1225. Thus, because the stop\u2019s 12-minute duration was justified by the \u201cordinary inquiries incident to such a stop,\u201d and Smith had not yet signed the citations when Dusty alerted on the car, the dog sniff did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Caballes, </em>125 S.Ct. at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">We also reject Smith\u2019s argument that the officers lacked probable cause to search his car. Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer may search an operational car without a warrant if he has probable cause to believe that the car contains contraband. <em>United States v. Tamari, </em>454 F.3d 1259, 1264 (11th Cir.2006). Probable cause \u201cexists when under the totality of the circumstances, \u2018there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found\u2019 in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And \u201c[w]e have long recognized that \u2018probable cause arises when a drug-trained canine alerts to drugs\u2019\u201d even in the absence of other evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">That the dog alerted to the presence of drugs in Smith\u2019s car is undisputed. Smith contends that, because Dusty had a \u201cfalse alert\u201d rate of nearly 30% in the field, this dog was not sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to search the car. While a dog sniff must be sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause, we have said \u201cthat training of a dog alone is sufficient proof of reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d 834, 838 n. 8 (11th Cir.1982) (endorsing the view of the First and Tenth Circuits); <em>see also United States v. $242,484.00, </em>389 F.3d 1149, 1159, 1165 (11th Cir.2004) (describing a police dog as \u201ca highly trained and credentialed professional whose integrity and objectivity [were] beyond reproach\u201d when the dog had graduated from the United States Canine Academy and Police Dog Training Center and had been certified by the National Narcotics Detector Dog Association). Here, the government presented evidence that Dusty had completed a 450-hour patrol course and a 200-hour narcotics detection course, was certified by the National Police Canine Association in both areas, and received an additional 6 to 10 hours of training each week. Moreover, even considering Dusty\u2019s alleged 70% accuracy rate in the field, a positive alert would be sufficient to establish a \u201cfair probability\u201d that drugs would be found in the car. <em>See Taman, </em>454 F.3d at 1265. Based on this record, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that this dog was sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to search Smith\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">In its cross-appeal, the government argues that the district court erred in concluding that Smith\u2019s Florida conviction for felony battery, for which he received a 60-month sentence, was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of whether a conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1254 (11th Cir.2009). The ACCA requires a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence for a person convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) who has 3 prior federal or state convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-9\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another!;.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Smith concedes that he has two prior felonies that qualify as predicate offenses under the ACCA. But he argues that his conviction for felony battery, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041(1), was not a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining whether Smith\u2019s prior conviction constitutes a violent felony, we apply a \u201ccategorical approach,\u201d looking \u201conly to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense\u201d and not to \u201cthe particularized facts disclosed by the record of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1258-54 (2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. 1783, 179 L.Ed.2d 656 (2011). In doing so, we also \u201clook to the way the crime is committed in the \u2018ordinary case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254. Under Florida law, a person commits felony battery if he \u201c(a) [actually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; and (b) [clauses great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">To qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d the predicate crime must involve conduct that \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.' \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The crime must also be \u201csimilar in degree and kind to the offenses enumerated in the residual clause insofar as it involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Lockley, </em>632 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir.2011). Because Florida\u2019s felony battery statute requires that a defendant\u2019s conduct actually cause \u201cgreat bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement,\u201d it follows that the underlying conduct must \u201cpresent[ 1 a serious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.041(1). Moreover, because the statute requires that the defendant intentionally touch or strike the victim with sufficient force to cause the requisite level of harm, felony battery \u2014 as ordinarily committed \u2014 involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct similar to burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. <em>See Lockley, </em>632 F.3d at 1246.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We vacate and remand for resentencing under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">. Smith also argues that the felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), is unconstitutional because Congress failed to define \"commerce\" as interstate or foreign commerce and because the statute exceeds Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. But, Smith concedes \u2014 and we agree \u2014 that these arguments are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>124 F.3d 1265 (11th Cir.1997), and <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b966-10\">. We also reject Smith\u2019s argument that an ACCA sentence would violate the Sixth Amendment and the principles announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000): an argument foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In addition, because both statutes at issue in this case are unambiguous, the rule of lenity is inapplicable. See <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b966-17\">. Because we conclude that Smith's felony battery conviction qualifies as a \"violent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, we need not address whether it also qualifies under the elements clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
