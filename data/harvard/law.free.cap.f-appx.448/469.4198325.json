His 24-month sentence was the statutory maximum sentence which was below the recommended guidelines range of 33-41 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">Hayes contends that the sentence was unreasonable because the court did not select a sentence that properly balanced the objectives of punishment and rehabilitation. He argues that imposition of the statutory maximum sentence did not serve the purpose of rehabilitation and shows that the court did not adequately consider mitigating factors (e.g., his health problems or his success in completing rehabilitative programs). Hayes further asserts that the district court wrongly based the sentence on \u201cpunishment,\u201d a factor that is listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), and barred from consideration by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) under <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345, 2011 WL 2148772 (2011). Because Hayes only offered a general objection in the district court to the reasonableness of his sentence and did not object on the specific grounds he raises on appeal, we review his arguments for plain error. <em>United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. LeBoeuf, </em>10-10849, 435 Fed.Appx. 359, 361-62 2011 WL 3279203, at * 2 (5th Cir. Aug.l, 2011)(un-published)(noting that a general objection to the reasonableness of a revocation sentence does not preserve the argument that the district court considered an improper sentencing factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-25\">Hayes\u2019s contention that the district court improperly based his sentence on \u201cpunishment\u201d is unavailing. The record supports that revocation of Hayes\u2019s supervised release was mandated by \u00a7 3583(g) because he violated an express condition of supervised release by being convicted in Louisiana state court of possession of heroin with intent to distribute, i.e., a drug possession crime punishable by more than one year. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(g). Section 3583(g) does not expressly invoke the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a), or the limits imposed by the first clause of \u00a7 3583(e). <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(g); <em>United States v. Giddings, </em>37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>F.3d 1091, 1095 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that a court need not consider \u00a7 3553(a) when revocation is mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)). Thus, Hayes fails to show that it is \u201cclear or obvious\u201d or \u201cobvious under existing law\u201d that a sentence imposed when revocation is mandatory must be limited by \u00a7 3583(e). <em>Cf. United States v. Larison, </em>432 F.3d 921, 923 (8th Cir.2006) (holding that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was not constrained by the factors specifically enunciated in \u00a7 3583(e) where revocation was mandated by \u00a7 3583(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Hayes\u2019s assertion that his sentence did not represent a proper evaluation of various competing interests and did not properly account for mitigating factors is without merit. The record reflects that the court considered the competing sentencing objectives and concluded that a 24-month sentence appropriately balanced those factors. The court acknowledged Hayes\u2019s serious health problems and specifically considered whether Hayes\u2019s previous efforts at rehabilitation warranted a lesser sentence. However, the court concluded that Hayes\u2019s history and characteristics outweighed his rehabilitative efforts and justified the sentence imposed. To the extent that Hayes disagrees with the weight that the court gave to the factors argued, his claim is unavailing; the district court was permitted to use its judgment to weigh the relative importance of each factor, and we may not reweigh those factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b495-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
