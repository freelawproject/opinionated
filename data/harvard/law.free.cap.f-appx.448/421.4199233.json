(collectively \u201cPPG\u201d) for the death of Dorsey McCann, which the McCanns allege resulted from his workplace exposure to PPG\u2019s paint products. The case was initially brought in the 28th District Court for the Parish of LaSalle, Louisiana, on March 11, 2004. After over six years of litigation, the state court set a trial date of May 10, 2010. The trial did not occur, however, because on that day PPG removed the case to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">The federal district court found that removal was improper and remanded the case on September 9, 2010. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>court awarded the McCanns $8,925.00 in attorney fees resulting from the improper removal, as well as $16,317.68 in costs and other expenses. The McCanns paid their five experts $17,361.00 in fees for the experts\u2019 preparation during the week preceding the May 10, 2010 trial date. The district court found that $15,561.00 worth of the experts\u2019 work \u201cwas wasted due to the defendants\u2019 improvident removal.\u201d The district court also found that the removal deprived the McCanns of the benefit of $756.68 in other costs they incurred in anticipation of the May 10, 2010 trial date. PPG appeals the $16,317.68 award for expenses. We REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Title 28, U.S.C., Section 1447(c) provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\u201d We apply an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a district court\u2019s award of fees and costs under \u00a7 1447(c). <em>Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>385 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Esmark Apparel, Inc. v. James, </em>10 F.3d 1156, 1163 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The expenses awarded in this case were incurred before the McCanns were even aware that PPG intended to remove. Although the removal deprived the McCanns of the benefit of the pre-removal trial preparation, it is impossible that the expense of that preparation was <em>incurred </em>as a result of the removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The district court\u2019s judgment of April 5, 2011, is VACATED; the case is REMANDED for reassessment of the expense award under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
