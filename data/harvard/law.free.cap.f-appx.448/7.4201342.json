(collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 action for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Plaintiffs also appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to allow them to amend their complaint a second time. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Plaintiffs argued that their constitutional right to be free from harm was violated by Renee Waters, Lajosha Haynes, Lisa Blackford, and Curtis Bennett (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d), all of whom are employees of Family Integrity Program (\u201cFIP\u201d), a subcontractor for the Department of Children and Families of St. Johns County, Florida. Plaintiffs had been taken into foster care by FIP in 2006 but were reunited with their mother and her boyfriend in late November 2007. Plaintiffs were almost immediately subjected to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of the boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that Defendants had failed to protect Plaintiffs by returning them to their mother and her boyfriend, who lived without electricity or water in a trailer allegedly infested with maggots and dead animals. Defendants had not conducted a \u201chome study\u201d to determine whether the house, mother, or boyfriend were suitable for Plaintiffs\u2019 return.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The district court determined that Plaintiffs had failed to make out a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 because Plaintiffs\u2019 facts showed that they had been injured while in the custody of their own mother and her boyfriend, rather than while in the custody of the state or its agencies. Thus, Plaintiffs could not make a showing that Defendants had violated a constitutional right. The district court also determined that Defendants would be immune from suit anyway because their actions did not violate a clearly established constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Harris v. Ivax Corp., </em>182 F.3d 799, 802 (11th Cir.1999). Defendants\u2019 claim of qualified immunity means that we need only to decide whether Defendants violated any <em>\u201cclearly established </em>constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Powell v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Human Resources, </em>114 F.3d 1074, 1080 (11th Cir.1997) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Despite Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments to the contrary, them case is not distinguishable from <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, </em>489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). <em>DeShaney </em>held that there could not be a \u00a7 1983 action where a child was severely injured while in the custody of his natural father, even though the state had previously taken custody of the child and had strong reason to believe that the father was continuing to abuse the child. <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 192-93, 200-03, 109 S.Ct. at 1001-02, 1005-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">Plaintiffs contend that <em>DeShaney </em>does not apply here because the government in <em>DeShaney </em>\u201cnever had custody of the child,\u201d whereas Defendants here had legal and physical custody over Plaintiffs for almost two years before returning them to their mother. However, in <em>DeShaney, </em>the government did previously have custody over the child. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006. And even if that were not the case, the extent of the government\u2019s <em>past </em>custody is not a meaningful factor. The \u201caffirmative duty to protect arises not from the State\u2019s knowledge of the individual\u2019s predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 109 S.Ct. at 1005-06. Accordingly, the government may have a duty to protect when it \u201ctakes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199-200, 109 S.Ct. at 1005. Typical cases are where the person is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 109 S.Ct. at 1006. The government owes these people a duty because the government has taken away their \u201cfreedom to act on [their] own behalf,\u201d which is the \u201c \u2018deprivation of liberty\u2019 triggering the protections of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">But where the government merely returns a child to his home \u2014 placing \u201chim in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all\u201d\u2014 there is no duty for the government to protect the child and thus there can be no constitutional violation if the child is injured. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006; <em>see also Camp v. Gregory, </em>67 F.3d 1286, 1293 (7th Cir.1995) (holding that the government may face liability under \u00a7 1983 when a child is taken from his home and placed in a state-chosen foster home, where he is subsequently injured).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">In the current case, Plaintiffs were injured by their mother\u2019s boyfriend at their own house. The boyfriend \u201cwas in no sense a state actor,\u201d <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006, nor were Plaintiffs \u201ctotally dependent upon the state,\u201d <em>Wooten v. Campbell, </em>49 F.3d 696, 701 (11th Cir.1995). They had been placed with their natural mother and were no longer in the custody of the government or its agents. The government\u2019s \u201cfailure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 197, 109 S.Ct. at 1004. Accordingly, Defendants had no duty to protect Plaintiffs from the boyfriend\u2019s actions, and a violation of \u00a7 1983 cannot be made out under these facts. <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 201-02, 109 S.Ct. at 1006-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">As <em>DeShaney </em>noted, \u201cthe State does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual\u2019s safety by having once offered him shelter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 109 S.Ct. at 1006. The district court was proper in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Id. </em>at 202-03, 109 S.Ct. at 1006-07; <em>Wooten, </em>49 F.3d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">Plaintiffs also appeal the district court\u2019s refusal to let them amend their complaint a second time. This normally is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but where the district court denied a plaintiff leave to amend on account of futility, we review the denial <em>de novo </em>because the district court concluded as a matter of law that \u201can amended complaint \u201cwould necessarily fail.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freeman v. First Union Nat\u2019l, </em>329 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>St. Charles Foods, Inc. v. America\u2019s Favorite Chicken Co., </em>198 F.3d 815, 822 (11th Cir.1999)). Since we agree with the district court that Plaintiffs could not make out a valid \u00a7 1983 claim under their own version of the facts, as discussed above, it would have been futile to allow further amendments on the subject. It was not error for the district court to refuse Plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent amendments. <em>Freeman, </em>329 F.3d at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">We are sympathetic to Plaintiffs\u2019 plight. They were subjected to unlivable conditions and abuse, perhaps as the result of Defendants\u2019 failure to conduct an evaluation of the suitability of Plaintiffs\u2019 mother, boyfriend, and home. But the Due Process Clause \u201cdoes not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 202, 109 S.Ct. at 1006. In a case like this, the court\u2019s initial focus is not on whether Defendants were derelict or negligent, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>on whether Defendants owed Plaintiffs a constitutional duty at all. The answer under <em>DeShaney </em>and <em>Wooten </em>is that Defendants did not, and this necessarily means that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail under \u00a7 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 109 S.Ct. at 1006-07; <em>Wooten, </em>49 F.3d at 701. Plaintiffs may be able to seek damages against Defendants under state tort law, <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 201-02, 109 S.Ct. at 1006, but the district court here properly dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which a federal court could grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ar\">.
