Spano was suspended and ultimately disbarred from the practice of law in Florida. She brought a suit in federal court alleging, among other things, that the procedures resulting in her suspension and disbarment, and the rules that governed those procedures, deprived her of due process and equal protection. Among those she sued were the Justices of the Florida Supreme Court. The district court granted the Justices\u2019s motion to dismiss Spano\u2019s claims against them for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Spano appeals that order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s resolution of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Community State Bank v. Strong, </em>651 F.3d 1241, 1251 (11th Cir.2011). But we will not address arguments not made in an appellant\u2019s initial brief. <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004). Nor will we develop on our own issues that a party mentions only in passing. <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1145 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), (9).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">The district court determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Spano\u2019s claims against the Justices because they were not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Yet Spa-no\u2019s argument in her initial brief consists entirely of direct challenges to the underlying state disciplinary proceedings. Beyond a cursory reference in the first sentence of her brief setting forth the procedural history, Spano nowhere else mentions the district court\u2019s judgment. And she devotes no attention whatsoever to the substance of the district court\u2019s determination that the Justices were not amendable to suit in their official capacities under \u00a7 1983. None of the cases Spano cites in her initial brief were brought under \u00a7 1983, so they provide no authority for determining whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the language of that statute to require dismissal of her claims was in error. Instead, Spano frames the issue on appeal as whether \u201cthe Florida Supreme Court reversibly erred\u201d in suspending and ultimately disbarring her. That issue is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>properly before us and therefore is not a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Because we conclude that Spano has waived any argument that the district court erred in dismissing her claims against the Justices for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we affirm the judgment of the district court. <em>Curtis, </em>380 F.3d at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-11\">. Although it is unclear from her notice of appeal, Spano\u2019s briefs make plain that she challenges only the dismissal of the Justices. Accordingly, she has abandoned all claims on appeal against David Schulson, Angelo Pa-zienza, the Department of Corrections, and Douglas Swerdowski. <em>Harris v. United Auto. Ins. Group, </em>579 F.3d 1227, 1231 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009) (claims not raised on appeal are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
