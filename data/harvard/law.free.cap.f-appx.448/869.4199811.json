After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">In his <em>pro se </em>amended complaint, Christ-man alleged that: (1) pursuant to a contract with Defendants Alfonso Johnson and Harry Buckley, a franchisee and the President of Jackson Hewitt, Inc., respectively, Christman managed a Jackson Hewitt seasonal tax location in a Walmart and prepared tax returns; (2) because the Walmart kiosk had limited space, Christ-man stored tax records at his home; (3) on February 4, 2009, Christman\u2019s contract was mutually terminated with the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>standing that the tax files would be picked up from his residence on February 8, 2009; and (4) Defendants Johnson and Buckley had a Jackson Hewitt office manager file a false police report accusing Christman of theft of trade secrets and burglary of a structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Christman\u2019s complaint further alleged that: (1) on February 8, 2009, Defendant Ralph Holmes, an officer with the Fort Pierce Police Department, arrested Christ-man at his residence, took the tax files without a search warrant, filed a fraudulent arrest affidavit and charged Christ-man with theft of trade secrets, burglary of a structure, and resisting an officer; (2) Officer Holmes did not investigate Johnson\u2019s and Buckley\u2019s charges with Walmart security before arresting Christman; and (3) the state prosecutor thereafter filed a No Information, dropping all charges without a hearing or arraignment because \u201cnone of the allegations given to the police by Jackson Hewitt can be substantiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Christman\u2019s complaint asserted claims of false arrest, malicious prosecution and conspiracy to deprive him of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Under Rule 12(b)(6), a district court may dismiss a complaint that fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \u201cIn assessing the sufficiency of the complaint\u2019s allegations, we are bound to apply the pleading standard articulated in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) and <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).\u201d <em>Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharm., LP, </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1359 (11th Cir.2011). Under this standard, the plaintiffs complaint \u201cmust ... contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting Bell <em>Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). This standard \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions, [or] a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\u201d to constitute a short and plain statement of the claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65. \u201c[T]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Christman\u2019s complaint alleged two arrest-related claims against Defendant Officer Holmes, namely that Officer Holmes: (1) made false statements in an arrest affidavit, and (2) arrested Christman without a warrant or probable cause. As a state actor, Officer Holmes is entitled to qualified immunity if he was performing a discretionary function and the alleged conduct did not violate a clearly established statutory or constitutional right. <em>See Andujar v. Rodriguez, </em>486 F.3d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir.2007). The parties do not dispute that Officer Holmes was performing a discretionary function. Thus, to defeat qualified immunity, (1) Christman\u2019s complaint needed to allege facts that, when viewed in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>Christman, established a constitutional violation, and (2) the constitutional right needed to be clearly established on the date of the alleged violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1202-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Christman\u2019s complaint alleged that Officer Holmes either knowingly or recklessly made false statements in an arrest affidavit. <em>See Kelly v. Curtis, </em>21 F.3d 1544, 1554 (11th Cir.1994) (stating that the Constitution prohibits a police officer from making knowingly or recklessly false statements in support of warrants). However, Christman did not allege any facts\u2014such as what false statements Officer Holmes made, how they were material to probable cause or how Officer Holmes knew or should have known they were false\u2014to support what amounted to a \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements.\u201d <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. Thus, Christman\u2019s allegation about the arrest affidavit is not enough to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Christman\u2019s complaint also alleged that Officer Holmes arrested him based on a criminal complaint filed by Jackson Hewitt\u2019s office manager that falsely accused Christman of burglary of a structure (presumably the kiosk at Walmart) and theft of trade secrets (presumably material in the tax files at Christman\u2019s residence). A warrantless arrest violates the Fourth Amendment when there is no probable cause, <em>Wood v. Kesler, </em>323 F.3d 872, 878 (11th Cir.2003), but an officer may rely on a victim\u2019s criminal complaint to support probable cause. <em>Rankin v. Evans, </em>133 F.3d 1425, 1441 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also Singer v. Fulton Cnty. Sheriff, </em>63 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir.1995) (\u201cAn arresting officer advised of a crime by a person who claims to be the victim, and who has signed a complaint or information charging someone with a crime, has probable cause to effect an arrest absent circumstances that raise doubts as to the victim\u2019s veracity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Moreover, an officer needs only arguable probable cause to be entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1137 (11th Cir.2007). Arguable probable cause exists when a reasonable officer in the same circumstances and with the same knowledge as the defendant could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Here, Christman\u2019s complaint alleged that Officer Holmes relied on a criminal complaint to support probable cause to arrest Christman. The complaint did not allege any facts suggesting that Officer Holmes\u2019s reliance on the criminal complaint was unreasonable. Absent such allegations, Christman\u2019s false arrest claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">As for the malicious prosecution claim against all three Defendants, Christ-man\u2019s complaint alleges that the state prosecutor filed a No Information before any hearing or arraignment. To state a federal claim of malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must allege, <em>inter alia, </em>the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, one of which is the commencement of an original judicial proceeding against the plaintiff. <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). However, in the case of warrant-less arrest, the judicial proceeding does not commence until arraignment or indictment, and a plaintiff cannot make out a malicious prosecution claim merely for his arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 1235. Because the allegations in Christman\u2019s complaint establish that Christman was arrested but not arraigned, he did not state a federal (or state) malicious prosecution claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Finally, given that Christman\u2019s complaint did not allege an underlying constitutional violation, it necessarily failed to allege a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy. <em>See NAACP v. Hunt, </em>891 F.2d 1555, 1568 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that a plaintiff alleging a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy must show an \u201cactionable wrong,\u201d and concluding that, because the plaintiffs underlying malicious prosecution claim failed, its conspiracy claim also failed). Moreover, Christman\u2019s complaint did not allege that Officer Holmes reached an understanding with Johnson and Buckley to violate Christman\u2019s rights. Instead, the complaint alleged only that Johnson and Buckley filed a false criminal complaint and used the Fort Pierce Police Department to have Christman arrested. See <em>Bailey v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Alachua Cnty., </em>956 F.2d 1112, 1122 (11th Cir.1992) (stating that to establish a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim between state and private actors, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants \u201creached an understanding\u201d to deprive the plaintiff of his rights (quotation marks omitted)). Because Christman\u2019s conspiracy claim was not supported by any facts in the complaint, the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">For all of these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Christman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1056-57 (11th Cir.2007). In doing so, we view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and accept as true all of the plaintiff's well-pleaded facts. <em>Id. </em>at 1057.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. In dismissing Christman\u2019s complaint, the district court relied upon the \"no set of facts\u201d standard of <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). That standard was \"retired\u201d by the Supreme Court in <em>Twombly. See Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>605 F.3d at 1288 (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 563, 127 S.Ct. at 1969). We nonetheless affirm because even under the <em>Twombly/Iqbal </em>standard, Christman\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed. <em>See Powers v. United States, </em>996 F.2d 1121, 1123-24 (11th Cir.1993) (explaining that this Court may affirm on any ground supported by the record even if it was not relied upon by the district court).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\">. Although Christman's complaint alleged that Defendant Officer Holmes conducted a warrantless search of his home and seized tax files, Christman's appellate brief did not offer any legal argument on this issue. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Christman abandoned this claim. See <em>Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (stating that issues merely identified but not argued on the merits are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\">. We reject the Defendants' argument that Christman's notice of appeal was untimely. Christman's timely filed motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 tolled the time for filing his notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi). The district court denied the Rule 60 motion on January 21, 2011. Because thirty days thereafter was a Sunday and the following day was Washington's Birthday, Christman's notice of appeal was not due until February 22, 2011, the day he filed it. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), (a)(6)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
