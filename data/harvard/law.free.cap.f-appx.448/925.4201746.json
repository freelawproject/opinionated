Nelson was driving French\u2019s car when it was involved in a crash. The Wards were also occupants in the car, and Tim Ward suffered serious injuries. Tim Ward sued Nelson, who was insured by Geico. Geico then filed this case, seeking a declaratory judgment that Nelson\u2019s insurance policy with Geico did not cover French\u2019s vehicle or injuries to Tim Ward. The only issues in the case are two legal questions: (1) whether French\u2019s vehicle was provided for Nelson\u2019s regular use and thereby excluded from Nelson\u2019s policy; and (2) whether Nelson resided in the same household as Tim Ward, thereby excluding him from recovering under Nelson\u2019s policy. We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Clemons v. Dougherty Cnty., </em>684 F.2d 1365, 1368 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Neither party disputes that the insurance contract is governed by Florida law. In Florida, terms in insurance policies that tend to limit or avoid liability are \u201cto be construed most liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.\u201d <em>U.S. Sugar Corp. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>475 So.2d 1350, 1352 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">I. <em>\u201cNon-owned auto\u201d Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">Nelson\u2019s Geico policy states that it will cover injuries \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the owned auto or a non-owned auto.\u201d The policy defines \u201cnon-owned auto\u201d in relevant part as a \u201cprivate passenger, farm or utility auto or trailer not owned by, or furnished for the regular use of either you or a relative, other than a temporary substitute auto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">Neither party contends that Nelson owned French\u2019s car. The question is whether French \u201cfurnished [her car] for the regular use\u201d of Nelson. If so, injuries arising from Nelson\u2019s use of the car will not be covered by Geico\u2019s policy. In Florida, when used in an automobile insurance policy, the phrase \u201cfurnished for regular use\u201d reasonably suggests \u201cprincipal use.\u201d <em>U.S. Sugar, </em>475 So.2d at 1352. That is, the Geico policy will provide coverage if Nelson was \u201cengaged in infrequent or casual use\u201d of French\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">There is substantial evidence that Nelson\u2019s use of French\u2019s car was infrequent or casual. French testified that she was \u201cvery touchy\u201d about other people using her car because it had been completely paid for, and she also said that Nelson never drove the vehicle to work, never drove it to visit his parents, and never drove it on his frequent hunting trips. Nelson testified that he did not possess a key to French\u2019s car and that he had to seek her permission to drive it, with such permission sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>being withheld. He drove it up to eight times a month -with her in the car when they would go out to dinner. The only times he drove it without her being in the vehicle were the two or three short trips a month to the store when his own vehicle was blocked in the driveway. Nelson did not use French\u2019s vehicle in any regular or continual way, nor did he treat the car as one he could use whenever he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">With the holding of <em>United States Sugar </em>on point, we need not accept Geico\u2019s invitation to interpret Nelson\u2019s insurance policy by analogizing it to cases dealing with policies that use broader language when defining a \u201cnon-owned auto.\u201d <em>See Allstate Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Weny, </em>No. 8:07-cv-1185-J16-HTS, 2009 WL 88576, at *3 (M.D.Fla. Jan. 13, 2009) (analyzing a policy defining a non-owned auto as one that is merely made \u201cavailable or furnished for the regular use\u201d of the insured); <em>Valiant Ins. Co. v. Evonosky, </em>864 F.Supp. 1189, 1191 (M.D.Fla.1994) (\u201cavailable for the regular use\u201d); <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Lesley, </em>433 So.2d 1299, 1300 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1983) (\u201cfurnished or available for your regular use\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Geico also argues that Nelson and French were in a \u201ccommitted relationship,\u201d and thus there was an expectation that they could share each other\u2019s property. <em>See Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y. v. Fonseca, </em>358 So.2d 569, 575 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1978) (\u201c[H]usbands and wives who reside in the same household potentially have their spouse\u2019s vehicles available for use on a regular basis.\u201d). However, Nelson and French were not married. And as Geico concedes, the <em>Fonseca </em>court did not even reach the issue of what was necessary to show that a vehicle had been \u201cfurnished for the regular use\u201d of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 574.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also, Nelson\u2019s limited use of French\u2019s car would dispel any assumption that her car was \u201cpotentially ... available for [her boyfriend\u2019s] use on a regular basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">On the undisputed facts, Nelson\u2019s use of French\u2019s car was \u201cinfrequent\u201d or \u201ccasual,\u201d and the district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendants on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">II. <em>\u201cInsured\u2019s family\u201d Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Nelson\u2019s policy also states that it \u25a0will \u201cnot cover any bodily injury to any insured or any member of an insured\u2019s family residing in the insured\u2019s household.\u201d Geico argues that Nelson and Tim Ward are \u201cfamily\u201d and lived in the same \u201chousehold\u201d at the time of the accident, which means the policy would not cover Tim Ward\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">However, as noted by the district court, the flaw in Geico\u2019s argument is as follows. The first question is whether Tim Ward is actually a member of Nelson\u2019s family. The policy does not define \u201cfamily.\u201d Tim Ward is Nelson\u2019s step-father, and they are not related by blood. Florida courts seem to construe family exclusion policies to include all relatives who have \u201cbecome integrated into the insured\u2019s household.\u201d <em>Larsen v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>485 So.2d 458, 459 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1986). Under this definition, Florida courts have found that a \u201cfamily\u201d would include a niece living in the same house as her aunt and uncle, <em>id., </em>and two sisters living with each other in the same house, <em>Reid v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>352 So.2d 1172, 1172-73 (Fla.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Accordingly, Florida courts\u2019 analysis of \u201cfamily\u201d seems to overlap heavily with the analysis they would use to answer our second question: were Nelson and Tim Ward actually in the same \u201chousehold\u201d at the time of the accident? \u201cHousehold\u201d is not defined in the policy. To answer this question, Florida courts look to these factors: \u201c(1) close ties of kinship, (2) fixed dwelling unit, and (3) enjoyment of all the living facilities.\u201d <em>Dwelle v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>839 So.2d 897, 899 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">At the time of the accident, Nelson had not lived at the Wards\u2019 house for at least six months, did not have a key to the house, and his bedroom had been converted into a study. At most, he spent only a few nights at the Wards\u2019 house after he moved in with French. If he arrived when no one was home, he had to wait for Tim or Sarah Ward to arrive and let him in. All of his belongings were at French\u2019s house, except perhaps for some of his hunting gear that remained at the Wards\u2019 house. While he did receive his Geico insurance bill at the Wards\u2019 mailing address, most of his mail was sent to French\u2019s house. Given Nelson\u2019s lack of access to the Wards\u2019 house and its facilities, the district court properly concluded from the undisputed facts that Nelson was not a member of Tim Ward\u2019s \u201chousehold\u201d at the time of the accident. Accordingly, the family exclusion portion of Nelson\u2019s policy does not apply, and the district court properly granted summary judgment to Defendants on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-7\">. In <em>Fonseca, </em>the wife was driving the husband\u2019s car, and the issue was coverage under the wife's policy pursuant to the nonowned car provision. 358 So.2d at 570-71. The court held that the husband\u2019s car was not a non-owned car because that provision was defined to exclude a car owned by the \"named insured,\u201d and the husband was defined in the policy as a named insured. <em>Id. </em>at 574.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\">.
