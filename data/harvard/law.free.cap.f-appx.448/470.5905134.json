On appeal, he challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court failed to conduct an individualized assessment and failed to accord adequate weight to his reasons for returning to the United States. Castro asserts that the threats he received from Mexican drug cartels and the fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>damage to his wife\u2019s United States home provided adequate rationales for that return and warranted a below-guidelines sentence. He also notes that his 51-month sentence greatly exceeded the sentence he received for his previous alien-smuggling conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The Government moves for summary af-firmance, asserting that this court has rejected defendants\u2019 disagreements with the weight given by the district court to the various 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors. In the alternative, the Government seeks an extension of.time to file an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">This court reviews Castro\u2019s challenge to his sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Where, as in this case, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The sentencing transcript reveals that the district court carefully made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court\u2019s conclusion that a within-guidelines sentence is appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that it is reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Newson, </em>515 F.3d at 379. Castro has not shown that the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in its weighing of the various sentencing factors, and he has not established that the district court\u2019s rejection of his arguments failed to account for a significant factor or gave weight to an irrelevant factor. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance or in the alternative for an extension of time to file a brief are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
