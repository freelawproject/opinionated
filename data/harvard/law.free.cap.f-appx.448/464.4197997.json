In his complaint, Wilson claimed there was no probable cause for his purse-snatching arrest (he was subsequently convicted for that offense) because the affidavit supporting the arrest warrant relied on false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-16\">Wilson contends the district court erred by: characterizing his complaint as frivolous; dismissing his complaint with, instead of without, prejudice; and determining his claim was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). A dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-19\">\u201c[T]o recover damages for [an] allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal or otherwise invalidated by official action. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (footnote omitted). Therefore, \u201cthe district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-20\">Although \u201ca claim of unlawful arrest, standing alone, does not <em>necessarily </em>implicate the validity of a criminal prosecution following the arrest\u201d, <em>Mackey v. Dickson, </em>47 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.1995) (emphasis in original), the crux of Wilson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is that testimony rejected by the jury is, in fact, true. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Wilson\u2019s claim is barred by <em>Heck. </em>Wilson has also failed to demonstrate the court erred in dismissing his claim as frivolous. <em>See Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 283-84 (5th Cir.1994) (dismissing claims as frivolous and concluding dismissal with preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>dice of prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was permitted under Heck).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
