Nardone, David Bernal, Eric Holder, Jr., U.S. Attorney General\u2019s Office, Ernesto H.

Petitioners argue the IJ and the BIA erred in denying them cancellation of removal, as they established their eligibility for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">An alien seeking review of a final order of removal must file a petition for review within 30 days of the issuance of the final order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The 30-day deadline is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). The finality of a removal order is not affected by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>Jaggemauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">Here, because the petitioners failed to file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s March 23, 2010, order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, we lack jurisdiction to review that order. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition to the extent that it challenges those decisions. <em>See Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3. Although we retain jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s January 21, 2011, decision denying the petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the petitioners do not offer argument on how the BIA erred in denying that motion. Rather, the petitioners\u2019 arguments are focused on the BIA\u2019s March 23, 2010, decision denying their application for cancellation of removal, and how they believe they established their eligibility for such relief during their proceedings. Because the petitioners have abandoned any arguments they potentially could have raised regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion for reconsideration, we deny the remainder of the petition. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (providing that issues not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned); <em>see also Greenbriar, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number><em>Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (providing that a passing reference to an issue in a brief is insufficient to properly raise that issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
