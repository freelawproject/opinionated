At sentencing, the district court imposed a 60-month sentence, 27 months above Stewart\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 27 to 38 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Stewart argues that this upward variance is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm Stewart\u2019s 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">Then, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cincluding an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cIf the sentence imposed is outside the Guidelines range, [we] must determine that the district court\u2019s consideration of the 3553(a) factors justified the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Jayyousi, </em>657 F.3d 1085, 1116 (11th Cir.2011). The defendant bears the burden to show his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number><em>States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">A. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">The district court found that Stewart: (1) possessed the firearm with an \u201cevil motive\u201d; and (2) committed perjury during his sentencing hearing. Stewart contends these facts are clearly erroneous and argues his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court based its decision to vary upward on these clearly erroneous facts. We find no clear error in either of the district court\u2019s factual findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court credited the testimony of Officer Jerry Boykins over Stewart\u2019s testimony as to the events. According to Officer Boykins, on August 7, 2009, a local prostitute, named Stephanie Jackson, flagged him down while on patrol. Jackson reported that a black male had forced her friend into a truck at gunpoint and driven away. Officer Boykins proceeded in the direction Jackson indicated and spotted a truck matching the description given by Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Officer Boykins initiated a traffic stop and approached the truck once backup arrived. The driver, a black male, was Defendant Stewart. Sitting next to him was a woman, Alice Barlow, who was naked from the waist up. As Officer Boykins approached, Barlow whispered to him, \u201cI need help. I need to get out of here.\u201d Officer Boykins asked Defendant Stewart if there were any weapons in the truck, and Stewart said no. After Stewart complied with the request to exit the truck, Officer Boykins took Barlow to his patrol car. Barlow told Officer Boykins that she wanted to get away from Stewart and that he had a weapon somewhere in the truck. Upon searching the truck, Officer Boykins found a black and silver semiautomatic pistol under the driver\u2019s side seat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Mike Myric, a homicide detective, also testified at Stewart\u2019s sentencing hearing. Detective Myric interviewed Defendant Stewart and Alice Barlow because the firearm found in Stewart\u2019s truck was used eight months earlier in a shooting incident in a hotel room. During this December 2009 shooting incident, a prostitute named Burnette Blue was critically injured and her boyfriend, Shawn Rogers, was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">According to Detective Myric, Alice Barlow told him that she and Stephanie Jackson encountered Defendant Stewart at a truck stop when he offered to help them get marijuana. Stewart drove them to a hotel parking lot, where he pulled a gun from his glove box and said he would shoot them if they did not have sex with him. Defendant Stewart made Jackson lie face down on the ground and ordered Barlow to remove her clothing. Stewart then changed his mind, ordered Barlow back into his truck and drove away with her. Defendant Stewart told Barlow to get dressed. While Barlow was putting on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>clothes, a police officer pulled Defendant Stewart\u2019s truck over.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">During Detective Myrie\u2019s interview, Defendant Stewart admitted that he shot Blue and Rogers in December 2009. Stewart also said that, after he had sex with Blue in the hotel room, Rogers entered with a gun, demanded Stewart\u2019s money and left. Believing he \u201chad been set up,\u201d Defendant Stewart demanded that Blue give him his money back. When Blue resisted, Defendant Stewart retrieved his firearm from his car and went back into the hotel room. Stewart told Detective Myric that \u201cpride made him go back in.\u201d When Blue would not return his money, Defendant Stewart cocked the firearm to scare her, but then \u201crealized he had shot her.\u201d Stewart tried to leave the hotel room and encountered Rogers in the doorway. Believing Rogers had a weapon, Defendant Stewart squatted down and fired at Rogers, shooting him in the throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">The government also submitted a transcript of Defendant Stewart\u2019s statement to Detective Myric. During the interview, Defendant Stewart said that he demanded his money from Blue, but had no intention of shooting anyone. Through a window, Stewart thought he saw Rogers returning and was \u201ctwisting and turning back and forth trying to watch him and watch her.\u201d Defendant Stewart stated, \u201cThe situation pretty much got out of control to the point where I told her, \u2018Give me my money,\u2019 and I pulled the trigger.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">The district court found that Stewart \u201cfailed to show consideration of others, and instead acted with an evil motive.\u201d The district court explained that Defendant Stewart\u2019s own admission that in December 2008 he had shot Blue after demanding that she give him his money showed \u201can evil mind at work.\u201d The district court pointed out that, on August 7, 2009, Defendant Stewart \u201chad the same gun he had when he shot Ms. Blue,\u201d and concluded that Stewart had \u201cwithout question, beyond a reasonable doubt the evil motive as well.\u201d The district court elaborated that Defendant Stewart possessed the firearm in this offense with the specific intent to hurt someone and that, if Stewart had encountered someone who offended him, \u201che would have shot that person.\u201d The district court\u2019s finding that Defendant Stewart possessed the gun with \u201can evil motive,\u201d that is, with the intent to use the gun to harm someone, is supported by the government\u2019s evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">Defendant Stewart emphasizes that the district court found that the government failed to prove he kidnapped Jackson and Barlow. The district court did find that although the government\u2019s hearsay evidence supported the kidnapping scenario, it was not convincing enough to meet the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court pointed out neither Jackson nor Barlow testified at the hearing. Nonetheless, contrary to Stewart\u2019s contention, this kidnapping finding is not inconsistent with the district court\u2019s separate finding that Stewart possessed the firearm with an \u201cevil motive.\u201d The district court credited Officer Boykins\u2019 testimony that when he pulled over Defendant Stewart\u2019s truck, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>found Barlow inside, unclothed from the waist up, and clearly afraid of Stewart, whom she knew had a weapon in his truck. Regardless of how Barlow got into Stewart\u2019s truck, the circumstances in which Officer Boykins found her fearful during the traffic stop, coupled with the fact that Stewart admitted using the same firearm eight months earlier to shoot another woman who had offended his pride, support the court\u2019s finding that Defendant Stewart possessed the firearm with the intent to use it to harm someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">We also find no clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that Defendant Stewart committed perjury during the sentencing hearing. The district court found that Officer Boykins\u2019 testimony was \u201cmore credible,\u201d and that while Officer Boykins told the truth, Defendant Stewart \u201cperjured himself; that is, he intentionally did not tell the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">We give deference to a sentencing court\u2019s credibility findings. <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1259 (11th Cir.1998). Moreover, under this deferential standard, \u201c[wjhere the factfinding resolves a swearing match of witnesses, the resolution will almost never be clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). Here, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s credibility finding, Officer Boykins\u2019 testimony about the events of the traffic stop directly contradicted Defendant\u2019s Stewart\u2019s testimony. Although Stewart tries to minimize the contradiction by characterizing it as minor or immaterial, we disagree. At sentencing, the circumstances in which Stewart was found in possession of the gun are material. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (listing \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d as one of the factors the district court must consider in choosing a sentence). The record supports the district court\u2019s finding of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">B. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Stewart argues the district court\u2019s 27-month upward variance was substantively unreasonable because it was based on an impermissible factor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that a sentence may be substantively unreasonable if, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court based it on an impermissible factor). Stewart contends the district court should not have considered the December 2008 shooting because it was not relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">The problem for Stewart is that the district court was not limited to relevant conduct in considering what sentence to impose. Indeed, \u00a7 3553(a) requires the district court to consider not only the circumstances of the charged offense but also the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d which would include the defendant\u2019s criminal history and propensity for violence, and the need for the sentence to, among other things, protect the public and deter further criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1),(2)(B),(C). The district court identified these factors to be \u201ccritical,\u201d and \u201cof primary importance\u201d in Stewart\u2019s case. The district court\u2019s consideration of Stewart\u2019s December 2008 shooting of Blue and Rogers implicated all of these permissible factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Furthermore, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in imposing the 27-month upward variance. Stewart\u2019s prior felony conviction was for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>arson. According to paragraph 80 of the Presentence Investigation Report (to which Stewart did not object), Stewart started the fire in front of witnesses after arguing with, and beating, a woman. Stewart admitted that his arson resulted in burn injuries to another woman and her two small children who were in the home at the time. Less than three years after Stewart was released from prison, Stewart shot Blue and Rogers after arguing with them. Eight months after that, Stewart still had the firearm when Officer Boykins pulled him over under suspicious circumstances. At that time, the firearm was under Stewart\u2019s seat, and Stewart\u2019s passenger, Barlow, was naked from the waist up and asking Officer Boykins for help. When Barlow was safely out of the truck, she warned Officer Boykins that Stewart had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Given Stewart\u2019s history of violence, the circumstances of Stewart\u2019s possession of the firearm, and the need to protect the public from Stewart and to deter Stewart from committing further crimes, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a 60-month sentence, well-below the ten-year statutory maximum, was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-10\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-9\">. We review a sentencing court\u2019s fact findings for clear error and will reverse only if \"after making all credibility choices in favor of the fact-finder and reviewing the record as a whole, it is clear that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Ladson, </em>643 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 534, - L.Ed.2d -(2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b973-12\">. Stewart\u2019s version of the traffic stop was wholly different. Rather than having Barlow unclothed and afraid in his truck, Stewart testified that he was giving a ride to a male friend and a woman (who was fully dressed) when a police officer, not Officer Boykins, pulled Stewart's truck over. Once the truck stopped, Stewart\u2019s male friend and the woman jumped out of the truck and ran away. Officer Boykins arrived on the scene only after Defendant Stewart had exited his truck and was sitting next to a patrol car. Stewart claimed he saw the woman who had been riding in his truck return to the scene and talk with Officer Boykins.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b974-7\">. At the time of this sentencing, Defendant Stewart faced state charges of capital murder of Rogers and attempted murder of Blue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b974-8\">. Because the district court found that the government had not proved Stewart kidnapped Barlow and Jackson during the offense, the district court declined to calculate Stewart\u2019s offense using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(a), which would have resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 235 to 293 months. Instead, the district court calculated Stewart's offense level using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), which yielded the significantly lower advisory guidelines range of 27 to 33 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\">. Stewart also argues that the upward variance was based on speculation as to Stewart\u2019s evil motive for possessing the firearm. This is merely a reformulation of his argument that the district court clearly erred in finding that Stewart possessed the firearm with the intent to harm someone. For the reasons already stated, the district court's finding was supported by the evidentiary record and was not speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
