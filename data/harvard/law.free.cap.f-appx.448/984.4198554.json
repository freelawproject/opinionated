Searcy was sentenced to a term of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by a 3-year term of supervised release. Searcy subsequently filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court dismissed. Searcy filed a motion for a certificate of appealability, with respect to the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion, which both the district court and this Court denied. Searcy also filed other post-conviction motions, which the district court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">Searcy then filed the instant <em>pro se </em>pleadings, arguing that the district court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction over his conviction and sentence. In particular, Searcy challenged (1) his underlying conviction on the basis that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because he did not physically set foot in the Southern District of Florida during the conduct alleged in the indictment, and (2) his sentence on the basis that the court exceeded its subject matter jurisdiction when it sentenced him to a term of imprisonment in excess of the statutory maximum for his crime of conviction. The district court denied all of Sear-cy\u2019s motions. On appeal, Searcy argues that the district court erred in failing to address the challenges he raised to the court\u2019s subject matter and personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-18\">Our review of questions concerning the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is plenary. <em>United States v. Maduno, </em>40 F.3d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.1994). We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may challenge his conviction and sentence by filing a motion for a writ of <em>audita querela. United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005). We review the denial of a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will be liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Post-conviction relief is available to a federal prisoner under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 where \u201cthe sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or ... the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or ... the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Furthermore, a federal prisoner who wishes to file a second or successive motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence is required to move the court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider such a motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.' \u00a7 2255(h); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Certain common-law writs may be used to \u201cfill the interstices of the federal post-conviction remedial framework.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1175 (quotation omitted). However, a \u201cwrit of <em>audita querela </em>may not be granted when relief is cognizable under \u00a7 2255,\u201d regardless of whether a \u00a7 2255 motion would have succeeded. <em>Id. </em>In addition, a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>is unavailable to federal prisoners. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>181 F.3d 1274, 1274 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cCoram nobis </em>relief is unavailable to a person, such as the appellant, who is still in custody.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">After thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the dismissal of the instant pleadings. Searcy\u2019s jurisdictional challenges to his conviction and sentence are cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). In addition, Searcy has already filed, and had dismissed, a motion to vacate his sentence under \u00a7 2255. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding that Searcy\u2019s use of the writ of <em>audita querela </em>and writ of <em>coram nobis </em>was an attempt to circumvent the requirement in \u00a7 2255(h) that he seek authorization from this Court to file another \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
