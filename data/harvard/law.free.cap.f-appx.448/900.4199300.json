His appeal presents one issue: \u201cWhether the admission in evidence of a 68-page document entitled \u2018The Truth About Frivolous Tax Arguments,\u2019 to refute Beiter\u2019s good faith defense, was reversible error, because there was no evidence that Beiter ever saw or read this document, in whole or in part.\u201d Appellants Br. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Beiter argues that Federal Rule of Evidence 403 precluded the admission of this document into evidence because it lacked any probative value and was grossly prejudicial because it completely eviscerated his good-faith-belief defense that the payment of taxes was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">We generally review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Tinoco, </em>304 F.3d 1088, 1119 (11th Cir.2002). Even where the district court has abused its discretion, evidentiary and other non-constitutional errors are not grounds for reversal absent a \u201creasonable likelihood that they affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>117 F.3d 480, 486 (11th Cir.1997). The Government bears the burden of establishing that an error is harmless. <em>United States v. Sweat, </em>555 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cReversal is warranted only if the error resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1109 (11th Cir.) (internal quotations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 643, 178 L.Ed.2d 486 (2010). We review the trial record in its entirety when making the determination of harmless error. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">Federal Rule of Evidence 402 states that \u201c[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible.\u201d \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. However, as Rule 403 provides, relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d \u201cThe term \u2018unfair prejudice,\u2019 as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged.\u201d <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 180, 117 S.Ct. 644, 650, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). \u201cWhile it is true that all evidence which tends to establish the guilt of a defendant is, in one sense, prejudicial to the defendant, ... that does not mean that such evidence should be excluded.\u201d <em>United States v. Norton, </em>867 F.2d 1354, 1362 (11th Cir.1989) (citation and internal alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">Section 7212 of Title 26 of the U.S. Code requires the Government to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>a defendant corruptly obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the due administration of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 7212(a); <em>United States v. Popkin, </em>943 F.2d 1535, 1535-36 (11th Cir.1991). To obtain a conviction for tax evasion under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201, the Government must prove three elements: willfulness, the existence of a tax deficiency, and an affirmative act constituting evasion or attempted evasion. <em>United States v. Callahan, </em>588 F.2d 1078, 1081 (5th Cir.1979) (quotation omitted). It is a criminal violation to knowingly pass, utter, present, offer, broker, issue, or sell a false or fictitious instrument or document issued under the authority of a state or federal government entity. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">In <em>Cheek v. United States, </em>498 U.S. 192, 201, 203, 111 S.Ct. 604, 610-11, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991), the Supreme Court held that the Seventh Circuit erred in holding that a good-faith misunderstanding of tax law must be objectively reasonable \u201cif it is to be considered as possibly negating the Government\u2019s evidence purporting to show a defendant\u2019s awareness of the legal duty at issue.\u201d The Court noted, however, that \u201cthe more unreasonable the asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are, the more likely the jury will consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known legal duties imposed by the tax laws and will find that the Government has carried its burden of proving knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203-04, 111 S.Ct. at 611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">In <em>United States v. Morris, </em>we reversed the defendants\u2019 convictions for filing false income tax returns, holding that the district court erred when it failed to give a good-faith-defense instruction and material prejudice occurred. 20 F.3d 1111, 1113\u2014 14, 1118 (11th Cir.1994). We noted that the Government was required to negate \u201ca defendant\u2019s claim of ignorance of the law or a claim that because of a misunderstanding of the law, he had a good-faith belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the tax laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">In this case, the evidence was more than adequate to support a jury finding of guilt on the charges contained in the indictment. Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the IRS publication into evidence at trial because the document was relevant to the credibility of Beiter\u2019s good-faith defense regarding the nature of tax laws. The probative value of the publication was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice because the document was important to show that the IRS had attempted to furnish requested information to Better and address many of his arguments regarding the payment of taxes. Even if we were to assume that the court abused its discretion, any error was harmless because it did not affect Beiter\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
