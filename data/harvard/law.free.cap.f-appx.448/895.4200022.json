On appeal, Norman argues that: (1) the government used specialized computer software to obtain information from the shared-files folder of his computer without a warrant, and that the evidence subsequently seized during the execution of a search warrant at his residence was unlawfully obtained and should have been excluded from trial; and (2) the government failed to present any evidence that he knowingly downloaded or saved child pornography because the evidence established that multiple people used the computer in his bedroom and that at least one child pornography file was copied to the external hard drive at issue from the folder of one of Norman\u2019s sons. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">Our review of the denial of a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact, with rulings of law reviewed <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Lanzon, </em>639 F.3d 1293, 1299 (11th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 333, 181 L.Ed.2d 208, 2011 WL 4536264 (2011). Findings of fact are viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the district court. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>whether sufficient evidence supports a conviction, resolving all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1333 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010). \u201cWe will not reverse unless no reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not our function to make credibility choices or to pass upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>weight of the evidence. Instead, we must sustain the verdict where there is a reasonable basis in the record for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">First, we are unpersuaded by Norman\u2019s claim that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. In order to challenge a search under the Fourth Amendment, the defendant bears the burden of establishing both a subjective and an objective expectation of privacy in the area or object searched. <em>United States v. Segura-Baltazar, </em>448 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component requires that a person exhibit an actual expectation of privacy, while the objective component requires that the privacy expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Epps, </em>613 F.3d 1093, 1097-98 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1526, 179 L.Ed.2d 344 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Here, even if Norman held a subjectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the shared files on his computer, this expectation was not objectively reasonable. As the record shows, Norman\u2019s computer contained a peer-to-peer file-sharing program \u2014 which Norman himself used-that allowed other public users of such software to access the shared files on his computer. Moreover, Norman\u2019s argument that law enforcement used \u201cunique\u201d software that was not available to the general public, and his reliance on <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001), are misplaced because, as noted, he had placed the contents of the folder the police searched into the public domain, thereby negating any reasonable expectation of privacy in the folder. In <em>Kyllo, </em>law enforcement used a thermal imager to scan the home of a suspected marijuana grower to determine whether his home was emitting heat consistent with the use of high-intensity lamps for growing marijuana. 533 U.S. at 29-30, 121 S.Ct. 2038. The Supreme Court held that when the government uses a device, in that case a sense-enhancing thermal imager, which was not in general public use, to obtain information about the interior of a home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion, the surveillance constitutes a search. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 40, 121 S.Ct. 2038. However, unlike in <em>Kyllo, </em>the contents of the shared folder on Norman\u2019s computer were knowable to law enforcement without physical intrusion to Norman\u2019s house because this information was also available to members of the public. Accordingly, Norman did not suffer a Fourth Amendment violation, and thus, the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">We also find no merit in his sufficiency of the evidence claim. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), it is unlawful to knowingly possess any material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate commerce. It is the duty of the trier of fact to \u201cresolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d and we should only inquire as to whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">In this case, the only issue with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence established at trial is whether Norman knowingly possessed the images of child pornography on the external hard drive. The record reflects that there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find Norman guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of knowingly possessing these images on the external hard drive. Specifically, the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>viewed in the light most favorable to the government as to Count 2, established that: (1) Norman purchased the external hard drive and it was located in his bedroom; (2) the computer and external hard drive in Norman\u2019s bedroom contained the same files of child pornography \u2014 a total of 62 \u2014 which had been transferred from the computer to the hard drive on two occasions; (8) on the two occasions that files containing child pornography were transferred from the computer to the external hard drive, Norman was not at work; (4) of the other witnesses who had access to the computer in Norman\u2019s bedroom, only Norman\u2019s son knew a hard drive was located there; (5) his son may have \u201cplugged\u201d the external hard drive into the computer in Norman\u2019s bedroom on one occasion; and (6) his son did not use Norman\u2019s computer to download child pornography, and did not transfer files from his laptop, or his father\u2019s computer, to the external hard drive. Indeed, the jury was entitled to believe the witnesses who testified that they did not place child pornography on the computer in Norman\u2019s bedroom. <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Importantly, when the police questioned Norman during the execution of the search warrant, he initially denied having any contact with child pornography, yet then not only admitted that he was \u201ccurious\u201d about children, but also admitted that police would \u201c[ajbsolutely\u201d find child pornography on his computer. So although the questions the police officer asked did not address whether Norman knew child pornography was on the external hard drive, Norman\u2019s admissions, together with the other circumstantial evidence discussed above, were sufficient evidence for a rational juror to find Norman guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of knowingly possessing child pornography on the external hard drive. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
