Bennett, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the government in a suit to collect Bennett\u2019s unpaid federal income tax liability. Bennett argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because he was not engaged in any occupation subject to federal taxation during the relevant tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-21\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Williams v. Mast Biosurgery USA, Inc., </em>644 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir.2011). While we liberally construe pro se briefs, \u201cissues not briefed on appeal by a pro se litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-22\">Bennett concedes he held private-sector jobs in Florida and received earnings from them during the tax years at issue. He argues, however, that his earnings are not subject to federal income taxation because (1) he was not employed to perform services for the United States and earned income only from private-sector employers, and (2) the federal tax code\u2019s definition of \u201cUnited States\u201d includes only the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-23\">Bennett\u2019s arguments fail. We have long held that income derived from employment in the private sector is subject to federal income taxation. <em>United States v. Morse, </em>532 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (11th Cir.2008) (rejecting argument that income is not subject to federal taxation when \u201cderived from employment in the private sector\u201d as \u201cutterly without merit\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d); <em>Motes v. United States, </em>785 F.2d 928, 928 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>(11th Cir.1986) (rejecting argument \u201cthat only public servants are subject to tax liability\u201d). We have similarly ruled that the tax code does not limit the definition of the \u201cUnited States\u201d to include only its capital, federal enclaves, and territories. <em>United States v. Ward, </em>833 F.2d 1538, 1539 (11th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
