Freeman\u2019s current convictions include one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride and marijuana and one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride and marijuana. He asserts, however, that he is entitled to a reduction because his prior crack cocaine conviction was used to double the mandatory minimum sentences he faced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and (B). He maintains that, in light of the amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines, his prior conviction should not have been used to enhance the statutory minimum sentences. Freeman also contends that the district court failed to assess adequately the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly the need to avoid sentencing disparities, in determining whether he merited a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The district court\u2019s denial of Freeman\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Because Freeman\u2019s instant sentences were not calculated based on a quantity of crack cocaine, the guidelines amendments do not apply to his case. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 861 (5th Cir.2008). Although Freeman\u2019s statutory sentencing range was increased based on his prior conviction involving crack cocaine, he received the enhancement based on the existence of the prior felony drug conviction, rather than the type or quantity of drug that had resulted in the prior conviction. Freeman has not shown that the amendments to the Guidelines affect the statutory minimum sentences, and he is not entitled to a reduction because he received the minimum possible sentences. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 579-81 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">Regarding Freeman\u2019s contention that the district court should have considered various equitable factors from his original sentencing, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The principles of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce a sentence any further than the reduction allowed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s. <em>Id.; United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). Because Freeman was ineligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court was not required to address whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors warranted a reduction. <em>See Dillon, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2691-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-17\">The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED. Freeman\u2019s motion to amend his appellate brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
