No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-15\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the decision and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make fact-findings, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination on whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-16\">A person who applies for Social Security disability benefits must prove that he is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step sequential evaluation process for de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>termining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). The ALJ must evaluate whether (1) the claimant engaged in substantial gainful work; (2) the claimant has a severe impairment;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment on the Listings of Impairments; (4) the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his past relevant work; and (5) whether, in the light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">On appeal, Symonds argues that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that he was not disabled before 11 July 2006, was arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He asserts that the record does not demonstrate that his health or RFC declined between 26 May 2001, his alleged date of onset, and 11 July 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">On 26 May 2001, Symonds suffered a work-related injury to his lower back, and underwent back surgery a few months later. One of his treating physicians reported that Symonds reached maximum medical improvement on 26 November 2002, and was limited from bending, squatting, lifting more than ten pounds, standing for more than one hour, and repetitive use of his legs to operate controls. In March 2005, another treating physician reported that \u2014 although Symonds complained of lower back pain \u2014 his gait, muscle strength, and muscle tone were normal, and he had a normal range of motion in his back. Based on this record, sufficient evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Sy-monds was capable of performing sedentary physical exertion before 11 July 2006.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">On 11 July 2006, Symonds was involved in a car accident; and he developed three herniated discs in his cervical spine. He testified that, because of the newly-herniated discs, and the new pain in his left side, hip, and leg, his condition was worse after the accident. His medical records also demonstrate that his back pain and right leg weakness were worse after the accident and, thus, support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Symonds\u2019s health declined after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Symonds also argues that the ALJ did not give proper weight to the opinion of his treating physician, Dr. Lipnick, that Symonds\u2019s impairment rating was 28 percent of the whole person. Absent \u201cgood cause\u201d to the contrary, the ALJ must give substantial weight to the opinion, diagnosis, and medical evidence of a treating physician. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">The record demonstrates that the ALJ gave substantial weight to Dr. Lipnick\u2019s medical opinion. The ALJ concluded that, before 11 July 2006, Symonds could perform sedentary physical exertion, including lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling ten pounds occasionally, standing and walking for one hour at a time for about four hours a day, and sitting for six hours a day with normal breaks. This conclusion was consistent with Dr. Lipnick\u2019s assessment that, as of 8 December 2002, Symonds was limited from bending, squatting, lifting more than ten pounds, standing for more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>one hour, and repetitive use of his legs to operate controls. Although the ALJ did not rely on Dr. Lipnick\u2019s medical opinion that Symonds had a 28 percent permanent physical impairment to the whole body, that impairment rating was calculated based on the Florida Uniform Permanent Impairment Eating Schedule, not the Social Security Act\u2019s definition of disability. Moreover, the ultimate issue of disability is left to the determination of the Commissioner; and a statement by a medical source that a claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d is not binding on the ALJ. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Symonds also argues that the ALJ erred when the ALJ determined that his testimony about his subjective experience of pain was not credible. Credibility determinations about subjective testimony generally are reserved to the ALJ. <em>See Johns v. Bowen, </em>821 F.2d 551, 557 (11th Cir.1987). But \u201c[i]f the ALJ decides not to credit such testimony, he must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Here, the ALJ concluded that \u2014 although Symonds\u2019s medically determinable impairment could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged symptoms \u2014 his statements about the intensity, duration, and limiting effects of his pain before 11 July 2006, were \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In summarizing Symonds\u2019s medical records, the ALJ noted that, although Symonds had a limitation in straight leg raising on the right, he had \u201cmore facial grimacing than guarding,\u201d \u201c[ijmaging studies did not show a clear reason for his symptoms,\u201d and \u201cthe symptoms might be exaggerated or not terribly physiologic.\u201d The ALJ also indicated that Symonds\u2019s testimony about the limiting effects of his symptoms was contradicted by his testimony that his daily activities included vacuuming, caring for his children, and helping his wife with the grocery shopping.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(i) (providing that the ALJ may consider a claimant\u2019s daily activities in evaluating the intensity and persistence of pain symptoms).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\">. Disability is the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\">. Here, the AU concluded that Symonds had a severe impairment of lumbar spondylolysis with chronic back pain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\">. Because the AU concluded that Symonds was last insured on 30 June 2005, Symonds must establish that he was disabled on or before that date to qualify for disability insurance benefits. <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\">.The ALJ determined that, before 11 July 2006, Symonds was capable of lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling ten pounds occasionally, standing and walking for an hour at a time for about four hours a day, and sitting for about six hours a day with normal breaks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">. In a 21 July 2006 decision addressing Sy-monds's initial application for disability insurance benefits, the ALJ also concluded that Symonds\u2019s testimony about his pain was not credible based on (1) the objective medical evidence; (2) his \"attempts to obtain narcotic medications which suggest a possible reason to exaggerate his pain complaints;\u201d and (3) positive tests for cocaine and marijuana use.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
