Ferrer, U.S. Attorney, Robert J. Luck, Michael Brian Nadler, Anne R. Schultz, Emily M. Smachetti, Arimen-tha R.

On appeal, Almanza argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his motion to clarify his sentence for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-17\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1321 (11th Cir.2003). A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except (1) on motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons or (2) to the extent permitted by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1). Rule 35 permits a defendant to move within fourteen days of sentencing to correct his sentence for \u201carithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). The fourteen-day time requirement to file a Rule 35(a) motion is a \u201cjurisdictional restriction\u201d on the district court\u2019s power to grant relief. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1317 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-21\">Here, there has been no motion by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to amend Almanza\u2019s sentence. Although the district court finalized his sentence on April 26, 2010, Almanza did not file a motion for clarification until March 17, 2011 \u2014 over three hundred days past the deadline. Because he did not file this motion within the time required by Rule 35, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Almanza\u2019s motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-18\">. Almanza seeks to amend his sentence because the sentence imposed differed from the district judge\u2019s oral pronouncement. Because we find that the district court properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we do not address the merits of his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
