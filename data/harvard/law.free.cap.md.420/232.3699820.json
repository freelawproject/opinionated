Petitioner contends that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the standard of proof violated due process by reducing the State\u2019s burden of proof to below the constitutionally-required standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner, having made no objection to the instruction at trial, argued on appeal to the Court of Special Appeals that the erroneous instruction was a structural error that is per se reversible, even in the absence of a contemporaneous objection. He argued, alternatively, that the Court of Special Appeals should take cognizance of \u201cplain error,\u201d as permitted by Maryland Rule 4-325(e), and reverse the judgments on that basis. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of conviction. The court held that the jury instruction, viewed in its entirety, did not constitute constitutional error, much less constitutional error that is structural in nature, and there was no cause to exercise the court\u2019s discretion to review the claim under the guise of \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s request to review the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. For the following reasons, we hold that the instruction contained error of constitutional dimension and was structural in nature; the error is worthy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the exercise of our discretion to take cognizance of the error as \u201cplain\u201d; and Petitioner is entitled to a new trial as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In light of the legal question before us, we need not undertake a detailed account of the evidence offered at trial. It suffices for our purposes to understand that the State presented legally sufficient evidence that, on May 28, 1993, Petitioner shot and killed Marvin Watts during an altercation between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Petitioner\u2019s three-day jury trial commenced on May 9, 1994. At the close of all the evidence, the court gave the following jury instruction on the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof required for conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">[T]he defendant is presumed innocent of the charges until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty. He comes into court clothed with this presumption of innocence, which remains with him from the beginning to the end of the trial as though it were testified to and supported by evidence that the defendant is innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">The burden of proving the defendant guilty is upon the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial for every element of the crime charged. The defendant has no burden to sustain and does not have to prove his innocence. The charges against the defendant are not evidence of guilt. They are merely complaints to let you and the defendant know what the charges are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">After the jury has fairly and carefully reviewed all the evidence in this case, if you feel that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty all of the evidence necessary to convict, then you must acquit the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">The test of reasonable doubt is that the evidence that the State has produced must be so convincing that it would enable you to act on an important piece of business in your every day life. The words \u201cto a moral certainty\u201d do not mean an absolute or mathematical certainty but a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tainty based upon convincing grounds of probability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">The phrase \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d does not mean beyond any doubt or all possible doubt. But as the words indicate, beyond a doubt that is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">You are further instructed that the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the offenses were committed, but that the defendant is the person who committed them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Petitioner did not object to the instruction. The jury convicted him of involuntary manslaughter, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and carrying a handgun upon his person. The court imposed a total of 33 years\u2019 imprisonment, which included separate sentences for the two handgun-related convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">On direct appeal, Petitioner did not contest the reasonable doubt instruction. He argued, successfully, only that the handgun-related convictions should merge. His sentence was thereby reduced to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. Petitioner thereafter pursued post-conviction relief, which resulted in his receiving a second, belated direct appeal on the ground that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective in failing to challenge, as plainly erroneous, the reasonable doubt instruction given at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>In 2008, the Court of Special Appeals heard the appeal. Petitioner, citing <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993), asserted that the reasonable doubt instruction reduced the burden of proof at his trial. That error, Petitioner argued, violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury, thereby creating structural error that required reversal of the 1994 judgments of conviction, even in the absence of a contemporaneous objection at trial. Petitioner further argued that, even if the instructional error was not structural, the Court of Special Appeals should take cognizance of it as \u201cplain error\u201d and reverse the convictions on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The State did not contest Petitioner\u2019s premise that the reasonable doubt instruction was erroneous. Instead, the State took the position that Petitioner could not overcome the hurdles posed by the limits of \u201cplain error\u201d review merely by casting the error as \u201cstructural.\u201d The State therefore argued that the Court of Special Appeals should decline Petitioner\u2019s request for automatic review. Even so, the State further argued, the error in the instruction was not of constitutional dimension, much less structural error; moreover, Petitioner made no persuasive argument suggesting the need for or desirability of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 taking cognizance of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments of conviction. The Court recognized that, under <em>Sullivan, </em>a reasonable doubt instruction that reduces the burden of proof is constitutional error that is structural in nature. The Court of Special Appeals also recognized that, under <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994), not all errors in a reasonable doubt instruction are of constitutional magnitude. The court concluded that the error in the instruction given at Petitioner\u2019s trial was not of that magnitude. The court observed that the instruction was very similar to the instruction held to be plainly erroneous in <em>Himple v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 579, 647 A.2d 1240 (1994). The court, however, found no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>reason to exercise its discretion to take cognizance of the error in Petitioner\u2019s case as \u201cplain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">We granted certiorari to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">(1) Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that the reasonable doubt instructions issued to the jury at Petitioner\u2019s trial, which defined the standard for beyond a reasonable doubt as \u201ccertainty based upon convincing grounds of probability,\u201d did not constitute a structural error nor violate Petitioner\u2019s Sixth and Fourteenth amendment constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">(2) Did the Court of Special Appeals abuse its discretion in refusing to recognize plain error in reasonable doubt jury instructions, which defined the standard for reasonable doubt as \u201ccertainty based upon convincing grounds of probability\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We begin our discussion by noting the two points on which the parties agree: (1) the reasonable doubt instruction given at Petitioner\u2019s trial contained erroneous language; and (2) Petitioner did not lodge a contemporaneous objection to it. The parties have diametrically opposing views, though, concerning whether Petitioner\u2019s failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection to the instruction erects procedural and substantive hurdles to obtaining appellate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Looming large in the analysis is Maryland Rule 4\u2014325(e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The State, not surprisingly, hangs its hat on that rule. The State argues that the only way Petitioner can obtain appellate relief is by persuading us either that the Court of Special Appeals abused its discretion in declining to review the instructional error under the guise of plain error or that we should exercise our discretion under that same standard. In that regard, the State points out that the nature of the error, whether labeled \u201cconstitutional,\u201d \u201cstructural,\u201d or otherwise, is irrelevant to whether Petitioner preserved for appellate review his challenge to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Petitioner disagrees that the plain error rule necessarily controls his right to appellate review of the challenged instruction. He argues, albeit in a footnote only, that preservation by contemporaneous objection is not required to preserve an appellate challenge to a reasonable doubt instruction that lowers the constitutional standard of proof, because \u201cwaiver\u201d of such error requires that it be a <em>Zerbst-type </em>\u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d waiver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner further argues that an objection is unnecessary when, as here, the claimed instructional error creates a \u201cstructural\u201d problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">We disagree with both of Petitioner\u2019s arguments for why, in his view, the \u201cplain error\u201d standard of Rule 4-325(e) does not apply to the instructional error the parties agree occurred in this case. To begin, Petitioner confuses the concepts of a <em>Zerbst-type </em>substantive waiver of a known right or privilege, on the one hand, and a procedural forfeiture of the right to appellate review of trial error by failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection, on the other. \u201cForfeiture is the failure to make a timely assertion of a right, whereas waiver is the \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 580, 3 A.3d 1210, 1217 (2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (1993)). The two doctrines are distinct, and we have made clear that \u201c[t]he \u2018knowing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>intelligent\u2019 waiver concept is not applicable to the failure to object to an erroneous jury instruction.\u201d <em>Hunt v. State, </em>345 Md. 122, 150, 691 A.2d 1255, 1268 (1997) (rejecting that argument in the context of a post conviction challenge to the constitutional adequacy of a reasonable doubt instruction) (citing <em>Davis v. State, </em>285 Md. 19, 35, 400 A.2d 406, 414 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Petitioner\u2019s second argument for why he need not have objected to the instruction in order to obtain appellate review is that, because the instructional error is alleged to be of constitutional dimension and \u201cstructural\u201d in nature, the error is per se subject to appellate review. That argument relies heavily upon <em>Sullivan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In <em>Sullivan </em>(about which we shall say more later in this opinion), the Supreme Court held that a constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt jury instruction is structural error and, consequently, is never harmless error. 508 U.S. at 280, 113 S.Ct. 2078. The Supreme Court, though, did not suggest in that case, or in any subsequent case insofar as we know, that a structural error is immune from the ordinary appellate-review requirement of a contemporaneous objection to the claimed error, at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Rule 8-131 (a) is the general rule governing procedural forfeiture of an appellate claim through inaction at the trial level. That rule reads, in pertinent part: \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue [that is, any issue other than jurisdiction over the subject matter and, unless waived, over the person] unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court... ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have not hesitated to decline to review on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>direct appeal claims of constitutional dimension that were not preserved under Rule 8-181(a). <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 106, 976 A.2d 1072, 1081 (2009) (stating that errors of constitutional dimension can be waived, and declining to review on direct appeal a claim of a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial, where the claim was not raised at trial); <em>Taylor v. State, </em>381 Md. 602, 614, 851 A.2d 551, 558 (2004) (explaining that \u201c[e]ven errors of Constitutional dimension may be waived by failure to interpose a timely objection at trial\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Walker v. State, </em>338 Md. 253, 262-63, 658 A.2d 239, 243 (declining to consider the petitioner\u2019s Due Process and Sixth Amendment claims because the issues were not raised below and thus not preserved for review under Md. Rule 8-131(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><em>State v. Rose, </em>345 Md. 238, 691 A.2d 1314 (1997), also informs the issue. We held in <em>Rose </em>that a post-conviction petitioner is not excused from the contemporaneous objection requirement, in connection with an allegedly constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt instruction, notwithstanding that the error involved fundamental constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 248-49, 691 A.2d at 1319. In so holding, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">Our cases make it clear that, simply because an asserted right is derived from the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of Maryland, or is regarded as a \u201cfundamental right,\u201d does not necessarily make the \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d standard of waiver applicable. Rather, most rights, whether constitutional, statutory or common law, may be waived by inaction or failure to adhere to legitimate procedural requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 248, 691 A.2d at 1319. <em>See also Hunt, </em>345 Md. at 152, 691 A.2d at 1269-70 (declining, on post conviction review in a capital case, to overlook the appellant\u2019s failure to raise a timely challenge to the reasonable doubt instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>In addition to the general rule requiring preservation of claims by contemporaneous objection is, of course, Maryland Rule 4-325(e), which requires contemporaneous objection in order to challenge instructional error on appeal, as a matter of right. Absent from Rule 4-325(e), or any other rule relevant to appellate review, is an exception from the contemporaneous objection requirement for structural errors. In other words, appellate review of unpreserved instructional errors is limited to circumstances warranting plain error review, regardless of the nature of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We set forth in <em>State v. Hutchinson </em>the circumstances under which an appellate court should consider exercising discretion to take cognizance of plain error: \u201c[A]n appellate court should take cognizance of unobjected to error\u201d when the error is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d 287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035, 1038 (1980). Factors to consider in that determination include \u201cthe materiality of the error in the context in which it arose, giving due regard to whether the error was purely technical, the product of conscious design or trial tactics or the result of bald inattention.\u201d <em>Id., </em>411 A.2d at 1038. We have not deviated from that standard in the years since <em>Hutchinson. See, e.g., Miller v. State, </em>380 Md. 1, 29-30, 843 A.2d 803, 820 (2004) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The error at issue in the present case is instructional error. Notwithstanding (as we shall see) that the error is of constitutional dimension and structural in nature, Petitioner was required, but failed, to make a timely objection to the instruction. He therefore has no right to automatic appellate review of it. It remains for us to determine whether the error is appropriate for review under the guise of plain error. We therefore shall examine Petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments through the prism of that doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\n<em>Is the error in the reasonable doubt instruction given in this case of constitutional dimension and, if so, is it structural error?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Review for plain error requires as an initial step that the instruction contain error. The parties, as we have said, agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>that the reasonable doubt instruction given at Petitioner\u2019s trial was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The next step in the analysis requires that we consider whether the error was \u201cplain\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d to Petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial; that is, we must consider whether the error in the instruction lowered the burden of proof and thereby created error that was clear and \u201c \u2018fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>380 Md. at 29, 843 A.2d at 820 (quoting <em>Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 203, 411 A.2d at 1038). Petitioner argues that the error in the reasonable doubt instruction given at his trial meets that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Before examining that contention, we pause to repeat that Petitioner was tried in 1994. His trial therefore long predates <em>Ruffin v. State, </em>394 Md. 355, 906 A.2d 360 (2006). We held in <em>Ruffin </em>that, going forward from the date of that decision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cin every criminal jury trial, the trial court is required to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard of proof which closely adheres to MPJI-CR 2:02[,]\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u201cfdjeviations in substance will not be tolerated.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 373, 906 A.2d at 371. Because we made clear in <em>Ruffin </em>that our holding has only prospective application, it has no bearing on Petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the State to prove every element of an offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). The Constitution, however, \u201cdoes not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof.... Rather, \u2018taken as a whole, the instructions [must] correctly conve[y] the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 5,114 S.Ct. 1239 (upholding reasonable doubt instruction as constitutionally sound despite troublesome language because, upon consideration of the instruction in its entirety, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt) (quoting <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954)). <em>Accord Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 401, 697 A.2d 432, 437 (1997) (We review the trial court\u2019s \u201c \u2018explanation of reasonable doubt as a whole; [we cannot] determine the propriety of an explanation from an isolated statement^ but must] view[ ] the effect of a suspect statement on the jury in light of the entire explanation.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370, 384, 620 A.2d 295, 302 (1993))).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The inquiry is \u201c \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way\u2019 that violates the Constitution.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (quoting <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990)). If upon applying that standard of review we determine that the reasonable doubt instruction was constitutionally deficient, then the error is structural and defies analysis by harmless error standards. <em>See Sullivan, </em>508 U.S. at 280, 113 S.Ct. 2078; <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 398, 697 A.2d at 436 (\u201cThe reasonable doubt standard is such an indispensable and necessary part of any criminal proceeding that, with respect to a case tried before a jury, the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the jury of that standard constitutes reversible error.\u201d); <em>Wills, </em>329 Md. at 376, 620 A.2d at 298 (stating that inclusion of a reasonable doubt instruction \u201cis so indispensable that the Supreme Court has indicated that failure to instruct the jury of the requirement of the reasonable doubt standard is never harmless error\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">To determine whether the instruction given at Petitioner\u2019s trial is constitutionally deficient, we look first to Supreme Court jurisprudence on the subject. To our knowledge, there is but one case, <em>Cage v. Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39, 111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990) (per curiam), in which the Supreme Court found a reasonable doubt instruction constitutionally deficient. The instruction in <em>Cage </em>read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">If you entertain a reasonable doubt as to any fact or element necessary to constitute the defendant\u2019s guilt, it is your duty to give him the benefit of that doubt and return a verdict of not guilty. Even where the evidence demonstrates a probability of guilt, if it does not establish such guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, you must acquit the accused. This doubt, however, must be a reasonable one; that is one that is founded upon a real tangible substantial basis and not upon mere caprice and conjecture. It must be such doubt as would give rise to a grave uncertainty, raised in your mind by reasons of the unsatisfactory character of the evidence or lack thereof. A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt. It is an actual substantial doubt. It is a doubt that a reasonable man can seriously entertain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>What is required is not an absolute or mathematical certainty, but a moral certainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">498 U.S. at 40, 111 S.Ct. 328. The Supreme Court determined that the instruction, when viewed as a whole, \u201csuggest[ed] a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal,\u201d because the instruction equated reasonable doubt with \u201cgrave uncertainty\u201d and \u201cactual substantial doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 111 S.Ct. 328. The Court reversed the conviction on the basis of the constitutionally deficient instruction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Four years later, the Supreme Court, in <em>Victor, </em>again construed a reasonable doubt instruction for constitutional defectiveness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court considered in <em>Victor </em>the companion cases of petitioners Arthur Sandoval and Clarence Victor, each of whom asserted that his first-degree murder conviction was the product of a constitutionally-defective reasonable-doubt jury instruction. 511 U.S. at 7, 18-19, 114 S.Ct. 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">At Sandoval\u2019s trial, the court instructed the jury on the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">A defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt whether his guilt is satisfactorily shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. This presumption places upon the State the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">Reasonable doubt is defined as follows: It <em>is not a mere possible doubt; </em>because everything relating to human affairs, and <em>depending on moral evidence, </em>is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, <em>to a moral certainty, </em>of the truth of the charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 7, 114 S.Ct. 1239. Sandoval contended that the language italicized above reduced the State\u2019s burden of proof and thereby violated the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 114 S.Ct. 1239. The Court focused on the phrases \u201cmoral certainty\u201d and \u201cmoral evidence.\u201d Although the phrase is \u201cambiguous in the abstract,\u201d the Court determined that \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d in light of the immediately preceding clause \u201cabiding conviction,\u201d \u201cimpress[ed] upon the fact-finder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 114 S.Ct. 1239 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). The Court explained that the instruction given in Sandoval\u2019s case was further distinguished from the instruction given in <em>Cage </em>by the presence in the instruction to Sandoval\u2019s jury that (1) the decision must be based solely on the evidence presented in the case (\u201cafter the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence\u201d), and (2) the jury must \u201cdetermine the facts of the case from the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 114 S.Ct. 1239. The Court expressed disdain for the use of \u201cmoral certainty\u201d in jury instructions; the Court nevertheless held that the instruction given in Sandoval\u2019s case, when read in its entirety, was not constitutionally defective. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17, 114 S.Ct. 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Court then addressed the instruction provided at Victor\u2019s trial, where the trial court, after stating that the burden is always on the State to prove all elements of a charged offense, provided the following reasonable doubt charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">\u201cReasonable doubt\u201d is such a doubt as would cause a reasonable and prudent person, in one of the graver and more important transactions of life, to pause and hesitate before taking the represented facts as true and relying and acting thereon. It is such a doubt as will not permit you, after full, fair, and impartial consideration of all the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>dence, to have an abiding conviction, <em>to a moral certainty, </em>of the guilt of the accused. At the same time, absolute or mathematical certainty is not required. You may be convinced of the truth of a fact beyond a reasonable doubt and yet be fully aware that possibly you may be mistaken. You may find an accused guilty upon the <em>strong probabilities of the case, </em>provided such probabilities are strong enough to exclude any doubt of his guilt that is reasonable. A reasonable doubt is an <em>actual and substantial doubt </em>reasonably arising from the evidence, from the facts or circumstances shown by the evidence, or from the lack of evidence on the part of the State, as distinguished from a doubt arising from mere possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjecture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 18, 114 S.Ct. 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The Court observed that equating reasonable doubt with \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d is problematic because it could \u201cimply a doubt greater than required for acquittal under <em>Winship </em>[.] \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 114 S.Ct. 1239. The Court\u2019s concern about that language, however, was alleviated by the language that followed the problematic words: the instruction refined the meaning of \u201csubstantial\u201d as not involving a \u201cmere possibility, [ ] bare imagination, or [ ] fanciful conjecture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, unlike the instruction in <em>Cage, </em>the instruction in Victor\u2019s case provided an alternative explanation of reasonable doubt: \u201ca doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 114 S.Ct. 1239. Given those additions to the instruction, the Court was convinced that there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have interpreted the instruction as requiring proof that is less stringent than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">This Court\u2019s opinions are in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the subject. <em>See Wills, </em>329 Md. at 376-384, 388, 620 A.2d at 297-302, 303 (holding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>reasonable doubt instruction given in that case was more like the preponderance of the evidence standard and \u201cdid not measure up to an acceptable explanation of the reasonable doubt standard,\u201d because the instruction could lead a jury to believe that, \u201cif the evidence adduced by the state has more convincing force and produces in the minds of the jury a belief that it is more likely true than not, the reasonable doubt standard has been met\u201d); <em>see also Ruffin, </em>894 Md. at 371, 906 A.2d at 370 (collecting cases on the subject); <em>Miller, </em>380 Md. at 29-30, 843 A.2d at 820 (holding that the appellant, by failing to object timely to the reasonable doubt instruction, had waived his right to complain about it on appeal, but observing that, had the Court reached the merits of the challenge, it would have found no error in the inclusion in the instruction of the phrase \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d instead of \u201cwithout reservation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">We have no need to rehearse in further detail the jurisprudence developed in those cases. One additional case, however, deserves some discussion. <em>Himple, </em>101 Md.App. 579, 647 A.2d 1240, involved a reasonable doubt instruction virtually identical to the one given in Petitioner\u2019s case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Of additional interest, for our purposes, is that the Court of Special Appeals exercised its discretion in that case to take cognizance of plain error in the reasonable doubt instruction (as there had been no contemporaneous objection to it), and ordered a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>on the basis of that instructional error. It therefore is understandable that both Petitioner and the State devote much of their attention to <em>Himple.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in undertaking plain error review of the un-objected-to instruction, considered two aspects of it: the language advising that \u201cthe words, to a moral certainty do not mean absolute or mathematical certainty, but a certainty based upon a convincing ground of probability\u201d; and the omission of the phrase \u201cwithout reservation\u201d in the portion of the instruction that stated: \u201cThe test of reasonable doubt is the evidence that the State has produced must be so convincing that it would enable you to act on an important piece of business in everyday life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581, 647 A.2d at 1241. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the \u201cconvincing ground of probability\u201d language undermined the reasonable doubt standard because the language equated a \u201cconvincing ground of probability to reasonable doubt. In other words, the jurors were instructed that if they were convinced that it was probable that appellant committed the offense, they could convict him of the charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582-83, 647 A.2d at 1242. The <em>Himple </em>Court emphasized that omission of the \u201cwithout reservation\u201d language alone \u201cwould not necessarily constitute \u2018plain error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>647 A.2d at 1242. The Court nonetheless considered the omission to be problematic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">Even if the \u201cprobability\u201d factor had not been included, the balance of the instruction given [in Himple\u2019s case] appeared] to equate the degree with which people make important decisions in their everyday life with the reasonable doubt standard. That is not an accurate comparison. The important language in that portion of the pattern instruction that makes it a proper comparison is the language \u201cwilling to act ... <em>without reservation.\u201d </em>The legal reasonable doubt standard and the decision making progress in respect to important personal matters in a layman\u2019s life are not the same. It is the language \u201cwithout reservation\u201d that tends to impart to the jury the degree of certainty that elevates the comparison in the direction of the reasonable doubt standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 583, 647 A.2d at 1242 (citations omitted). The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the instruction given at Himple\u2019s trial contained \u201cthe type of error [that] we will consider even in the absence of preservation. It is \u2018plain error.\u2019 It is also clearly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>647 A.2d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">With <em>Cage, Victor, </em>and <em>Himple </em>as guideposts, we turn to the instruction in the present case. Petitioner complains that the trial court reduced the State\u2019s burden of proof and thereby violated <em>Winship, </em>by instructing the jury that the \u201cwords to a moral certainty do not mean an absolute or mathematical certainty but a certainty based upon convincing grounds of probability,\u201d and by omitting \u201cwithout reservation\u201d from the description of reasonable doubt as \u201cenabl[ing] you to act on an important piece of business in your everyday life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The State counters that the instruction, when viewed in its entirety, properly instructed the jury on the reasonable doubt standard despite the inclusion of the \u201cmoral certainty\u201d definition found deficient in <em>Himple. </em>As for the trial court\u2019s omission of the \u201cwithout reservation\u201d language, the State points to, inter alia, <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 399-400, 697 A.2d at 436, in which we upheld a reasonable doubt jury instruction that omitted the \u201cwithout reservation\u201d language, and <em>Wills, </em>329 Md. at 384, 620 A.2d at 305, in which we held that the phrase \u201cwithout reservation\u201d is not required for an instruction to be constitutionally sufficient but is advisable to include.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We conclude, much as did the Court of Special Appeals in analyzing the virtually identical reasonable doubt instruction in <em>Himple, </em>that the instruction given at Petitioner\u2019s trial was constitutionally deficient. Aside from the troublesome use of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d <em>see Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 16, 114 S.Ct. 1239,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the instruction lacks the curative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>language present in <em>Victor </em>that would permit us to overlook the problematic language of \u201cconvincing grounds of probability.\u201d Looking for context to the words immediately surrounding the problematic language in the instruction, we find no words explaining or refining the phrase \u201ca convincing ground of probability\u201d that give some assurance that the jury understood the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as requiring more than a mere \u201cprobability.\u201d <em>See Himple, </em>101 Md.App. at 582-83, 647 A.2d at 1242. That error alone renders the instruction constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">That same error, moreover, must be considered in concert with the omission of the \u201cwithout reservation\u201d language in the sentence that followed. We hew to our holding in <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 399-400, 697 A.2d at 436, that the omission of the \u201cwithout reservation\u201d language is alone not fatal. Yet we must consider the absence of that language in light of the entire instruction given in Petitioner\u2019s case. Like our colleagues in <em>Himple, </em>we cannot say that, in viewing the instruction as a whole, there is no \u201creasonable likelihood that the jury had applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the Constitution.\u201d <em>McGuire, </em>502 U.S. at 72, 112 S.Ct. 475 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the error in the reasonable doubt instruction given in Petitioner\u2019s case is of constitutional dimension and, under <em>Sullivan, </em>is \u201cstructural\u201d error. Moreover, such error is self-evidently plain and material to Petitioner\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial. <em>See Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 203, 411 A.2d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">That we have found error in the instruction, though, does not answer the ultimate question, which is whether the discretion of the Court of Special Appeals or, for that matter, this Court, should be exercised to take cognizance of the unobjected-to error. It is to that question we turn next.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\n<em>Should the structural error in the instruction be subject to discretionary review under Rule b-325?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">We have not hesitated to exercise discretion, in the appropriate (albeit rare) case, to take cognizance of un-objected-to instructional error under the guise of plain error. <em>See Richmond v. State, </em>330 Md. 223, 623 A.2d 630 (1993) (taking cognizance of plain error in a jury instruction on malicious wounding with intent to disable that omitted specific intent); <em>Franklin v. State, </em>319 Md. 116, 571 A.2d 1208 (1990) (taking cognizance of plain error in an instruction indicating that specific intent to kill was not required to establish assault with intent to murder); <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988) (finding plain error where jury instruction omitted element of knowledge from CDS possession). We conclude, for several reasons, that this case, too, is an appropriate case for the exercise of plain error review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The instructional error was serious, as it undermined a core value of constitutional criminal jurisprudence: that a person charged with a crime shall not be convicted on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The prejudice to Petitioner\u2019s case is presumed. <em>Sullivan, </em>508 U.S. at 280, 113 S.Ct. 2078. Moreover, it is most unlikely that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instruction was a matter of strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We bear in mind, moreover, that this case comes to us as a direct, albeit much belated, appeal. Therefore, we have considered Petitioner\u2019s case as if it were the Spring of 1994. At that time, <em>Cage </em>had been on the books for four years, <em>Sullivan, </em>one year, and <em>Victor, </em>a matter of several months. <em>Himple, Wills, </em>and <em>Ruffin </em>were not to be decided for several months, eight years, and twelve years, respectively. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>words, the legal landscape at the time this issue should have been raised on direct appeal was far different from what it is today. Indeed, we can find no reported Maryland decision on the books at the time of Petitioner\u2019s trial and original appeal that addressed the reasonable doubt instruction given at his trial. These circumstances make it all the more appropriate for us to exercise our discretion to decide the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Having exercised our discretion to review the instructional error, it follows from the nature of the error that Petitioner is entitled to a new trial. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is therefore reversed. We direct that court to vacate the judgments of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY BALTIMORE CITY.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">HARRELL and BATTAGLIA, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-10\">. Getting to that result involved a number of procedural steps. In 2002, Petitioner filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for post conviction relief, asserting that he had ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. On December 2, 2002, the post conviction court found that Petitioner had received ineffective assistance of both trial counsel, who failed to object to the instruction, and appellate counsel, who failed to challenge the reasonable doubt instruction as plainly erroneous. Accordingly, the post conviction court granted Petitioner a new trial. The State filed an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which granted the application and placed the case on the regular appeal docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the post conviction court's ruling that trial counsel was ineffective. The appellate court, though, agreed with the post conviction court that Petitioner received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and held that a belated appeal was the appropriate relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">. <em>See Johnson v.

The overwhelming majority of courts that have considered this issue have held, as we do here, that un-preserved structural errors are not automatically reversible, but, instead, are subject to plain error review. <em>See United States v. Birbal, 62 </em>F.3d 456, 461 (2d Cir.1995) (applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>plain error review to un-objected-to constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt instruction); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>12 F.3d 1128, 1138 (D.C.Cir.1994) (explaining that an un-objected-to constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt instruction is structural error under <em>Sullivan </em>and applying plain error review); <em>United States v. Colon-Pagan, </em>1 F.3d 80, 81 (1st Cir.1993) (Breyer, J.) (\"Because appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to [a constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt instruction] at trial, the issue on appeal is whether [the instructions] contain an error that is 'plain' or a 'defect' [ ] that affect[s] substantial rights\u201d). <em>See also United States v. David, </em>83 F.3d 638, 647-48 (4th Cir.1996) (applying plain error review to structural error); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>71 F.3d 954, 960 (1st Cir.1995) (\u201cIn all events, our best guess is that the Supreme Court would regard an omitted element reversible error <em>per se </em>if there were a timely objection\u2014although not automatically 'plain error\u2019 if no objection occurred....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Petitioner relies for the contrary view on two out-of-state cases, <em>People v. Duncan, </em>462 Mich. 47, 610 N.W.2d 551 (2000), and <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 885 N.E.2d 917 (2008). We do not find those cases persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The analysis in <em>Duncan, </em>in our view, is flawed. True, the Michigan Supreme Court held in <em>Duncan </em>that structural errors are automatically reversible, regardless of the failure to make a contemporaneous objection. 610 N.W.2d at 552 (reversing defendant's conviction despite failure to object at trial to instruction's omission of all of the elements of a crime because the omission was structural error). In so holding, the Michigan Supreme Court misconstrued, and thereby misapplied, Supreme Court precedent, particularly <em>Sullivan, Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 7, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), and <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997), to support that court\u2019s conclusion that structural errors are not subject to preservation requirements. As explained above, <em>Sullivan </em>says nothing about automatic appellate review of un-preserved structural errors. Neither does <em>Neder, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that the omission of an element of a crime in a jury instruction is subject to harmless-error analysis. 527 U.S. at 10, 119 S.Ct. 1827 (in fact, an objection was made to the omission at trial). And in <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court expressly avoided deciding whether the instructional error was structural and thus automatically reversible, explaining that, even if it was, the error did not \u201cseriously affect[] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of [the] judicial proceeding[ ]\u201d and would not warrant exercise of plain error review. 520 U.S. at 469, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (\u201cBut we need not decide that question because, even assuming that the failure to submit materiality to the jury [was a structural error], it does not meet the final requirement of [plain error].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Nor are we persuaded by <em>Colon, </em>885 N.E.2d at 926, which was expressly overruled by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>State v.

The Majority opinion takes great lengths to establish a framework within which to review unpreserved errors in a jury instruction context. Although the framework is accurate, it is applied in a conclusory and flawed manner to the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The Majority opinion recognizes that a jury instruction may contain \u201ctroublesome language,\u201d so long as, \u201ctaken as a whole, the instructions correctly convey the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\u201d <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 22, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 1251, 127 L.Ed.2d 583, 601 (1994). Despite cognizance of this cautionary Supreme Court precept, the Majority opinion focuses almost solely on two problematic phrases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the instruction under scrutiny in the present case, finding solace in the fact that the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Himple v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 579, 647 A.2d 1240 (1994), considered \u201cvirtually identical\u201d language and concluded that the instruction was deficient constitutionally. The trouble is that the <em>Himple </em>Court did not rely on or even cite <em>Victor, </em>let alone view the jury instructions in that case as a contextual whole. Thus, in the final analysis, the Majority opinion here does not practice what it preaches, instead averting its glance (with Himple-glazed eyes) from the present instruction viewed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">I conclude that the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in Savoy\u2019s case should be affirmed. Because the error in the subject jury instruction was not plain and material (i.e., not deficient constitutionally), Petitioner was required to object contemporaneously at trial to preserve his appellate challenge. He did not. Therefore, the error in the jury instruction is ineligible for discretionary review by an appellate court, and a new trial is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">I. The Majority Opinion\u2019s Plain Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The Majority correctly identifies Maryland Rule 4-325(e) as the starting point for analyzing the present case. Majority op. at 293, 22 A.3d at 850. The Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite the failure to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">According to its plain reading, no unpreserved error\u2014even one of constitutional dimension\u2014yields automatic reversal. Rather, any error to which a defendant did not object contemporaneously may be subject to plain error review. An appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>late court, at its discretion, may opt to review \u201cany plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.\u201d Md. Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">A. <em>The Presence of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">To qualify for potential review, Petitioner must demonstrate first that an error exists. In the present case, the State concedes, and the Majority opinion agrees, that errors appear in the jury instruction, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">[T]he defendant is presumed innocent of the charges until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty. He comes into court clothed with the presumption of innocence, which remains with him from the beginning to the end of the trial as though it were testified to and supported by evidence that the defendant is innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">The burden of proving the defendant guilty is upon the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial for every element of the crime charged. The defendant has no burden to sustain and does not have to prove his innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">The charges against the defendant are not evidence of guilt. They are merely complaints to let you and the defendant know what the charges are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">After the jury has fairly and carefully reviewed all the evidence in this case, if you feel that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty all of the evidence necessary to convict, then you must acquit the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">The test of reasonable doubt is that the evidence that the State produced must be so convincing that <em>it would enable you to act on an important piece of business in your every day life. </em>The words \u201cto a moral certainty\u201d do not mean an absolute or mathematical certainty but <em>a certainty based upon convincing grounds of probability. </em>The phrase \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 does not mean beyond any doubt or all possible doubt. But[,] as the words indicate, beyond a doubt that is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>You are further instructed that the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the offenses were committed, but that the defendant is the person who committed them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Majority opinion identifies two particular problems with this instruction: (1) the omission of the qualifying words \u201cwithout reservation\u201d appended to the phrase \u201cin your every day life,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) the use of the phrase \u201cconvincing grounds of probability\u201d to define \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d Majority op. at 252, 22 A.8d at 857. The Majority opinion concedes, however, that the omission of \u201cwithout reservation\u201d is \u201cnot alone fatal.\u201d Majority op. at 254, 22 A.3d at 858; <em>see Himple, </em>101 Md.App. at 582-83, 647 A.2d at 1242 (1994) (holding that failing to include the \u201cwithout reservation\u201d language \u201citself would not necessarily constitute \u2018plain error\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">B. Was <em>The Error Plain and Material Became It Was Constitutionally Deficient?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The second step in securing appellate review of an unobjected-to instruction is the establishment of the error as both \u201cplain\u201d and \u201cmaterial.\u201d An appellate court should consider exercising its discretion to review the jury instruction if an error is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 202-03, 411 A.2d 1035, 1038 (1980). Stated more definitively, the instruction constitutes plain and material error (and is, therefore, susceptible to review at the discretion of an appellate court) if there is a reasonable chance that the jury would apply the instruction in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>S.Ct. 475, 482, 116 L.Ed.2d 385, 399 (1991) (quoting <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 1198, 108 L.Ed.2d 316, 329 (1990)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In the present case, the Majority opinion establishes plain and material error by deeming the jury instruction \u201cconstitutionally deficient.\u201d Majority op. at 247, 22 A.3d at 854. According to the Majority, the instruction misrepresented the reasonable doubt standard, i.e., reduced the State\u2019s burden of proof. Because \u201cfailure to instruct the jury of the requirement of reasonable doubt is never harmless,\u201d <em>Wills v. State, </em>329 Md. 370, 376, 620 A.2d 295, 298 (1993), the Majority opinion holds that the erroneous jury instruction vitiates the conviction and Petitioner must be awarded a new trial. <em>See Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 279, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2081, 124 L.Ed.2d 182, 189 (1993) (holding that a constitutionally deficient instruction discredits the conviction).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>To support its holding, the Majority opinion analogizes this case to two <em>others\u2014Cage v. Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39, 111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990) and Himple\u25a0\u2014in which reasonable doubt instructions were deemed constitutionally deficient. The Majority opinion also attempted to minimize the relevance of <em>Victor, </em>in which the flawed instructions were upheld as constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">1. <em>Cage and Himple</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In only one previous case, <em>Cage, </em>has the Supreme Court reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction because the reasonable doubt instruction as given was unconstitutional. <em>See Cage, </em>498 U.S. at 41, 111 S.Ct. at 330, 112 L.Ed.2d at 342. In <em>Cage, </em>the problematic portion of the jury instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agm\">This doubt must be a reasonable one; that is one that is founded upon a real tangible substantial basis and not upon mere caprice and conjecture. It must be such doubt as would give rise to a <em>grave uncertainty, </em>raised in your mind by reasons of the unsatisfactory character of the evidence or lack thereof. A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt. It is an <em>actual substantial doubt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court held that the instruction did not emphasize adequately the reasonable doubt standard or the \u201cevidentiary certainty\u201d required to convict the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the instruction as given permitted \u201ca finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that required by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The Majority opinion here also relies heavily on <em>Himple, </em>in large part because the instruction in that case resembles closely the instruction in the present case. The instructions in <em>Himple </em>read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">[T]he defendant is presumed innocent of the crimes charged until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to a moral certainty.... [He] comes into Court clothed with this presumption of innocence, which remains with him from the beginning to the end of trial, as to each element of the crimes charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The burden of proving the defendant guilty is upon the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial. The defendant has no burden to sustain, does not have to prove his innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">The test of reasonable doubt is the evidence that the State has produced must be so convincing that <em>it would enable you to act on an important piece of business in your everyday life. </em>The words, to a moral certainty, do not mean absolute or mathematical certainty, but <em>a certainty based upon a convincing ground of probability. </em>The phrase beyond a reasonable doubt, does not mean beyond any doubt or all possible doubt, but, as the words indicate, beyond a doubt that is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">You are further instructed that the burden is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the offenses were committed, but that the defendant is the person who committed them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Brief for the Appellant, <em>Himple v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 579, 647 A.2d 1240 (1994) (Ct.Spec.App.1995) (No.1911, Sept. Term 1993) (Appendix). The Court of Special Appeals deemed the instructions deficient constitutionally for reasons similar to those expressed in <em>Cage. Himple, </em>101 Md.App. at 582-83, 647 A.2d at 1242. The instruction \u201cequat[ed] a convincing ground of probability to reasonable doubt\u201d and, thereby, lowered the burden of proof required to convict the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\n<em>2. Victor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Early on, the Majority opinion highlights correctly that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the State to prove every element of a offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364[, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, 375] (1970). The Constitution, however, \u201cdoes not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof.... Rather, taken as a whole, the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>tions [must] correctly convey the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\u201d <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 5[, 114 S.Ct. at 1243, 127 L.Ed.2d at 590] (upholding reasonable doubt instruction as constitutionally sound despite troublesome language, because after examining instruction in its entirety, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt) (quoting <em>Holland v.

Aside from the troublesome use of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d <em>see Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 16[, 114 S.Ct. at 1248, 127 L.Ed.2d at 596-97], the instruction lacks the curative language present in <em>Victor </em>that would permit us to overlook the problematic language of \u201cconvincing grounds of probability.\u201d Looking for context to the words immediately surrounding the problematic language in the instruction, we find no words explaining or refining the phrase \u201ca convincing ground of probability\u201d that give some assurance that the jury understood the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as requiring more than a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201cprobability.\u201d <em>See Himple, </em>101 Md.App. at 582-83, 647 A.2d at 1242. That error alone renders the instruction constitutionally deficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Majority op. at 253-54, 22 A.3d at 858-59 (footnote omitted). For good measure, the Majority opinion cites also the omission of the phrase \u201cwithout reservation,\u201d which although \u201cnot alone fatal,\u201d supports the taken inference that there is a reasonable likelihood the jury employed a standard of proof lower than reasonable doubt. Majority op. at 253-54, 22 A.3d at 858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">II. The Majority Opinion\u2019s Tunnel Vision</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">A. <em>Victor </em>Should Not Be Set Aside So Easily</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Although the use of problematic phrases is not encouraged, their presence may not warrant a new trial if the surrounding context ensures that a jury will apply correctly the concept of reasonable doubt. <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 20, 114 S.Ct. at 1250, 127 L.Ed.2d at 599 (\u201c[A]ny ambiguity ... is removed by reading the phrase in context....\u201d). This is the case particularly when the instruction provides \u201can alternative definition of reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Although the Majority opinion employs the phrase \u201ctaken as a whole\u201d in numerous instances, it seems to derive from <em>Victor </em>that a flawed instruction may be remedied only by curative language immediately preceding or following the flawed portion of the instruction. Majority op. at 254, 22 A.3d at 858 (\u201cLooking for context to the words immediately surrounding the problematic language in the instruction, we find no words explaining or refining the phrase \u2018a convincing ground of probability\u2019.... That error <em>alone </em>renders the instruction constitutionally deficient.\u201d (emphasis added) (citation omitted)). The Supreme Court in <em>Victor, </em>however, did not evaluate only the language in nearest proximity to the troublesome passage, but \u201cthe rest of the instruction given in [the] case,\u201d which \u201clends content to the [subject] phrase.\u201d <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 14, 114 S.Ct. at 1247, 127 L.Ed.2d at 596. In the final analysis, the <em>Victor </em>Court was persuaded by the fact that, within the instruction (but not immediately before or after the pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>language), the trial judge provided an \u201calternative definition of reasonable doubt: a doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act.\u201d <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 20, 114 S.Ct. at 1250, 127 L.Ed.2d at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In the present case, there is language present both immediately following the problematic phrase, as well as earlier in the instruction, that mitigates the presence of the principal problematic phrase. Indeed, the words \u201c \u2018to a moral certainty\u2019 ... mean ... a certainty based upon convincing grounds of probability\u201d were flanked by sufficiently curative language, such that any concern over misinterpretation or misconception was dispelled. Immediately following the phrase \u201cconvincing grounds of probability,\u201d the trial court provided an alternative definition of the applicable standard, explaining that: \u201cThe phrase \u2018beyond all reasonable doubt\u2019 does not mean beyond <em>any </em>doubt or <em>all possible </em>doubt. But[,] as the words indicate, beyond a doubt that is reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis added); <em>see Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 5, 114 S.Ct. at 1242-43, 127 L.Ed.2d at 590 (upholding a flawed instruction because, taken together, the instruction did not convey to the jury \u201cthat the doubt must be anything but a reasonable one\u201d). This language requires that the jury maintain an appropriate sense of what is \u201creasonable\u201d in evaluating the case. The phrases \u201cbeyond any doubt\u201d and \u201cbeyond ... all possible doubt\u201d indicate to the jury that the standard of proof is high, and that it be convinced beyond most doubts\u2014that is, all reasonable doubts\u2014before convicting Savoy. It is not likely that a jury would overlook these remonstrances and misinterpret the instructions as calling for \u201canything but\u201d a personal and moral satisfaction of any reasonable doubts before finding guilt. <em>See Wills, </em>329 Md. at 382-83, 620 A.2d at 301 (1993) (explaining that \u201c[o]ur opinions have refrained from adopting a boiler plate explanation of reasonable doubt\u201d and that \u201cthe explanation should ... bring home to the jury clearly that ... the [guilt] of the accused must be proved <em>beyond </em>a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Any possibility that the jury interpreted unconstitutionally the reasonable doubt instruction as given is extinguished when it is viewed as a whole, rather than a series of isolated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>dissected phrases and sentences. Upon issuing the instruction, the trial court first informed the jury that Savoy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtH\">comes into court clothed with the presumption of innocence, which remains with him from the beginning to the end of the trial as though it were testified to and supported by evidence that the defendant is innocent. The burden of proving the defendant guilty is upon the prosecution from the beginning to the end of the trial for every element of the crime charged. The defendant has no burden to sustain and does not have to prove his innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Imbued with this knowledge, the jury would interpret properly the phrase \u201cconvincing grounds of probability.\u201d Anything less than a moral conviction\u2014close to, but not necessarily an absolute or mathematical certainty\u2014is insufficient to rebuff the defendant\u2019s presumed innocence. Stated another way, before evaluating the evidence, the defendant stands as innocent. To make a finding of guilt, the jury must travel the entire probability spectrum until it arrives, convinced, at the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">B. <em>Himple </em>Is Flawed Fatally</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The <em>Victor </em>Court\u2019s explication of the importance of a holistic review of reasonable doubt jury instructions predates <em>Himple. See Victor </em>(decided 22 March 1994); <em>Himple </em>(decided 28 September 1994). Yet, the <em>Himple </em>Court failed to take <em>Victor </em>into account. In its opinion, the <em>Himple </em>Court referenced only a small portion of the subject instruction there\u2014honing in narrowly on two problematic phrases in the instruction while disregarding the rest. Nevertheless, despite its suspect value given this omission, <em>Himple </em>becomes the Majority\u2019s mainstay in order to conclude that the phrase \u201cconvincing grounds of probability\u201d erased all of the qualifying and explanatory instructions the jury heard previously and thereafter, such that the problematic phrase stood alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">C. <em>Cage</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">In <em>Cage, </em>the trial court had informed the jury that a reasonable doubt is- an \u201cactual substantial doubt,\u201d one that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>gives rise to a \u201cgrave uncertainty....\u201d <em>Cage, </em>498 U.S. at 40, 111 S.Ct. at 329, 112 L.Ed.2d at 342. The instruction in <em>Cage </em>stands in stark contrast to the instruction in the present case. Undoubtedly, the phrase \u201cconvincing grounds of probability\u201d is not the most accurate description of the reasonable doubt standard and, taken in isolation, may produce an instructional shortcoming. Unlike <em>Cage, </em>however, the phrase here was not so immediately severe and misleading, was prefaced with a contextual instruction about the presumed innocence of the defendant (i.e., the starting point of any jury deliberations), and was followed by an alternate definition of the standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The trial court here did not suggest that, to acquit, the jury must possess an actual substantial doubt or a grave uncertainty; rather, the trial court stated clearly that Savoy was, by dint of legal entitlement, innocent at all times during the trial, and that the jury must acquit if the State\u2019s evidence does not address all those doubts that are reasonable or produce a certainty that, while not necessarily mathematical or absolute in nature, is personally and morally satisfying. (\u201c[I]f you feel that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty all of the evidence necessary to convict, then you must acquit the defendant.\u201d) Such contextual and curative language, absent in <em>Cage, </em>ensured that the instruction in the present case conveyed properly the \u201cevidentiary certainty,\u201d <em>See Cage, </em>498 U.S. at 41, 111 S.Ct. at 330, 112 L.Ed.2d at 342, required to convict Savoy, allowing a finding of guilty only upon a degree of proof <em>beyond a reasonable doubt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">While the reasonable doubt standard is \u201can ancient and honored aspect of our criminal justice system,\u201d it \u201cdefies easy explication.\u201d <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 5, 114 S.Ct. at 1242, 127 L.Ed.2d. at 590. The U.S. Constitution \u201cdoes not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the judiciary is charged with preventing \u201cagainst dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Taylor v.

Although there was error in the subject jury instruction, it was not plain and material, given the fact that the instruction, taken as a whole, conveyed adequately the reasonable doubt standard to the jury. Accordingly, Petitioner should not be granted a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. In the Majority opinion's eyes, the sentence should have read: The test of reasonable doubt is that the evidence that the State produced must be so convincing that it would enable you to act on an important piece of business in your every day life <em>without reservation.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. Not all errors in a reasonable doubt jury instruction constitute constitutional deficiency. <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 5, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 1242-43, 127 L.Ed.2d 583, 590 (1994). The above standard determines which reasonable doubt errors are eligible for discretionary review as constitutionally deficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">. Because the Majority opinion decided that the error was constitutionally deficient, it was able to determine, as a matter of rote, that the error was also structural in nature, such that a harmless error analysis was inapposite. Majority op. at 247, 22 A.3d at 854 (\"If ... we determine that the reasonable doubt instruction was constitutionally deficient, then the error is structural and defies analysis by harmless error standards.\u201d). A constitutional deficiency is classified as a structural error because it affects the entire trial process. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, 331-32 (1991). An inadequate jury instruction \"necessarily renderfs] a trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Rose v. Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 3106, 92 L.Ed.2d 460, 470 (1986). Therefore, prejudice against the defendant is presumed and reversal of the conviction is mandated. <em>See Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 310, 111 S.Ct. at 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d at 331 (stating that a criminal trial cannot accurately determine guilt or innocence if there is a structural error present).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Structural error is distinct from a \"trial error,\u201d which is evaluated using the harmless error standard: the defendant must prove prejudice, then the severity of the error is quantified to determine whether a new trial ought to be granted. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 307-08, 111 S.Ct. at 1263-64, 113 L.E.2d. at 329-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
