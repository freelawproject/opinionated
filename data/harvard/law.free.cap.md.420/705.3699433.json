We shall hold that admission of the alibi notice was error, and an abuse of discretion, and the error was not harmless. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">On August 9, 2007, Respondent Perry Simms, a/k/a Perry Sims,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was charged by indictment with the June 30, 2007 murder of Paul Cornish as well as various weapons charges. Pursuant to the notification requirement in Md. Rule 4-263(d)(3) (2007),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s defense counsel filed a timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Notice of Alibi Witnesses on February 5, 2008, some six months before the August 2008 trial date. The notice listed the names and addresses of eleven individuals. Prior to admission, the notice was redacted so that it showed only the name and address of Sims\u2019s father, Perry Simms, Sr. Respondent elected a trial by jury. At trial, the State proffered to the trial judge that the alibi notice was relevant evidence because it showed Sims\u2019s consciousness of guilt in the commission of the underlying offenses. The trial judge reasoned that the notice was probative evidence of guilt when considered in conjunction with jailhouse phone calls in which the defendant and other callers referred to people who could vouch for the defendant\u2019s whereabouts on the night of the incident. The notice was admitted into evidence by the State, during its case-in-chief, through the testimony of a police officer involved in the investigation. Consequently, the notice was submitted to the jury along with transcripts of the admitted jailhouse phone calls. A Baltimore City jury convicted Respondent of manslaughter and two weapons charges. Respondent then filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial because the \u201ccircuit court erred or abused its discretion\u201d by admitting, over objections, a redacted copy of the alibi notice and that error \u201cwas not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Simms v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 285, 307, 327, 4 A.3d 72, 85, 96 (2010). The State petitioned for <em>certiorari, </em>asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>1. Where the plain language of the alibi-notice rule does not indicate that such notices are inadmissible as a matter of law, did the Court of Special Appeals err in determining that the trial court erred in admitting the alibi notice, where Sims\u2019s defense at trial was a <em>de facto </em>alibi defense, Sims never withdrew his alibi notice, the alibi notice was redacted to eliminate all names but one, and recordings of jailhouse telephone conversations supported an inference that the alibi notice was willfully false as to one person because that person was in a different city at the time of the charged offenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in concluding that the alibi notice was not admissible, where an inference that the alibi notice was willfully false as to one person because that person was in a different city at the time of the charged offenses was not the only possible inference based on the record in this case? [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We granted the State\u2019s petition. <em>State v. Simms, </em>417 Md. 384, 10 A.3d 199 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Perry Sims was arrested on July 13, 2007 in connection with a shooting death that occurred at approximately 9:00 p.m. on June 30, 2007. Sims waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave a statement to Detective Diaz, in which he indicated that on the date of the crime, he was at his mother\u2019s house with his mother and two brothers until about 11 p.m. when he \u201cwent up Douglas projects.\u201d The statement, which was played for the jury, also indicated that Sims told Detective Diaz that \u201csomeone named Tim\u201d had been shot that day, but Sims denied shooting anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">While Sims was in custody pending his trial date, the State recorded several telephone conversations between Sims, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>mother, his friend, and others. As discussed below, three of those phone calls were played for the jury at trial and transcripts of the calls were sent into the jury deliberation room. The defense attorney objected when the State offered for admission into evidence the three recorded telephone conversations, as well as the alibi witness disclosure list. The Court of Special Appeals summarized the following colloquy between the court and the parties concerning admissibility of the alibi notice and the jailhouse phone calls:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">In connection with the ruling on the admissibility of the recorded telephone conversations, the [trial] court also discussed the defense\u2019s alibi notice. The prosecutor advised the court that the defense had disclosed a list of \u201cabout 10\u201d alibi witnesses, and that, in one of the recorded telephone conversations, [Sims] referred to about twenty people who saw him at a party. Referring to the alibi notice, the [trial] court asked: \u201cAre you going to put that into evidence?\u201d The court then said: \u201c[I]f the alibi statement sounds to be probative, [defense counsel is] the agent of the defendant, so it\u2019s admissible against him....\u201d The [trial] court also said to the prosecutor: \u201c[Y]ou should put the filing into evidence so that you can argue it to the jury.\u201d The following ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuS\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would have an objection to that and ask for an opportunity to be heard\u2014 THE COURT: You\u2019ll be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:\u2014on that collateral issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">THE COURT: All right. But if\u2014-well, why don\u2019t you tell me now. Why shouldn\u2019t your alibi statement\u2014you\u2019re the agent of the defendant, why wouldn\u2019t that come in? [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the Defense has no burden to put any defense on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">And the State bringing up the Defense\u2019s attorney filing a notice of alibi witnesses, shifts the burden that my client then has to rebut.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">THE COURT: Let me put on my Defense attorney hat for a minute. ... [The defense attorney is] not bound to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>put on an alibi defense. ... She [i.e., the defense] just has to give you warning. ... And suppose she as a careful lawyer says, all right, I better file [the alibi notice] so I have the option of using it and decides not to do it. Then what\u2019s the relevance for the State to put it in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AX9\">[PROSECUTOR]: The relevance for the State, whether she puts it in or not, is consciousness of guilt. The State\u2019s argument\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">THE COURT: It could be. But how does that show consciousness of guilt? It\u2019s only consciousness of guilt if it\u2019s false.... The fact that she doesn\u2019t use it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s false.... The fact that she\u2019s not\u2014how do you prove it\u2019s a false alibi.... At least it is an admission by counsel.... I mean counsel could say and the defendant could say, you know, I\u2019ve got these alibi witnesses, but maybe they\u2019ve got criminal records, maybe the jury won\u2019t like them, so I\u2019m going to make a tactical decision not to put them on. And making that tactical decision should not bite them frankly. I only think it comes in if it\u2019s clear the defendant knows that he\u2019s lying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right. What I\u2019m saying is they are putting forth alibi witnesses saying that they were at this party\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">THE COURT: Was there a party to your knowledge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmqK\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay, well, I can\u2019t say that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... There may have been a party. I believe that there might have been\u2014\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">THE COURT: What else you\u2019ve (sic) got that shows that he knows that it\u2019s a false alibi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: All right. On the alibi, and this is during the time that the defendant is on the telephone calls, he\u2019s speaking again to his mother, and then one time also to his father. And in one conversation with his</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>mother, he\u2019s discussing with his mother that they have alibi witnesses, and that the defendant was at his mother\u2019s house because the father and the little brother went out of town____That\u2019s why he came over for his mother\u2019s birthday party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">THE COURT: How do you show it\u2019s [i.e., alibi notice] false and that he knows it\u2019s false?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: By his response to the statement, by the fact that he speaks to his father, by the fact that they say he\u2019s in Myrtle Beach on the phone call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">THE COURT: Okay, you\u2019re telling me there\u2019s a phone call in which the defendant says father and brother were out of town?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Town, right. He\u2019s talking to the mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">THE COURT: And he says they were out of town, and then he lists those two as alibi witnesses .... why it matters is your proffer that there is a subsequent phone call in which he says where he\u2019s going to use two people as alibi witnesses, father and brother I think you said. And did in fact list those two people he knows were not there. Based on that proffer, if I understood you correctly, that there is a subsequent phone conversation in which he says in effect we\u2019ll use father and brother I think that subsequently helps to pull this one in.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] ... So let me hear from [defense counsel]. What do you want to tell us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... The speaker who\u2019s not institutionalized [i.e., Sims\u2019s mother] says \u201cbecause you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>came home, because you\u2019re staying with your father, and your father then went out of town, your father and your little brother. That\u2019s why you was over here with me.\u201d ... But where it indicates that the father and the little brother were out of town. I mean where\u2019s the impeachment portion of that?....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">THE COURT: Okay. I hear you, but I think it\u2019s enough to let it in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The telephone recording that the State played first was of a conversation between [Sims] and his mother on July 31, 2007. The following excerpt is relevant (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af1\">[SIMS]: ... Ma\u2019 [sic] I just need everybody, Ma\u2019, that you can get Ma\u2019, (unintelligible)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">[SIMS]: And vouch for me and say the same shit, see what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: Yeah I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">[SIMS]: I told them that you know my hair was all over my head, you done my hair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: Uhhuh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">[SIMS]: You see what I\u2019m saying from at um what\u2014you start doing my hair like seven o\u2019clock but the party started at six. I been there ever since that morning. You feel me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-13\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-14\">[SIMS]: (inaudible) you already know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: Because you came home, because <em>you was staying with your father and your father and them went out of </em>town\u2014your father and your little <em>brother\u2014that [sic] why you was over here with me.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8e\">[SIMS]: Okay. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-16\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: On my birthday that\u2019s the way it went.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-17\">[SIMS]: Uh huh. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying right, and all, and everybody Aunt Lisa everybody you see what I\u2019m saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: Uh huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">[SIMS]: See what I\u2019m saying\u2014vouch for me\u2014everybody that was at that party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">[SIMS]: As long as I have at least about seven people, I\u2019m good Ma\u2019 [sic] I know you can get that, you hear me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">[SIMS\u2019S MOTHER]: I know baby and I know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">The State next played a telephone conversation between [Sims] and his mother on July 15, 2007. [Sims] told his mother that \u201cthey saying I supposed to did that at 10:10.\u201d He also said that at \u201c10:10 Ma and I ain\u2019t leave, I ain\u2019t leave outside really about up Douglas until like 11 o\u2019clock any mu [sic], any way, you see what I\u2019m saying. You did my hair and everything, my hair was all over my head, come on now, Ma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">The third recording concerned a telephone conversation between [Sims] and Tim on July 18, 2007. [Sims] stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">Right\u2014So they\u2014man\u2014they ain\u2019t got nothing on me, man, they ain\u2019t got nothing, man. All it is, somebody, somebody snitching on me, though, (unintelligible). One of them ... got mad and start (unintelligible). (Unintelligible) when I get my motions and all that, you feel me? ... Right, right, right, right. Somebody ratting hard, you hear me, something terrible.....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">During the phone call, Tim indicated that he was with a \u201ccouple\u201d of other people, and [Sims] asked Tim to put one of those persons on the phone. [Sims] told that individual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-15\">I got alibis and everything, saying I was at the house the whole time, feel me, this and that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-16\">Yo, you know the whole time, the thing was suppose [sic] to went down my mother birthday, you hear me, so where as though I gotta like 20, 25 people already signed papers and everything saying I was in the house whole time, man. You feel me?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>The State showed [its witness, investigating police officer] Detective Diaz State\u2019s Exhibit No. 30, which was a redacted version of the alibi notice that [Sims\u2019s] attorney had submitted on February 5, 2008. As noted, the alibi notice initially contained the names of eleven alibi witnesses. The redacted version contained only the name of appellant\u2019s father, and was in the form of a pleading, signed by appellant\u2019s attorney. Captioned \u201cNOTICE OF ALIBI WITNESS,\u201d it stated: \u201cPursuant to Maryland Rules of Procedure, 4-263(d)(3), Defendant is disclosing the name and address of the following witness:\u201d The Notice listed \u201cPerry Simms, Sr.\u201d along with his address.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: During the investigation and approaching the trial date in this case, did there come a time that you received any documentation relating to Notice of an Alibi Witness on behalf of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASk\">[DETECTIVE DIAZ]: Yes ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: When you received the document that I\u2019m showing you, State\u2019s 30, does that document\u2014what it that\u2014what is the name on State\u2019s 30 that was disclosed on behalf of the defendant as an alibi witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">THE COURT: Basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Defense counsel sought to incorporate her earlier arguments. At the bench, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Your Honor, my objection is that the document [i.e., the redacted alibi notice], in and of itself, is tantamount to a pleading.... It\u2019s not evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">THE COURT: Pleadings can be if there are admissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But they\u2019re\u2014it\u2019s prepared by counsel, it\u2019s not....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">THE COURT: It\u2019s an agent of a defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That\u2019s correct and I just want it placed on the record so the Court knows. As I indicated previously, Mr. Sims was represented by another attorney. I picked up his case after [he] had been charged, had his indictment, had been arraigned. I did not enter my appearance in this case until January and as his attorney I felt duty bound to turn over whatever information I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">THE COURT: Understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And it\u2019s not necessarily proper to assume the information I had came from the defendant and entering this Notice of Alibi Witness into evidence, I believe creates that aura that it came from him.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">THE COURT: On a personal level, I\u2019m sympathetic ... but I, as I understand the law, an emaciate [sic] pleading can be an admission and when you enter into a pleading on his behalf, it is\u2014can be an admission against him. The record should reflect that Exhibit 30 has been redacted so that only one name of the, I don\u2019t know, dozen that you submitted, is going to the jury and the reason and that one name is Perry Simms, Senior\u2014. * * * [A]nd the only reason I\u2019m letting it in is because of the taped conversation which he says his father was out of town. I would not let in other names for all kinds of reasons so your objection\u2019s noted, appreciated, overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The testimony resumed, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: [W]hose name was provided as an alibi witness on behalf of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">[DETECTIVE DIAZ]: I received Senior, Perry Simms, Senior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The State then offered State\u2019s Exhibit 30 into evidence. [Defense counsel] again objected, the court again overruled the objection, and the redacted alibi notice was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">After the prosecution rested, appellant rested. He did not testify or call any defense witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The court and counsel discussed jury instructions, initially in chambers and then on the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In terms of argument as to the issue of alibi witnesses, the court limited the State to arguing only about appellant\u2019s mother and father.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Immediately before giving \u201cformal instructions on the law,\u201d the court announced to the jury a \u201cpreliminary instruction on the evidence.\u201d It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">Ladies and gentlemen, there w[ere] some tapes played for you recently during the trial. And there w[ere] some references there to potential alibi witnesses, and I want to tell you to strike from your mind any references about alibi witnesses except as the testimony concerned the defendant\u2019s father and mother. Other than father and mother, you should strike it from the record and do not consider it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">In closing, defense counsel argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">Mr. Simms gave a statement to Detective Diaz, and he told him I wasn\u2019t there. Not self defense. I had a gun, you had a gun, there are witnesses, weapons, two of them, one of me. He never said it was self defense. He said I wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t me. Were you listening? It has nothing to do with self defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 298-306, 4 A.3d at 79-84 (footnotes in original) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The trial judge accepted the State\u2019s argument that the redacted notice was probative on the issue of defendant\u2019s \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> when coupled with the phone calls implicating a false alibi. The notice was admitted during the direct examination of Detective Diaz, a State\u2019s witness, and circulated to the jury. At trial, the defense did not call an alibi witness, it did not assert in its opening statement that the defendant had an alibi, and it did not request an alibi jury instruction. The defense did explicitly refer to the alibi notice in its closing argument asserting that the State could have investigated the alibi witness but chose not to and the defense chose not to put him on the stand. The court did not give an alibi instruction or a \u201cfalse exculpatory statement instruction,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> even though it suggested an example of the latter to the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">I. Admissibility of the Redacted Alibi Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">At trial, the State proffered that the alibi notice, when considered in conjunction with three admitted jailhouse phone calls, was admissible because it showed Sims\u2019s \u201cconsciousness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>of guilt,\u201d i.e., it was circumstantial evidence of his complicity in the criminal offenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Before the Court of Special Appeals, the State asserted alternative reasons to uphold the admission of the notice, including: use of the notice to impeach the defendant; use as a party admission; use to counter the defendant\u2019s <em>de facto </em>alibi defense; and use because the defendant did not withdraw the notice. Regarding the \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d theory, the Court of Special Appeals held that the redacted alibi notice was inadmissible at trial because \u201cthe State\u2019s theory of falsity was not clear from the evidence.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 316, 4 A.3d at 90. Particularly, the intermediate appellate court determined that because the \u201cevidence that [Sims\u2019s] father was out of town arguably supported [Sims\u2019s] alibi....

State, </em>140 Md.App. 1, 30, 779 A.2d 1004, 1020 (2001). A criminal defendant may choose to present an alibi defense in order to controvert the State\u2019s evidence of criminal agency, i.e., that the defendant was at the place and time that the criminal incident occurred. <em>See Grandison v. State, </em>390 Md. 412, 439, 889 A.2d 366, 382 (2005) (noting that \u201calibi negates criminal agency\u201d) (quoting <em>Borchardt v. State, </em>367 Md. 91, 786 A.2d 631 (2001)). A defendant may also be entitled to a jury instruction on alibi, even if he, himself, does not generate the issue of an alibi at trial. <em>See Robertson v. State, </em>112 Md.App. 366, 382, 685 A.2d 805, 810 (1996) (noting that an alibi defense is not an affirmative defense and \u201cthe defendant, himself, need not introduce alibi evidence in order to generate the basis for an instruction on the issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>In Maryland, as in \u201cthe federal system and more than forty states,\u201d a defendant must \u201cgive advance notice of his [or her] intent to raise an alibi defense.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 308, 4 A.3d at 85 (quoting Wayne R.

State, </em>295 Md. 376, 456 A.2d 29 (1983), we recognized that the requirement of advance notice of potential alibi witnesses to the State serves four purposes, including: preventing surprise; deterring false alibis because the State can investigate the witnesses prior to trial; avoiding delay because meritorious alibis warrant dismissal and the opportunity for pre-trial investigation avoids continuances; and affording more respect to the alibis actually presented at trial. <em>Taliaferro, </em>295 Md. at 385-86, 456 A.2d at 34-35 (affirming the trial judge\u2019s decision to exclude an alibi witness not disclosed pretrial) (quoting Epstein, <em>Advance Notice of Alibi, 55 </em>J.Crim. L., Criminology &amp; Police Sci. 29, 31-32 (1964)). An alibi notice is, in fact, a tool of discovery that is unique to criminal cases and the beneficiary of the required rule is clearly the State. <em>Accord Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 313-314, 4 A.3d at 88 (\u201cWe agree with [Sims] that \u2018introducing an alibi notice against a non-testifying defendant who calls no witnesses impermissibly converts a discovery tool into a means of extracting admissions\u2019 from a defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Petitioner asserts that this case presents an exceptional circumstance because a generally inadmissible alibi notice should be admissible \u201cwhere there is evidence that an alibi notice is willfully false, and the defendant did not affirmatively act to withdraw the notice ... particularly when the defendant presents a <em>de facto </em>alibi defense.\u201d Respondent counters that evidence of the alibi notice was not legally relevant to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>lish the underlying crime because inferences other than intentional falsity of the notice could be drawn, for instance that the witness could have confirmed the Respondent\u2019s whereabouts the night of the incident. Additionally, Respondent argues that any probative value of the redacted notice was outweighed by the risk that the notice shifted the burden of proof to Sims to present an alibi defense. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, this Court has not previously addressed the permissible use of alibi notices during criminal trials, and the notice rule, itself, is silent as to admissibility. <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 311, 4 A.3d at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">B.

While trial judges are vested with discretion in weighing relevancy in light of unfairness or efficiency considerations, trial judges do not have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence. <em>See Pearson v.

In <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md. v.

Thus, we must consider first, whether the evidence is legally relevant, and, if relevant, then whether the evidence is inadmissible because its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, or other countervailing concerns as outlined in Maryland Rule 5-403. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>372 Md. 342, 350, 812 A.2d 1050, 1055 (2002) <em>(Thomas I) </em>(\u201cThe fundamental test in assessing admissibility is relevance.\u201d).

Speaking specifically to the issue of relevancy, we have also stated that \u201c[a]pplying our accepted test of relevancy, \u2018guilty behavior should be admissible to prove guilt if we can say that the fact that the accused behaved in a particular way renders more probable the fact of [his or her] guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas I, </em>372 Md. at 352, 812 A.2d at 1056 (quoting Andrew Palmer, <em>Guilt and the Consciousness of Guilt: The Use of Lies, Flight and Other \u2018Guilty Behavior\u2019 in the Investigation and Prosecution of Crimes, </em>21 Melb.

Thus, the relevance of the alibi notice depends upon whether the conduct of naming Sims\u2019s father as a potential alibi witness makes Sims\u2019s guilt of the murder and related weapons charges more probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The record indicates that the trial judge first asserted that \u201cthe alibi statement sounds to be probative ... so it\u2019s admissible against him.\u201d Upon objection by defense counsel, the trial judge then pressed the State\u2019s Attorney to show \u201cwhat\u2019s the relevance for the State to put it in?\u201d The State responded that \u201c[t]he relevance for the State, whether she puts [the alibi defense] in or not, is consciousness of guilt.\u201d The judge responded, \u201c[fit\u2019s only consciousness of guilt if it\u2019s false.... The fact that [defense counsel] doesn\u2019t use it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s false.\u201d The judge then asked the State to identify evidence that the \u201cdefendant knows that it\u2019s a false alibi.\u201d Upon the State\u2019s description of how particular proffered jailhouse phone calls suggest that the defendant listed a potential alibi witness who was identified during the phone call as being out of town at the pertinent time, the judge concluded \u201cI see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>why it\u2019s probative. And if you connect it up with a later phone call where the father and brother are out of town, and he says he knows they\u2019re out of town.\u201d Apparently, the trial judge assumed that the alibi notice was relevant to the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">It is true that relevance is generally a low bar, but it is a legal requirement nonetheless. We have described relevance by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">To be relevant, it is not necessary that evidence of this nature conclusively establish guilt. The proper inquiry is whether the evidence <em>could </em>support an inference that the defendant\u2019s conduct demonstrates a consciousness of guilt. If so, the evidence is relevant and generally admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Als\"><em>Thomas v. State, </em>897 Md. 557, 577, 919 A.2d 49, 61 (2007) <em>(Thomas </em>II) (quoting <em>Thomas v. State, </em>168 Md.App. 682, 712, 899 A.2d 170, 188 (2006)) (emphasis in original) (internal citations omitted). The redacted alibi notice was, in fact, not relevant because it did not \u201c \u2018render[ ] more probable the fact of [Sims\u2019s] guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas I, </em>372 Md. at 352, 812 A.2d at 1056. The State has not indicated which \u201cfact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\u201d is arguably made \u201cmore or less probable\u201d by admission of the notice into evidence. In our view, the State, in effect, manufactured an issue in the case, i.e., it presented defendant\u2019s potential alibi defense prospectively, and then introduced evidence to undermine the credibility of the defense. The strategy might have been potentially appropriate in a rebuttal case after the defendant\u2019s actual testimony and use of his alibi, but it was not appropriate here where the defendant did not testify or introduce any evidence to support an alibi defense. The Maryland Rules require that a criminal defendant file a Notice of Alibi Witnesses in order to preserve the right to present alibi witnesses that may negate the State\u2019s evidence linking the defendant to the time and place of the alleged crime. In a criminal case, the State is not permitted to use the defendant\u2019s compliance with the mandatory notice requirement as affirmative evidence of guilt or to prove the crimes charged. Thus, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>judge erred in determining that the notice was admissible relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">D. The Insufficient Probative Value of the Redacted Alibi Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Even if the notice was relevant to the ultimate question of guilt, which we hold it was not because it did not render Sims\u2019s guilty conscience more probable, the trial judge had the discretion to bar the evidence because it was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant and misleading to the jury. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-403 (\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d). We have reversed convictions where alleged \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d evidence was erroneously admitted. <em>See, e.g., Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 668, 566 A.2d 111, 115 (1989) (holding that \u201cpossession of the wire is so equivocal ... its admission into evidence was more prejudicial to Bedford than probative of an intent to escape and should have been excluded.\u201d); <em>Thomas I, </em>372 Md. at 357-58, 812 A.2d at 1058-59 (holding that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting evidence of defendant\u2019s refusal to give the police a blood sample where there was no connection between the consciousness of guilt evidence and guilt of the crime charged); <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 596, 762 A.2d 125, 134 (2000) (holding that evidence that the defendant had not contacted the police who were investigating his wife\u2019s murder was inadmissible because it was \u201ctoo ambiguous and equivocal\u201d as evidence of consciousness of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Because \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d evidence can be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant, we have outlined the manner by which a trial judge should employ discretion when considering the admissibility of such evidence. For instance, in <em>Bedford </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">The authorities are uniform that evidence of a consciousness of guilt is generally circumstantial and should be more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>probative on the issue of ultimate guilt than prejudicial to the defendant. McCormick, [McCormick on] Evidence \u00a7 271 [ (3d. ed. 1984) ]; <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. If the judge finds that the proposed material is likely to lead a reasonable jury to infer the defendant\u2019s guilt without causing him substantial prejudice, then the judge may allow the jury to consider the evidence in reaching a verdict as to the charged offense. If, however, the inference as to ultimate guilt is weak and the circumstantial evidence merely tends to create in the minds of jurors the impression that the defendant is of questionable character and has a propensity for bad acts and probably acted accordingly on the charged occasion, then the evidence should be excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><em>Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 667-68, 566 A.2d at 115 (holding that it was reversible error to admit into evidence a four inch wire that prison guards discovered during a strip search in order to show that Bedford had attempted to escape from custody). We have, additionally, prescribed a four-prong test to guide review of the probative value of the evidence, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">the probative value of the evidence \u2018depends upon the degree of confidence with which four inferences can be drawn: (1) from the defendant\u2019s behavior to flight; (2) from the flight to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt of the crime charged.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\"><em>Decker, </em>408 Md. at 642, 971 A.2d at 275 (quoting <em>Thomas I, </em>372 Md. at 352, 812 A.2d at 1056-57) (adopting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s test in <em>United States v. Myers, </em>550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir.1977)) (finding all four sub-inferences supported by evidence and, so, the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence of defendant\u2019s \u201cdeparture from the courthouse on the previously scheduled trial date was relevant evidence\u201d); <em>see also Snyder, </em>361 Md. at 596, 762 A.2d at 134 (noting that the inference of consciousness of guilt requires four sub-inferences, which must all have evidentiary support). For instance, in <em>Thomas I, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he jury should not have been permitted to draw an inference of guilt from petitioner\u2019s conduct unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>conduct was related to the murder investigation. Because there is no evidence connecting petitioner\u2019s refusal to allow the officers to draw his blood and a consciousness of guilt of the murder ... the evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct lacks probative value and was inadmissible.\u201d <em>Thomas I, </em>372 Md. at 358, 812 A.2d at 1059 (reversing defendant\u2019s conviction and remanding for a new trial, which was conducted and the second conviction affirmed upon satisfaction of all four prongs in <em>Thomas </em>II).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Based on the <em>Myers </em>test, adopted in <em>Thomas I </em>and subsequently applied in <em>Decker, </em>the probative value, and attendant admissibility, of the redacted alibi notice as circumstantial evidence of Sims\u2019s guilt of the crimes charged depends on whether the following four inferences can be drawn: (1) from his conduct naming his father as a potential alibi witness, a desire to invoke a false alibi defense; (2) from a desire to invoke a false alibi defense, a consciousness of guilt; (3) from a consciousness of guilt, a consciousness of guilt of the murder of Paul Cornish; and (4) from a consciousness of guilt of the murder of Paul Cornish, actual guilt of the murder and related weapons charges. <em>See e.g., Decker, </em>408 Md. at 642, 971 A.2d at 275 (applying these four factors to evidence of flight from prosecution); <em>Thomas I, </em>372 Md. at 356, 812 A.2d at 1058 (applying the four factors to evidence of refusal to take a blood test and holding that third inference was lacking); <em>Thomas II, </em>397 Md. at 576-77, 919 A.2d at 60-61 (applying the four factors as in <em>Thomas I </em>but finding all four factors satisfied); <em>Snyder, </em>361 Md. at 596, 762 A.2d at 134 (applying similar factors to evidence that the husband of the murdered wife failed to inquire about the progress of the investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In <em>Myers, </em>the Fifth Circuit determined that a flight instruction should not have been given because the first and third inferences could not be reasonably drawn. In that case, a defendant challenged a jury instruction that addressed evidence of intentional flight subsequent to a crime and instructed the jury that they could consider whether such evidence indicated a consciousness of guilt as well as how much significance such conduct had on the ultimate question of guilt for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>the crime alleged. The defendant argued that \u201cthe district court erred in instructing the jury concerning the proper use of evidence indicating that he fled from FBI agents on two occasions [once in Florida, the other time in California] subsequent to the commission of the robbery\u201d in Florida. <em>Myers, </em>550 F.2d at 1048. The first inference could not be drawn because the allegedly guilty conduct, i.e., the flight from federal agents, was \u201cwithout support in the record\u201d and \u201cfor a jury to find that Myers fled from federal agents prior to his arrest in California would require conjecture and speculation.\u201d <em>Myers, </em>550 F.2d at 1049-50 (noting that the only evidence of flight was presented by one of the arresting officers but that the officer\u2019s testimony was \u201cinconclusive\u201d). The third inference could not be reasonably drawn because \u201cthe hypothesis that he fled solely because he felt guilty about [a similar but separate, alleged crime] cannot be ruled out.\u201d <em>Myers, </em>550 F.2d at 1050 (holding that because Myers allegedly committed two bank robberies, the first in Florida and subsequent robbery in Pennsylvania, but was charged with only the Florida robbery at the time that he allegedly fled, \u201cno inference that he is guilty of the Florida robbery [and not just the Pennsylvania robbery] is possible\u201d). Because \u201cthe hypothesis that he fled solely because he felt guilty about the Pennsylvania robbery [could not] be ruled out[,]\u201d the court determined it was error to instruct the jury that they could draw an inference of guilt for the Florida robbery from the flight evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Similarly here, the redacted alibi notice was \u201ctoo ambiguous and equivocal\u201d to support the inferences connecting Sims\u2019s pre-trial conduct to the actual crimes. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, the notice and phone calls may support inferences other than an intent to create false exculpatory evidence because \u201c[Sims\u2019s] identification of his father as an alibi witness was not inconsistent with his pretrial claim that he was not at the scene of the shooting!,]\u201d and \u201cevidence that [Sims\u2019s] father was out of town arguably supported [Sims\u2019s] alibi.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 317, 4 A.3d at 90. In our view, a redacted alibi notice is not analogous to other types of admissible \u201cconscious<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>ness of guilt\u201d evidence such as, \u201cflight after a crime, escape from confinement, use of a false name, and destruction or concealment of evidence.\u201d <em>Decker, </em>408 Md. at 640, 971 A.2d at 274 (quoting <em>Thomas I, </em>372 Md. at 351, 812 A.2d at 1055) (citing <em>Sorrell v. State, </em>315 Md. 224, 228, 554 A.2d 352, 354 (1989)). Any inference of consciousness of guilt requires a presumption that Sims intentionally falsified the notice and supplied the name of his father so that it could be added to the list, and that the phone call to his mother unequivocally shows that the father would have been unable to testify as an alibi witness. This chain involves the kind of speculation that removes the notice from the sphere of circumstantial evidence that we have previously allowed as probative evidence of guilty behavior. <em>Cf.

In <em>Snyder, </em>we held that the lack of inquiry evidence produced \u201cassumptions and speculations [that] lack[ed] probative value\u201d and that the State had not produced evidence linking the failure to inquire specifically to the consciousness of guilt of the defendant. <em>Snyder, </em>361 Md. at 596, 762 A.2d at 134. Here, we hold that the \u201cinference as to ultimate guilt is weak and the circumstantial evidence merely tends to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>in the minds of jurors the impression that the defendant is of questionable character and has a propensity for bad acts and probably acted accordingly on the charged occasion,\u201d and as such the evidence should have been excluded. <em>Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 668, 566 A.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Even if the alibi notice was relevant to the ultimate question of guilt, which we hold it was not because it did not render Sims\u2019s guilt more probable, its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-403. We do not know why Sims did not present an alibi defense, and the answer, at any rate, would be inconsequential because a defendant is under no compulsion to testify or to defend his innocence. <em>See Brogden v. State, </em>384 Md. 631, 649, 866 A.2d 129, 139 (2005) (\u201c[Pjetitioner did not put on any evidence at trial in his defense\u2014he merely relied on a presumption of innocence, which he unquestionably is entitled to do.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u201cThat no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Md. Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cA person may not be compelled to testify in violation of his privilege against self incrimination.\u201d). Moreover, because the evidence was not properly admitted, it was not incumbent upon Sims to refute the State\u2019s assertion that his alibi notice indicated guilt of the underlying crimes. <em>Cf. Decker, </em>408 Md. at 648, 971 A.2d at 278 (concluding that Defendant \u201coffered no evidence at trial to refute the inference that he fled the courthouse on the previous trial date to avoid prosecution\u201d) (citing <em>Thomas II, </em>397 Md. at 578, 919 A.2d at 62 (noting that defendant \u201chad the opportunity at trial to offer alternative theories explaining his resistance to the blood test, and the record is completely devoid of any such evidence.\u201d)); <em>accord Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 315, 901 A.2d 208, 222 (2006) (stating that if defendant can present an innocent explanation for the conduct that \u201cdoes not risk prejudicing the jury against him,\u201d he is expected to do so). The admission of the alibi notice into evidence unfairly prejudiced the defendant by inviting the jury to speculate that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>concocted a false alibi in order to conceal his guilt of the alleged crimes and the only party to generate the issue of alibi in the case was the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">II. Petitioner\u2019s Alternative Grounds for Admissibility of the Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Petitioner maintains, alternatively, that the notice was admissible because Respondent presented a <em>de facto </em>alibi defense when defense counsel\u2019s closing argument referred to Sims\u2019s prior exculpatory statement given to Detective Diaz. Defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">Mr. Simms gave a statement to Detective Diaz, and he told him I wasn\u2019t there. Not self defense. I had a gun, you had a gun, here are witnesses, weapons, two of them, one of me. He never said it was self defense. He said I wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t me. Were you listening? It has nothing to do with self defense.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected this argument, and so shall we. <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 316, 4 A.3d at 90. (rejecting \u201cthe State\u2019s contention that it was entitled to use the alibi notice because Sims is the one who \u2018essentially\u2019 put forth an alibi defense, notwithstanding his failure to present a defense case.\u201d). Defense counsel did not refer to an alibi during her opening statement to the jury, the defendant did not testify, nor did he call any witnesses or present any evidence on his behalf. Certainly, the defendant is entitled to respond to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>State\u2019s evidence in its closing argument. <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 380, 969 A.2d 989, 996-97 (2009) (quoting <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707, 714 (1974) (describing the wide range afforded counsel in closing argument)). Defense counsel\u2019s reference to Sims\u2019s pre-trial statement to Detective Diaz, along with the closing argument, did not, as the State asserts, \u201cmanifest!] a commitment to [Sims\u2019s] alibi defense ... well after the State introduced the evidence.\u201d The State introduced Sims\u2019s statement to Detective Diaz in order to lay a foundation for admission of the redacted alibi notice and to support its theory of falsity and consciousness of guilt. Subsequently, in our view, defense counsel attempted to negate the potential inference by the jury that either the defendant lied about having an alibi because he did not present an alibi defense or, as is more likely given the entirety of the statement, to refute the suggestion that the defendant was relying on a self-defense argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The State argues that the fact of mentioning the pretrial statement made by Sims to Detective Diaz commits Sims to a <em>de facto </em>alibi defense, which in turn justifies the State\u2019s admission of the alibi notice. The Court of Special Appeals pierced the State\u2019s reasoning stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">In effect, the State\u2019s argument is tantamount to bootstrapping. It relies on evidence it introduced against [Sims] to establish its claim that [Sims] had an alibi defense, and it then argued that it was entitled to refute that defense by use of [Sims]\u2019s pretrial alibi notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\"><em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 317-18, 4 A.3d at 91. The State may not manufacture evidence. The State may not commit the defendant to an alibi defense and then imply that because the alibi is untenable, i.e., false, that the defendant must be guilty of the underlying crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Additionally, the Court of Special Appeals recognized that \u201cthe \u2018debate\u2019 concerning use of an alibi notice for impeachment \u2018is not implicated here,\u2019 because [Sims] never testified nor called any witnesses.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>313, 4 A.3d at 88. In this Court, as in the Court of Special Appeals, the State advances an argument that it did not make at trial, which is that the purpose of the allegedly false alibi notice was to impeach Sims\u2019s statement to Detective Diaz that he was not present at the time and place of the crime. \u201cThe purpose of impeachment evidence is not to establish guilt, but to attack the credibility of a witness who has offered detrimental testimony.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>342 Md. 230, 242, 674 A.2d 944, 950 (1996); <em>see also Bradley v. State, </em>333 Md. 593, 605-06, 636 A.2d 999, 1005 (1994) (\u201cImpeachment\u201d is \u201ca shield\u201d that \u201cprotects a party from unfavorable testimony,\u201d not \u201ca sword to place otherwise inadmissible evidence before the jury\u201d). Sims did not testify, nor did his exculpatory statement to the police following his arrest convert him into a State\u2019s witness. Thus, the State is not entitled to assert that the alibi notice was offered to impeach Sims\u2019s statement to Detective Diaz. <em>See Spence v. State, </em>321 Md. 526, 531-32, 583 A.2d 715, 717-18 (1991) (holding that the State may not introduce testimony solely to impeach it).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Finally, the State has argued that the Court of Special Appeals erred in rejecting its contention that because Sims did not withdraw his alibi notice it was admissible evidence. <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 318, 4 A.3d at 91. The State has mentioned numerous jurisdictions that bar admission of an alibi notice if the notice has been withdrawn. Most of those jurisdictions appear to have adopted Fed. R. Crim. 12.1(f), which states: \u201cEvidence of an intention to rely on an alibi defense, later withdrawn, or of a statement made in connection with that intention, is not, in any civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the person who gave notice of the intention.\u201d Additionally, the State has cited three states, Maine, New Mexico, and North Carolina, which, it asserts, bar admission of alibi notices outright. The State argues that \u201c[b]y failing to take into account whether Sims withdrew his notice, the Court of Special Appeals effectively adopted one of the most restrictive alibi-notice-admissibility rules in the country.\u201d The purpose and function of an alibi defense, however, would be compromised were we to hold that in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>preclude admission of a notice into evidence, a defendant is required to withdraw it before or during trial. The defendant\u2019s right to raise an alibi defense is preserved throughout the trial because, \u201clike any other defense testimony, [it] is simply a means of controverting the State\u2019s effort to establish criminal agency.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 450, 459, 316 A.2d 268 (1974). Thus, the fact that the notice was not withdrawn has no bearing on the issue of admissibility in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">III. Harmless Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial judge\u2019s error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because \u201cthe strength of the State\u2019s case was not so overwhelming as to render the error inconsequential^]\u201d and because the court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard all references to alibi witnesses except as to Sims\u2019s mother and father \u201chighlight[ed] [Sims\u2019s] failure to pursue his alibi defense by calling his parents to explain his whereabouts.\u201d <em>Simms, </em>194 Md.App. at 323, 326-27, 4 A.3d at 94, 96. Taking issue with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding, Petitioner contends that any error in admitting the redacted notice was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because: \u201cthe redacted alibi notice in this case contained very little information\u2014just Sims\u2019s father\u2019s name and address[;] ... Sims never withdrew the noticef;] ... the prosecutor made no mention of the alibi notice in closing, and made clear that Sims had no burden[;] ... the record contained other evidence showing consciousness of guilt\u2014Detective Diaz\u2019s testimony highlighting the differences between his interview of Sims and the jailhouse telephone calls[;] ... [and] [t]he evidence of guilt was strong.\u201d Respondent counters that Petitioner\u2019s burden to show that the error was harmless has not been met because the \u201cState\u2019s evidence against Mr. Sims was very thin\u201d and essentially \u201cthe trial was a swearing match\u201d between conflicting eyewitnesses where the State \u201casked the jury to fully credit the witness who testified that Mr. Sims did <em>not </em>resemble the shooter (Mr. Thompson), while asking the jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>question the credibility of the witnesses who identified Mr. Sims (the Hugginses).\u201d Further, Respondent argues that the alibi notice \u201ctook the form of a pleading, with the name of the trial court on the top, the caption listing the case title just below that, and the signature of Mr. Sims\u2019s counsel at the bottom[,]\u201d and that \u201cthe document went to the jury room, where it served as a tangible reminder that Mr. Sims had disclosed a possible alibi defense but elected not to present it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), we explored the fundamental purpose and constitutional basis for the harmless error test and, then, concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMI\">when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\"><em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678; <em>accord Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011); <em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 4 A.3d 976 (2010); <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 941 A.2d 1107 (2008); <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 837 A.2d 944 (2003). Accordingly, the burden rests upon the \u201cbeneficiary of error ... to demonstrate ... that such error did not contribute to the conviction[.]\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 658-59, 350 A.2d 665; <em>see also Dove, </em>415 Md. at 743, 4 A.3d at 985 (noting that the standard \u201cis highly favorable to the defendant,\u201d and \u201c \u2018the burden is on the State to show that [the error] was harmless\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 658-59, 837 A.2d at 952).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">As in <em>Dorsey, </em>\u201c[a]pplying [the harmless error] test to the facts of this case, upon our own independent review of the entire record, we are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that\u201d the admission and subsequent presentation of the redacted alibi notice to the jury, \u201cwhich posited before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>jury\u201d the implication that the defendant lied about having an alibi, thus possessed a guilty mind, and consequently was guilty of the crimes charged, \u201cby evidence irrelevant and extraneous to the issue of the [defendant\u2019s] guilt or innocence, did not contribute to the guilty verdict returned against [Sims].\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678 (holding that admission of a detective\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s arrest-conviction record was not harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The State offered the redacted alibi notice to show that Sims \u201cconcocted a false alibi,\u201d as circumstantial evidence that he had committed the alleged offenses. The notice identified Sims\u2019s father, by name and address, as a potential alibi witness. Additional information in the disclosure document, such as \u201cdate, time, and specific location\u201d of alibis, would not make a defendant\u2019s assertion that he has an alibi more or less probable. The redacted alibi notice was entered into evidence for consideration by the jury. While the prosecutor\u2019s failure to further discuss the document might imply that the jurors were less likely to be influenced by the document, this cannot be the test. If the test for jury impact was based only on what the attorneys said during closing arguments, prosecutors could protect wrongful convictions based on inadmissible evidence by avoiding direct reference to any possibly offending evidence during closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The State\u2019s argument that other consciousness of guilt evidence renders the alibi notice cumulative is not persuasive. We recently discussed cumulative evidence under the harmless error standard in <em>Dove, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">Evidence is cumulative when, beyond a reasonable doubt, we are convinced that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence, independent of the [evidence] complained of, to support the appellant\u2019s] conviction[ ].\u201d <em>Richardson v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 334, 343, 255 A.2d 463, 468 (1969). In other words, cumulative evidence tends to prove the same point as other evidence presented during the trial or sentencing hearing. For example, witness testimony is cumulative when it repeats the testimony of other witnesses introduced during the State\u2019s case-in-chief. <em>See Hutchinson [v. State </em>], 406 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Md. [219,] 227-28, 958 A.2d [284,] 288-89 [ (2008) ] (holding that improperly admitted expert testimony was not cumulative when the testimony \u201cdid not repeat the testimony of any of the prior witnesses introduced during the State\u2019s case-in-chief\u2019 and the testimony asserted that the victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with her description of the incident). \u201cThe essence of this test is the determination whether the cumulative effect of the properly admitted evidence so outweighs the prejudicial nature of the evidence erroneously admitted that there is no reasonable possibility that the decision of the finder of fact would have been different had the tainted evidence been excluded.\u201d <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 674, 350 A.2d 680, 687 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. at 743-44, 4 A.3d at 985-86. In this case, we cannot say that the alibi notice was sufficiently cumulative so as to not impact the jury. A juror might reasonably conclude from the recorded conversations between Sims and his mother that Sims was merely looking for alibis, not falsely manufacturing them. Even Sims\u2019s statement to an acquaintance, \u201cI gotta like 20, 25 people already signed papers and everything saying I was in the house the whole time,\u201d is of a different quality than a prepared and filed document listing the name and address of an alibi witness who is never called to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Furthermore, the trial judge referred to the tape-recorded telephone conversations, as well as the \u201creferences to potential alibi witnesses\u201d and explicitly directed the jurors that they should \u201cstrike from [their] mind[s] any references about alibi witnesses except as the testimony concerned the defendant\u2019s father and mother. Other than father and mother, you should strike it from the record and do not consider it.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s exhortation raises the \u201creasonable possibility that the evidence ... may have contributed to the rendition of a guilty verdictf,]\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. Accordingly, the admission of the alibi notice into evidence was reversible error and the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

See footnote 2 for text of Rule 4-263(e)(4), which is the current version of the alibi notice rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\">. Defense counsel also explicitly mentioned the alibi notice in closing argument stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-10\">The State wants to point to the fact that Mr. Simms\u2014that I filed a notice saying that Mr. [Perry] Simms[, Sr.]\u2014notifying the State was a potential alibi witness. And that in his phone call talking to his mother, his mother says your father and your brother were out of town. She wants to direct you to that as if it has some meaning. If it had some meaning, you tell me why this detective whose job it is to investigate this case never spoke to the man. He doesn\u2019t know whether or not that man could testify [to or about] anything with regard to his gun. It could be that he spoke to his son and doesn't know what time it was. And I chose not to put him up there to say that. We don\u2019t know what it is because he didn\u2019t bother to ask and neither did she.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
