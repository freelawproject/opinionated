Prior to trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, C&amp;M successfully moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude Strub from introducing expert testimony that C&amp;M either owed or breached a statutory duty of care to Nocar pursuant either to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 <em>et seq. </em>(2006) (\u201cOSHA\u201d) or the Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Act, Md.Code (1991 Repl.Vol., 2006 Supp.), \u00a7 5-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cMOSHA\u201d). C&amp;M moved to preclude that testimony on the theory that it did not owe a statutory duty to Nocar because he was not its employee. Strub contended, however, that C&amp;M was obligated to protect its own employees as well as the employees of other subcontractors from a fall hazard created by stairwell openings in floors that C&amp;M built. Additionally, at the close of all the evidence, C&amp;M moved for judgment asserting that the evidence showed that Nocar assumed the risk of his fatal injury and was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. The trial judge denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury. The jury determined that C&amp;M was not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial judge erred in precluding expert testimony regarding particular MOSHA and OSHA regulations because as a \u201ccreating employer\u201d C&amp;M owed a duty to Nocar to comply with MOSHA. <em>Strub v. C &amp; M, </em>198 Md.App. 1, 22, 996 A.2d 399, 412 (2010). Additionally, the intermediate appellate court held that the case was properly submitted to the jury and could not have been resolved on C &amp; M\u2019s motion for judgment. <em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 27-28, 996 A.2d at 415. We granted certiorari to consider two issues raised by C &amp; M:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals correctly hold that an employer owes a duty under MOSHA to provide a safe workplace to a person who is not his employee after the employer has left the worksite and has no control over worksite conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals correctly hold that where a person is aware of an obvious risk of falling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>and voluntarily exposes himself to that risk, and falls to his death, that the inability to show how he fell makes assumption of the risk a question of fact for the jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQk\"><em>C &amp; M v. Strub, </em>415 Md. 607, 4 A.3d 512 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We hold that C&amp;M did not owe a duty of care to Nocar pursuant to MOSHA, and, therefore, regulations promulgated under MOSHA were inadmissible as evidence of the standard of care. In addition, we hold that the decedent assumed the risk of injury, as a matter of law, and, therefore, the trial judge erred in failing to grant Petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct reinstatement of the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The following evidence was presented at trial. In the spring of 2006, C&amp;M entered into an oral contract with Bayside Builders, Inc. (\u201cBayside\u201d) a general contractor, to finish framing what was to be a three story row house in Baltimore City, Maryland. As a subcontractor, C&amp;M agreed to complete the framing work, which included framing the walls on the first floor and constructing the flooring, roof and walls for the second and third floors. When C&amp;M arrived at the worksite, the first floor had been framed by Bayside and contained a rectangular 7 j\u00e9\u2019 x 2 j\u00e9\u2019 opening in the first floor above the basement that was not covered or guarded. C &amp; M\u2019s contract required it to create, and it did create, the same size openings in the second and third floors, so that a staircase system could be installed by the staircase subcontractor, who was scheduled to perform its work when C&amp;M finished its framing responsibilities. C&amp;M used the openings to move plywood, sheathing, lumber and other framing materials between the floors and the roof. The C&amp;M workers built temporary ladders out of 2\" x 4\" lumber that were nailed at the top side rail into each opening in order to move workers and materials between floors. On approximately May 5, 2006, C&amp;M finished the framing work, so the workers removed the ladders and put them in a trash pile on the site and covered up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the basement and first floor window openings with plywood. C&amp;M workers agreed not to cover the stairwell openings before leaving the site because Bayside, who inspected and approved the work, wanted the openings left uncovered for its staircase subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Three weeks later, on May 24, 2006, Bayside entered into a contract with Comfort Masters Cooling and Heating, Inc. (\u201cComfort Masters\u201d), an HVAC subcontractor, to provide and install all HVAC equipment and duct work for the property. Even though the staircases had not yet been installed, Bayside and Comfort Masters agreed that the HVAC work would proceed, i.e., before the staircase sub-contractor began its work. On May 26, 2006, Nocar and two other Comfort Masters\u2019s employees, Joshua Tudor (another sheet metal mechanic) and Andrew Pfarr (a helper), arrived at the property to begin the HVAC work. When the Comfort Masters\u2019s employees arrived the property was not as C &amp; M had left it: the ladders had been reclaimed from the trash and one had been nailed into the third floor opening, the front door was open, and windows that had been covered with plywood were uncovered and open. Comfort Masters\u2019s employees worked for the next three hours inside the row house, climbing up and down the ladders numerous times, through each of the three stairwell openings, carrying tools, duct work and other materials between floors.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Nocar was alone on the third floor of the row house at the time of his fatal accident. Tudor testified at trial that he had been working with Nocar on the third floor prior to the accident, but they could not complete the work required because they had neglected to bring all of the necessary parts with them. Therefore, Tudor climbed back down to the second floor to do work there, but, Nocar remained on the third floor. Tudor explained the accident as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">A. [Nocar] yelled down to hand up a ladder. I said, \u201cOkay. Hang on one minute,\u201d because I was\u2014it only took me a minute to finish what I was doing. So in the meantime, I was\u2014I was facing the wall. And in the meantime, he stuck his head down the hole, he leaned down in the hole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>like this, and he said, \u201cOh. You (sic) using it. Never mind\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, you can either take a break for a minute, because I\u2019m only going to be a minute, or you take it and I\u2019ll take a break for a minute.\u201d And he said\u2014do I say exactly what he said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">Q. Yep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">A. He said, \u201cFuck it. I\u2019ll just climb the bitch.\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, be careful. Don\u2019t do nothing to get yourself hurt.\u201d And he said\u2014the last words that he said to me was, \u201cAt least you care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">Q. How long after that did you realize an accident had happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">A. Well, maybe about three or four minutes later, I heard the strangest noise I never heard before.... So I started walking over toward the stairwell opening.... And that\u2019s when I look (sic) down and saw Wayne [Nocar].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">Q. At the time you heard this and looked, where was the ladder that had been on the second floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">A. Dangling over top of the stairwell opening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">Q. And was anybody on the third floor besides Mr. Nocar? A. Nobody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Tudor also stated in his testimony, that Nocar was \u201cthe only one that could have\u201d removed the nail holding the ladder in place between the second and third floors and pulled the ladder up to the third floor because he (Tudor) did not do it and their third colleague was on the first floor attending to another task. Tudor testified that the \u201cladder was leaning right where the return box was supposed to go[,]\u201d and that even after they had discussed that they could wait until they had all the required materials, Nocar had \u201ccut a hole in the return box.\u201d Tudor stated that \u201c[Nocar] leaned [the ladder] across the hole up against the metal stud. And the metal studs are not made for structural [support]. So when he leaned on it, it bent and tipped the ladder.\u201d Nocar fell approximately 26 feet from the third floor into the basement of the row house sustaining fatal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>At trial, Respondent also sought to present evidence, through the testimony of its expert witness, a civil engineer, Brent Leisenring, that C&amp;M violated MOSHA and OSHA regulations that require holes to be guarded and covered at a worksite when any other workers will be foreseeably exposed to them. In a letter to Petitioner\u2019s counsel, Respondent asserted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">Mr. Leisenring is expected to testify, to a reasonable degree of probability, that the Defendants, who each had a hand in the construction of the basement floor and the three floors of the house, should have either ensured that the floor openings should have been covered or had hand rails that were at least 42\" high. The OSHA regulations in reference to the floor openings that were applicable are 1926 (501)(b)(4)(i) and (502)(l)(2)(3)(4)(i), which required floor coverings over the stairwell openings and further requires them to be \u201csecured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In his deposition, Leisenring testified that C&amp;M was the \u201ccreating employer\u201d pursuant to the \u201cMulti-employer Work-site Citation Policy,\u201d discussed <em>infra, </em>and, therefore, that C &amp; M owed a duty of care to Nocar. Petitioner, however, moved to preclude that testimony on the grounds that the general duties and fall protection standards established by MOSHA and OSHA are owed by an employer only to its employees and that C&amp;M was not Nocar\u2019s employer, nor did it have any control or presence on the worksite at the time of Nocar\u2019s fatal accident. The trial judge held that Respondent would not be permitted to present expert testimony that C&amp;M owed Nocar a statutory duty under MOSHA or OSHA to have covered the stairwell openings. The trial judge did permit expert testimony that in not covering the stairwells there was evidence of \u201cnegligence based on industry standards[,]\u201d but did not permit testimony that there was \u201ca legal duty owed.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Leisenring testified that C&amp;M created the openings in the floors and did not cover them, which violated industry standards and was the cause of Nocar\u2019s death. Additionally, Leisenring testified that it was \u201cpredictable\u201d that other workers would be present at the worksite and that it was the general practice in the industry to guard openings to protect others.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">At the conclusion of the evidence, Petitioner moved for judgment and argued that Nocar assumed the risk of injury and was contributorily negligent because he utilized the makeshift ladder inappropriately in close proximity to the stairwell opening in order to work on a task which his colleagues had already decided could not be completed without obtaining other materials. The trial judge denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of C &amp; M finding no negligence on its part in Nocar\u2019s death. Additional facts are supplied <em>infra </em>as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">At trial, the judge granted C &amp; M\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>precluding Strub\u2019s expert witness from testifying that C&amp;M had violated MOSHA or OSHA standards and that such violations caused Nocar\u2019s fatal injury. The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial judge\u2019s ruling was erroneous. <em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 22, 996 A.2d at 412. Petitioner appeals the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding that \u201c[t]he [Circuit [Cjourt erred in precluding all testimony regarding OSHA or MOSHA [regulations] because C &amp; M, as an employer that created the openings in the stairwells, exposed its own employees to the hazard and left them unguarded, in violation of MOSHA, could be liable under MOSHA for its violation and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>thus, owed Strub (sic) [Nocar] a duty to maintain a safe workplace.... \u201d <em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 22, 996 A.2d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">We have held that the admissibility of expert testimony is generally within the discretion of the trial judge, but when a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is based \u201con a pure conclusion of law\u201d we review for legal correctness. <em>Hall v. UMMS, </em>398 Md. 67, 82-83, 919 A.2d 1177, 1186 (2007) (quoting Be<em>rn-Shaw Ltd. Partnership v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>377 Md. 277, 291, 833 A.2d 502, 510 (2003)) (\u201cIf \u2018the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a pure legal question, we generally review the trial court\u2019s ruling [for legal correctness].\u2019 \u201d); <em>see Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 17 A.3d 676 (2011) (\u201cWhile the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s factual finding that an item of evidence does or does not have \u201cprobative value,\u201d the [legal correctness] standard of review is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not \u201cof consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d). Thus, we review the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling on C &amp; M\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>for legal correctness because it \u201cinvolve[d] a pure legal question,\u201d i.e., whether expert testimony pertaining to C &amp; M\u2019s violations of MOSHA standards at the construction site was legally relevant to the negligence claim arising out of Nocar\u2019s fatality.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">It is undisputed that Nocar was not an employee of C&amp;M, thus the general duty provisions of MOSHA, \u00a7 5-104(a) and \u00a7 654(a)(1) do not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Special Appeals was incorrect in concluding that C&amp;M owed Nocar a \u201cduty to maintain a safe workplace\u201d because that is a general duty that, by statute, runs only to an employer\u2019s own employees. Rather, the ultimate question is whether the specific duty clauses of MOSHA, \u00a7 5\u2014104(b), and OSHA, \u00a7 654(a)(2), applied as between C &amp; M and Nocar, a non-employee, so that C &amp; M\u2019s violations of state or federal construction regulations would be admissible evidence of negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Federal courts have concluded that OSHA, \u00a7 654(a)(2) \u201ccreates a specific duty to comply with standards for the good of all employees on a multi-employer worksite[,]\u201d therefore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>specific duty extends to a more general class than the general duty to provide a safe environment, which extends only to employees. <em>Solis v. Summit Contractors. Inc., </em>558 F.3d 815, 818 (8th Cir.2009) and cases cited therein. The Federal Secretary of Labor, who is charged with enforcing OSHA, has implemented a citation policy, \u201cthe multiple-employer worksite doctrine,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which, as discussed <em>infra, </em>places a limitation on the seemingly broad scope of OSHA \u00a7 654(a)(2). For example, in federal cases interpreting the administrative application of the doctrine, \u201ccreating employers\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are held to owe a duty to non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>employees where there is evidence of responsibility or duty to maintain, and where it is feasible that the employer would be in a position to remedy the hazard. <em>See e.g., Brennan v. OSHRC, </em>513 F.2d 1032, 1037-39 (2d Cir.1975) (holding that a subcontractor on a high-rise project was liable for violations of OSHA regulations where it <em>\u201ccreated </em>the hazards and <em>maintained the area </em>in which they were located.... It had <em>control over the areas </em>in which the hazards were located and the <em>duty to maintain </em>those areas,\u201d where only persons that were non-employees were threatened by the hazards.).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Petitioner contends that it was not a \u201ccreating employer\u201d according to the \u201cmulti-employer worksite doctrine,\u201d as interpreted by federal and Maryland cases, so the trial judge properly excluded testimony about the statutes or regulations. Respondent asks that we affirm that C&amp;M was a \u201ccreating employer,\u201d and, therefore, was in violation of the specific duty clauses of MOSHA and OSHA. Accordingly, Respondent asserts that we should affirm the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding that Respondent\u2019s expert witness should have been allowed to testify \u201cabout MOSHA requirements and whether the conditions of the construction site would have constituted a violation.\u201d <em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 22, 996 A.2d at 412. Contrary to the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, we do not adopt the \u201ccreating employer\u201d citation policy of the \u201cmultiemployer worksite doctrine\u201d as the legal duty owed by C &amp; M to Nocar in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Consequently, the OSHA and MOSHA regulations were not admissible to establish the standard of care in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In essence, MOSHA regulations should only have been introduced as evidence of a statutory duty if Nocar fell within the class of persons meant to be protected by the statute and the injury was one that the statute was designed to prevent. It is a well-established principle of common law that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">a plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence by showing: \u2018(a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"><em>Allen v. Dackman, </em>413 Md. 132, 143-44, 991 A.2d 1216, 1222-23 (2010) (quoting <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty, </em>378 Md. 70, 79, 835 A.2d 616, 621 (2003)); <em>Pendleton v. State, </em>398 Md. 447, 466, 921 A.2d 196, 208 (2007) (quoting <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 831 A.2d 18 (2003), (\u201c[ejvidence of negligence may be established by the breach of a statutory duty.\u201d)). The Court of Special Appeals held that C&amp;M \u201cowed a duty to comply with MOSHA[,]\u201d but clarified that \u201ca violation of MOSHA [does not] automatically give rise to a tort duty[,]\u201d because it is not a punitive statute. <em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 22, 996 A.2d at 412 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>82 Md.App. at 533, 572 A.2d at 1123 (involving a case in which MOSHA and OSHA did not apply \u201cby their own force\u201d and so \u201cParsons\u2019s source of tort liability [did] not stem from a statutory violation.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We know that neither OSHA, nor MOSHA, can be used to establish negligence per se. <em>Solis, </em>558 F.3d at 829 (citing <em>Ries v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1156, 1164-65 (3d Cir.1992)) (holding that \u00a7 653(b)(4) prohibits private causes of action including the use of a violation of an OSHA regulation to establish negligence per se). Statutes, regulations, and industry standards, however, may be admissible as evidence of applicable standards of care. <em>See e.g., Schultz v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>413 Md. 15, 35, 990 A.2d 1078, 1091 (2010) (holding that evidence of the commercial standards applicable to a professional banker should have been introduced through expert testimony in order to establish the standard of care in a negligence case). Indeed, in <em>Brady v. Parsons Co., </em>327 Md. 275, 609 A.2d 297 (1992) this Court noted that \u201calthough evidence of a violation of an OSH or MOSH Act standard may be admissible <em>in an appropriate case </em>to assist the trier of fact in determining whether an employer <em>or one having the duty of an employer </em>was negligent, proof of a violation of such a standard does not establish negligence <em>per se, </em>nor does it ... preclude consideration of the defenses of contributory negligence or assumption of risk.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>327 Md. at 294, 609 A.2d at 306 (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Thus, the admissibility of OSHA and MOSHA standards depends on whether C &amp; M \u201cha[d] the duty of an employer[.]\u201d <em>Brady, </em>327 Md. at 294, 609 A.2d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In this case, the Court of Special Appeals determined that C &amp; M had the duty of an employer because it created the holes in the flooring. <em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 22, 996 A.2d at 412. To reach its holding that Leisenring\u2019s testimony about the statutes should have been admitted, the Court of Special Appeals explicitly adopted and applied the \u201ccreating employer\u201d citation policy to C &amp; M, which it had previously recognized, but did not apply, in <em>Murphy v. Stuart M. Smith, Inc., </em>53 Md.App. 640, 642, 455 A.2d 69, 71 (1983).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By applying \u201ccreating employer\u201d status to C &amp; M, the court extended the reach of any allegedly pertinent MOSHA and OSHA provisions from C &amp; M to Nocar, who was not its employee. In doing so, it agreed with Strub that \u201cthe trial court erred in prohibiting Leisenring from testifying that the open holes in the floor violated MOSHA, under which it owed a duty of care to Nocar.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 11, 996 A.2d at 405 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The \u201ccreating employer\u201d citation policy is a regulatory tool used by the Secretary of Labor to carry out the OSHA enforcement responsibilities against violations of OSHA regulations.

Federal courts, that have \u201cexpressed approval\u201d of the doctrine have held that when a case presents a question of judicial review of an administrative agency action, the federal Secretary of Labor\u2019s application of the \u201ccreating employer\u201d exception may be upheld where there was evidence of maintenance of the area containing the hazard, or control, where the responsible party was the only one who could remedy the hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>For example, in <em>Brennan, </em>the Second Circuit upheld a ruling of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (\u201cOSHRC\u201d) that a subcontractor on a high-rise project was liable for violations of OSHA regulations where it \u201chad <em>control over the areas </em>in which the hazards were located and the <em>duty to maintain </em>those areas[,]\u201d even though only persons that were non-employees were threatened by the hazards, so \u201c[njecessarily it must be responsible for creation of a hazard.\u201d <em>Brennan, </em>518 F.2d at 1039 (emphasis added). In <em>Beatty Equipment Leasing, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>577 F.2d 534, 536, 537 (9th Cir.1978), the Ninth Circuit upheld an administrative ruling finding that a subcontractor \u201ccreated the hazard at the multi-employer construction site by erecting the scaffold and employees of other subcontractors were exposed to the hazard.\u201d The Ninth Circuit bolstered it\u2019s holding in <em>Beatty </em>by distinguishing the offending employer there from one who might not be held hable where \u201cemployees were exposed [to a hazard], but which the subcontractors <em>neither created nor were responsible for </em>pursuant to their contractual duties.\u201d <em>Beatty, </em>577 F.2d at 537 (quoting <em>Anning-Johnson Co. v.

In a case of first impression, the Seventh Circuit held in <em>United States v. Pitt-Des Moines, Inc., </em>168 F.3d 976 (7th Cir.1999) that criminal sanctions could be levied against a subcontractor for willful violations of OSHA regulations, which resulted in the deaths of two non-employees, where the subcontractor \u201ccreated the hazard, and was the only entity on the site that could reasonably have remedied it.\u201d <em>Pitt-Des Moines, </em>168 F.3d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Thus, in federal cases reviewing the administrative adjudication of the application of the Secretary\u2019s enforcement policy, \u201ccreating employers\u201d are held to owe a duty to non-employees where there is evidence of continued presence, responsibility, maintenance, etc. at the worksite.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> C &amp; M does not fit into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>this scheme. The unguarded openings (alleged violations of MOSHA and/or OSHA regulations) in the floors on the second and third stories were undisputably created by C &amp; M, pursuant to their contract, three weeks prior to the arrival of Nocar and the Comfort Masters workcrew. C&amp;M, however, retained no control or oversight at the worksite, and indeed, at the time of the accident, had completely finished its responsibilities under its contract with Bayside and relinquished control of the premises back to Bayside.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It was not contemplated that the scope of Custom Masters\u2019s contract work was related to or dependent on the openings, as was the case in <em>Pitt-Des Moines </em>where the victim\u2019s job was to follow PDM\u2019s crew and \u201cbolt-up the connections they made.\u201d <em>Pitt-Des Moines, </em>168 F.3d at 985. Nor is this case factually similar to <em>Beatty </em>where the subcontractor\u2019s role was to install scaffolding for use by subsequent subcontractors and the scaffolding itself violated applicable regulations. <em>Beatty, </em>577 F.2d at 535. Nor was C&amp;M analogously situated to the subcontractor-defendant in <em>Brennan, </em>where that employer \u201ccreated the hazards and maintained the area ... had control over the areas where the hazards were located and the duty to maintain those areas.\u201d Thus, in our view, it was not legal error for the trial judge to exclude testimony establishing a standard of care under MOSHA and OSHA where evidence that C&amp;M could have been cited for violations of MOSHA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>regulations would be irrelevant to a claim for injuries to an individual to whom the specific duty to comply with the regulations did not exist.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See e.g. Safeco Ins.

Ridgefield Const. Services, Inc., </em>184 Conn. 173, 439 A.2d 954 (1981), the case cited in <em>Murphy </em>as an example of judicial adoption of the \u201ccreating employer\u201d citation policy, does not provide support for imposing liability upon a \u201ccreating employer\u201d in the absence of control and responsibility for maintenance. In <em>Wendland, </em>the Connecticut Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">[W]e follow the approach taken by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the <em>Brennan </em>case. Thus, where an employer is in control of an area and responsible for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>maintenance, as was the case here, a violation occurs if any employees working on the project have access to the hazard. ... Thus in the present case, the defendant [subcontractor] was responsible for complying with applicable excavation regulations. The defendant violated the applicable safety regulations when it failed either to shore up or to cut back to an angle of repose the excavated earthen wall which eventually caved in on the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><em>Wendland, </em>439 A.2d at 956 (footnote omitted) (citing <em>Brennan </em>in which the Second Circuit held that \u201c[i]n a situation where, as here, an employer is in control of an area, and responsible for its maintenance, we hold that to prove a violation of OSHA[,] the Secretary of Labor need only show that a hazard has been committed and that the area of the hazard was accessible to the employees of the cited employer or those of other employers engaged in a common undertaking.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Even though in <em>Murphy </em>and later in <em>Thompson, </em>the intermediate appellate court recognized an employer may be liable under MOSHA (or OSHA) for either creating <em>or </em>controlling a hazard, in both cases liability was ultimately determined by a combination of the two factors. For instance, in <em>Thompson, </em>the Court of Special Appeals stated that BG &amp; E had a duty to a non-employee because it \u201cerected and constructed the hazardous condition and retained actual control over the work area to which it had assigned Thompson.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company v. Thompson, </em>57 Md.App. 642, 651-52, 471 A.2d 768, 773 (1984). Additionally, weighing in favor of assessing liability against BG <em>&amp; </em>E, even though it was technically not Thompson\u2019s employer, were facts indicating that \u201c[Thompson\u2019s] work assignments came from or through BG &amp; E\u2019s foreman and supervisors for fifteen months, from the time he was employed until the time he was injured, although his skills and performances were subject to his employer\u2019s supervision[,]\u201d and that \u201cThompson had no reasonable alternative access supplied by BG &amp; E.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>57 Md.App. at 644, 650, 471 A.2d at 769, 773. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Special Appeals decoupled the creation and control aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the \u201cthird circumstance\u201d first recognized in <em>Murphy, </em>53 Md. App. at 643, 455 A.2d at 71, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">While we agree that C &amp; M did not exercise control in this instance, it was undisputed that C &amp; M did <em>create </em>the hazard when it framed the second and third floors of the row home and left the stairwell openings uncovered and exposed its own employees to the hazard. Liability under these circumstances was recognized in both <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Thompson, </em>but in <em>Thompson, </em>it was the control aspect of the exception that applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\"><em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 21, 996 A.2d at 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Leisenring was proffered as an expert witness to testify that C&amp;M \u201cviolated the OSHA regulations and ANSI safety standards\u2014general safety standards.\u201d Even if C &amp; M \u201ccreated\u201d a hazard that was in violation of a regulation, it did not exercise continuing control, or even a presence, at the work-site at the time of Nocar\u2019s fatal accident. Thus, the facts of this case do not warrant this Court\u2019s adoption or application of the \u201cmulti-employer worksite doctrine\u201d or its \u201ccreating employer\u201d citation policy. Accordingly, the trial court was legally correct in not permitting Respondent\u2019s expert to testify that C&amp;M owed a statutory duty to Nocar, as a \u201ccreating employer,\u201d to comply with MOSHA or OSHA regulations or that C &amp; M\u2019s violation of the regulations caused Nocar\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">At the close of all the evidence, C&amp;M moved for judgment on the grounds that the evidence showed that Nocar assumed the risk of injury as a matter of law and was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. The trial judge was concerned: if \u201cI grant this motion now and I\u2019m wrong, then the case has to be tried completely over. If I deny it and then grant a motion [for judgment notwithstanding the verdict], then they have a verdict.\u201d Accordingly, the trial judge denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment and the case was submitted to the jury, which found that Petitioner was not negligent. Before the Court of Special Appeals, C&amp;M filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>cross-appeal in order to obtain review of the trial judge\u2019s ruling on C &amp; M\u2019s motion for judgment. In that court, Strub contended that whether the decedent assumed the risk was a jury question in \u201call but the clearest cases\u201d because there was no direct evidence regarding how Nocar fell through the hole; therefore, the questions of assumption of risk and contributory negligence could not be resolved as a matter of law. The intermediate appellate court agreed stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">While we agree that there was no evidence presented that Nocar protested to working in and around the openings, we decline to hold that the court erred in submitting the issue to the jury <em>became there was no direct evidence offered by either party of what Nocar was doing when he fell.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">Whether Nocar actually climbed the ladder across to the opening, or whether he obeyed the instruction of his superi- or to wait until after lunch to install the return and fell for some other reason was for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\"><em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 26, 27-28, 996 A.2d at 414, 415 (emphasis added). The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s analysis, therefore, focused on the lack of direct evidence about \u201chow\u201d Nocar fell through the holes in the floors and into the basement. This logistical element of the incident, however, is a not relevant to an assumption of risk analysis, although it might be relevant to a contributory negligence analysis where a voluntary encounter with a known risk might be \u201citself unreasonable.\u201d <em>See BG &amp; E v. Flippo, </em>348 Md. 680, 706, 705 A.2d 1144 (1998) (quoting <em>Warner v. Markoe, </em>171 Md. 351, 359-60, 189 A. 260, 264 (1937) (\u201cContributory negligence defeats recovery because it is a proximate cause of the accident which happens, but assumption of risk defeats recovery because it is a previous abandonment of the right to complain if an accident occurs.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s ruling on C &amp; M\u2019s motion for judgment we consider the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion was made. Md. Rule 2-519 (2011); <em>see Wilkens Square, LLLP v. W.C. Pinkard &amp; Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>419 Md. 173, 18 A.3d 878 (2011); <em>Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc. v. Saville, </em>418 Md. 496, 16 A.3d 159 (2011); <em>Imbraguglio v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, </em>358 Md. 194, 209-10, 747 A.2d 662, 670 (2000) (noting \u201cinasmuch as the only issue is whether [decedent] assumed the risk of injury as a matter of law, our concern is only with the facts most favorable to the Petitioner on that issue\u201d); <em>Nelson v. Carroll, </em>355 Md. 593, 600, 735 A.2d 1096, 1099 (1999); <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 29, 660 A.2d 423, 426, n. 4, (1995). When, as here, a defendant moves for judgment based on an affirmative defense, e.g., assumption of risk, or, as is more common, based on the legal insufficiency of plaintiffs evidence, a trial judge must determine if there is \u201cany evidence, no matter how slight, that is legally sufficient to generate a jury question.\u201d <em>Tate v. Bd. of Educ., </em>155 Md.App. 536, 544-45, 843 A.2d 890, 895-96 (2004) (noting also that \u201c[a]n appellate court reviewing the propriety of a grant or denial of a motion for judgment by a trial judge must conduct the same analysis.\u201d). Therefore, it would have been appropriate, in the instant case, for the trial judge to grant C &amp; M\u2019s motion for judgment founded upon assumption of the risk if all reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in a light most favorable to Strub led to only one logical conclusion, that is that Nocar assumed the risk of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Essentially, Petitioner\u2019s position is that, even if the jury believed that C&amp;M was negligent in causing Nocar\u2019s fatality, as a matter of law, that negligence could not establish C &amp; M\u2019s liability because Nocar assumed the risk of his injuries. C &amp; M contends that Nocar knew, appreciated and voluntarily encountered the risk of falling through the 26 foot deep unguarded hole. Petitioner notes prior Maryland cases where falling through an unguarded hole was recognized as a risk that \u201canyone of adult age must be taken to appreciate\u201d citing <em>ADM v. Martin, </em>348 Md. 84, 91-92, 702 A.2d 730, 734 (1997) and other cases discussed <em>infra. </em>Finally, Petitioner contends that \u201chow\u201d Nocar fell is immaterial to an assumption of the risk claim. Respondent contends, however, that Nocar did not know that the unguarded holes were unsafe because testimony was introduced at trial that the other employees on the site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>did not perceive them as unsafe and that they worked around similar holes all the time. Moreover, citing <em>Thompson, </em>Respondent asserts that any danger that was \u201copen and obvious\u201d danger was \u201cassuaged by his co-worker\u2019s use [of the opening] without constraint or incident.\u201d Finally, Respondent contends that the same result should be reached here as was reached in <em>Imbraguglio </em>where we held that an event that \u201cmay or may not have been expected to occur\u201d was the cause of the fatal injury, and, therefore, as Respondent asserts, because we cannot know how Nocar fell, assumption of the risk could not be resolved as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In our view, assumption of risk was established as a matter of law by the evidence presented during the trial, thus, no determination of liability was required by the factfinder and Petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment, at the close of all the evidence, should have been granted. We have often \u201cstated in earlier cases involving the assumption of the risk defense, \u2018where the facts are not in dispute and the plaintiff intentionally and voluntarily exposed [himself or] herself to a known danger, we will sustain the granting of a summary judgment or the direction of a verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morgan State v. Walker, </em>397 Md. 509, 520-21, 919 A.2d 21, 28 (2007) (quoting <em>ADM, </em>348 Md. at 102, 702 A.2d at 740); <em>American Powerlifting v. Cotillo, </em>401 Md. 658, 663, 934 A.2d 27, 30 (2007) (holding that there was \u201cno genuine issue of material fact\u201d that the plaintiff had \u201cassumed the usual and foreseeable risks\u201d of the sport of weightlifting therefore summary judgment was proper); <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 288-89, 592 A.2d at 1126 (reversing a trial court judgment for a plaintiff when she assumed the risk of her injury as a matter of law); <em>see also Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 422, 226 A.2d at 276 (affirming an order granting a motion to dismiss on the basis of assumption of the risk).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Assumption of the risk \u201cnegates the issue of a defendant\u2019s negligence by virtue of a plaintiffs previous abandonment of his or her right to maintain an action if an accident occurs.\u201d <em>Cotillo, </em>401 Md. at 668, 934 A.2d at 33 (quoting <em>McQuiggan v. Boy Scouts of Am., </em>73 Md.App. 705, 710, 536 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>A.2d 137, 139 (1998)). Thus, when a plaintiff can be shown, through words or conduct, to have expressly or impliedly consented to \u201cvoluntarily proceed to encounter [a known risk] ... as where ... he proceeds to walk over debris on the sidewalk carelessly strewn and left there by a construction contractor. If these are voluntary choices, the plaintiff may be found to have accepted the situation, and consented to relieve the defendant of his duty.\u201d Prosser and Keeton on Torts, \u00a7 68 at 481 (5th ed. 1984). Therefore, questions about the defendant\u2019s duty are irrelevant to an assumption of risk analysis because \u201cany duty the defendant owed the plaintiff to act reasonably for the plaintiff\u2019s safety is superseded by the plaintiffs willingness to take a chance.\u201d <em>Schroyer </em>323 Md. at 282, 592 A.2d at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u201cIn Maryland there are three requirements that the defendant must prove to establish the defense of assumption of the risk: (1) the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk of danger; (2) the plaintiff appreciated that risk; and (3) the plaintiff voluntarily confronted the risk of danger.\u201d <em>Cotillo, </em>401 Md. at 668, 934 A.2d at 33-34. In the instant case, the parties contest whether Nocar knew and appreciated the risk of falling through the unguarded openings at the construction site, and whether the evidence supports an assertion that Nocar confronted involuntarily the risk of a fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We have held that in determining \u201cwhether the plaintiff had the requisite knowledge and appreciation of the risk ... an objective standard\u201d is applied. <em>Cotillo, </em>401 Md. at 668, 934 A.2d at 34 (citing <em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>358 Md. 627, 644, 751 A.2d 481, 490 (2000)); <em>see also Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 514, 919 A.2d at 24 (stating \u201cthe question of voluntariness, in the context of an assumption of the risk analysis, is measured by an objective standard.\u201d). In <em>Cotillo, </em>a weightlifter was held to have \u201cassumed the risk that the spotters may have negligently failed to catch the bar because he knew that type of injury was foreseeable____\u201d <em>Cotillo, </em>401 Md. at 671, 934 A.2d at 35. Additionally, we held that as a professional weightlifter, Cotil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>lo had \u201cdirect knowledge of the inherent risks of powerlifting.\u201d <em>Cotillo, </em>401 Md. at 669, 934 A.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Commentators have noted that there is a subjective and objective aspect to the issue of a plaintiffs knowledge. For instance, professors Prosser and Keeton have stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">The standard to be applied is, in theory at least, a subjective one, geared to the particular plaintiff and his situation, rather than that of the reasonable person of ordinary prudence who appears in contributory negligence.... At the same time, it is evident that a purely subjective standard opens a very wide door for the plaintiff who is willing to testify that he did not know or understand the risk; and there have been a good many cases in which the courts have said in effect that he is not to be believed, so that in effect something of an objective element enters the case, and the standard applied in fact does not always differ greatly from that of the reasonable person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Prosser and Keeton, \u00a7 68 at 487-88 (footnote omitted); and cases cited therein; <em>see also </em>Speiser, Krause &amp; Gans, The American Law of Torts \u00a7 12-53 at 431-33 (2008) (stating \u201c[t]he standard to be applied is a <em>subjective </em>one\u2014what the particular plaintiff, in fact, sees, knows, understands, and appreciates\u2014as distinguished from the objective standard which is applied to contributory negligence.\u201d). This Court has recognized implicitly in prior decisions the subjective undertones to the objective standard of knowledge, for example, in <em>Imbragulio </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">\u2018In determining whether a plaintiff had knowledge and appreciation of the risk, an objective standard must be applied and a <em>plaintijf will not be heard to say that he did not comprehend a risk which must have been obvious to him.\u2019 Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 421, 226 A.2d at 275. Thus, \u201cwhen it is clear that a person of <em>normal intelligence in the position of the plaintijf must have understood the danger, </em>the issue is for the court.\u2019 <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283-84, 592 A.2d at 1123.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Imbraguglio, </em>358 Md. at 213, 747 A.2d at 672 (quoting <em>ADM, </em>348 Md. at 91-92, 702 A.2d at 734). Thus, the party must have known and appreciated the risk either because it is not credible that a similarly situated person would not have done so, or because the risk was so obvious that it could not have been encountered unwittingly.

The three worked for approximately three hours that morning before Nocar\u2019s fall. Throughout the morning, the three worked with only two step ladders, as they had left one behind at the shop. They planned to retrieve a third ladder from the shop on their lunch break.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Tudor testified that, in addition to forgetting a ladder, they had neglected to bring other materials necessary for the installation of a return on the third floor. He testified: \u201cWe had no collars to hook to it. So I told him, I say, Wayne, there\u2019s no sense of putting this return box up just so that we have to take it down in an hour....\u2019\u201d Nocar agreed and Tudor went down to the second floor to begin another project. Tudor testified that soon thereafter Nocar had yelled down to him while he was working on the second floor to bring his ladder up to the third floor. Tudor testified that he told Nocar that he would give him his ladder in a minute after he finished the task he was working on when Nocar \u201cleaned down in the hole ... and said \u2018Oh. You using it. Never mind.\u2019 \u201d Then, according to Tudor, Nocar said \u201cFuck it. I\u2019ll just climb the bitch.\u201d Three or four minutes later, Tudor heard a loud noise and heard Pfarr scream. He walked to the opening of the second floor stairwell and saw the step ladder \u201cdangling over the third floor\u201d and realized that Nocar had fallen from the third floor into the basement. Tudor testified that, based upon the conversation minutes before the fall, he believed that Nocar had pulled the ladder that had been nailed into the stairwell up to the third floor to use it to install the return box on the third floor. He surmised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">The ladder was leaning right where the return box was supposed to go. The ladder was too tall to stand up in the hallway like straight. And the hallway was too narrow for him to fit up there. So what he did is he leaned it across the hole up against the metal stud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">And the metal studs are not made for structural [sic]. So when he leaned on it, it bent and tipped the ladder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2U\">During cross-examination, Tudor explained that he did not know for certain if Nocar fell as a result of positioning the ladder as he had described, but that he thought that he fell in that manner based on the circumstances and his knowledge of the task that Nocar was attempting to complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amh\"><em>Strub, </em>193 Md.App. at 8-9, 996 A.2d at 403-04. In her brief, filed in this Court, Respondent also directs our attention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>statements made by Joshua Tudor during his testimony at trial including: that he had his back to the opening and did not see Nocar fall; that he did not know what Nocar was doing at the time of the accident; that he did not see Nocar pull the ladder up to the third floor; that he did not know if Nocar tripped over a steel box or something else that caused him to fall through the opening; that he did not know if Nocar was on the ladder or just positioning the ladder at the time of the fall; and that when Nocar said he was \u201cgoing to climb it,\u201d Tudor thought that Nocar meant he was \"going to climb onto the roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Even in light of these additional facts, it is clear that Nocar was voluntarily working on the third floor, particularly when he and Tudor had discussed and decided that the work on the third floor could not be completed at that time and, therefore, Tudor descended safely to complete other tasks on the second floor. Moreover, Nocar objectively appreciated the \u201cnature and magnitude of the potential injury\u201d posed by falling through the unguarded openings in the floor because he undisputably poked his head through the third floor opening to communicate with Tudor and cannot be said to have remained unaware that just below him were two similarly sized holes with no guardrails or coverings in place. <em>Cf.

Finally, Nocar knowingly encountered the risk, regardless of whether he was standing on a ladder attempting to prepare the return-box apparatus as was testified by his co-worker or was doing something else, because the holes were an open and obvious hazard and the danger of falling through one or three of them would be foreseeable to a person of normal intelligence.
