State, </em>420 Md. 391, 23 A.3d 223 (2011), we now address whether the statutory provision criminalizing the unlawful possession of a regulated firearm by a convicted felon has a related penalty provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Petitioner, Troy A. Jones, Jr., seeks to overturn his conviction on Count Five of a criminal information filed against him which charged him with the unlawful possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a felony, pursuant to Section 5-133(b) of the Public Safety Article, Maryland Code (2003),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asserting that Section 5-133(b) does not contain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>penalty provision and that the penalty provisions in Sections 5-133(c) and 5-143 of the Public Safety Article do not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>He also asserts, alternatively, that an out-of-state conviction cannot serve as a predicate conviction for a violation of Section 5\u2014133(b) and that the trial judge erred in imposing a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for the violation. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Jones\u2019s conviction and sentence for Count Five,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 45and we granted certiorari, <em>Jones v. State, </em>416 Md. 272, 6 A.3d 904 (2010), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">1. Is there a penalty provision applicable to a violation of Public Safety Article \u00a7 5\u2014133(b), and if not, is a violation of that subsection a crime and does a court have jurisdiction over the charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">2. Can a prior out-of-state conviction serve as the predicate conviction where the State has charged a defendant with possessing a regulated firearm after having been convicted of \u201ca violation classified as a felony in the State\u201d in violation of Public Safety Article \u00a7 5\u2014133(b)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">3. Having found that the trial court erred in imposing the mandatory-minimum, five-year, no-parole penalty applicable to violations of \u00a7 5-133(c) for a violation of \u00a7 5\u2014133(b), did the Court of Special Appeals err by only striking the no-parole condition and failing to vacate the sentence and remand the case for a new sentencing so that the judge could consider imposing a sentence of less than five years?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We shall hold that Section 5-143 of the Public Safety Article serves as the penalty provision for a violation of Section 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>133(b) of that Article. We shall further hold that an out-of-state conviction can serve as a predicate conviction for the purposes of Section 5-133(b). Finally, although we affirm the conviction, we shall hold that the trial judge erred in imposing a <em>mandatory </em>five-year sentence for a violation of Section 5-133(b) and shall remand for a new sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Jones was charged in a criminal information in Case # 207270027 with two drug crimes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also was accused in another criminal information in Case #207270028 with five firearm-related crimes, one of which was Count Five, involving his possession, as a felon, of a handgun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Jones and the State agreed to proceed on an Agreed Statement of Facts as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Count Two, in which he was charged with illegal possession of marijuana in Case # 207270027; Count Four, in which he was charged with illegal possession of a regulated firearm having been convicted of a crime of violence in Case #207270028; and Count Five, the charge with which we are concerned, from Case #207270028, in which the information alleged that: \u201c[Troy A. Jones, Jr.] unlawfully did possess a regulated firearm, to wit: A .25 caliber Lorcin handgun-serial # LT043282 after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime, to wit: 2003-Fairfax County, VA-case # 102485 a violation classified as a felony in this State, in violation of Public Safety Article, Section 5-133(b) of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The Agreed Statement of Facts reflected that Jones admitted he had purchased a handgun after having been convicted of manufacturing cocaine in the Commonwealth of Virginia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax0\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, on July 30, 2007, at approximately 0630 hours in the morning, the Warrant Apprehension Task Force responded to 4200 Eldone Road in Baltimore City, State of Maryland, looking for a wanted person. On arrival, Detective D. Koenigberg, from the Baltimore County Police Department, and other members of the Warrant Apprehension Task\u2014Task Force, knocked on the door and was met by a black female. Detective Koenigberg said that the police were looking for a wanted person and was invited in by the female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">In the back bedroom of the residence, Detective Koenigberg made contact with a black male, later identified as Defendant, Troy A. Smith, Jr. [Troy A. Jones, Jr.][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Detective Koenigberg looked under the bed (indiscernible) a wanted subject and there was a magazine for a firearm. Mr. Smith [Jones] was in the bed\u2014was in the bed\u2014Mr. Smith [Jones] was in the bed of the room with no clothes. Mr. Smith [Jones] attempted to put his shorts on when Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Koenigberg observed a bulge in the right front pocket of his shorts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">Detective Koenigberg grabbed the bulge with his hand and immediately knew it was a gun. Mr. Smith [Jones] stated to Detective Koenigberg that, somebody must have put the gun in my shorts while I slept. Also in the right front pocket of his shorts was a Maryland identification card with a picture of the Defendant and the information of Troy A. Smith [Jones], with a date of birth of 9-13-1982. In the left front pocket of those same shorts, was a plastic sandwich baggie, with 10 smaller zip-loc\u2014zip-loc (indiscernible) red devil baggies, containing a greenish, brown vegetable matter, suspect marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Mr. Smith [Jones] was placed under arrest and transported to the Warrant Apprehension Task Force Office. The gun was described as a .25 caliber, Lucerne handgun, with a serial number of LT043202. The handgun is considered a regulated firearm in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">Also, on July 30th, 2007, Sergeant Steve Gabis of the Baltimore County Police Department assigned Sergeant John Carhart of the Maryland State Police, who are assigned to the joint Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Maryland State Police Gun Tracing Unit, responded to the\u2014to interview Mr. Smith [Jones]. At approximately 0820 hours, Mr. Smith [Jones] was read his Miranda warnings by Sergeant Gabis. Mr. Smith [Jones] stated that he understood his rights and agreed to be interviewed by the sergeants. Mr. Smith [Jones] stated that he was arrested and convicted for manufacturing cocaine in the State of Virginia in the year 2002 and 2000. Sergeant Gabis reviewed Mr. Smith\u2019s [Jones\u2019s] criminal record and found he was convicted of manufacturing, sale and possession of a cultivated substance in Fairfax County, Virginia on 3-24-2003. Mr. Smith [Jones] continued by stating that the handgun that was found, was his and he purchased the handgun from a person\u2014a person in\u2014driving a black Navigator in a bar called, Sedonia Inn. Mr. Smith [Jones] further stated he paid $70 for the firearm. Mr. Smith [Jones] admitted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the marijuana in his shorts was also his, that he bought wholesale from another person. He said the marijuana was for personal use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The Statement of Facts also reflected that the handgun Jones possessed was inoperable and that conviction records from Virginia from 2008 showed that Jones had been convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in Virginia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: The State\u2019s Exhibit No. 2, the State will introduce into evidence [an] Operability Report for the firearm. It is a pistol, semi-automatic, LT25, gray in color, with a barrel length of 2.38 inches and that the firearm was inoperable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">[COUNSEL FOR JONES]: No objection [] as to the report itself, as whether it qualifies as a firearm (indiscernible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: State\u2019s Exhibit No. 3, the State will also enter into evidence, a Sentencing Order from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Criminal Case Number 102485, that on March 21st, 2003, Mr. Jones was convicted of possession of a controlled substance\u2014a controlled drug, with intent to distribute and it is certified, two test copies by the Clerk of Virginia\u2014the Clerk of the Court of Virginia, excuse me. The State will admit that as State\u2019s Exhibit No. 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">If called to testify, the Officers would identify Mr. Smith [Jones] as the person in possession of the gun and the drugs on that date (indiscernible) in Baltimore City, State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Jones\u2019s counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on Count Five arguing that Jones\u2019s out-of-state conviction could not serve as a predicate felony in Maryland, among other issues not relevant here. The judge denied the motion, explaining that the predicate conviction in Virginia met the statute\u2019s requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">[COURT]: [T]he conviction in Virginia is for that which would have been a felony here in Maryland, had the Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>dant been tried here in Maryland. And it would have been the companion or equal charge in Virginia as to the specific possession with intent to distribute charge listed in the statute in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">For those reasons, the Court is going to deny your Motion for Judgment of Acquittal as to the\u2014the charge of possession of a regulated firearm, having been convicted of a disqualifying crime under Public Safety Act 5\u2014138(c)(i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">As to Count Five, the court sentenced Jones to five years\u2019 imprisonment without parole, explaining \u201c[tjhis is a mandatory sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Jones noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and argued that the Circuit Court erred by convicting him of a crime with which he was not charged, convicting him on insufficient evidence, convicting him of a violation which was not a crime, and by giving him an illegal sentence. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Jones\u2019s conviction and sentence in an unreported opinion, reasoning that Jones\u2019s Virginia conviction, coupled with his admission regarding that conviction in the Agreed Statement of Facts, provided sufficient evidence to \u201csupport a finding that he was convicted of manufacturing cocaine in Virginia,\u201d a violation which would constitute a felony in Maryland under Section 5-133(b). The Court of Special Appeals vacated the no-parole condition of Jones\u2019s five-year sentence on Count Five, however, reasoning that \u201ca no-parole penalty is mandated only for a violation of PS \u00a7 5-133(c), not for a violation of PS \u00a7 5\u2014133(b).\u201d Jones, thereafter, filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing that vacatur of the no-parole condition was insufficient to remedy the misapplication of a mandatory sentencing provision, which the intermediate appellate court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">We very recently in <em>Evans v. State, </em>420 Md. 391, 23 A.3d 223 (2011), acknowledged the mandatory relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>between language in a statute criminalizing behavior and a related penalty provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">[Generally, criminal statutes must contain language that criminalizes the forbidden act, as well as a provision that penalizes the behavior.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This proposition, as hornbook law, is succinctly stated by Wayne R. LaFave in the 2010 edition of one of our oft-quoted tomes: \u201c[A] crime is made up of two parts, forbidden conduct and a prescribed penalty. The former without the latter is no crime. The modern criminal penalties are: the death penalty, imprisonment with or without hard labor, and the fine. In many cases the section of the statute that describes the forbidden conduct concludes with a statement of the punishment; or perhaps one section sets forth the forbidden conduct and the next section the punishment.\u201d See <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 438, 450, 639 A.2d 675, 680, 685 (1994), in which we reversed a trial court\u2019s application of a mandatory ten-year penalty for drug offenders that \u201cpreviously [have] been convicted\u201d of similar offenses to an offender who had been convicted of a drug offense after the conviction of the principal offense. In so doing, we relied on the fundamental principle that \u201ccriminal statutes [must] be sufficiently clear and definite to inform a person of ordinary intelligence what conduct is punishable and what the penalty for such conduct might be <em>before </em>the criminal conduct is committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">When a statute, as the instant one, fails to internally contain a penalty provision, its ability to criminalize conduct becomes more complicated. LaFave is of assistance in identifying the spectrum of issues in this regard, including in the first instance, those about which there is \u201clittle difficulty\u201d for a court to determine criminality: \u201cSometimes, however, the statute forbidding the conduct may refer to another statute for the punishment, such as the rather common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>statute providing that whoever commits embezzlement (defining it) shall be punishable as if he committed larceny, with the larceny statute providing for a certain penalty of fine or imprisonment. Another method sometimes encountered is for the statute, after forbidding certain conduct, to conclude \u201cshall be guilty of a felony\u201d (or \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d), without setting forth the penalty; but another catch-all statute provides that one who commits a felony (or a misdemeanor) not otherwise punishable shall be punished in a prescribed way. Similarly, the statute defining certain conduct as criminal may say that this crime is a felony or misdemeanor of a certain classification; another statute then indicates the permissible punishment for each classification. In all of these cases there is little difficulty in concluding that, since the statutes set forth both forbidden conduct and criminal penalty, the legislature has created a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">For example, in <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 803 A.2d 518 (2002), we were faced with a penalty provision that, due to a recodification, appeared in a different title of the Tax-General Article than the forbidden conduct it punished, namely the possession of unstamped cigarettes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We determined that the two sections in issue could be read <em>in para materia </em>in a plain meaning analysis to warrant application of the penalty provision in what was a separate statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\"><em>Evans v. State, </em>420 Md. 391, 23 A.3d 223 (2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Faced with a question similar to that before us in the instant case, regarding whether a statute, without a penalty provision, was criminalized by the association with a separate penalty provision, we again turned to LaFave:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\">In the more difficult situation, however, the omission of a penalty provision in or related to a statute cannot support a criminal conviction for its violation: \u201cBut sometimes the legislature forbids conduct and then omits (in most cases unintentionally) to provide for a penalty; and there is no catchall statute of the type mentioned above. In such a situation one who engages in the forbidden conduct is not guilty of a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted), quoting Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law \u00a7 1.2(d), at 12-13 (5th ed.2010). In <em>Evans, </em>we determined that the penalty provision of Section 5-143(b) of the Public Safety Article, which also is in issue in the present case, did not relate to Section 5-142 of the same Article, which criminalized the obliteration of a manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm, thereby reversing Evans\u2019s conviction for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Section 5-133(b) of the Public Safety Article, under which Jones was convicted, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">(b) <em>Possession of regulated firearm </em>prohibited.\u2014A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">(1) has been convicted of a disqualifying crime....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMh\">\u201cDisqualifying crime\u201d has been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">(1) a crime of violence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">(2) a violation classified as a felony in the State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">(3) a violation classified as a misdemeanor in the State that carries a statutory penalty of more than 2 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Section 5-101(g) of the Public Safety Article. Section 5-143 of the Public Safety Article, according to the State, supplies the penalty for Jones\u2019s conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, a dealer or other person may not knowingly participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>in the illegal sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt of a regulated firearm in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">(b) Penalty.\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $10,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">(c) <em>Separate </em>crime.\u2014Each violation of this section is a separate crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">There is no internal penalty provision in Section 5-133(b). Section 5-143(b), which the State asserts applies, does not explicitly refer to Section 5-133(b). Section 5-143(a) explicitly refers, however, to \u201cviolation[s] of this subtitle,\u201d and generally criminalizes the \u201cillegal ... possession ... of a regulated firearm,\u201d \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle.\u201d Section 5\u2014133(b), from the same Subtitle as Section 5-143(a), prohibits the act of \u201cpossess[ing] a regulated firearm,\u201d and does not \u201cotherwise provide[ ]\u201d a penalty. The term \u201cpossession\u201d appears in both provisions, as well as does the phrase \u201cregulated firearm\u201d which, facially, distinguishes the plain meaning analysis in this case from that of <em>Evans </em>in which reconciliation of the terms was impossible between the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Although the language appears facially reconcilable, Section 5\u2014133(b) prohibits possession by a convicted felon of a regulated firearm, a status crime, while Section 5-143(a) embraces the illegal possession of a regulated firearm for any reason, not just for being a convicted felon. It is this distinction upon which Jones rests his assertion that the two provisions are irreconcilable, relying on the cases of <em>United States v. Evans, </em>333 U.S. 483, 68 S.Ct. 634, 92 L.Ed. 823 (1948), and <em>Keller v. State, </em>11 Md. 525 (1857). In <em>Evans, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States determined that the acts of \u201cconcealing or harboring\u201d an alien could not be reconciled with the acts of \u201clanding] or bringing] in\u201d an alien, <em>id. </em>at 493-94, 68 S.Ct. at 640, 92 L.Ed. at 830, while in <em>Keller, </em>we determined, in a plain meaning analysis, that the Legislature had placed the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>selling lager beer without a license \u201con the same footing\u201d as selling liquor without a license.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 11 Md. at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We explained the legislative history of Section 5-143 in <em>Evans, </em>and opined that it had evolved over time as a catch-all penalty provision, but not one encompassing the conduct of obliteration, removal, change or alteration of the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm with which Evans was charged. <em>Evans, </em>420 Md. at 449-50, 23 A.3d at 887, 2011 WL 2572749. Whether Section 5\u2014133(b) is \u201csaved\u201d by its historical relationship to Section 5-143, or whether it, too, is an \u201corphan\u201d provision, is the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In <em>Evans, </em>we acknowledged that each of Section 5-143\u2019s predecessor provisions from 1941 until 1996 acted as a catchall provision \u201cat the end of a series of\u2019 prohibited acts, to punish violations of \u201cany of the provisions\u201d of the Subtitle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfX\">[The] penalty provision was also enacted in 1941 at the end of a series of four prohibited acts, which included the obliteration, removal, change or alteration of a manufactur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>er\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm and read: \u201cAny person violating any of the provisions of this sub-title shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than Three Hundred Dollars ($300) or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.\u201d The other prohibited acts in the list included proscriptions on selling or transferring a pistol or revolver to persons convicted of a crime of violence or who were fugitives from justice, possessing a pistol or revolver if a person had been convicted of a crime of violence or who were fugitives from justice, and possessing, selling, transferring, or disposing of a stolen pistol or revolver. The latter two sections explicitly dealt with a \u201cpistol or revolver,\u201d a term which was defined as \u201cany firearm with barrel less than twelve inches in length.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><em>Evans, </em>420 Md. at 453-54, 23 A.3d at 889, 2011 WL 2572749 (citations omitted). The original catch-all penalty of one year and $300 in Section 531E of Article 27 applied to a limited number of possessory offenses, those being of a pistol or revolver by a person previously convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or who is a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d to possess a pistol or revolver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Maryland Code (1939, 1943 Supp.), Article 27, Section 531E.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">By 1996, the possessory offenses had multiplied and they, among other offenses, also were followed by a successor to the original catch-all penalty provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">\u00a7 444.

The \u201cSummary of Bill\u201d Section of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report for Senate Bill 215 character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>ized the new possession law as \u201ccreating] several new crimes involving the use or possession of firearms.\u201d The Revised Fiscal Note of the Department of Fiscal Services for House Bill 297, the companion bill, provided that the new law \u201cexpand[ed] the criteria under which it [was] illegal to possess a regulated firearm,\u201d so that felons convicted of possession were now subject to punishment under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">During the 1996 session, the Legislature also liberated all of the other existing possessory offenses from the penalty provision, which was repealed. A new, more specific catch-all penalty provision was enacted, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">(e) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any dealer or person who knowingly participates in the illegal sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt of a regulated firearm in violation of this subheading shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both. Each violation shall be considered a separate offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">1996 Maryland Laws, Chapter 561 and 562, Section 449(e). This catch-all penalty provision specifically included reference to possessory offenses, among others, which did not have their own internal penalty provision. The explanation for the addition of this language is found in the Senate Bill Floor Report and the Fiscal Note for the House Bill, which recognized that increased penalties for illegal possession of a regulated firearm was the basis for the Bill\u2019s development: The \u201cSummary of Bill\u201d Section of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report for Senate Bill 215 characterized the new law as \u201cincreasing] the penalties for several current crimes relating to the use or possession of firearms.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report for SB 215, at 1 (1996). Likewise, the Revised Fiscal Note for House Bill 297 characterized the new penalty section as \u201cexpanding] the penalties for use and possession of regulated firearms.\u201d Department of Fiscal Services Revised Fiscal Note for HB 297, at 1 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The Legislature, thus, clearly intended to more strenuously penalize the possessory offenses enacted during that session, and did so, through the enactment of Section 449(e),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the precursor to Section 5-143.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 449(e) was the only penalty provision enacted in 1996 which incorporated possessory language and increased the penalty provision for illegal possession. To determine that 449(e) was not a related penalty provision to the possessory crimes enacted in 1996, to include the precursor to Section 5-133, would be to nullify the intent of the Legislature. <em>See Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 185, 887 A.2d 1078, 1084 (2005) (reasoning that the court may not \u201cconstrue the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application\u201d). The plain meaning analysis of Sections 5-133(b) and 5-143 is, thus, corroborated, so that the latter Section penalizes possession by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Jones also urges that his out-of-state conviction could not serve as a \u201cdisqualifying crime\u201d under Section 5\u2014133(b)(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>because the language of \u201cdisqualifying crime,\u201d regarding a \u201cviolation classified as a felony in the State\u201d pursuant to Section 5\u2014101(g)(2) of the Public Safety Article, does not explicitly encompass felony convictions in other states. The State, on the other hand, argues that because Jones\u2019s Virginia conviction, that of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine, is a \u201cviolation classified as a felony in the State,\u201d Jones\u2019s conviction meets the definition of \u201cdisqualifying crime\u201d in a plain meaning analysis. The trial judge made the requisite finding that Jones\u2019s \u201cconviction in Virginia\u201d would have \u201cbeen a felony here in Maryland,\u201d and thus, the only question is whether Section 5\u2014133(b)(1) applies to out-of-state convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">At this juncture it is vital to our analysis to recognize that not all of our sister states utilize the same type of felony-misdemeanor classification system embraced in Maryland. Rather, as the Supreme Court of New Mexico noted, in <em>State v. Moya, </em>141 N.M. 817, 161 P.3d 862, 865-866 (2007), while grappling with language that defined a prior felony conviction to include those from other jurisdictions \u201cif the offense would have been classified as a felony in New Mexico at the time of conviction,\u201d there is a singular lack of uniformity among the fifty states regarding the classification of criminal offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 863. In that case, Moya had been given an enhanced sentence under New Mexico\u2019s Habitual Offender Act, but he urged that his Utah forgery conviction, which was classified as a misdemeanor in Utah, was erroneously considered as a \u201cprior felony\u201d in New Mexico. In rejecting Moya\u2019s argument, the Supreme Court of New Mexico reasoned that it would be illogical to interpret \u201cprior felony\u201d to apply only to offenses classified as felonies in other jurisdictions using the same classification system as New Mexico, because it would effectively \u201cpreclude the use of convictions from states that do not classify crimes as felonies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">It is the same reasoning that precluded our Legislature from adding the language Jones proffers to be a necessity, that being that a prior out-of-state conviction be classified as a felony in the other state. Although Maryland uses a felony-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>misdemeanor classification system, as well as does the majority of our sister states, many of the other states are not consistent in their felony-misdemeanor classifications with that of Maryland.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even more importantly, some states do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>employ the \u201cfelony-misdemeanor\u201d dichotomy at all. Maine, for instance, classifies crimes in a \u201cclass\u201d system, ranking each individual offense as class A, B, C, D, or E. <em>See </em>Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 17-A, \u00a7 4(1) (2006). New Jersey, on the other hand, classifies crimes in order of \u201cdegrees,\u201d first, second, third, or fourth. <em>See </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:43-1 (West 2005). If we were to embrace Jones\u2019s argument, convictions from Maine and New Jersey could never be considered as disqualifying crimes for the purposes of illegal possession by a felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The diversity of classification systems necessitates the reference to Maryland\u2019s own felony classification to ensure uniformity of application of the law. The rule of lenity does not apply to Jones\u2019s conviction for being a felon in possession, because the basis for legislative draftsmanship is clear, and we do not have to guess as to intent. <em>See Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525, 529 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Jones, finally, takes issue with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 vacatur of the no-parole condition placed on his five-year sentence that the trial court imposed; he argues that a remand for a new sentencing is in order. The State concedes that the trial court used the wrong statutory section, that being Section 5-133(c) of the Public Safety Article, which mandates a term of five years\u2019 imprisonment without parole, but argues that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in just vacating the no-parole condition and leaving the rest of Jones\u2019s sentence intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Section 5-133(c), the section under which Jones was sentenced, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">(c) <em>Penalty for possession by person convicted of crime of </em>violence.\u2014(1) A person may not possess a regulated firearm if the person was previously convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">(i) a crime of violence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>(ii) a violation of \u00a7 5-602, \u00a7 5-603, \u00a7 5-604, \u00a7 5-605, \u00a7 5-606, \u00a7 5-607, \u00a7 5-608, \u00a7 5-609, \u00a7 5-612, \u00a7 5-613, or \u00a7 5-614 of the Criminal Law Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">(2) A person who violates this subsection is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment for not less than 5 years, no part of which may be suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">(3) A person sentenced under paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">(4) Each violation of this subsection is a separate crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVL\">Section 5\u2014133(c) clearly does not apply to Jones\u2019s conviction, because he was not charged and convicted for illegal possession of a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a crime of violence. Rather, he was convicted of illegal possession after having been convicted of a felony, for which he should have been sentenced under Section 5-143. Thus, Jones received an illegal sentence, which requires a new sentencing proceeding rather than mere vacatur of the no-parole portion under our longstanding jurisprudence. <em>See Medley v. State, </em>386 Md. 3, 870 A.2d 1218 (2005) (remanding for new sentencing where sentencing judge incorrectly stated that the criminal fine imposed on the defendant would be used to compensate the jury); <em>White v. State, </em>322 Md. 738, 589 A.2d 969 (1991) (remanding for new sentencing where sentencing judge three times misstated that mitigating factors had to outweigh aggravating factors for the defendant to escape the death penalty).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.
