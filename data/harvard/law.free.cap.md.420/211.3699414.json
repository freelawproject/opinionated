A driver may seek review of that suspension at a \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), at the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">The precise question we consider here is whether suspension of the driver\u2019s license hinges on proof by the Motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) at the show cause hearing that the driver was stopped on a highway or private property used by the public. For the following reasons, we answer \u201cno\u201d to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On May 17, 2009, Officer Karsmith of the Ocean City Police Department stopped Respondent Frank William Loane, Jr. for failing to obey lane directions. After detecting an odor of alcohol on Respondent\u2019s breath, Officer Karsmith administered field sobriety tests. Respondent failed to complete those tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Officer Karsmith asked Respondent to submit to a chemical breath test, as authorized by T.R. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officer Karsmith informed Respondent of his right to refuse to submit to the breath test and, if he did, the resulting administrative sanctions. Officer Karsmith provided Respondent Form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>DR-15, entitled \u201cAdvice of Rights,\u201d which explains the administrative process and the rights afforded a driver under the Statute. Respondent refused to submit to the breath test and signed Form DR-15. That form included a \u201cNo-Alcohol concentration test refused\u201d check box, which was marked to indicate Respondent\u2019s refusal. In accordance with \u00a7 16\u2014 205.1(b)(3), Officer Karsmith confiscated Respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license and issued him a temporary license and an Order of Suspension.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Officer Karsmith completed and signed Form DR-15A, entitled \u201cOfficer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Officer Karsmith indicated on the form that he was a member of the Ocean City Police Department and had stopped Respondent for \u201cfailing to follow lane directions.\u201d Within the section of the form labeled \u201cLocation (Specify county or Baltimore City and Address),\u201d Officer Karsmith wrote that the stop occurred in \u201cWor.,\u201d evidently referring to Worcester County. The exact address of the stop was not provided. Officer Karsmith affirmed under penalty of perjury, however, the truth and correctness of all information on Form DR-15A, which included the following pre-printed certification containing a statement that the stop occurred on a highway or private property that is used by the public in general:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">I, the undersigned officer, had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver described and named above had been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of Section 16-813 of the Maryland Vehicle Law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The language of the certification is identical in material respects to the \u201csworn statement\u201d required by subsection (b)(3)(viii) of the Statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Officer Karsmith forwarded to the MVA Respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license, the completed and signed Form DR-15, and the completed and signed Form DR-15A. <em>See </em>T.R. \u00a7 16-205.1(b) (3)(viii).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\n<em>The Show Cause Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Respondent filed a timely request for an administrative hearing to \u201cshow cause why [his] driver\u2019s license should not be suspended concerning the refusal to take the test....\u201d <em>See </em>T.R. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(v)(l). Respondent was represented by counsel at the hearing. The MVA, as typically is done, appeared through its paper record, consisting of Form DR-15 and Form DR-15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Respondent did not present evidence or testimony to rebut the information contained on Form DR-15A. Nor did Respondent avail himself of COMAR 11.11.07.07 (entitled \u201cSubpoena\u201d), pursuant to which he could have requested issuance by the ALJ of a subpoena to require Officer Karsmith\u2019s attendance at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Instead, Respondent moved for \u201cno action.\u201d He argued that his license could not be suspended unless the MVA first proved where the stop occurred, whether on a highway or private property used by the public in general. Respondent based that argument on the prefatory language contained in subsection (a)(2) of the Statute, which provides that \u201c[a]ny person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented ... to take a test....\u201d That language, claimed Respondent, limits application of the Statute to those persons who at the operative time were driving or attempting to drive on a highway or private property used by the public in general. Respondent argued that the Form DR-15A used in his case \u201cgives us no identifiable information whether [the stop occurred on] a public roadway or a private roadway used by the public in general.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent further argued that the pre-printed \u201cCertification of Police Officer\u201d was insufficient because it \u201cmerely recit[ed] the statutory language\u201d of T.R. \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(viii)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The ALJ evidently believed, or at least assumed for the sake of argument, that the MVA was required to prove the precise location of the stop. The ALJ, though, rejected Respondent\u2019s argument that the MVA failed to prove the location. The ALJ explained her reasoning: \u201cTaking this entire [Form DR-15A] into consideration, I know [the stop occurred] in Maryland ... and that the officer has certified that the person was driving on a highway.... So, I find that the fact that the officer did not give me a specific address is not [a] sufficient basis to take no action in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The ALJ made additional findings pursuant to subsection (f)(8)(i) of the Statute. That subsection directs the ALJ to suspend a person\u2019s driver license if:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>1. The police officer who stopped or detained the person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">2. There was evidence of the use by the person of alcohol, any drug, any combination of drugs, a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol, or a controlled dangerous substance;</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">3. The police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised, as required under subsection (b)(2) of this section, of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed; and</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">4. A. The person refused to take the test; or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">B. A test to determine alcohol concentration was taken and the test result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The ALJ found that Officer Karsmith had reasonable grounds to detain Respondent, there was evidence Respondent had used alcohol, and Respondent refused to submit to the test after being fully advised of the sanctions for refusal. The ALJ then suspended Respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license for 120 days, pursuant to subsection (b)(l)(i)(3) of the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\n<em>Circuit Court Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Respondent filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a petition for judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article (\u201cS.G.\u201d). At the hearing on the petition, Respondent repeated the argument he had made before the ALJ. The MVA, relying on <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 844 A.2d 388 (2004), countered that the location of the stop is not an issue that may be raised at the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>trative hearing because it is not listed among the issues set forth in T.R. \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i). That subsection provides that, at the administrative hearing, \u201cthe only issues shall be:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">1. Whether the police officer who stops or detains a person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">2. Whether there was evidence of the use by the person of alcohol, any drug, any combination of drugs, a combination of one more drugs and alcohol, or a controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">3. Whether the police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised, as required under subsection (b)(2) of this section, of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">4. Whether the person refused to take the test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">5. Whether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">6. Whether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">7. If the hearing involves disqualification of a commercial driver\u2019s license, whether the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle or held a commercial driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">T.R. \u00a7 16\u2014205.1(f)(7)(i). The MVA further maintained that, even if the location of the stop may be raised at the administrative hearing, there was sufficient evidence before the ALJ\u2014namely the information contained within Officer Karsmith\u2019s sworn statement\u2014to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>stop of Respondent occurred on a highway or private road used by the public in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The Circuit Court agreed with Respondent that subsection (a)(2) of the Statute requires the MVA to prove that the stop occurred on a highway or private property that is used by the public in general. The court determined, moreover, that the issue may be raised at an administrative hearing. The court reasoned that the term \u201cperson,\u201d as used in subsection (f)(7)(i)(l) of the Statute, incorporates the language of subsection (a)(2) and thereby requires the MVA to present evidence that the \u201cperson [ ] drove or attempted to drive on a public highway or on public use private property.\u201d Looking to the record before the ALJ, the court determined that there was not substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that the stop occurred on a public highway or on publicly-used private property. The court reversed the decision of the ALJ and remanded the case to the OAH with directions to reverse the suspension of Respondent\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The MVA filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">Did the administrative law judge correctly conclude that the implied consent statute, Md.Code Ann., Transp. II \u00a7 16-205.1(f), does not require the MVA to prove the exact location when a suspected drunk driver was detained after driving on a \u201chighway or private property used by the public in general,\u201d before suspending the motorist\u2019s license for a test refusal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u201cJudicial review of administrative decision-making \u2018is constrained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Aiken, </em>418 Md. 11, 26, 12 A.3d 656, 664 (2011) (citation omitted); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 14, 997 A.2d 768, 775 (2010); S.G. \u00a7 10-222(h)(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We look through the judgment of the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Court and focus on the agency\u2019s decision. <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Loyola College in Maryland, </em>406 Md. 54, 66, 956 A.2d 166, 173 (2008). Our review of that decision is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asp\"><em>Aiken, </em>418 Md. at 27, 12 A.3d at 665 (quoting <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 14-15, 997 A.2d at 775-76 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Moreover, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by the reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 15, 997 A.2d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>This case involves the ALJ\u2019s interpretation and application of the Statute, which the MVA administers. We therefore shall \u201creview the ALJ\u2019s decision for legal correctness, giving appropriate weight to the MVA\u2019s interpretation of the Statute.\u201d <em>Aiken, </em>418 Md. at 27, 12 A.3d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The task of statutory interpretation requires us to begin[ ] with the language of the statute as the primary source of legislative intent. When the language is clearly consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute and the result is not absurd, we have held that no further inquiry into legislative intent is required. Beyond plain meaning, the purpose of the statute may be ascertained by examining the Legislature\u2019s statement of a statute\u2019s purposes, and courts may consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d indicating the legislative intent. The language of a statute cannot be divorced from its context. [Thus], even where the language of the statute is plain, its meaning is controlled by its context. In short, the statutory language must be construed in light of and governed by its context within the overall statutory scheme. An appellate court may consider evidence such as a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the Legislature, and its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s goal in enacting the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 28, 12 A.3d at 665 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Lytle, </em>374 Md. 37, 57, 821 A.2d 62, 73-74 (2003) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The question before us is whether, at a license suspension hearing conducted pursuant to the Statute, the MVA must establish and the ALJ must find that the officer stopped the driver on a highway or publicly-used private property. Respondent concedes that \u201cabsent from the literal wording of [subsection (f)(7)(i)(l) of the Statute] is any mention that the location of where the licensee was driving is to be addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>[at an administrative hearing].\u201d Respondent nonetheless contends that subsection (a)(2) of the Statute \u201cclearly establishes that the Implied Consent Law only applies on a highway or private property used by the public in general. As such, when the phrase \u2018drive or attempt to drive\u2019 is used in [subsection (f)(7)(i)(l) of the Statute], it is an implicit requirement that the person be driving or attempting to drive on a highway or private property used for the public in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The MVA disagrees with Respondent\u2019s interpretation of subsection (a)(2). The MVA asserts that the reference in subsection (a)(2) to \u201chighway[s] or any private property that is used by the public in general\u201d relates only to the \u201cconsent\u201d to testing that drivers impliedly give in return for the privilege to drive on Maryland\u2019s roadways. The MVA further argues that the Statute applies regardless of whether the driver is stopped on a highway, a publicly-used private road, or purely private property; in other words, the Statute does \u201cnot ... preclude suspension if a motorist is detained somewhere other than on a highway\u201d or private property used by the public in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The Statute, when viewed in its entirety, supports the MVA\u2019s arguments. We begin with subsection (a)(2), the provision upon which Respondent rests his argument. That provision states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">Any person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Subsection (a)(2) contains two references to driving or attempting to drive. The first is found within what we shall label the \u201cimplied consent\u201d clause, which establishes that \u201c[a]ny person who <em>drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>public in general </em>in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test____\u201d T.R. \u00a7 16-205.1(a)(2) (emphasis added). The second reference is found within what we shall call the \u201capplicability clause,\u201d which provides that submission to the breath test is required \u201cif the person [is] detained on suspicion of <em>driving or attempting to drive while </em>under the influence of alcohol.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). If, as Respondent advocates, the General Assembly had intended through the implied consent clause to limit applicability of the Statute only to those situations in which the motorist is driving on a highway or a publicly-used private roadway, it would have been unnecessarily repetitive to refer to \u201cdriving or attempting to drive\u201d within the \u201capplicability clause.\u201d Put differently, Respondent\u2019s interpretation would require us to read subsection (a)(2) as providing that \u201c[a]ny person who is detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a highway or on any private property that is used by the public in general in this State while under the influence of alcohol is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test.\u201d That, of course, is not how subsection (a)(2) reads.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">To give effect to each clause of subsection (a)(2) and to avoid rendering either clause \u201cmeaningless or nugatory,\u201d <em>Smack v. Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 306, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003) (citations omitted), we read the \u201cimplied consent\u201d clause as establishing simply that any driver who has availed himself or herself of the privilege of driving on Maryland\u2019s roadways impliedly consents to submitting to a breath test. The \u201capplicability clause\u201d plainly indicates that the consented-to breath test is triggered whenever an officer has stopped or detained a driver on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Noticeably absent from the applicability clause is any indication that the Statute applies only to stops of a person driving on a highway or publicly-used private property. We therefore construe subsection (a)(2) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>mean that the reach of the Statute is broad; that is, the administrative license provisions apply to any licensed driver, whether driving on public or purely private property in Maryland.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Our construction of subsection (a)(2) is confirmed when it is read in conjunction with other provisions of the Statute. Subsection (f)(7)(i) sets forth the issues that the ALJ is to consider at the show cause administrative hearing. The location of the stop is not among the issues listed in that subsection. Neither is the location of the stop among the specific findings listed in subsection (f)(8)(i) that require suspension of the motorist\u2019s license to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We made clear in <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 844 A.2d 388, and more recently in <em>Aiken, </em>418 Md. 11, 12 A.3d 656, that the only issues cognizable at the show cause hearing are those listed in (f)(7)(i) and the only findings of the ALJ that precipitate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>license suspension are listed in (f)(8)(i). In <em>Jones, </em>the motorist\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended after refusing to submit to a breath test. 380 Md. at 166, 844 A.2d at 389. At the show cause hearing, Jones argued that, in order for his license to be suspended administratively, the MVA must first establish compliance with Maryland Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d). That section requires, for purposes of proof of a driver\u2019s blood alcohol concentration at trial, that the chemical breath test was taken within two hours of the driver\u2019s apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We rejected the motorist\u2019s contention that C.J. \u00a7 10-303 also applies to administrative license suspensions. We observed that the language of subsection (f)(7)(i) of the Statute \u201cis clear and unambiguous on its face\u201d in limiting the issues cognizable at the administrative hearing. <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. at 177, 844 A.2d at 395. We also noted that the timeliness of the test requirement was absent from subsection (f)(8)(i) of the Statute. <em>Id., </em>844 A.2d at 396. We explained that \u201cat a hearing under subsection (f) the <em>only </em>issues shall be the six enumerated issues in the section.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>844 A.2d at 395-96 (quotation marks omitted). For those reasons, we held that the two-hour requirement \u201cis not relevant in suspension hearings ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 844 A.2d at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We used the same reasoning in <em>Aiken. </em>The motorist argued in that case that the MVA must establish as part of its prima facie case for license suspension that the blood alcohol test was administered by a \u201cqualified person,\u201d as that term is defined in C.J. \u00a7 10-304, and that the testing equipment was approved by the State toxicologist. 418 Md. at 32-36, 12 A.3d at 668-70. In rejecting that argument, we noted the absence of any mention of the qualifications of the test administrator, and of approval by the toxicologist of the testing equipment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>either in the list in subsection (f)(7)\u00ae of the \u201conly\u201d issues cognizable at the administrative hearing or in the list in subsection (f)(8)\u00ae of the findings by the ALJ that lead to automatic license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The rationale and holdings of <em>Jones </em>and <em>Aiken </em>are applicable here. The Statute, read as a whole, plainly demonstrates that the location of the stop is not a matter required to be established by the MVA. In the words of the MVA, \u201c[i]f the Legislature intended to require the MVA to prove that an alcohol offense took place on a \u2018highway or on any private property used by the public in general in this State,\u2019 that requirement would be written into the Statute.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The construction we have given to the Statute, moreover, gives full effect to the legislative purpose behind it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Statute is remedial in nature. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 374, 739 A.2d 58, 68 (1999). The goals of the Statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">are first, to help effectuate the administrative goals of the MVA in ridding Maryland roadways of drunk drivers and, second, to encourage both general compliance with Maryland law as well as specific fulfillment of the consent to taking a properly requested chemical breath test implied by a motorist\u2019s entry upon and usage of this State\u2019s roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZJ\"><em>Id., </em>739 A.2d at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">To accomplish that purpose, the Statute establishes an administrative process that is \u201cinformal and summary in nature,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 376-77, 739 A.2d at 70, thereby providing for \u201cspeedy Administrative sanctions [that] [ ] help the offender to recognize the cause and effect relationship between the offense and the sanction which would otherwise be weakened by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>lengthy delays in the court processes,\u201d <em>Aiken, </em>418 Md. at 29, 12 A.3d at 666 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, the Statute is designed \u201cto reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests; the <em>[SJtatute [is] not meant to protect drivers.\u201d Id. </em>at 28, 12 A.3d at 666 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Respondent has not articulated a principled reason for reading into the Statute a location limitation, nor can we fathom one. In that regard, we find persuasive the reasoning of <em>Rettig v. State, </em>334 Md. 419, 639 A.2d 670 (1994). We held in <em>Rettig </em>that T.R. \u00a7 21-902(a), which makes it a crime to drive while, inter alia, under the influence of alcohol, applies to both public and private property. 334 Md. at 427, 639 A.2d at 674. Of relevance to the present case, the <em>Rettig </em>Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">We have recognized previously that Maryland\u2019s drunk driving provisions generally were enacted for the protection of the public. The menace posed by an impaired driver on purely private property is sometimes no different from that posed by one who ventures onto property open to the public generally____Furthermore, there is never a guarantee that a vehicle driven by someone in an impaired condition will remain off the roadways for long.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\"><em>Id., </em>639 A.2d at 674 (citations omitted). We decided <em>Rettig </em>in 1994. Since then, the General Assembly has not amended T.R. \u00a7 21-902 to overrule our construction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The analysis of <em>Rettig </em>applies equally in the administrative realm, and further buttresses the conclusion to which we have come. We would be giving an absurd construction of the Statute by reading into it an intent by the General Assembly to require proof, for purposes of the administrative sanction of license suspension, that the driver stopped or detained was driving on a highway or private roadway used by the public, when no such intent on the part of the General Assembly is reflected in the criminal drunk-driving scheme. Our rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>construction abhor absurdity; rather, the rules require a construction that is reasonable, compatible with common sense, and harmonizes various provisions of the Code. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>415 Md. 413, 421-22, 2 A.3d 368, 373 (2010) (\u201cWe presume that the legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law\u201d; furthermore, \u201c[i]n every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense\u201d (citation omitted)). We give full effect to the General Assembly\u2019s intent by holding that the Statute applies to both public and private property, and therefore the MVA is not required to prove at a license suspension hearing that the stop occurred \u201con a highway or private property that is used by the public in general[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">We hold that the Statute does not require the MVA to prove at the show cause administrative hearing that the officer stopped Respondent on a highway or private property used by the public in general.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The ALJ made all the findings required by subsection (f)(8)(i) of the Statute before suspending Respondent\u2019s license to drive. The Circuit Court\u2019s judgment to the contrary, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATION.
