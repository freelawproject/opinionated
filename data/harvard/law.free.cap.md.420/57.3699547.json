Before this Court, Petitioners challenge the non-disclosure of multiple jury notes submitted to the judge during the course of the trial. Specifically, the Petitioners presented one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in applying a weakened harmless error test to the admittedly erroneous nondisclosure to counsel of six substantive jury notes in this case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We shall answer the question in the affirmative. In the present case, jury members sent more than thirty notes to the court during the course of the trial, seeking clarification of testimony and asking questions relating to the case. Of those notes, six were not disclosed to counsel for the defense or the State, or to the Petitioners. Petitioners challenge the failure of the trial judge to disclose jury notes in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-326(d), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">Communications with jury. The court shall notify the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney of the receipt of any communication from the jury pertaining to the action as promptly as practicable and in any event before responding to the communication. All such communications between the court and the jury shall be on the record in open court or shall be in writing and filed in the action. The clerk or the court shall note on a written communication the date and time it was received from the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The State concedes that the trial judge erred in not disclosing the notes; the issue before this Court is whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">On May 27, 2004, three children were killed while alone in an apartment in Northwest Baltimore. The children, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>were members of the same extended family as Petitioners,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were discovered by their parents when the parents returned home from work. A neighbor called the police, who arrived on the scene and began their investigation. As family members began arriving at the apartment complex, they were taken to the rental office, where they were interviewed by a detective, with another officer serving as an interpreter. About fifteen relatives voluntarily went into the conference room of the rental office, and were asked questions regarding their identity, their relation to the victims, and when they had last seen the children alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">When Petitioners arrived a few hours later, they were interviewed by the police. Petitioners appeared to have showered recently and gave inconsistent statements as to their prior whereabouts. A neighbor told police that two days prior to the discovery of the victims, she had seen Petitioners coming out of the bushes near the victims\u2019 apartment and acting suspiciously. After questioning, the Petitioners were taken to the homicide unit and placed in adjacent holding cells. Both Petitioners were questioned separately, and based on Perez\u2019s statement, both Petitioners were arrested and a search warrant was issued for their shared home and Perez\u2019s car. In Petitioners\u2019 home, police found a pair of blue jeans with apparent blood stains and a knife impression. In Perez\u2019s car, police recovered two gloves and another pair of jeans with apparent blood stains. DNA analysis on the items subsequently linked Petitioners to the victims. The gloves were analyzed using a device invented by Salvatore Bianca, an expert in the field of trace analysis. Using Bianca\u2019s micro-vacuum technique, samples were collected from the interior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>surface of the gloves and the jeans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Petitioners were arrested and later tried by a jury. The first trial resulted in a hung jury in 2005. The second trial took place throughout June, July and August of 2006, and resulted in guilty verdicts for both Petitioners. Petitioners each received: two consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder, a consecutive thirty-year sentence for second-degree murder, and a concurrent life sentence for three counts of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Petitioners appealed their convictions to the Court of Special Appeals. Relevant to this case, Petitioners contested multiple jury notes which were not disclosed to counsel at trial, and were only discovered when counsel reviewed the record for appeal. The Court of Special Appeals remanded the matter to the Circuit Court for fact-finding on the issue, as provided for by Md. Rule 8-413(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Retired Judge Dennis M. Sweeney was specially assigned to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether certain jury notes had been disclosed. The hearing judge determined that the jury wrote twenty-eight notes, which were submitted to the judge during the trial, posing questions concerning the evidence presented. Judge Sweeney found that notes 6, 7, 14, 21, 23, and 26 were not disclosed to either counsel or Petitioners. Based on the opinion issued by Judge Sweeney, both parties filed supplemental briefs in the Court of Special Appeals. After the supplemental briefing and oral argument, that court affirmed the judgments of conviction. <em>Canela v. State, </em>193 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>259, 997 A.2d 793 (2010). Subsequently, we granted Petitioners\u2019 Petition for Writ of Certiorari. <em>Perez v. State, </em>416 Md. 272, 6 A.3d 904 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Md. Rule 4-326(d) provides explicit guidance to a trial court in dealing with communications from the jury. In interpreting the Maryland Rules, we have stated, \u201cwe use the same well-established canons of construction that we use when interpreting statutes.\u201d <em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 738, 4 A.3d 976, 982 (2010). Specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201cAs we have so often stated, the chief objective of statutory construction is to discover and effectuate the actual intent of the legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004). When interpreting legislative intent, \u201cwe look first to the plain language of the statute [or Rule], \u2018as the words of the statute, given their ordinary and popularly understood meaning, are the primary source of legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melgar v. State, </em>355 Md. 339, 347, 734 A.2d 712, 716 (1999) (quoting <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 435, 639 A.2d 675, 678 (1994)). As this Court and the intermediate appellate court have reiterated on numerous occasions, the word \u201cshall\u201d indicates the intent that a provision is mandatory. <em>E.g., State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 82, 785 A.2d 1275, 1287 (2001) (\u201cWhen the Legislature commands that something be done, using words such as \u2018shall\u2019 or \u2018must\u2019 rather than \u2018may\u2019 or \u2018should,\u2019 the obligation to comply with the statute or rule is mandatory.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-8\"><em>Dove, </em>415 Md. at 738, 4 A.3d at 982. In the context of Md. Rule 4-326(d), we have stated, \u201c[t]he rules governing communications between the judge and the jury are basic and relatively simple to adhere to in practice.... These rules are not abstract guides. They are mandatory and must be strictly followed.\u201d <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 322, 765 A.2d 97, 122-123 (2001) (citations omitted); <em>see also Porter v. State, </em>289 Md. 349, 352-353, 424 A.2d 371, 374 (1981) (noting that \u201cthe right is deemed \u2018absolute,\u2019 and a judgment of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ordinarily cannot be upheld if the record discloses a violation of the right.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">Maryland Rule 4-326 originates from the right of a criminal defendant to be present at every stage of his trial [which] is, as we have said many times, a common law right preserved by Art. 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The right, in some measure at least, is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Finally, the right is guaranteed by Maryland Rule [4-231, requiring the presence of the defendant at all stages of the trial].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><em>Bunch v. State, </em>281 Md. 680, 683-684, 381 A.2d 1142, 1143-44 (1978) (internal citations omitted). Further, \u201ccommunications between the trial judge and the jury relating to the jury\u2019s verdict are generally considered stages of the trial when the defendant has a right to be present.\u201d <em>Bunch, </em>281 Md. at 685, 381 A.2d at 1144. In <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 139 A.2d 209 (1958), we thoroughly discussed the right to be present, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">In this State there is no doubt that an accused in a criminal prosecution for a felony has the absolute right to be present at every stage of his trial from the time the jury is impaneled until it reaches a verdict or is discharged, and there can be no valid trial or judgment unless he has been afforded that right. The constitutional guarantee includes the right of the accused to be present ... (iii) when the court communicates with the jury in answer to questions propounded by the jury, or (iv) when there shall be any communication whatsoever between the court and the jury; <em>unless </em>the record affirmatively shows that such communications were not prejudicial or had no tendency to influence the verdict of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\"><em>Midgett, </em>216 Md. at 36-37, 139 A.2d at 214. Additionally, \u201c[w]hile the rule expressly requires notice to the parties of any communication from the jury, its very spirit is to provide an opportunity for input in designing an appropriate response to each question in order to assure fairness and avoid error.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Smith v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 603, 624, 505 A.2d 564, 574 (1986) <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 371, 509 A.2d 134 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Current Md. Rule 4-326(d) is derived from former Rule 758(d). Interestingly, prior to being recodified as Md. Rule 4-326, former Rule 758 was altered on July 1, 1977. In changing Rule 758, we dropped the language \u201c[a]fter the jury has retired to deliberate, all communications between it and the court shall be made on the record in open court or shall be in writing and filed in the case,\u201d and replaced it with language pertinent to timing and notification of jury communications. After the amendment, the rule stated \u201c[t]he court shall notify the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney of the receipt of any communication from the jury pertaining to the case. All communications between the court and the jury shall be made on the record in open court, or shall be in writing and filed in the case.\u201d Thus, the Court expanded the requirement of disclosure of jury communications by the trial court from solely during deliberation to include any point during the case. When Rule 758(d) was recodified as Md. Rule 4-326(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> effective in 1985, the new rule specifically required that the trial judge shall notify the parties \u201cbefore responding to the communications.\u201d This Court approved subsequent changes to Md. Rule 4-326(d) in 2003, adding the phrase \u201cas promptly as practicable,\u201d and in 2005, formalizing the requirements for notification by requiring that the court or clerk record a date and time on any written communication received from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">As seen above, Md. Rule 4-326 protects an important right, and therefore we employ the harmless error analysis when reviewing violations of the rule. <em>Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. 549, 568, 446 A.2d 844, 854 (1982) (\u201cthe harmless error principle is fully applicable to a defendant\u2019s right to be present during a stage of the trial.\u201d). We discussed this standard at length in <em>Dove:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>This Court announced the standard for evaluating harmless error in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Maryland appellate courts continue to follow the standard established in <em>Dorsey. </em>The harmless error standard is highly favorable to the defendant, <em>Bellamy [v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 333, 941 A.2d 1107, 1121 (2008) ], and \u201cthe burden is on the State to show that [the error] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and did not influence the outcome of the case. <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 658-59, 837 A.2d 944, 952 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\"><em>Dove, </em>415 Md. at 743, 4 A.3d at 985 (citations omitted). Prior to <em>Dove, </em>we clarified this standard as applied to Md. Rule 4-326(d) in <em>Denicolis, </em>stating that, \u201c[o]nce error is established, the burden is on the State to show that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The record must affirmatively show that the communication (or response or lack of response) was not prejudicial.\u201d <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 658-59, 837 A.2d at 952 (relying on <em>Noble </em>and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">One of the first cases to interpret Md. Rule 4-326(d) is <em>Allen v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 537, 551 A.2d 156 (1989), <em>cert denied, State v. Allen, </em>315 Md. 692, 556 A.2d 674 (1989). The Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cRule 4-326[d] requires full communication of the contents of a jury communication so that both parties can have input into the response.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>77 Md.App. at 545, 551 A.2d at 160. Drawing from cases interpreting Md. Rule 2-521, Md. Rule 4-326\u2019s civil analog, the intermediate appellate court stated that \u201cthe general rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that a <em>judge shall not answer questions without first informing counsel and then giving counsel a chance to address the court\u2019s proposed answer </em>\u201d and further that <em>\u201c[bjefore responding to an oral or written communication, the court must notify the parties of the receipt and substance </em>of the communication and advise them of the court\u2019s intended response, permitting counsel the opportunity to object or to request inclusion of some other response.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>77 Md.App. at 545-546, 551 A.2d at 160 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We have previously cited <em>Allen </em>in emphasizing the requirement that counsel be allowed to provide input prior to the court\u2019s response to a jury communication. <em>See Miles v. State, </em>365 Md. 488, 543-544, 781 A.2d 787, 819 (2001) (noting that \u201cfiling of the written communication with the action allows the parties to inspect the communication for themselves if they so desire[;]\u201d but cautioning that a \u201cfailure to provide an opportunity for inspection in order to develop an appropriate response may provide the basis for an error.\u201d); <em>see also Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 415, 601 A.2d 131, 139 (1992) (agreeing with <em>Allen </em>that \u201cthe spirit of the Rule is to provide relevant information to those most vitally concerned with the trial.\u201d). In <em>Stewart v. State, </em>334 Md. 213, 638 A.2d 754 (1994), we relied on <em>Allen </em>in holding that Stewart\u2019s absence during a communication between the judge and a juror was not harmless error when the judge went to the jury room during deliberations to talk with a distressed juror. In <em>Stewart, </em>the defendant was precluded \u201cfrom having \u2018input\u2019 in the judge\u2019s response to the juror\u2019s conduct. Stewart may have had other suggestions as to how the situation could be handled\u201d and therefore \u201cthe mere opportunity for improper influence in Stewart\u2019s absence prejudiced him\u201d despite any innocent motive of the trial judge. <em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 229, 638 A.2d at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In <em>Denicolis, </em>we emphasized that Md. Rule 4-326(d) implements \u201cthe Constitutional and common law right of a criminal defendant to be present at every critical stage of trial\u201d and emphasized the \u201cfundamental principle\u201d that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>right is \u201cabsolute.\u201d <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 656, 837 A.2d at 950. In <em>Denicolis, </em>four notes were received from the jury during deliberations. <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 653, 837 A.2d at 948. The note at issue sought clarification on the definition of solicitation. <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 653, 837 A.2d at 949. The note was in the record but was not time-stamped, responded to, or even mentioned on the record, and counsel was apparently unaware of the note until after the verdict and sentence had been imposed. <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court in <em>Denicolis </em>held that since the record was silent as to the note, prejudice could not be proven. <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 657, 837 A.2d at 951. We reversed that holding, stating that the record was \u201csufficient to establish non-harmless error\u201d because neither Denicolis nor his attorney were informed of the communication, which pertained to a non-collateral issue, and the State could not prove that the error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 658-59, 837 A.2d at 951-52. We held that the \u201crecord must affirmatively show that the communication (or response or lack of response) was not prejudicial\u201d and that a silent record could not do so. <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 659, 837 A.2d at 952.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Denicolis, </em>we also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>explained what errors may be deemed non-prejudicial and thus harmless in the context of jury communications, including \u201cthose [communications] that clearly do not pertain to the action or to a juror\u2019s qualification to continue serving and that are of a purely personal nature.\u201d <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 657, 837 A.2d at 950 (relying on <em>Midgett, </em>216 Md. at 36-37, 139 A.2d at 214, and <em>Graham, </em>325 Md. 398, 415, 601 A.2d 131, 139).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Turning to the case at hand, there are six notes which were not disclosed to counsel during the course of the trial. On remand to the Circuit Court, Judge Sweeney found that \u201cthe contents of juror notes 6, 7, 14, 21, 23, and 26 were not disclosed to counsel by the court.\u201d Testimony by the trial judge at the evidentiary hearing before Judge Sweeney revealed that the trial judge believed there to be three categories of jury communications. First, those notes dealing with juror comfort or personal problems, which the trial judge reviewed and acted upon without informing counsel. Second, those notes which were given to counsel to review in order to determine whether to conduct an inquiry. Third, those notes the judge considered to be \u201cobvious\u201d and solely for \u201cclarification,\u201d which the judge believed did not have to be given to counsel and thus were responded to by the court without input. The jury notes at issue in this case fall under this third category.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Although the State concedes that the trial judge committed error in not disclosing the notes, the State contends that the errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The State argues that the Court of Special Appeals concluded correctly, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the errors at issue \u201chad no impact whatever on the jury\u2019s verdicts.\u201d In contrast, the Petitioners argue that the \u201cerrors in the present case were hardly harmless. Five of the six notes reflected precise and important substantive concerns the jury had with evidence in the trial. Counsel were entitled under the rule to know that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the jury had asked these questions so that counsel could use this information about the jury\u2019s concerns to adjust their trial strategy or ... [to undertake] follow-up questioning of the witness.\u201d We agree with the Petitioners that the trial judge\u2019s failure to disclose to counsel the origin of the five substantive questions, four of which the judge posed to the witnesses at trial, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">We first turn, however, to juror note 14, which reflected the concern on the part of several jurors with the efficacy of another juror. The note stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">We the juror[s] feel that juror # 6 should be removed, because of lack of concentration and constantly nodding during this trial. Two men[\u2019s] lives are at stake and we believe they deserve a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The note was received prior to the start of testimony on July 18. The trial judge did not advise counsel that the court received the note. Rather, because juror # 6 had not yet arrived, the judge discussed with both counsel what should be done about the absent juror. This discussion occurred outside the presence of the jury. The jury was called into open court only briefly in order for the judge to inform them that there would be a delay in the proceedings while the court waited for the absent juror to arrive. When the jury next returned to the courtroom, the court directed an alternate to take the seat of juror # 6 without offering further explanation to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Relying on <em>Dorsey, </em>the Petitioners argue that the State cannot declare beyond a reasonable doubt that the error \u201cin no way influenced the verdict.\u201d Petitioners argue that the trial judge\u2019s failure to disclose the jury note is not harmless because \u201cit is not really so hard to imagine well-intentioned jurors of the sort who wrote Note 14 wearing down over the course of a long trial and losing their initial willingness to extend the benefit of the doubt to the defendants.\u201d The Petitioners conclude that the delay would have prejudiced the defendant by \u201cneedlessly trying the jury\u2019s patience\u201d and \u201cdiminish[ing] the jury\u2019s good will to the Petitioners\u2019 detriment and thus could have contributed to the guilty verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The State disagrees with Petitioners\u2019 characterization that the jurors would have charged the delay to the Petitioners because \u201call of the discussions between the court and counsel about the tardy juror occurred while the jury was out of the courtroom\u201d and therefore there \u201cwas patently no reason for the jurors to blame defense counsel for the delay on this record.\u201d Further, the State argues that \u201c[t]he very contents of the note demonstrated that the juror\u2019s were indeed ... sympathetic to the defendants\u2019 right to a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We hold that the failure to disclose juror note 14 was a moot issue, and therefore we need not engage in the harmless error analysis. In this case, Judge Sweeney found that \u201cJuror Number 6\u2019s continued participation in the trial had become a moot issue\u201d because, following the note, \u201cthe juror was subsequently removed for not showing up, making it unnecessary for the court to deal with the jury\u2019s note.\u201d Thus, there was an independent ground for excusing the juror (tardiness), and there was an alternate available to sit on the venire. Had the Petitioners not been informed of the note and the juror was allowed to remain on the venire, the case would be quite different. Instead, any possibility for prejudice resulting from the failure to disclose the jury note is moot because the juror was dismissed on an independent ground having nothing to do with the failure to disclose the jury note. Thus, we agree with Judge Sweeney\u2019s observation that the continued participation of juror number 6 was a \u201cmoot issue,\u201d and of no consequence to our harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The remainder of the undisclosed jury notes dealt with substantive issues and cannot be deemed moot or harmless. Jury notes 6 and 7 asked for clarification of the testimony of Ricardo Espinoza Perez, the father of two of the victims, regarding his actions on the afternoon of the murders. There was apparently confusion among the jurors regarding where the witness and other family members stopped on their way home as well as when and what items were purchased. Jury note 6 asked: \u201cWhen were these things purchased? When everybody got out of the car to carry stuff to the house?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Jury note 7 stated: \u201cPlease I need to know when these things were purchased. If they only made two stops. 1. Bank 2. The babysitters house 3. Home.\u201d The notes were received by the court on July 7, within two hours of each other. Judge Sweeney found that \u201c[n]otes 6 and 7 were not disclosed to defense counsel as proposed questions coming from the jury.\u201d Instead, the trial judge asked the witness the questions posed on the notes and asked counsel if there was any follow up questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The next note, jury note 21, was submitted to the court during the testimony of Bruce Levine, an engineer for Sprint Corporation. The State presented evidence regarding numerous cell phone calls between the Petitioners and other family members shortly before and after the murders. Mr. Levine testified as an expert regarding the location of the cell phones when various calls were made or received. During Mr. Levine\u2019s testimony, the jury submitted note 21, which asked: \u201cWhen you say call \u2018received\u2019 does that mean the call went through and was answered at the other end?\u201d The trial judge then asked the witness to define the term \u201creceived.\u201d Mr. Levine explained the term referred to the start of a phone call, but did not indicate whether the call was answered. Judge Sweeney found that the trial judge \u201cdid not disclose that it was a jury note that prompted the inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Jury notes 23 and 26 both concerned the DNA evidence. Jury note 23 was received while Salvatore Bianca was testifying about his micro-vacuum technique. The note asked, \u201cis it possible to vaccum [sic] those types of gloves? If possible did you vaccum [sic] them one and two.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The hearing judge determined that defense counsel was not notified of this note and the trial judge, who did not remember receiving the note, did not pose the question contained in the note to the witness. Jury note 26 was received during the testimony of the State\u2019s DNA expert, Francis Chiafari. The note asked: \u201cIs it possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ble for another DNA expert to look at the same reports and have a different opinion?\u201d Following the cross-examination by Canela\u2019s attorney, the trial judge asked Mr. Chiafari, \u201c[i]s it possible for another DNA expert to look at the reports that you generated and reach a different conclusion than what you have reached?\u201d Mr. Chiafari responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that if another DNA expert is provided with the data ... that they would reach a different conclusion.\u201d The trial judge then asked counsel if they had any questions, and counsel for both Petitioners asked a series of follow up questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Petitioners argue that each jury note should have been disclosed and that the failure of the court to do so resulted in prejudicial error. Petitioners contend that the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">[completely dismisses Petitioners\u2019 interest in knowing that the question [in each note] was one that was on the minds of one or more jurors, and thus that the issue was of concern to them. It should be obvious that knowing a particular evidentiary matter or issue is of concern to jurors, as opposed to just being of concern to the trial judge, would be very important to a lawyer trying a case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The Petitioners argue that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s repeated statements that it \u201cfail[ed] to see how appellants were prejudiced,\u201d and that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the court to envision a different result, resulted from an improper harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Regarding notes 6 and 7, Petitioners contend that the trial judge\u2019s \u201cquestioning did not clear up the matter satisfactorily.\u201d They assert that if \u201cPetitioners or their counsel had known the questions came from a juror, rather than just from the trial judge, they may well have pressed the matter further. ... [D]efense counsel could have pursued the matter until it was in fact cleared up.\u201d Notes 6 and 7 pertained directly to the credibility of the witness, and revealed the jury\u2019s concern regarding the testimony. Again with note 20, Petitioners argue that the failure to disclose a note asking for clarification of a witness\u2019s testimony is not harmless because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>defense counsel may have responded differently to the issue had they known it was a concern of the jury rather than the judge. With regard to notes 23 and 26, which expressed questions concerning the DNA evidence, Petitioners proffered at the evidentiary hearing before Judge Sweeney that had they known the notes came from the jury, counsel would have been more likely to call a defense DNA expert to counter the State\u2019s experts. Petitioners further point out that the Court of Special Appeals did not properly apply the harmless error test from <em>Dorsey </em>for any note, and argue that the court\u2019s analysis \u201ctotally dismisses the importance to trial counsel of having information about what the jury is thinking. It substitutes the appellate court\u2019s after-the-fact inability to conceive of what might have been done for trial counsel\u2019s opportunity to make on-the-spot intuitive decisions about trial strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In response to these concerns, the State argues repeatedly that \u201cPetitioners contention[s] ignore[ ] the fact that the questions posed in the notes were asked of the witness\u201d and that \u201c[i]f defense counsel thought the matter had some additional significance, they were free to pursue the matter further.\u201d The State posits that knowing that a note came from a juror would do \u201cnothing to change the defense strategy.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals largely agreed with the State\u2019s arguments, holding that the failure to disclose the jury notes was harmless error. The court stated, \u201c[w]e fail to see how appellants were prejudiced by the failure to reveal the contents\u201d of the jury notes, and that it is \u201cimpossible for us to envision how defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy may have differed if they had known the source of the question was a note from the jury.\u201d <em>Canela, </em>193 Md.App. at 283, 286, 997 A.2d at 806, 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Petitioners finally argue that adopting the intermediate court\u2019s burden-shifting analysis would essentially change Md. Rule 4-326(d) to no longer require a trial judge to show counsel jury notes raising questions about evidence, so long as the trial judge asks the question posed in the note. Petitioners rely on <em>Taylor v. State, </em>352 Md. 338, 340-41, 722 A.2d 65 (1998), in which we held that it was not harmless error when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the trial judge answered the jury\u2019s questions without notice to, and in the absence of, counsel. In <em>Taylor, </em>we stated that although the trial judge\u2019s responses were substantively correct, \u201cneither the petitioner nor his counsel had any input, or even any opportunity to have input, in the answers the jury received.... The petitioner might well have asked the court to make the response clearer, or objected to the form of the response.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>352 Md. at 354, 722 A.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Petitioners analogize the present case to <em>Taylor, </em>arguing that allowing a trial judge to simply ask the witness a question posed by the jury without notifying counsel, is \u201calmost the same as saying that the failure to share a note with counsel is excusable so long as the judge\u2019s reply to the note is correct, a proposition this Court has rightly and soundly rejected [in <em>Taylor].\u201d </em>The State, however, disagrees with Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Taylor, </em>arguing that the present case is distinguishable because the \u201ctrial court did not answer the jury\u2019s questions [itself],\u201d as the question was posed to the witnesses and Petitioners had the opportunity to follow up. Thus, the State contends that there was no effect on the jury\u2019s verdict because the jury\u2019s questions were answered by the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We agree with Petitioners that \u201cdespite stating correct principles of law, the intermediate appellate court then shifted the burden to Petitioners to show precisely how they were prejudiced by the non-disclosure of the jury notes by delineating what defense counsel would have done differently had the notes been disclosed.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals stated several times that it could not find prejudice, and faulted the Petitioners for not affirmatively showing prejudice. <em>Canela, </em>193 Md.App. at 278, 279, 281, 283, 286, 997 A.2d at 803, 804, 805, 806, 808. Despite appearing to apply the <em>Dorsey </em>harmless error standard, <em>Canela, </em>193 Md.App. at 274, 997 A.2d at 801, the court did not hold the State to its burden of proving the errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Simply stating that the court failed to see how the outcome would be different is not the same as the court determining that the error did not influence the verdict. Moreover, it is not the province of an appellate court to speculate as to how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>defense would have reacted to the disclosure of the note in order to ascertain prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We also agree with Petitioners that expanding the harmless error standard to allow a trial judge to read a jury note, not inform counsel, and ask the question directly to the witness without allowing for counsel\u2019s input in advance, would fundamentally alter the rule. As seen in the trial judge\u2019s testimony, at the evidentiary hearing, the trial judge believed there to be a category of jury notes, not outlined by the rule or prior cases, which would allow a judge to use his or her discretion in dealing with what the trial judge characterized as \u201cobvious\u201d or \u201cclarifying\u201d questions, rather than follow the dictates of the rule and require input from counsel prior to responding. We have previously cautioned against expanding the harmless error standard, stating that the rule \u201cshould be carefully circumscribed\u201d because \u201c[cjontinued expansion of the harmless error rule will merely encourage prosecutors to attempt to get such [improper evidence] in, since they know that, if they have a strong case, such testimony will not be considered to be reversible error [under the harmless error prejudice requirement].\u201d <em>Younie v. </em>State, 272 Md. 233, 248, 322 A.2d 211, 219 (1974) (quoting <em>People v. </em>Jablonski, 38 Mich.App. 33, 38-39, 195 N.W.2d 777, 780 (1972)). Instead of protecting an \u201cabsolute\u201d and \u201cfundamental\u201d right which is \u201csimple to adhere to in practice,\u201d such a change would greatly expand the discretion of the trial judge and allow him or her to determine when the defendant may exercise his or her right to be present for all communications between the court and the jury. To be sure, to create such an exception to the rule of disclosure would invite mischief and thereby undermine the public\u2019s trust and confidence in the jury system.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Applying <em>Dorsey </em>and its progeny, we must determine, based on the record, whether the error possibly influenced the verdict in this case. Petitioners are not required to prove what they would have done differently; the burden is on the State to persuade us beyond a reasonable doubt that violations of Rule 4-326 did not influence the verdict to the Petitioners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>prejudice. In this case, although most of the notes in question were asked to the witnesses by the judge,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> this did not relieve the court of its obligation to inform both parties that the communications originated with the jurors and the substance thereof, pertaining to noncollateral issues, prior to any response by the court. The trial judge\u2019s failure to disclose the receipt of the jury notes to counsel deprived counsel of the opportunity to have input into the form and substance of the court\u2019s response. We are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the failure of the trial judge to inform counsel of the receipt and content of the jury notes, numbers 6, 7, 20, 23, and 26, prior to the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s inquiry, did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. Consequently, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct the intermediate appellate court to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court, and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS ENTERED BY THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.

We find it important to clarify the burden placed on the State for proving harmless error. Some cases refer to the need for the record to \"affirmatively show\u201d that the error did not cause prejudice. <em>See Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 656, 837 A.2d at 950; <em>Noble, </em>293 Md. at 563, 446 A.2d at 851; <em>Midgett, </em>216 Md. at 36-37, 139 A.2d at 214. That phrasing, however, does not alter the underlying meaning of the test, which requires the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that \"the error in no way influenced the verdict\u201d and thus did not cause prejudice. <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. We point to two cases which help clarify the State\u2019s burden of proving that the error had no influence on the verdict, effectively requiring the State to prove the absence of prejudice. <em>See Noble, </em>293 Md. at 573, 446 A.2d at 855 <em>and La Guardia v. State, </em>190 Md. 450, 458-59, 58 A.2d 913, 917 (1948). In those cases, the error in question either benefitted the defendant, as in <em>Noble, </em>or had no affect at all on the proceedings because the error pertained to a defendant who did not appeal the case, as in <em>La Guardia. </em>Therefore, we held in both <em>Noble </em>and <em>La Guardia </em>that the record \"affirmatively showed\u201d a lack of prejudice, or rather, proved that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because there was no possibility that the defendant was harmed by the error. <em>Noble, </em>293 Md. at 571-73, 446 A.2d at 856; <em>La Guardia, </em>190 Md. at 459-60, 58 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>917. Thus, to require the record to \"affirmatively show\u201d lack of prejudice is simply to reiterate the State\u2019s burden of proving that the error did not influence the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">.

Even if the question contained in note 23 had been asked of the witness, as the other notes apparently were, this would not correct or ameliorate the prejudice caused by failing to disclose the note to counsel. Therefore, note 23 should be evaluated in accordance with the balance of the notes, which, although addressed by the court, were not disclosed to counsel in advance of the court\u2019s response.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>MURPHY, J., dissenting, in which HARRELL and ADKINS, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">There are two reasons why I dissent from the holding that Petitioners are entitled to a new trial. First, assuming that it is appropriate to reach the \u201cmerits,\u201d I would adopt the analysis of the Court of Special Appeals and affirm the judgment of that Court. More importantly, however, this Court should refuse to address the merits of Petitioners\u2019 Rule 4-326(d) argument on the ground that the inaction of Petitioners\u2019 trial <em>counsel\u2014who actually witnessed the alleged </em>violations\u2014utterly failed to preserve this argument for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Judge Sweeney\u2019s opinion includes the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">Counsel did not expressly agree to any process for handling jury notes or communications. Counsel did observe at various times that notes were coming from the jury foreperson and being given to the judge for consideration. Counsel did not observe all jury notes being handed to the clerk since they were busy with other tasks such as examining or cross-examining witnesses, taking notes, or, in the case of the parties with more than one attorney, counsel may have been absent from the courtroom preparing an upcoming -witness or handling other matters needing attention outside of the courtroom. At no time did counsel object to the process by which Judge Mitchell was handling jury notes throughout the course of the trial or prior to the verdict being reached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">The clerk was keeping the jury notes as part of the record in the case. At any time, counsel in the case could have reviewed any or all of the jury notes that the judge had returned to the clerk. There is no evidence that any of the counsel asked to review the notes in the possession of the clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">Jury Note 12, which clearly was fully disclosed on the record, is not at issue as not being disclosed. However, Appellants have placed emphasis on this note with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>suggestion that it was being \u201chidden\u201d by Judge Mitchell and only revealed when one of the attorneys, Mr. Panteleakis, noticed it at the bench while they were discussing Jury Note 11 and asked Judge Mitchell about it. Mr. Panteleakis stated he received \u201ca stern look\u201d from Judge Mitchell upon making the inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">Judge Mitchell testified that he was not trying to hide any notes, and this is credible to the Court. He was instead going to get to the note when he chose to do so\u2014not on counsel\u2019s schedule. He was preempted by counsel\u2019s arguably presumptuous inquiry and then fully disclosed Note 12 to counsel. This incident does show that all defense counsel were aware at that juncture that at least some jury notes were being handled in a fashion that did not totally suit them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">As Judge Sweeney noted, at the point in time when Jury Notes 11 and 12 were discussed at a bench conference, Petitioners\u2019 trial counsel were on actual notice of how Judge Mitchell had been handling jury notes that were being (1) written in the jury box, and (2) passed to him <em>in open court. </em>At this point in the trial, Petitioners\u2019 trial counsel had a full and fair opportunity to make whatever objections they wished to make. It is clear, however, that Petitioners\u2019 trial counsel neither made any objection nor requested (1) to review any of the notes that had already come out of the jury box, or (2) the opportunity to review, from that point forward, any note that would come out of the jury box during the remainder of the trial. Under these circumstances, this Court should hold that Petitioners\u2019 right to review notes coming out of the jury box was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">In <em>Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 60 A.2d 216 (1948), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">This Court has recently held in <em>Conley v.
