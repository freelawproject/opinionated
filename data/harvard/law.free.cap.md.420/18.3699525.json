ELDRIDGE (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">Near the beginning of the trial of this criminal case, after the prosecution\u2019s first witness had completed his direct testimony, and before cross-examination by the defense, the Circuit Court permitted the defendant-petitioner, Ramon Lopez, to discharge his attorney and represent himself. In allowing Lopez to discharge his attorney, and accepting his waiver of the right to counsel, the Circuit Court, <em>inter alia, </em>failed to inform Lopez of the full range of penalties he faced as a subsequent offender. Moreover, the record does not show that Lopez had previously been told of the maximum penalties he faced as a subsequent offender. The issue before us is whether, under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to state proceedings by virtue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment, and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Lopez\u2019s decision to waive counsel and to represent himself satisfied \u201cthe <em>Johnson v. </em>Zerbst<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standard of an \u2018intelligent and knowing\u2019 waiver\u201d of counsel. <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 150, 395 A.2d 464 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Petitioner Ramon Lopez was charged by information, filed in the Circuit Court for Caroline County, with possessing marijuana, importing into Maryland between 5 and 45 kilograms of marijuana, and related offenses. Lopez first appeared before a District Court Commissioner on April 4, 2004, but there is no record of what he was told at that proceeding. The first recorded proceeding was a bail review hearing conducted on April 5, 2004, before a judge of the District Court of Maryland, Caroline County. At the time, Lopez was not represented by counsel, and the following exchange occurred (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Lopez, you\u2019ve been charged with four crimes, one of which is transporting a large volume of marijuana, which has <em>a maximum penalty of ten years in jail </em>and/or a ten thousand dollar fine. You are also charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, which has a <em>maximum penalty of five years </em>in jail and/or a five thousand dollar fine. You\u2019ve been charged with one count of possession, simple possession of marijuana, which has a maximum penalty of a year in jail and/or a thousand dollar fine. You are charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, which as a first offender would have a maximum penalty of five hundred dollars. As <em>a subsequent offender that could be up to two years in jail. </em>Did you receive a copy of those four charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cLOPEZ: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: And do you understand what you\u2019re charged with and what the possible penalties are?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201cLOPEZ: Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Consequently, Lopez was told on April 5th, by a judge of the District Court, that he faced maximum penalties of 10 years imprisonment on the most serious charge and 5 years imprisonment on the next to the most serious charge. Actually, as a subsequent offender, he faced 20 years imprisonment on the first charge and 10 years imprisonment on the second charge. The only statement about the maximum allowable penalties which was accurate related to the least serious charge. In the seven months between April 5, 2004, and the start of his trial on November 8, 2004, Lopez appeared before several judges in both the District Court and the Circuit Court. The record of those proceedings shows that Lopez was never informed of the range of allowable maximum penalties which he faced as a subsequent offender. In fact, nothing was said about the allowable penalties at any of those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">At the start of Lopez\u2019s criminal trial on November 8, 2004, an assistant public defender represented him. After the State had finished direct examination of its first witness, and before cross-examination began, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Cross-exam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Cross-examination is up to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">\u201cMR. LOPEZ: Your Honor at this time I\u2019d like to address the Court, there\u2019s a conflict ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Hold on we have to do it up at the bench. Come on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">THE COURT: Wait a minute, you may come up. You may come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">(Bench conference. Counsel and defendant approach the bench and the following ensued.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">\u201cMR. LOPEZ: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: It what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-15\">\u201cMR. LOPEZ: And I wish to assert my right to cross-examine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: At this point, Your Honor, it appears that the client is not satisfied with my representation and wishes to remove me from the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cLOPEZ: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: With what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cLOPEZ: I wish to proceed with cross-examination. (Inaudible ...)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: You do understand that because you are not a lawyer gives you absolutely no latitude in asking questions. That if your questions are not properly framed and they are objected to, the objection will be sustained. So you may well be disputing your own purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">\u201cLOPEZ: Your Honor, upon cross-examination the statements alone and the inconsistencies in his statements. I don\u2019t see where I will be (inaudible ...) and in fairness I should be allowed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you want your attorney then to be excused entirely from the case or ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">\u201cLOPEZ: (Inaudible ...)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: I don\u2019t believe that the Office of the Public Defender allows (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-13\">\u201cLOPEZ: (Inaudible ...)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: As long as you have a lawyer it is not your right. It is the right to be exercised through an attorney. However, if you are uncomfortable with her, I am not going to require that she stay. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that she should have to sit there and be referred to as an exhibit. Do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-15\">\u201cLOPEZ: Your Honor, as I said before ... (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: She can withdraw completely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-17\">\u201cLOPEZ: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you understand at that point, you\u2019ll be without legal representation. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-19\">\u201cLOPEZ: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you understand that ah, you will be responsible for arguing the case to the jury in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>with what is justified.... You\u2019ll be responsible for asking upon any instructions submitted by the State. It will be up to you to present any instructions, which you wish to be given on your behalf. And how do you propose to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201cLOPEZ: Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: How do you propose to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cLOPEZ: Yes, sir. Your Honor, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: You can do the instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u201cLOPEZ: Um, I\u2019m asking you to instruct the jury to please excuse me if I make mistakes seeing as how I\u2019m not a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will not do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">\u201cLOPEZ: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: You have no right to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">\u201cLOPEZ: (Inaudible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: You have absolutely no right. If you want to undertake to represent yourself, you do it under the same rules as everybody else. There\u2019s nothing special about your case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">\u201cLOPEZ: Your Honor ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: There\u2019s nothing special about you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-17\">\u201cLOPEZ: Your Honor, you just stated that it was up to me to ask for instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-19\">The Court continued to admonish Lopez that he would not be \u201centitled to ... special consideration with regard to presentation of the case because you\u2019re a layman.\u201d Lopez was adamant that he wished to represent himself, alleging that his attorney had lied to him. After listening to Lopez\u2019s concerns about his counsel, the judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s \u201cobjections to the conduct of [his] attorney are wholly unfounded.\u201d Thereafter, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-20\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... Now we\u2019re going to proceed and how is it that you want to proceed. Do you want an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-21\">\u201cLOPEZ: Um, I wish to represent myself at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: ... You understand that you have a right to a lawyer. A lawyer can render very important assistance to you by helping you explain the matter more fully.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201cLOPEZ: Well, I asked if I could cross-examine the witnesses which I think is ah, allowable because I am the defendant and it is my right to cross-examine. But since the Court has stated that I am not allowed to do so if [the defense attorney] stays as my attorney, then I\u2019m forced to ask her to refrain from my case ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The judge told Lopez that he could choose either to represent himself or to be represented by an attorney, but the defendant had to choose one of those options to proceed. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... [I]f you have a lawyer, it is for the lawyer to do the cross-examining. We cannot have lawyers and defendants both doing it----I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s just the rule. You are right. You have a right to cross-examine, but you do not have a right to cross-examine if you have an attorney. Now that\u2019s my ruling. Now, where do we go from there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">\u201cLOPEZ: What I\u2019ve already stated, Your Honor, that I wish to proceed with [the] trial then, that I want to represent myself at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: You want to represent yourself at this time, all right. Thank you. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">For the remainder of the trial, the defendant represented himself. At the close of all of the evidence, the trial judge granted Lopez\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and use of paraphernalia. Thereafter, the jury convicted Lopez of possessing marijuana and importing between 5 and 45 kilograms of marijuana into Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">When the court reconvened for sentencing, Lopez was once again represented by a public defender. At the sentencing, the prosecutor stated that he was seeking to double the maximum penalty for the petitioner\u2019s convictions pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 5-905(a) of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lopez was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for importing marijuana. He was also sentenced to a one year concurrent term of imprisonment for marijuana possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Lopez appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, raising several issues. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed. With regard to the waiver of counsel issue, the intermediate appellate court concluded that Lopez\u2019s \u201cwaiver of counsel was knowing and voluntary\u201d as shown \u201cby the court\u2019s extensive on-the-record colloquy with\u201d Lopez. The Court of Special Appeals \u201cdisagree[d] with [Lopez] that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>[trial] court was required to inform him of the maximum penalty he faced if convicted of all charges, including the enhanced penalty the State was seeking.\u201d The appellate court relied upon the fact that Lopez \u201cwas advised at the bail review hearing in District Court of the charges and the maximum penalty for each charge, including that, as a subsequent offender, he could face additional incarceration.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court \u201cwas not required\u201d to \u201cre-apprise [Lopez] of the charges and penalties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Lopez filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the single issue of whether his waiver of the right to counsel complied with constitutional requirements in light of the fact that he was never informed of the range of allowable punishments which he faced as a subsequent offender. The State did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. This Court granted Lopez\u2019s certiorari petition, <em>Lopez v. State, </em>405 Md. 68, 949 A.2d 651 (2008), and we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Lopez points out that he was never told that he could receive 20 years in prison if convicted of importing a large quantity of marijuana into Maryland. He asserts that he \u201cwaived counsel with the understanding that the most severe penalty he could get, as a District Court judge had told him seven months earlier, was 10 years.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief in this Court at 12). According to Lopez, his waiver of counsel was not \u201cmade with full knowledge of the risks of proceeding without an attorney. His waiver was therefore not knowingly and intelligently made.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Lopez relies exclusively upon the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and cases dealing with those constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The State devotes a considerable portion of its brief to a discussion of Maryland Rule 4-215, entitled \u201cWaiver of counsel.\u201d Rule 4-215, <em>inter alia, </em>states that a court cannot accept a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel unless a court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>first advised the defendant of various matters, one of which, under subsection (a)(3) of the Rule, is \u201cthe allowable penalties, including mandatory penalties, if any.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The State argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that the entire Rule 4-215 is totally inapplicable once \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun. Therefore, the State\u2019s argument continues, there need not be compliance with subsection (a)(3) of the rule.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The State does acknowledge, however, that the requirements of the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights are applicable to a waiver of counsel after a criminal trial begins. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 428, 676 A.2d 513, 525 (1996) (This Court, among other things, held that, after the trial had begun, the trial court \u201cmust conduct an inquiry\u201d into \u201cthe defendant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel____This inquiry must meet constitutional standards. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464-465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)\u201d). <em>See also Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 604, 536 A.2d 1149, 1158 (1988) (\u201cAn accused who, at ... trial and without justification, insists on discharging his counsel ..., may properly be deemed to have waived his right to counsel if he is sufficiently informed ... so that his discharge of counsel represents knowing, intelligent, and voluntary action on his part\u201d). The State, referring to the advice Lopez was given by a District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>judge at the bail review hearing, the letter sent by the prosecuting attorney, and the colloquy at the beginning of the trial, argues that Lopez waived counsel \u201cknowing full well the nature of the charges against him [and] the allowable penalties .... \u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief in this Court at 10). The State contends that \u201cit was not necessary for ... Lopez to be apprised of specific subsequent offender penalties in order to make a constitutionally valid \u2018knowing and intelligent waiver\u2019 of counsel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Prehminarily, some comments about Rule 4-215 are in order. The Rule contains detailed procedural requirements concerning waiver of counsel in criminal cases. Rule 4-215 was intended to implement both the Sixth Amendment and the Article 21 right to counsel in criminal cases, as well as the Sixth Amendment right of selfrepresentation. When applicable, its provisions are mandatory, must be strictly complied with, and are not subject to a harmless error analysis. <em>See, e.g., State v. Camper, </em>415 Md. 44, 49, 55-58, 998 A.2d 352, 354, 358-360 (2010); <em>Brye v. State, </em>410 Md. 623, 635, 637, 643-644, 980 A.2d 435, 442-443, 447 (2009); <em>Knox v. State, </em>404 Md. 76, 87, 945 A.2d 638, 645 (2008); <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>401 Md. 175, 182, 931 A.2d 1098, 1102 (2007); <em>Richardson v. State, </em>381 Md. 348, 366-367, 849 A.2d 487, 498 (2004); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>355 Md. 420, 426, 444-449, 735 A.2d 1003, 1006, 1016-1018 (1999); <em>Moten v. State, </em>339 Md. 407, 409-412, 663 A.2d 593, 595-596 (1995); <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 130, 406 A.2d 98, 102 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In cases where a defendant seeks to discharge his attorney during the trial and the trial judge refuses to permit the discharge, this Court has held that \u201cthe mandatory nature of Rule 4-215(e) is inapplicable.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell, </em>385 Md. 616, 632, 870 A.2d 217, 226 (2005). In such cases, the issue on appeal is whether \u201cthe judge ... abuse[d] his discretion when he denied [the defendant\u2019s] request.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>385 Md. at 636, 870 A.2d at 228. <em>See also State v. Brown, supra, </em>342 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>404, 676 A.2d 513. This Court in <em>Fowlkes v. State, supra, </em>311 Md. at 604, 536 A.2d at 1158, however, held that a waiver of counsel <em>\u201cat </em>or shortly before trial\u201d requires that the defendant be \u201csufficiently informed in accordance with Rule 4-215\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We need not decide whether, and to what extent, Rule 4-215 may be applicable to the present case. As previously indicated, Lopez does not rely on Rule 4-215. Although he relies on cases where this Court discusses both Rule 4-215 and the constitutional right to counsel, Lopez\u2019s argument, as previously noted, is based entirely on the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The guarantee of the right to counsel in criminal cases was summarized in <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 262-263, 523 A.2d 597, 598 (1987), as follows (footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">\u201c \u2018The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee a right to counsel, including appointed counsel for an indigent, in a criminal case involving incarceration.\u2019 <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 357, 464 A.2d 228 (1983). The constitutional guarantees encompass not only the right of a defendant to the effective assistance of a duly licensed attorney at law but also the right of a defendant to appear <em>in propria persona. Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2527, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975); <em>Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 119, 486 A.2d 163 (1985). The right of self-representation is independent of the right to the assistance of counsel. <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 819 n. 15, 95 S.Ct. at 2533 n. 15. The rights \u2018are mutually exclusive and the defendant cannot assert both simultaneously.\u2019 <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 119, 486 A.2d at 166. The right to counsel has been zealously protected by the Supreme Court as a fundamental constitutional right. It is basic to our adversary system of criminal justice. <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 818, 95 S.Ct. at 2532. Although it may be knowingly and voluntarily waived, the courts indulge every reasonable presumption against its waiver; acquiescence in the loss of such a right is never presumed. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Moreover, \u201c[a] defendant may exercise his <em>Faretta </em>right of self-representation only if he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Fowlkes v. State, supra, </em>311 Md. at 589, 536 A.2d at 1151. As Judge Battaglia pointed out for the Court in <em>State v. Campbell, supra, </em>385 Md. at 627, 870 A.2d at 223, because a defendant choosing self-representation \u201cis waiving the right to counsel, the court must conduct an inquiry to ensure that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel is knowing and intelligent. <em>See [State v. </em>] <em>Brown, </em>342 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Md. at 414, 676 A.2d at 518, citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464-465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). With regard to waiver of the right to counsel, this Court has not distinguished between the right under Article 21 and the right under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Parren v. State, supra, </em>309 Md. at 262-263 n. 1, 523 A.2d at 598 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">After <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, </em>the leading opinion on the constitutional requirements for a waiver of counsel is Mr. Justice Black\u2019s opinion announcing the judgment of the Supreme Court in <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies, </em>332 U.S. 708, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). That opinion has been relied upon or cited with approval on numerous occasions, both by the Supreme Court and by this Court. In <em>Von Moltke, </em>Justice Black held as follows (332 U.S. at 723-724, 68 S.Ct. at 323, 92 L.Ed. at 320-321, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">\u201cWe have said: \u2018The constitutional right of an accused to be represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of a trial court, in which the accused\u2014whose life or liberty is at stake\u2014is without counsel. This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To discharge this duty properly in light of the strong presumption against waiver of the constitutional right to counsel,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a judge must investigate as long and as thoroughly as the circumstances of the case before him demand. The fact that an accused may tell him that he is informed of his right to counsel and desires to waive this right does not automatically end the judge\u2019s responsibility. <em>To be valid such waiver must be made with an apprehension of </em>the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, <em>the range of allowable punishments thereunder, </em>possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter. A judge can make certain that an accused\u2019s professed waiver of counsel is understandingly and wisely made only from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>penetrating and comprehensive examination of all the circumstances under which such a plea is tendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\"><em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 244 n. 32, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2056-2057 n. 32, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, 873 n. 32 (1973) (quoting with approval the above-quoted language from <em>Von Moltke); Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 581 (1975) (citing with approval Justice Black\u2019s opinion in <em>Von </em>Moltke). To the same effect, <em>see, e.g., Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 86-87, 109 S.Ct. 346, 353, 102 L.Ed.2d 300, 313 (1988); <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 20, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1079, 10 L.Ed.2d 148, 164 (1963); <em>Moore v. Michigan, </em>355 U.S. 155, 161, 78 S.Ct. 191, 195, 2 L.Ed.2d 167, 172 (1957); <em>Herman v.

Gillies </em>in several cases. Thus, in <em>Parren v. State, supra, </em>309 Md. 260, 523 A.2d 597, this Court, relying on both the constitutional requirements for waiver of counsel and on Rule 4-215, reversed the convictions of two persons who represented themselves at trial. The reversal rested squarely on the failure of the trial court to advise the defendants of the allowable penalties for the offenses charged. The <em>Parren </em>opinion, authored by Judge Orth for the Court, began its discussion of the applicable law as follows <em>(Parren, </em>309 Md. at 272-273, 523 A.2d at 602-603):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">\u201cWe noted <em>supra </em>that the standard applicable to a waiver of the constitutional right to counsel was enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, explicated in <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies, </em>332 U.S. 708, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309, and summarized in <em>Faretta v. California,, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>After quoting a passage from <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>Judge Orth quoted the requirements for waiver of counsel set forth in Justice Black\u2019s <em>Von Moltke </em>opinion. In reviewing the record in <em>Parren </em>and pointing to some factors possibly indicating a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel, the <em>Pairen </em>opinion continued (309 Md. at 275-276, 523 A.2d at 604-605, footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201cWhat gives pause in a determination of whether the constitutional standard was satisfied is that the record does not conclusively show that the defendants had \u2018an apprehension of ... the range of allowable punishments,\u2019 <em>Von Moltke, </em>332 U.S. at 724, 68 S.Ct. at 323, for the crimes charged. There is nothing in the record to establish that the defendants were told by the court or by counsel of the penalties involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Following a discussion of cases in other jurisdictions and of Rule 4-215, the <em>Parren </em>opinion concluded (309 Md. at 282, 523 A.2d at 607-608):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States patently deems knowledge on the part of a defendant of the penalties allowable for the charges against him to play an integral role in the preservation of the right [to counsel]. <em>Von Moltke </em>expressly set out the factor as a matter to be considered. 332 U.S. at 724, 68 S.Ct. at 323. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declared that when it is incumbent upon the trial court to determine that a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel is knowing and intelligent, \u2018the court must assure itself that the defendant knows ... the possible punishment\u2019 for the charges against him. <em>United States v. King, </em>582 F.2d 888, 890 (4th Cir. 1978). This Court obviously shares the regard for the vital part which knowledge of the allowable penalties by the defendant plays in the determination of the effectiveness of a waiver of counsel. The provision has persisted in our Waiver Rule through revisions and amendments and has been consistently mandated by the language employed to set it out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Another case where the defendant represented himself at trial, and where the trial judge failed, <em>inter alia, </em>to inform the defendant of the allowable penalties, was <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>355 Md. 420, 735 A.2d 1003. In <em>Johnson, </em>this Court addressed at length both the constitutional requirements for waiver of counsel and Rule 4-215. With regard to constitutional requirements, the Court, in an opinion by Judge Chasanow, discussed <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies </em>in detail, and emphasized the following from that case (355 Md. at 441, 735 A.2d at 1014, emphasis added by the <em>Johnson </em>opinion):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he fact an accused may tell [the judge] that he is informed of his right to counsel and desires to waive this right does not automatically end the judge\u2019s responsibility. <em>To be valid such waiver must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\"><em>\u201cVon Moltke, </em>332 U.S. at 724, 68 S.Ct. at 323, 92 L.Ed. at 321.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In discussing the earlier <em>Parren v. State </em>case, the <em>Johnson </em>opinion recounted (355 Md. at 447, 735 A.2d at 1017):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">\u201cWe reversed the defendants\u2019 convictions and ordered a new trial. In applying the waiver inquiry standard outlined in <em>Von Moltke, supra, </em>we found that the record did not conclusively demonstrate that the defendants had \u2018 \u201can apprehension of ... the range of allowable punishments.\u201d \u2019 <em>Parren, </em>309 Md. at 275-76, 523 A.2d at 604 (quoting <em>Von Moltke, </em>332 U.S. at 724, 68 S.Ct. at 323, 92 L.Ed. at 321).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Auj\"><em>See also Leonard v.

While the opinion in <em>Knox v. State </em>purported to be based solely on Rule 4-215, the Court \u201cconclude[d] that ... Rule 4-215 is ambiguous\u201d and construed the Rule in light of constitutional requirements. <em>Knox, supra, </em>404 Md. at 86-91, 945 A.2d at 644-647. Judge Raker for the Court in <em>Knox </em>then stated (404 Md. at 90-91, 945 A.2d at 647):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahk\">\u201cThe court must inform the defendant of the peril he or she faces to permit a \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 waiver of counsel, with eyes open to the consequences of that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cThe State postures that advising all defendants of potential penalty enhancements applicable to subsequent offenders would impermissibly chill a defendant\u2019s right to self-representation. To be sure, the right to self-representation is an integral aspect of the right to counsel. <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). The right to self-representation, however, presumes that defendant has waived counsel \u2018knowingly and intelligently.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541. A defendant cannot effectively waive counsel without an \u2018apprehension ... of the range of allowable [punishments].\u2019 <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies, </em>332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 323, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). A defendant cannot have full understanding of the consequences of the waiver of counsel if the defendant is unaware of the more severe potential penalties because of prior convictions. A chilling effect, if any, is <em>de minimis </em>compared to the surprise at the end of the day when a defendant learns of the mandatory penalty, after trial and just before sentencing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">More recently, in <em>Brye v. State, supra, </em>410 Md. 623, 980 A.2d 435, the defendant was charged with various offenses, some of which carried mandatory penalties and some of which carried enhanced penalties. At pre-trial appearances before different circuit judges, the defendant was given \u201cconflicting and inaccurate advisements of the penalties for some of the charges,\u201d 410 Md. at 626, 980 A.2d at 437. Several of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>advisements understated the maximum penalties, and one of the advisements \u201cgrossly understated the potential penalties [the defendant] faced.\u201d 410 Md. at 639, 980 A.2d at 444. The defendant \u201cwaived\u201d his right to counsel, represented himself at the trial, and was convicted of second degree assault. This Court, in an opinion by Judge Harrell, reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that the \u201cwaiver\u201d of counsel was invalid. While the reversal was based upon the violation of Rule 4-215, the Court reviewed the constitutional requirements, pointing out that the purpose of Rule 4-215 was \u201cthe implementation and protection of a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to counsel,\u201d 410 Md. at 635, 980 A.2d at 442. The Court concluded on a constitutional note (410 Md. at 640-641, 980 A.2d at 445):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\u201cWhile a layperson may be expected to comprehend accurate advisements given cumulatively at separate appearances, we draw the line at expecting a layperson to be able to discern which is the correct advisement from a series of conflicting and often incorrect advisements from different judges. On this record, Brye is not deemed by us as having \u2018effectively waive[d] counsel\u2019 because these advisements did not give him a valid and clear basis from which \u2018 \u201capprehension ... of the range of allowable penalties\u201d \u2019 may be inferred. <em>Knox, </em>404 Md. at 91, 945 A.2d at 647 (quoting <em>Von Moltke v. Gillies, </em>332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\"><em>See also State v. Camper, supra, </em>415 Md. at 56, 998 A.2d at 359 (The Circuit Court, in determining that the defendant had waived counsel, failed to advise the defendant that he faced enhanced penalties as a subsequent offender. In holding that the conviction should be reversed, Judge Barbera for the Court stated \u201cthat without advisement of the more severe potential penalties resulting from prior convictions, a defendant cannot effectively \u2018evaluate the risks of foregoing the assistance of counsel,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Knox v. State, supra, </em>404 Md. at 91, 945 A.2d at 647).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">It is clear, therefore, that under the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>waiver of counsel in a criminal case requires that the accused be informed of \u201cthe range of allowable punishments\u201d for the charges against him or her, including applicable enhanced penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">As earlier mentioned, the State argues that the advice given to Lopez by a District Court judge at the bail review hearing, the April 15, 2004, letter sent to Lopez by the prosecuting attorney, and the colloquy between the trial judge and Lopez at the beginning of the trial, informed Lopez of the allowable penalties. The Court of Special Appeals held that the advice given to Lopez at the bail review hearing informed him of the applicable penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The State\u2019s reliance on the letter from the prosecutor and the colloquy at the beginning of the trial is entirely misplaced. Neither the letter nor the colloquy among the trial judge, Lopez, and counsel, mentioned anything about the particular range of penalties for the charges against Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The State\u2019s and the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reliance on the advice given to Lopez at the District Court bail review hearing is also misplaced. Preliminarily, this Court has taken the position that, with regard to advisements required for a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the Circuit Court, one \u201cmay not rely on advisements given during a District Court bail review hearing where the charges involved ultimately were within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Circuit Court,\u201d <em>Broadwater v. State, supra, </em>401 Md. at 200, 931 A.2d at 1112. <em>See Johnson v. State, supra, </em>355 Md. at 456-457, 735 A.2d at 1022-1023. Since the most serious charges against Lopez were felonies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court had exclusive jurisdiction over all of the charges. Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 4\u2014302(f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Accordingly, under <em>Broadwater </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>reliance cannot be placed on the District Court bail review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Even if we consider the advice given at the District Court bail review hearing, the State\u2019s and Court of Special Appeals\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>reliance on the advice given at that hearing is misplaced. The District Judge failed to advise Lopez of the enhanced penalties for the two most serious charges. In fact, by telling Lopez that the importation charge had a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and the possession with intent to distribute charge carried a maximum of five years imprisonment, the District Judge gave Lopez inaccurate and misleading advice. The actual maximum penalties were twenty years and ten years imprisonment, and Lopez was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment for the importation offense. <em>See Brye v. State, supra, </em>410 Md. at 626, 639, 980 A.2d at 436, 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The Circuit Court for Caroline County clearly erred when the trial judge failed to inform Lopez of the full range of allowable penalties prior to his waiver of counsel. As this Court stated in <em>Knox v. State, supra, </em>404 Md. at 90, 945 A.2d at 647, \u201cThe court must inform the defendant of the peril he or she faces to permit a \u2018knowing and intelligent\u2019 waiver of counsel, with eyes open to the consequences of that decision.\u201d The defendant was not made aware of the consequences he faced, and, therefore, his waiver of counsel was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CAROLINE COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.

The State justifies its lengthy discussion of Rule 4-215, and its argument that the Rule is always inapplicable after the criminal trial begins, by asserting that Lopez argues that there must be \u201cfull compliance with Maryland Rule 4-215 prior to allowing a represented defendant to discharge counsel\u201d during the trial. (Respondent\u2019s brief in this Court at 4). The State's assertion is erroneous. In the portion of Lopez\u2019s brief which the State cites in support of the assertion, Lopez simply relies on a prior opinion where this Court relied on both Rule 4-215 and a leading Supreme Court case applying the Sixth Amendment. As previously mentioned, Lopez\u2019s argument is based entirely on the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\">. In arguing that Rule 4-215 is, in its entirety, inapplicable once a trial begins, the State relies heavily upon <em>State v. Wischhusen, </em>342 Md. 530, 677 A.2d 595 (1996). Although the issue in <em>Wischhusen </em>was viewed as \"tantamount to a waiver of the right to counsel\u201d (342 Md. at 532, 677 A.2d at 596), the case did not actually involve an attempt to discharge counsel or a waiver of counsel by the defendant. In that case, involving a charge of murder, the defendant was represented by defense counsel throughout the trial. What happened was that, during the second day of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge asking about the difference between first and second degree murder. Defense counsel was not present at the time, but the judge contacted defense counsel by telephone, advised counsel that he, the judge, proposed to respond by rereading his initial jury instructions on the matter, read to counsel his proposed response, and counsel stated that she had no objection to the response. The judge also read his proposed response to the defendant, informed the defendant that the judge had spoken to defense counsel over the telephone, and that defense counsel had no objection to the proposed response. The judge also informed the defendant that the defendant had a right to have his attorney present when the response was given to the jury, and that the judge would wait until the attorney was present before reinstructing the jury if the defendant wished. The defendant replied that the judge could reinstruct the juty without the presence of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In <em>Wischhusen, </em>therefore, counsel was representing the defendant with regard to the jury\u2019s note, although that representation was by telephone. <em>Wischhusen\u2019s </em>authority with regard to Rule 4-215 or waiver of counsel is very doubtful. Circumstances similar to what happened in <em>Wischhusen </em>are usually analyzed as involving Maiyland Rules 4-231, 4-326(c) or (d), and the right to be present. <em>See, e.g., Denicolis v.
