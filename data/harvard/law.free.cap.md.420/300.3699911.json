Perkins Hospital Center (\u201cPerkins Hospital\u201d). Petitioner ultimately seeks appellate review on the merits regarding the trial judge\u2019s denial of Harris\u2019s motion for a protective order resulting from service of a subpoena on one of Harris\u2019s treating physicians as well as service of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>on Perkins Hospital. Because we conclude that the discovery orders are not appealable at this time, we do not address the merits of Harris\u2019s challenges to those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">On May 23, 2008, Harris, through counsel, filed a \u201cMotion for Competency Evaluation,\u201d requesting that the Circuit Court order an inpatient evaluation to be conducted at Perkins Hospital.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial judge ordered Harris\u2019s commitment to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d) for purposes of conducting an examination as to his competency to stand trial and that he be confined within the Maryland Department of Corrections, or at a facility determined by DHMH, for the purposes of the evaluation. DHMH designated Perkins Hospital.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>On June 26, 2008, Harris, through counsel, filed a \u201cMotion for Counsel to be Present During Competency Evaluation and to Maintain all Recordings of the Evaluation Process.\u201d DHMH opposed the motion averring that the presence of attorneys would compromise the evaluation process and furthermore that there was no danger to the defendant of having potentially incriminating statements used against him because such statements would not be admissible at trial to prove the criminal offense or enhance a sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defense counsel then filed a motion to stay the competency evaluation pending a ruling on its motion to allow counsel to be present during the evaluation. The stay was granted. Apparently, unaware of the stay, the Director of Pretrial Services at Perkins Hospital sent a letter to the trial judge on July 3rd requesting an extension of 30 days to complete the evaluation. That request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">One week later, prior to the performance of the competency evaluation and prior to the scheduled hearing on defense counsel\u2019s motion to permit counsel to be present during Harris\u2019s evaluation, defense counsel moved to withdraw the motion for a competency evaluation and to rescind the order for DHMH to conduct the evaluation as well as withdraw the allegation of incompetence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge considered these motions at a hearing on July 15, 2008. Defense counsel explained to the trial judge that according to the expert opinion of a forensic neuropsychiatrist, Harris was not competent to stand trial and, therefore, in counsel\u2019s view the evaluation by DHMH was no longer necessary. At that time, the trial judge did not permit Harris to withdraw his request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>competency evaluation, thus the standing order for DHMH to conduct an evaluation was not rescinded. The trial judge also concluded that Harris was not entitled to have counsel present during the competency evaluation because it was not a critical stage of the proceedings, however, the trial judge ordered that Perkins Hospital should make an audio recording of the entire evaluation and disclose the recording to counsel unless the court ordered otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Subsequently, Harris submitted to a competency evaluation conducted by Perkins Hospital. By report dated August 27, 2008 and filed September 4, 2008, Dr. Danielle Robinson opined that Harris was not competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then scheduled November 20 and 21, 2008 for a competency hearing. On October 7, 2008, the court received a letter from Perkins Hospital indicating that Harris\u2019s mental state had shown improvement since the first competency evaluation report, consequently, the court ordered that, prior to the November competency hearing dates, DHMH should conduct \u201cadditional mental health evaluations as may be necessary to enable the Court to exercise its duty to determine the competency of the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Defense counsel moved, shortly thereafter, for the Circuit Court to issue a \u201cSubpoena to Produce Tangible Evidence\u201d for service on the \u201cCustodian of Records\u201d at Perkins Hospital to disclose to the defense \u201cthe complete file of the testing, examination, and \u2018raw data\u2019 \u201d that supported the Psychology Consultation Report prepared by Dr. Cowan, a physician at Perkins Hospital, which was used as part of Dr. Robinson\u2019s first competency evaluation. Contemporaneously, Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>filed a second \u201cMotion for Subpoena to Produce Tangible Evidence\u201d requesting his \u201ccomplete treatment file.\u201d On October 29, 2008, the State obtained a subpoena requiring Dr. Sameer Patel, Harris\u2019s treating physician at Perkins Hospital, to appear and testify at the November competency hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On November 7, 2008, Defense counsel filed a motion for protective order seeking to quash the State\u2019s subpoena for Dr. Patel. The State then obtained and served a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>on Perkins Hospital requiring the custodian of the institution\u2019s records to release all records, including treatment records, relating to Harris from the date of his admittance on July 24, 2008 through the motion date. There is no indication in the record that defense counsel filed a motion in opposition to the State\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A second competency evaluation report was filed with the trial court on November 14, 2008 averring that Harris remained not competent to stand trial. Thus, physicians at Perkins Hospital have determined Harris to be incompetent, however, no competency hearing has been held by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The trial court held a hearing on November 18, 2008 to address the outstanding motions with regard to competency. The trial judge ordered that the material requested in Petitioner\u2019s subpoena issued to Perkins Hospital should be furnished to the Petitioner\u2019s qualified expert as well as to the State, pursuant to its own subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>Defense counsel then argued that only the defense was authorized to obtain the treatment records generated as a result of Harris\u2019s admission to Perkins Hospital. Defense counsel challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the State\u2019s request to view treatment records, asserting Harris\u2019s patient-psychiatrist privilege in the records. The trial judge ruled that because Harris had put his mental competency in issue he had no privilege to maintain confidentiality in any of the medical records made for purposes of the competency evaluation or, otherwise, for treatment, and so the records should be disclosed to the defense and to the State.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Thus, the trial judge rejected Harris\u2019s request for a protective order and ordered that Dr. Patel appear at the competency hearing, granted Harris\u2019s motions for production of tangible evidence, and explained why Perkins Hospital must comply with the State\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>DHMH immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>released to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney involved in the case and to the defense counsel boxes containing copies of Harris\u2019s medical records from Perkins Hospital.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Subsequently, the trial judge granted the State\u2019s motion for a postponement of the competency hearing in order to allow time to review the records. Approximately two weeks later, defense counsel moved to stay the trial judge\u2019s denial of the motion for a protective order and the trial judge\u2019s ruling to disclose Harris\u2019s medical records to the State, as well as noting an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The trial judge granted the stay on December 11, 2008 and ordered that \u201cto the extent that the State has not already reviewed or discussed these records, they shall refrain from doing so until further order of the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed Harris\u2019s appeal. That court held that the challenged orders were interlocutory discovery orders and therefore not appealable, final orders; and, moreover the case did not merit application of the collateral order doctrine as an exception to the final judgment rule. Defense counsel filed a motion for reconsideration suggesting that the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding was defective because it did not address the potential application of the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine to Harris\u2019s case. <em>See Perlman v. United States, </em>247 U.S. 7, 38 S.Ct. 417, 62 L.Ed. 950 (1918).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>declined Harris\u2019s motion to reconsider and therefore made no comment on the application of <em>Perlman </em>to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">We granted certiorari, <em>Harris v. State, </em>415 Md. 607, 4 A.3d 512 (2010), to answer the following consolidated, reworded question:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Were the trial court\u2019s interlocutory orders authorizing disclosure of treatment records and testimony by the treating physician that are allegedly protected by the patient-therapist privilege immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine, or, if not, should this Court adopt the exception to the final judgment requirement for appealability recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Perlman v. U.S., </em>247 U.S. 7, 38 S.Ct. 417, 62 L.Ed. 950 (1918), and if so, does that doctrine apply here?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The orders that Petitioner submits that warrant appellate review are: (1) the trial judge\u2019s order denying Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion for Protective Order\u201d through which Petitioner sought to preclude the testimony of his treating physician, Dr. Patel, at his competency hearing; and (2) the trial judge\u2019s order permitting the State\u2019s subpoena for disclosure of Petitioner\u2019s medical records held by Perkins Hospital, including those made during the two competency evaluations and all treatment records.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Generally, in Maryland appellate jurisdiction may arise only after entry of a final judgment. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.P.\u201d) (\u201c[A] party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a ... criminal case by a circuit court .... unless ... the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.\u201d). A final judgment is statutorily defined as \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court ... from which an appeal ... may be taken.\u201d C.J.P. 12-101(f). The necessity of \u201cfinality,\u201d arises from \u201c[t]he fundamental objective ... [which] is \u2018to prevent piecemeal appeals and to prevent the interruptions of ongoing judicial proceedings[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>WSSC v. Bowen, </em>410 Md. 287, 294-95, 978 A.2d 678, 683 (2009) (quoting <em>St. Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, </em>393 Md. 415, 424, 903 A.2d 378, 383-84 (2006)). This Court is responsible for defining the contours of the \u201cfinality\u201d of a judgment, <em>Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. v. Los Angeles Rams, </em>284 Md. 86, 91, 394 A.2d 801, 804 (1978), and accordingly we have stated that \u201cto constitute a final judgment, a trial court\u2019s ruling \u2018must either decide and conclude the rights of the parties involved or deny a party the means to prosecute or defend rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schuele v. Case Handyman, </em>412 Md. 555, 565, 989 A.2d 210, 216 (2010) (quoting <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>389 Md. 315, 324, 884 A.2d 1215, 1219-20 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In criminal cases, in particular, we have held that \u201cno final judgment exists until after conviction and sentence has been determined, or in other words, when only the execution of the judgment remains.\u201d <em>Sigma Repro. Health Cen. v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 665, 467 A.2d 483, 485 (1983) (citing <em>Parr v. United States, </em>351 U.S. 513, 518, 76 S.Ct. 912, 100 L.Ed. 1377 (1956)). But, in <em>Sigma, </em>we noted that criminal defendants may be able to \u201cappeal[ ] from certain pretrial or trial orders [where] the rights of the defendant would be lost or irreparably harmed if an appeal was not allowed until after trial.\u201d <em>Sigma, </em>297 Md. at 666, 467 A.2d at 486.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThere are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>... three well-identified, but infrequently sanctioned, limited exceptions to the final judgment rule which permit appellate review before a final judgment has been rendered.\u201d <em>Falik v. Hornage, </em>413 Md. 163, 175, 991 A.2d 1234, 1241-42 (2010) (citing <em>St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery Associates, P.A., </em>392 Md. 75, 84, 896 A.2d 304, 309 (2006)). Those exceptions are: \u201cappeals from interlocutory orders specifically allowed by statute; immediate appeals permitted under Maryland Rule 2-602;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and appeals from interlocutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>orders allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>Falik, </em>413 Md. at 175-76, 991 A.2d at 1242 (quoting <em>St. Joseph, </em>392 Md. at 84, 896 A.2d at 309).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In Maryland, discovery orders \u201cbeing interlocutory in nature, are not ordinarily appealable prior to a final judgment terminating the case in the trial court.\u201d <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 634, 820 A.2d 587, 592 (2003) (reversing the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding that a discovery order for a medical examination of the subject of a guardianship proceeding met the four requirements of the collateral order doctrine because the order did not satisfy the third and fourth requirements). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is well established in Maryland that generally \u2018interlocutory discovery orders do not meet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine and are not appealable under that doctrine.\u2019\u201d <em>Falik, </em>413 Md. at 177, 991 A.2d at 1243 (quoting <em>St. Joseph, </em>392 Md. at 87, 896 A.2d at 311).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Here, Petitioner persists in seeking appellate review pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, in opposition to the holding by the Court of Special Appeals, or alternatively, under the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine, which he avers should be an applicable fourth exception to the final judgment rule. Petitioner asserts that our application of the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine to this case would result in the relief that he seeks, which ultimately is a review of the merits of his objections.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>II. The Collateral Order Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Harris contends that the collateral order doctrine applies here and that consequently we should review the merits of the trial judge\u2019s rulings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We have held that the collateral order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>doctrine \u201ctreats a \u2018narrow class\u2019 of interlocutory orders as final judgments regardless of the posture of the case.\u201d <em>Bowen, </em>410 Md. at 296, 978 A.2d at 684 (quoting <em>St Mary\u2019s County v. Lacer, </em>393 Md. at 428, 903 A.2d at 386) (citing <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 326, 783 A.2d 673, 685 (2001)). \u201cTime after time, this Court\u2019s opinions have emphasized that the collateral order doctrine is extremely narrow and that it is applicable only under extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Bowen, </em>410 Md. at 296, 978 A.2d at 684 and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">This Court has recently reiterated in <em>Falik </em>the factual predicate to application of the collateral order doctrine. There, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">The collateral order doctrine treats</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_d\">as final and appealable interlocutory orders that: (1) conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) resolve an important issue; (3) resolve an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. The collateral order doctrine is a very narrow exception to the final judgment rule, and each of its four requirements is very strictly applied in Maryland. In particular, the fourth prong, unreviewability on appeal, is not satisfied except in extraordinary situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\"><em>Falik, </em>413 Md. at 176-77, 991 A.2d at 1242-43 (quoting <em>St Joseph, </em>392 Md. at 86, 896 A.2d at 310) (quoting <em>Nnoli, </em>389 Md. at 329, 884 A.2d at 1223) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); <em>see Bowen, </em>410 Md. at 296, 978 A.2d at 684 (noting that all four elements of test are \u201cconjunctive in nature\u201d and must each be met).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the collateral order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>doctrine is \u201cbased upon a judicially created fiction,\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Department, </em>376 Md. 53, 64, 827 A.2d 115, 121 (2003), which permits immediate appellate review of an order that shares sufficient attributes of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Interlocutory discovery orders, such as the ones implicated here, typically are not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine because most fail the third and fourth requirement. Discovery orders</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">do not comply with the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine, as they generally are not completely separate from the merits of the lawsuit. Instead, a typical discovery order is aimed at ascertaining critical facts upon which the outcome of the ... controversy might depend. In addition, discovery orders fail to meet the collateral order doctrine\u2019s fourth element, as they are effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Falik, </em>413 Md. at 177, 991 A.2d at 1243 (quoting <em>St Joseph, </em>392 Md. at 87, 896 A.2d at 311). In <em>St Joseph, </em>we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQA\">The \u201csingular situation,\u201d <em>[In re Foley, supra, </em>373 Md. at 636, 820 A.2d at 593] in which this Court has held that interlocutory discovery orders are appealable under the collateral order doctrine, involves trial court orders permitting the depositions of high level governmental decision makers for the purpose of \u201cextensively probing ... their individual decisional thought processes.\u201d <em>Montgomery Co. v. Stevens, supra, </em>337 Md. at 479, 654 A.2d at 881, quoting <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, supra, </em>300 Md. at 207, 477 A.2d at 763.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\"><em>St. Joseph, </em>392 Md. at 88, 896 A.2d at 311(footnote omitted). The orders here cannot be subsumed into that \u201csingular situation\u201d category highlighted in the <em>St. Joseph </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In the present case, the Court of Special Appeals assumed <em>arguendo </em>that the first two requirements were met, and then held that the discovery orders failed the third and fourth requirements of the collateral order doctrine. The intermedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ate appellate court determined that the resolution of Harris\u2019s competency to stand trial would necessarily impact the merits of the trial, e.g., an incompetency finding by the trial judge would preclude trial. In addition, the court noted that the discovery orders were not unreviewable on appeal, <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. at 636, 820 A.2d at 593, where we noted that \u201cextraordinary situations\u201d usually precede a determination that a discovery order is \u201ceffectively unreviewable[.]\u201d We will likewise <em>assume arguendo </em>that the discovery orders conclusively determined the issue of privilege pertaining to the records and that privilege was an important issue at the time of the orders, and therefore, we consider whether the third and fourth requirements of the collateral order doctrine were met.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We conclude that they were not; thus the doctrine does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A. The Third Requirement of the Collateral Order Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The collateral order doctrine requires that the contested order(s) be completely \u201cseparable from\u201d and \u201ccollateral to\u201d the merits of the action. <em>See Cohen, </em>337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. at 1536 (holding that an order for plaintiff shareholders to post a bond, allegedly required by statute, was appealable because that decision would not \u201caffect, or ... be affected by, [a] decision on the merits of this case[,]\u201d and that the \u201cclaims of right [were] separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the [underlying] action\u201d); <em>c.f Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 573-74, 989 A.2d at 221 (holding that an order denying a motion to compel arbitration satisfied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>third requirement because it \u201cdetermine[d] only the forum in which the parties should settle their dispute without reaching any of [the] ... claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Determining that the third prong was not met, the Court of Special Appeals held, in the present case, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYB\">the issue of privilege pertaining to [Harris\u2019s] records from Perkins is not completely independent from the merits of the action, that is, the issue of guilt or innocence of the crimes charged. To the contrary, the circuit court\u2019s ruling regarding the disclosure of [Harris\u2019s] medical records, and the testimony of his treating physician, was in the nature of a discovery order aimed at ascertaining critical facts upon which the outcome of a competency determination might depend. The outcome of the competency determination would, in turn, impact the merits of the action because [Harris] cannot be tried on the merits until the circuit court finds him competent to stand trial. We conclude that the resolution of the disputed issue is not separate from the merits of the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Harris v. State, </em>No. 2299, slip op. at 7-8 (April 19, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Generally, most discovery orders are not separate from the merits of an action. <em>See e.g., Hudson v.

The <em>Perlman </em>Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Upon concluding that the collateral order doctrine did not apply, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed Harris\u2019s appeal without considering whether the trial judge\u2019s ruling denying his protective order was alternatively appealable under the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine. In <em>Perlman, </em>the United States Supreme Court approved an interlocutory appeal of a denial of a motion that challenged a discovery order on the basis of privilege.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Perlman v. United States, </em>247 U.S. 7, 38 S.Ct. 417, 62 L.Ed. 950 (1918); <em>see also United States v. Myers, </em>593 F.3d 338, 345 (4th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Church of Scientology of Ca. v.

Balt. City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>376 Md. 53, 60, 827 A.2d 115, 119 (2003); <em>see generally Fletcher v.

It is only a grant of legislative grace.\u201d) and cases cited therein. Furthermore, to adopt and apply <em>Perlman </em>would require a determination at this stage of the criminal proceedings that (1) the State is a disinterested third party; (2) Petitioner has a privilege in his treatment records at Perkins, that has not been excluded by the court under C.J.P. \u00a7 9-109(d)(2) or that he has not introduced \u201chis mental condition as an element of his claim or defense\u201d under C.J.P. \u00a7 9\u2014109(d)(3); and (3) that the issue is unreviewable after a final judgment on the merits.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In <em>Perlman, </em>the privilege holder was \u201cpowerless\u201d to protect his privilege because he was not a party to the underlying grand jury proceeding, although he would have become a party if ultimately indicted, presumably because of the successful introduction of the privileged documents. Thus, the status of the custodian of the privileged documents and the status of the privilege holder are paramount to a determination of whether the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine provides appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>jurisdiction in a given case. Petitioner contends that we should adopt the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine in this case as a basis for appellate jurisdiction contending that the discovery orders issued to Perkins Hospital and to Dr. Patel, allegedly \u201cdisinterested third-parties,\u201d to disclose all of Harris\u2019s medical records to the State were \u201cfinal\u201d orders, in as much as they decided the issue of privilege, and as such this present appeal is the only way to \u201cprotect privileged material in the hands of a non-party from unwarranted disclosure before the privilege is irrevocably damaged.\u201d Specifically, Petitioner contends that Perkins Hospital is disinterested because: (1) it has no interest in protecting Harris\u2019s patient-psychiatrist privilege; and (2) that while a State agency, Perkins Hospital is not affiliated with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and is therefore \u201cnot remotely a party to this proceeding.\u201d The record reveals that at the time that the discovery orders were served on Harris\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Patel, and Harris\u2019s treating hospital, Perkins Hospital, Harris was admitted, as an inpatient, into Perkins Hospital for treatment for his mental condition.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The State argues that \u201cthere is no need for this Court to make any expansion of the exceptions to the final judgment rule\u201d because \u201cthere is no nonparty or disinterested third party .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We note that <em>Perlman </em>is a narrowly applied doctrine.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For example, the Seventh Circuit observed in <em>Wilson </em>that \u201c[ojnly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>when the person who asserts a privilege is a non-litigant will an appeal from the final decision be inadequate[,\u201d] otherwise \u201can appeal from the final decision will allow review of the trial judge\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>621 F.3d at 643; <em>accord In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>616 F.3d 1172, 1179 (10th Cir.2010) (holding that <em>Perlman </em>applies only when an appeal \u201cis sought by an intervenor who claims a justiciable interest in preventing a third party\u2019s disclosure of documents or testimony\u201d); <em>United States v. Cuthbertson, </em>651 F.2d 189, 194 (3d Cir.1981) (same). In addition, the <em>Wilson </em>court observed that the evidentiary \u201cprivilege (if there is one) belongs to [the defendant]\u201d and not to the nonparty asserting the privilege. <em>Wilson, </em>621 F.3d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded to adopt <em>Perlman </em>because at least two federal circuit courts of appeals have explicitly questioned whether <em>Perlman </em>is still good law. The Tenth Circuit has said that <em>\u201cMohawk Industries </em>calls <em>Perl-man </em>and its successors into question, because, whether the order is directed against a litigant or a third party, an appeal from the final decision will allow review of the district court\u2019s ruling. Only when the person who asserts a privilege is a non-litigant will an appeal from the final decision be inadequate.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>621 F.3d at 643; <em>accord Krane, </em>625 F.3d at 573 (noting that <em>Perlman </em>applied because \u201cfor all practical purposes, this appeal is [the non-party privilege holder\u2019s] only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>opportunity to seek review\u201d of the orders adverse to his privilege); <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum Comm. Futures Trading, </em>439 F.3d 740 (D.C.Cir.2006) (holding that <em>Perlman </em>permitted an immediate appeal because the government had complied in part, and intended to fully comply with a discovery order where records of trading activities of a non-party to an underlying criminal suit were to be disclosed in contravention to a claim of privilege and so its was the non-party\u2019s \u201clast chance to oppose the order\u201d). Accordingly, the fact that Harris is a party to the underlying litigation and therefore this is not his last opportunity for appellate review weighs against application of the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine to the case <em>sub </em>judice,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Additionally, the Seventh Circuit has said that \u201cPerlman relied in part on a conclusion that the rejection of an intervenor\u2019s claim is \u2018final\u2019 with respect to the intervenor, a position the Supreme Court rejected in <em>DiBella v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962), <em>when the intervenor is also a, putative defendant. </em>Although the Supreme Court has cited <em>Perlman </em>since <em>DiBella, </em>it has not reconsidered how much of <em>Perlman\u2019s </em>rationale survives.\u201d <em>In re Klein, </em>776 F.2d 628, 630 (7th Cir.1985) (emphasis added) (holding that the Seventh Circuit will allow interlocutory appeals, in accordance with its precedential opinions interpreting <em>Perl-man, </em>in the interest of judicial economy). Moreover, the Tenth Circuit has very recently noted that \u201c[w]e are aware of no case ... that extends <em>Perlman </em>beyond criminal grand jury proceedings.\u201d <em>In re: Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices Litigation, </em>641 F.3d 470 (10th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that Perkins Hospital is a disinterested non-party to this litigation on the basis that the State has no interest in refusing to obey the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>discovery orders and that Harris maintains a statutory patient-psychiatrist privilege in his treatment records, we, nonetheless, would not be persuaded to adopt <em>Perlman </em>given the facts of this case.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Here, Harris\u2019s claim to privilege in the records would be reviewable on appeal after a final judgment on the merits. Presumably, at the, as yet unscheduled, competency hearing, Harris would present \u201cevidence on the record,\u201d which the State could presumably rebut, both parties would be culling their evidence from the admissible portions of the treatment records and physician testimony. <em>See Peaks v. State, </em>419 Md. 239, 18 A.3d 917 (2011) (detailing the procedure and content of a competency hearing); <em>accord Roberts v.

The United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Supreme Court has held that the exercise of discretion over such pretrial orders is paramount, stating: \u201c[e]nforcement of a pretrial subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>must necessarily be committed to the sound discretion of the trial court since the necessity for the subpoena most often turns upon a determination of factual issues.\u201d <em>Sigma, </em>297 Md. at 671, 467 A.2d at 488 (quoting <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 690, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Finally, further delay of these and similar proceedings cannot be tolerated, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Klein:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">When people may appeal any order enforcing a subpoena, it is easy to oppose every subpoena and make broad claims.... The claims are very hard to resolve, because they lack the focus on particular documents and defenses that an adjudication in contempt would produce.

In the meantime the targets are free, memories of other witnesses are fading, evidence is disappearing.... <em>Calendra v. United States [United States v.

Accordingly, because Harris, a party and the alleged privilege holder, may seek an appellate determination of the propriety of the discovery orders after a final judgment, we are not inclined to take this opportunity to expand the pool of exceptions to our final judgment rule by annexation of the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

United States, </em>247 U.S. 7, 38 S.Ct. 417, 62 L.Ed. 950 (1918). This doctrine, although infrequently applied, is vital to ensure protection against disclosure of privileged information when exceptional circumstances apply. I would not sacrifice it on the altar of judicial efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">I agree with the majority that, in general, courts disfavor immediate review of discovery orders, instead preferring the subpoenaed party to submit to contempt if it wants to protect the documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">[W]hen an order of disclosure is directed against a person whose legal interests are affected, that person has a means to obtain appellate review: refuse to comply, be subjected to sanctions in contempt, and then appeal from the sanctions. That approach puts the objecting person\u2019s sincerity to the test by attaching a price to the demand for immediate review. Only serious and substantial disputes will interrupt the proceedings in the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>Wilson v. O\u2019Brien, </em>621 F.3d 641, 642-43 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The heart of the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine is that certain third-party custodians, with no personal interest in protecting confidentiality, will not hazard a contempt citation to protect the rights of another party. In those situations, the privilege holder is \u201cpowerless to avert the mischief of the order[.]\u201d <em>Perlman, </em>247 U.S. at 13, 38 S.Ct. at 419. <em>See also In re Air Crash at Belle Harbor, </em>490 F.3d 99, 106 (2nd Cir.2007) (\u201cIt is impossible for such an appellant to pursue the normal avenue of review\u2014submission to contempt\u2014because ... that appellant has not been required to do anything by the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The <em>Perlman </em>doctrine thus evolved to provide extra protections for important privileges against disclosure that, because of a third-party\u2019s ambivalence or indifference, would otherwise be violated. Under the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine, \u201ca discovery order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>directed at a disinterested third party is treated as an immediately appealable final order because the third party presumably lacks a sufficient stake in the proceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance.\u201d <em>Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 18 n. 11, 113 S.Ct. 447, 452 n. 11, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992). In <em>Perlman, </em>a privilege holder had, as a condition to dismissal of a patent infringement case, submitted exhibits to the clerk of the court, which were to be held under seal. In a later grand jury investigation, then District Court Judge Learned Hand subpoenaed that information, and Perl-man, the privilege holder, moved to intervene. The Supreme Court held that the denial of Perlman\u2019s motion was immediately appealable. <em>Perlman, </em>247 U.S. at 12, 38 S.Ct. at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Because the discussion in <em>Perlman </em>was limited, the doctrine has been perhaps better defined in subsequent cases. Courts applying <em>Perlman </em>have relied, primarily, on the unwillingness of certain third-party custodians to submit to contempt or otherwise protect the documents. For example, in <em>National Super Spuds v. New York Mercantile, </em>591 F.2d 174, 179 (2nd Cir.1979), the Second Circuit described <em>Perlman\u2019s </em>continuing justification as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">it was unlikely that the third party [in <em>Perlman </em>] would risk a contempt citation in order to allow immediate review of the appellant\u2019s claim of privilege. In fact it was not only unlikely but unimaginable. The only third party who could have helped Perlman was the clerk of the District Court for the Southern District of New York and we do not exactly see that clerk defying an order of then District Judge Learned Hand in order to assist the target of a grand jury perjury investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">(citing <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 691, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3099, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974)) (internal quotations omitted). <em>See also Burden-Meeks v. Welch, </em>319 F.3d 897, 899-900 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe idea behind <em>Perlman </em>is that someone who is neither a party to the suit nor a person aggrieved by the disclosure cannot be expected to put his own neck on the chopping block, standing in contempt of court just to help the privilege holder obtain appellate review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The majority seems to start off with a blanket rejection of <em>Perlman </em>as inconsistent with our general law against immediate appeal of disclosure orders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">At the outset, we note that the basic premise of <em>Perlman </em>is inconsistent with Maryland jurisprudence because: (1) generally discovery orders are not immediately appealable, and (2) if the issue is denial of a privilege, consistent with our jurisprudence those issues also are not immediately appealable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Majority op. at 324, 22 A.3d at 900 (citation omitted). It is inconsistent, to be sure, but all exceptions are inconsistent with the general rule, and the doctrine has been developed and recognized by other courts as a necessary and desirable exception. Like other \u201cexceptions,\u201d the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine allows a predictable but flexible system under which courts measure each case, in its factual and procedural context.</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">The majority then summarily rejects <em>Perlman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">[W]e are not inclined to adopt and apply <em>Perlman </em>to these facts because: (1) it is questionable whether <em>Perlman </em>survived the United State\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mohawk Industries;</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and (2) we are not bound to adopt <em>Perlman </em>because it did not address a constitutional principle that is binding on the State courts but rather addressed \u201ca matter of federal court appellate procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">I am troubled by the majority\u2019s suggestion that <em>Perlman </em>was effectively abolished by <em>Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, </em>558 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 599, 175 L.Ed.2d 458 (2009). In <em>Mohawk, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether a District Court\u2019s order compelling an employer to turn over documents that were subject to attorney-client privilege, was immediately reviewable under the collateral order doctrine. The Supreme Court held that the order was not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine, concluding immediate review was \u201cnot necessary to ensure effective review of orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>adverse to the attorney-client privilege^]\u201d <em>Mohawk, </em>558 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 606, 175 L.Ed.2d at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">One of the Court\u2019s primary justifications for its conclusion that immediate review was not necessary was <em>the existence of other remedies. </em>First, the Court concluded that a post-judgment appeal was sufficient in most cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">In our estimation, postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and assure the vitality of the attorney-client privilege. Appellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\"><em>Mohawk, </em>558 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 606-07, 175 L.Ed.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Second, the Court observed that, for cases when post-judgment review was not sufficient, there were alternate routes. Relevant here, the Court discussed two \u201csafety valves\u201d for a litigant wanting immediate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">[Ljitigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege ruling have several potential avenues of review apart from collateral order appeal.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] .... [I]n extraordinary <em>circumstances\u2014i.e., </em>when a disclosure order \u201camount[s] to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion,\u201d or otherwise works a manifest injustice\u2014a party may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">Another long-recognized option is for a party to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-13\"><em>Mohawk, </em>558 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 607-08, 175 L.Ed.2d at 469. Because these options existed \u201cfor promptly correcting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>serious errors,\u201d the Court was able to conclude that a general rule of delayed review would not \u201cimperil a substantial public interest\u201d or \u201csome particular value of a high order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 605, 175 L.Ed.2d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><em>Mohawk\u2019s </em>holding is thus conditioned on the existence of an alternate vehicle for immediate appeal in extreme cases where postjudgment appeal is not adequate. <em>Perlman </em>is such a vehicle. Indeed, <em>Perlman\u2019s </em>primary justification is that the contempt route\u2014perhaps the most universal \u201csafety valve\u201d identified by the <em>Mohawk </em>Court\u2014is <em>not sufficient to protect certain rights. </em>I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Supreme Court\u2019s approach in <em>Mohawk, </em>which was carefully constructed to preserve certain rights, should be interpreted as foreclosing avenues of review not expressly mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Indeed, the other cases which the majority cites on this point do not reject <em>Perlman, </em>but rather recognize a need for Perlman-like interlocutory appeals, if only in narrow circumstances. For example, the majority cites, as analogous authority, the 7th Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>In re Klein, </em>776 F.2d 628 (7th Cir.1985). There, although the court observed that the Supreme Court \u201chas not reconsidered how much of <em>Perlman\u2019s </em>rationale survives!,]\u201d it allowed the interlocutory appeal and reached the merits of the case. <em>Klein, </em>776 F.2d at 630, 632. <em>See also National Super Spuds, </em>591 F.2d at 179 (\u201c[Predictions of <em>Perlman\u2019s </em>demise would have been as exaggerated as those of Mark Twain\u2019s.\u201d). The majority\u2019s other cited cases merely emphasize that <em>Perlman </em>is a narrowly-applied doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Wilson, </em>621 F.3d at 642 <em>(Perlman </em>appeal allowed \u201c[o]nly when the person who asserts a privilege is a non-litigant[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">For the reasons above, I disagree with the majority and conclude that <em>Perlman </em>appeals, an exception to the general rule on appeal of discovery orders, serve an important purpose. The majority broadly rejects the <em>Perlman </em>doctrine, without, I suggest, a full analysis of the doctrine and its purpose. I submit that <em>Perlman </em>recognized a significant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>persisting problem with regard to third-party custodians of privileged documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Testimonial privileges serve important public interests<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and their protection depends upon consistent and predictable judicial decision-making. As the Supreme Court has explained, although in a different context:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">Making the promise of confidentiality contingent upon a trial judge\u2019s later evaluation of the relative importance of the patient\u2019s interest in privacy and the evidentiary need for disclosure would eviscerate the effectiveness of the privilege. [I]f the purpose of the privilege is to be served, the participants in the confidential conversation \u201cmust be able to predict with some degree of certainty whether particular discussions will be protected. An uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Jaffee v. Redmond, </em>518 U.S. 1, 17-18, 116 S.Ct. 1928, 1932, 135 L.Ed.2d 337 (1996) (citations omitted). In exceptional circumstances, like <em>Perlman </em>and its progeny, appellate review of an order requiring disclosure of alleged privileged information is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>My view does not mean that Harris is entitled to a <em>Perlman </em>appeal. Harris has pled incompetency, and accordingly he has no privilege with respect to his psychiatric records. Under Maryland Code, (1973, 2006 Repl.
