Ann.Code <em>art. </em>25, \u00a7 8(a) which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">(a) ... [T]he County Commissioners of Cecil County, in addition to, but not in substitution of, the powers which may have been or may hereafter be granted them, shall have the full power and authority to acquire by lease, purchase or condemnation real or leasehold property needed for any public purpose and to erect buildings thereon for the benefit of the county and to sell at public or private sale or lease any real or leasehold property belonging to the county when in their discretion it is no longer needed for public use, and to execute and acknowledge any and all deeds and/or other instruments necessary to effect and complete such lease, purchase or sale of real or leasehold property!/]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Appellants are residents of Cecil County who argue that the above quoted statute prohibits the Board of Cecil County Commissioners (the Board), Appellee, from selling County owned water and wastewater facilities to the company that has been granted a franchise to provide water services. The Circuit Court for Cecil County rejected that argument in a Memorandum Opinion that concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">The Board of Cecil County Commissioners have properly determined that the water and wastewater Facilities are no longer needed for public use by Cecil County and should not continue to be owned and maintained by the County as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>county-owned property. In doing so, the Commissioners have not exceeded their discretionary authority as permitted by Article 25, \u00a7 8(a), by the enactment of the Resolutions on October 7, 2008 providing for the sale of the Facilities to Artesian, a privately owned, publicly regulated utility company, for the continued use and benefit of the citizens of Cecil County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">After Appellants noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, both Appellants and Appellee filed Petitions for Writs of Certiorari. We granted those petitions. 411 Md. 598, 984 A.2d 243 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Appellants argue that we should answer \u201cno\u201d to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">Whether Annotated Code of Maryland, Article 25 \u00a7 8(a) authorizes the Cecil County Commissioners to sell operating County water and wastewater facilities as \u201cno longer needed for public use\u201d when they must continue to be operated by the new owners as water and wastewater facilities or revert to County ownership and operation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The Board argues that the question should be rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">Does the \u201cPublic Need Test\u201d as set forth in Article 25, Section 8(a) and clarified in <em>South Easton Neighborhood Association (\u201cSENA\u201d), Inc., et al. v. Town of Easton, Maryland, </em>387 Md. 468, 876 A.2d 58 (2005), permit the Commissioners to convey County-owned water and waste-water facilities to privately owned, publicly-regulated utilities, when the Commissioners determined they no longer needed to own the facilities because they previously granted exclusive water and wastewater franchises to those companies exclusively to provide water and wastewater services in the area served by the facilities?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall hold that <em>art. </em>25, \u00a7 8(a) does not prohibit the Board from conveying the property at issue.

On August 19, 2008, the Board of County Commissioners of Cecil County (the \u201cBoard\u201d or \u201cCounty\u201d) voted to grant a water services and a wastewater franchise to Artesian Water Maryland, Inc. and Artesian Wastewater Maryland, Inc., respectively (for ease of reference, both companies are referred to collectively as \u201cArtesian\u201d). On September 18, 2008, Petitioners, Appleton Regional Community Alliance, et al. (\u201cAppleton\u201d), filed the initial petition for judicial review of the decision of the Countyf.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">On October 7, 2008, the Board approved additional resolutions and a related Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) that provides for the sale and transfer to Artesian of various county-owned water and wastewater facilities, along with associated parcels of real property, easement rights, and other water and wastewater system assets. On November 4, 2008, Appleton filed a second petition for judicial review specifically addressing the purposed transfers of county property and assets[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The Franchise Agreements include the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0I\">Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the County\u2019s grant of the Franchise to Franchisee, and Franchisee\u2019s contractual undertaking to provide Water Service to Customers in the Franchise Area pursuant to and consistent with Applicable Laws, pursuant to the terms, covenants, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and the adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the County and Franchisee agree as follows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">3 GRANT OF FRANCHISE; LIMITS AND RESERVATIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>3.1 Generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">(b) Franchisee and County shall execute a definitive agreement for the transfer of the County\u2019s water facilities within the Service Area as described in Exhibit A from the County to Franchisee in accordance with the terms reflected in the Letter of Intent at Exhibit F.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">11.1 County Approval of Transfer of Control Required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">(a) No Transfer of Control of Franchisee may occur without the prior written consent of the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">(b) No Transfer of Control of the Franchise may occur without the prior written consent of the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">11.2 Other Actions Affecting Franchise</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">(a) Franchisee shall not enter into any agreement or contract with any Person which materially affects Franchisee\u2019s performance of its obligations under the Franchise and this Agreement, or abandon or discontinue the exercise of the Franchise, and the operation of the Water System within the Franchise Area, as a whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">12.1 Termination Events.

In a Memorandum Opinion filed on July 27, 2009, the Circuit Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Indeed, there can be little doubt that the Facilities, which provide necessary services of the County, are and will continue to be needed and operated for public purpose and benefit. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the language and intent of Article 25 \u00a7 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">.... The question then, is whether the legislative discretionary power and authority of the Commissioners is so limited that it applies solely to property no longer needed for any public use, such as surplus property.... However, the statute can certainly be construed to permit the sale of property used by the public, but not <em>necessary </em>for public use, such as a street or alley, or a portion thereof, where other means of access may be available. <em>Inlet </em>Assoc. <em>v. Assateague House Condo. Assn., et al.[] </em>313 Md. 413[, 545 A.2d 1296] (1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">Both Parties rely on the Court of Appeals decision in <em>South Easton Neighborhood Association, Inc., et al. v. Town of Easton, Maryland, </em>387 Md. 468[, 876 A.2d 58] (2005) <em>(\u201cSENA </em>\u201d). The Court in <em>SENA </em>rejected the proposition that because a certain street in Easton (Adkins Avenue) was in continued use by the public, that in and of itself would foreclose the Town of Easton\u2019s discretionary authority to close the street and sell the right-of-way to a hospital under Article 23A, \u00a7 2(b)(24). The Court observed, \u201c[r]ecognizing an absolute no-use standard would permit one person to walk the length of Adkins Avenue, or any other public right of way, and thereby foreclose any conveyance of the roadbed, regardless of the Town Council\u2019s legislative determinations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 495 [876 A.2d 58]). This, of course, would tend to undermine Petitioners\u2019 contention that \u201cno longer needed for public use\u201d equates to a finding that the property must be surplus. In <em>SENA </em>there was ample evidence that the public had access to and continued to use the subject street on a daily basis, even though it was not the sole means of access for various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>property owners in the vicinity. Thus, the continued public use argument had failed to persuade the Court of Appeals that a legislative decision of the Town of Easton to transfer the roadbed in Easton Memorial Hospital was somehow an abuse of discretion under Article 23A, \u00a7 2(b)(24).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Here, the County, in the exercise of its statutory discretion, made a legislative determination that: a) it would franchise the operation of its water and wastewater systems to a private entity, and b) it no longer needed the subject property for the existing public use and would convey it to the private entity, consistent with the franchise award to operate those water and wastewater systems for the continued public benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">It has already been determined that the County, in the proper exercise of its legislative function may grant a franchise to a private entity to provide water and wastewater services to its citizens. As the County now suggests, that made superfluous the continuing \u201cpublic use\u201d of the facilities by the County by its lawful action in granting the franchises to Artesian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">In a practical sense, the Facilities to be transferred are in fact no longer needed for the public use <em>by Cecil County. </em>Artesian, by providing, among other things, the personnel, administration, necessary upkeep and capital improvements, engineering expertise and flexibility as to discharge credits, as well as assuming major liabilities and obligations providing a financial benefit to the County, will essentially remove the existing water and wastewater facilities from the County needs inventory, even though the Facilities will continue to be maintained for a public use, purpose and benefit to the citizens of Cecil County. The question is whether Article 25, \u00a7 8 imposes a narrow limitation on the discretionary authority of the Commissioners to a degree that they may not sell or lease property to a private entity if the property continues to be maintained for public use, benefit and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>purpose. Although the [Appellants] seek to distinguish the holding in <em>SENA </em>from the instant matter as public property \u201cno longer needed for public use\u201d as opposed to public property <em>\u201cstill </em>needed for public use,\u201d this Court does not interpret <em>SENA </em>to represent such a limitation on the discretionary authority of the Board of Commissioners. Indeed, the <em>SENA </em>court reasoned that the street bed to be transferred would continue to be used for a public purpose and benefit as a hospital, facilitating emergency and outpatient care services. <em>Id. </em>at 499 [876 A.2d 58]. Although the particular public purpose and benefit may have changed, the property nevertheless continued to be maintained for a public use, benefit and purpose. Accordingly, the [Appellants\u2019] position is without merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">(Emphasis in original. Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The record includes a JOINT STIPULATION that \u201cAppellants now challenge only those portions of the Franchise Agreements and attachments thereto that provide for, or relate to, the sale and transfer of County water and wastewater assets[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Although they concede that the Board is expressly authorized by <em>art. </em>25, \u00a7 3D(b) to grant franchises for \u201cwater and sewerage systems in order to assure delivery of [such] services to its citizens, to avoid duplication of facilities, ... and to promote the general health and welfare by providing for adequate water and sewerage systems,\u201d Appellants argue that the Board is prohibited by <em>art. </em>25, \u00a7 8(a) from selling facilities that will <em>continue </em>to provide essential services to the citizens of Cecil County. According to Appellants, the Board does not have authority to sell county property pursuant to a transaction in which (a) the County has granted a water and wastewater services franchise to a private company; (b) the property will be sold to the franchisee, who will continue to use the property to provide the very same essential services to the citizens of Cecil County, and (c) the County has a right to reenter the property and resume providing the same public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>services that it had been providing prior to the sale. According to the Board, however, in the words of its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">The Public Need Test requires that two findings be apparent from the record: first, that the governing body has identified and considered the existing public use property in question; and second, that the governing body has determined that it no longer needs to own and operate that property for the existing public use. <em>See SENA, </em>387 Md. at 489, 876 A.2d at 71.... The facts of this case are on all fours with <em>SENA.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">As we apply the well settled principles of statutory interpretation to these arguments, we (1) attempt to harmonize the Board\u2019s statutory authority to grant water and wastewater franchises with the Board\u2019s \u201cadditional\u201d statutory authority to sell property when, in the Board\u2019s \u201cdiscretion,\u201d the property is no longer needed for public use, (2) presume that the legislature intended that both <em>art. </em>25, \u00a7 3D(b) and <em>art. </em>25, \u00a7 8(a) would operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and (3) avoid a construction that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense. <em>See, e.g., Condon v. State of Maryland-University of Maryland, </em>332 Md. 481, 491-92, 632 A.2d 753, 757-58 (1993); <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">We are persuaded that <em>art. 25, </em>\u00a7 3D(b) and <em>art. 25, </em>\u00a7 8(a) can be harmonized. As we see it, <em>art. 25, </em>\u00a7 8(a) is an express grant of \u201cadditional\u201d authority to the Board. We therefore disagree with the argument that <em>art. </em>25, \u00a7 8(a) prohibits the Board from exercising the \u201cdiscretion\u201d that was exercised in the case at bar. As the Court of Special Appeals has stated, \u201cdiscretion signifies choice. Consideration of the various elements of the problem does not preordain a single permissible conclusion.\u201d <em>Hart v. Miller, </em>65 Md.App. 620, 625-26, 501 A.2d 872, 875-76 (1985). <em>Art. 25, </em>\u00a7 3D(b) authorized the Board to grant the franchises, as well as to take appropriate action in order to \u201cavoid the duplication of facilities,\u201d while <em>art. 25, </em>\u00a7 8(a) provided the Board with the discretion to structure the transaction for maximum public benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>As to the issue of whether Appellants\u2019 interpretation of <em>art. 25, \u00a7 </em>8(a) is unreasonable, the Board argues, in the words of its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">Appellants would permit the Commissioners the power to grant exclusive franchises to Artesian but would deny them the statutory authority to convey the very systems which would allow Artesian to carry out the services attendant to those franchises. Further, having granted lawful water and wastewater Franchises within the franchise area, the County would be constrained to own and to operate Facilities, \u201cfor public use,\u201d <em>in perpetuity, </em>in effect <em>creating two operating and competing water and wastewater systems within the same geographic area. </em>The statute cannot, it should not, and it need not be read to create such an implausible result. <em>See Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991) (recognizing that statutes should generally be interpreted to produce \u201creasonable\u201d rather than \u201cabsurd\u201d or \u201cextraordinary\u201d results).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">(Emphasis in original). We agree with this argument. It would be unreasonable and illogical to hold that, although expressly authorized to grant the franchises, the Board is prohibited by <em>art. 25 </em>\u00a7 8(a) from performing its duty \u201cto avoid the duplication of [water and sewerage] facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that <em>art. 25, </em>\u00a7 8(a) does not prohibit the Board from entering into the Asset Purchase Agreements at issue. We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">HARRELL, BATTAGLIA and GREENE, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">HARRELL, J., dissenting, in which BATTAGLIA and GREENE, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">I dissent. In reaching its holding \u201cthat <em>art. 25, </em>\u00a7 8(a) does not prohibit the Board from entering into the Asset Purchase Agreements at issue,\u201d 420 Md. 172, 184, 21 A.3d 1116, 1123 (2011) the Majority opinion reads the phrase \u201cno longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>needed for public use\u201d out of the applicable Maryland statute in its attempt to \u201charmonize\u201d Maryland Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Art. 25 \u00a7 8(a) with Art. 25 \u00a7 3D(b). The Majority\u2019s succinct analysis disregards, by failing to analogize, distinguish or otherwise address, this Court\u2019s 2005 decision in <em>South Easton Neighborhood Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Town of Easton (\u201cSENA\u201d), </em>387 Md. 468, 489, 876 A.2d 58, 71 (2005), which considered a similar provision of the Maryland Code. Application of <em>SENA </em>to the facts and relevant statutory law of the present case compels the conclusion that the Board of County Commissioners of Cecil County, Maryland, does not have the authority to sell the water and wastewater facilities at issue, as the facilities are, and continue to be, \u201cneeded for public use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In August 2008, the Board of County Commissioners of Cecil County, Maryland (\u201cthe Board\u201d) granted franchises, through certain \u201cFranchise Agreements,\u201d to Artesian Water Maryland, Inc. and Artesian Wastewater Maryland, Inc. (collectively \u201cArtesian\u201d) for exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services in the \u201cOriginal Elkton West Service Area,\u201d which did not have its own service facilities. Both Artesian entities are privately-owned, for-profit, water utility companies. Art. 25 \u00a7 3D(b), among other things, gives the Board the authority to grant one or more franchises for water and/or wastewater systems. The Franchise Agreements contemplated the expansion of the service area, as well as a sale of the facilities within the expanded area.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Pursuant to Art. 25 \u00a7 8(b), the Board held a public hearing on 30 September 2008, which was advertised in The Cecil Whig, a local newspaper, two weeks prior to the hearing. At this hearing, a member of the Cecil County Chamber of Commerce testified that the transfer would benefit the County and its residents by freeing-up capital and wastewater discharge credits, as well as reducing county debt and taxpayer subsidies. Certain county residents questioned, however, the authority of the Board to sell the land, arguing it was needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>for public use, quoting Art. 25, \u00a7 8(a), which states that the Board may sell property when it is \u201cno longer needed for public use[.]\u201d These taxpayers also noted concerns regarding rate increases and service level decreases. In response to the citizens\u2019 questions and complaints, a member of the Board stated merely that it has \u201cplenary power under Article 25, Section 8 of the Code to sell and convey real property when [the Board] deem[s] it to be in the public interest to do so.\u201d Not once did any of the members of the Board address the requirement that the property be \u201cno longer needed for public use.\u201d Following this hearing, the Board adopted three resolutions, in October 2008, approving the Asset Purchase Agreements, effectuating the expansion and sale of the facilities. Members of the community, joined as Appleton Regional Community Alliance (\u201cAppleton\u201d), filed a petition which sought, among other things, to enjoin the Board from selling the facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">II. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The relevant provisions of the Maryland Code are Art. 25, \u00a7 3D(b) and Art. 25, \u00a7 8(a). Section 3D provides county commissioners the power to \u201cdisplace or limit competition\u201d in certain sectors, such as public transportation, water and sewerage, and publicly-owned or leased lands. Subsection (b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">(1) It has been and shall continue to be the policy of the State to authorize the county commissioners of each county to displace or limit competition in the area of water and sewerage systems in order to assure delivery of adequate, economical, and efficient services to its citizens, to avoid duplication of facilities, and to provide for the health and safety of its citizens....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">(2) (i) The county commissioners of each county have the authority to grant one or more franchises or enter into contracts for water and sewerage systems on exclusive or nonexclusive basis to any person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\u00a7 3D(b). Section 8(a) grants additional powers to the Board specifically to purchase and sell public land. The board may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u201csell at public or private sale or lease any real or leasehold property belonging to the county when in their discretion it is no longer needed for public use ....\u201d\u00a7 8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The Legislature acted presumably with full knowledge of the interplay between these two sections and their respective policy implications. <em>See Bd. of Educ. of Garrett County v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 68, 453 A.2d 1185, 1189 (1982) (\u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to have had, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\u201d). To the extent that two statutes are vague or ambiguous, it is well-settled that they should be read together, within the entire statutory scheme, to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature in a way that will not lead to absurd consequences. <em>See Mayor of Rockville v. Rylyns Enters., Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 549-51, 814 A.2d 469, 491 (2002) (\u201c[W]e interpret the meaning and effect of the language in light of the objectives and purposes of the provision enacted. Such an interpretation must be reasonable and consonant with logic and common sense.\u201d). Further, courts must ensure that no word or phrase is \u201crendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Lendo, </em>295 Md. at 63, 453 A.2d at 1189; <em>see also Hurst v. V &amp; M of Virginia, Inc., </em>293 Md. 575, 578-79, 446 A.2d 55, 57 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Although the Majority is correct in stating that \u00a7 3D(b) and \u00a7 8(a) can be harmonized in a way that avoids \u201ca construction that is illogical, or inconsistent with common sense,\u201d <em>see </em>420 Md. at 183, 21 A.3d at 1122 (2011) (citations omitted), the Majority opinion\u2019s attempt at singing that harmony is off-key. To be sure, \u00a7 8(a) does provide discretion to the Board to \u201cstructure the transaction for maximum public benefit,\u201d 420 Md. at 183, 21 A.3d at 1123 (2011); however, this discretion is limited to the sale or transfer of properties \u201cno longer needed for public use.\u201d \u00a7 8(a). The Majority opinion\u2019s analysis elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>nates this limitation from the statute altogether and renders the phrase nugatory, contrary to well-settled rules of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In analyzing the sale of public property by the Board, the primary question for the Court is whether the property is still \u201cneeded for public use.\u201d <em>See, e.g., SENA, </em>387 Md. 468, 876 A.2d 58 (2005) (road closure); <em>Inlet Assocs. v. Assateague House Condo. Ass\u2019n, </em>313 Md. 413, 432, 545 A.2d 1296, 1306 (1988) (sale of public alley and riparian rights); <em>Baltimore County v.

County Comm\u2019rs of Anne Arundel County, </em>212 Md. 543, 129 A.2d 847 (1957) (proposed purchase of land under a public wharf to construct pipelines). Although the Board need not state explicitly the words \u201cno longer needed for public use,\u201d an equivalent determination that there is no longer a public need for the property is a prerequisite to a valid transfer of the property. <em>See Inlet Assocs., </em>313 Md. at 431, 545 A.2d at 1305 (\u201cWhile [sections] of the City Charter separately authorize the City Council to close or abandon a dedicated street, a determination that there is no longer any public need for the street is a requisite to the validity of the Council\u2019s action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">III. <em>SENA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The parties to the present case rely heavily on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>SENA </em>to support their respective positions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>explicating its decision, however, the Majority opinion exerts little effort to analogize, distinguish, or explain this case. The issue in <em>SENA, </em>similar to the issue in the present case, was whether the requirement that the local government must determine that a public road \u201cis no longer needed for any public use\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prior to conveying public property, prohibits the local government from \u201cconveying public property to a private person or entity if a limited minority of [the] public uses the public property for convenience.\u201d <em>SENA, </em>387 Md. at 476-77, 876 A.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In <em>SENA, </em>Easton\u2019s Town Council decided to close Adkins Avenue and transfer the land upon which the street laid to a local hospital for an expansion project and to a religious temple. <em>See SENA, </em>387 Md. at 482, 876 A.2d at 66. Relying on several findings of fact, the Town Council determined ultimately that the road was \u201cno longer needed for any public use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These facts were incorporated in Ordinance No. 466 and \u201cincluded: 1) Adkins Avenue is used as a convenience by area residents in lieu of Wye Avenue; [and] 2) SHS would maintain a means of access of transit between [two streets] in the event that an emergency would close access.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the Town Council found that \u201cclosing a portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Adkins Avenue was in the best interest of the public in providing improved emergency medical services to the Town,\u201d and that there was no benefit to retaining public ownership of the portion to be closed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The citizens proposed an absolute no-use threshold before the sale of publicly-used land may occur, arguing that because the road was traveled on\u2014albeit only infrequently\u2014the Town Council could not transfer the land. <em>See SENA, </em>387 Md. at 495, 876 A.2d at 74. The Court dismissed this argument as ignoring unreasonably two principles of statutory interpretation: (1) it replaces \u201cneeded\u201d with \u201cused,\u201d thereby changing the plain meaning of the statute; and (2) it would produce absurd results by foreclosing any conveyance regardless of any legislative determinations. <em>See id. </em>The Court also dismissed the citizens\u2019 argument that it was not clear from the record that the Town determined that the road was \u201cno longer needed for public use\u201d because Ordinance No.466 did not use those exact words, explaining that the Ordinance went through several levels of approval \u201cwithout so much as a suggestion for any other future public use.\u201d <em>See SENA, </em>387 Md. at 495, 876 A.2d at 74-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The facts of <em>SENA </em>are distinguishable readily from the present case in several ways. For one, the road in <em>SENA </em>was such that it was rarely used and citizens had other reasonable alternatives to circumnavigate the area. <em>See SENA, </em>387 Md. at 479-80, 876 A.2d at 64-65. The water and wastewater facilities in the present case, on the other hand, are the sole source of water for residents in each facility\u2019s service area. Continuous use and need is further emphasized by Sections 6.1 and 4.5(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreements,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>that the County will operate the facilities as normal on the date immediately preceding the transfer, and, on the date of transfer, Artesian will begin operation seamlessly. These provisions also reinforce the conclusion that there is neither an alternative to the specific facilities in the franchise area, nor a parallel alternative that would give the same service and rate guarantees as if the facilities had not been privatized. <em>See SENA, </em>387 Md. at 485, 876 A.2d at 68 (the finding of an adequate parallel alternative may support the determination that the public use is \u201cno longer needed\u201d). As the frequency of use and availability of alternatives for the water treatment facilities at issue in the present case differ greatly from those of the road in <em>SENA, </em>the two cases are distinguishable in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Much like a road is operated by a Town or County for the benefit of the public at large, water conveyance and treatment facilities operated by the County are for the benefit, use, and convenience of the public. <em>See Inlet Assocs., </em>313 Md. at 430, 545 A.2d at 1305 (applying principles of public roads with publicly-owned riparian land). Whether to close or sell a publicly owned facility or street, therefore, \u201cnecessarily turns \u2018upon considerations of public benefit, and not by barter and sale of private interests____\u2019 \u201d <em>Inlet Assocs., </em>313 Md. at 431, 545 A.2d at 1305 (quoting <em>Perellis v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>190 Md. 86, 95, 57 A.2d 341, 346 (1948)); <em>see also Rescue Fire Co. of Cambridge v. County Comm\u2019rs of Dorchester County, </em>188 Md. 354, 357, 52 A.2d 733, 735 (1947) (counties, incorporated towns, and cities are public corporations \u201cwith political powers, to be exercised for purposes connected with the public good\u201d and are the \u201csole trustees of the public interest\u201d); <em>Van Witsen v. Gutman, </em>79 Md. 405, 411, 29 A. 608, 610 (1894) (\u201cThe Legislature has the power to direct that private property shall be taken for the public use\u201d). The Town in <em>SENA </em>noted that the benefit of closing the road outweighed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>benefit of retaining public ownership\u2014i.e., the increased quality of medical care projected from the proposed use is more important than the convenience <em>vel non </em>of a small number of residents. <em>SENA </em>387 Md. at 482, 876 A.2d at 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">In the present case, however, the opposing benefits are not weighed as easily as in <em>SENA. </em>On the one hand, the Board claims that the County will save nine million dollars, as well as the twenty-seven million dollars required to make capital improvements to the facilities. On the other hand, Appleton contends that the franchises will lead to rate increases and high density development in the franchise areas. As a private company, Artesian is held accountable to its investors and not necessarily the citizens using the facilities; therefore, as the argument goes, increasing profits may outweigh maintaining reasonable rates. Another arguable potential negative effect of privatization is that, eventually, Artesian may be unable to maintain the facilities to the proper standards or could go bankrupt. The Board included reversionary provisions in the Asset Purchase Agreement to safeguard against any service stoppage, which evidences the Board\u2019s emphasis on ensuring continuous operation of the facilities as an essential service to County residents. Accordingly, it is not clear whether the benefit to the County outweighs the costs that the citizens may bear, unlike the tradeoff in <em>SENA </em>where the potential benefits outweighed clearly the potential costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In the present case, the public use of the facilities forecloses conveyance of the facilities. This outcome, however, does not foreclose <em>any </em>transfer of the water or wastewater facilities, nor does it mandate an \u201cabsolute no-use standard,\u201d as the Board suggests. Section 3D(b) authorizes county commissioners to grant one or more franchises for water and sewerage systems. Section 8(a) then provides county commissioners with discretion to sell or transfer publicly owned property that is \u201cno longer needed for public use.\u201d It is still possible, therefore, to transfer facilities, at the discretion of the Board, in the first instance (under \u00a7 3D(b))\u2014when the facilities are not yet in public use\u2014or after a finding that already in use facilities are \u201cno longer needed for public use\u201d (under \u00a7 8(a)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>For example, the \u201cOriginal Elkton West Service Area,\u201d where no County-owned or operated facilities were located, could be sold to Artesian as the service area is not yet \u201cneeded for public use.\u201d When the County expanded the franchise area to include service areas that had existing service facilities, however, pursuant to \u00a7 8(a), the option to sell the entire franchise area was unavailable. In this way, the two sections may be harmonized to avoid rendering the phrase \u201cno longer needed for public use\u201d nugatory, while giving the Board discretion (if exercised properly) to sell public facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">IV. <em>Public Use Status</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The primary emphasis in analyzing statutes mandating a determination that property is \u201cno longer needed for public use,\u201d before transfer to a private owner is permitted, is on the actual nature of the use of the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cPublic use\u201d is a somewhat vague term and \u201cthere is \u2018no satisfactory single clear-cut rule ... which can decide all cases....\u2019\u201d <em>SENA, </em>387 Md. at 492, 876 A.2d at 73 (2005) (quoting <em>Green v.

Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Cecil County did not have authorization to sell the water and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>wastewater facilities, being that the facilities are still in continuous public use.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Judge BATTAGLIA and Judge GREENE authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">.

The test articulated by the Court in <em>SENA </em>states there are two intertwined legal concepts in play. <em>Id. </em>\"The first is the authority of a municipal corporation to convey governmental real property,\u201d i.e., whether there is either inherent or statutory authority. <em>Id. </em>\"The second issue is the authority of a municipal corporation to close permanently a public street.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applied to the present case, the Court must determine whether the Board has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>authority to convey public property in the first instance and then whether the Board has the authority to privatize these specific water and wastewater facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Appleton relies on factual distinctions between <em>SENA </em>and the present case. In its reply brief, Appleton notes that the two cases are different fundamentally, as <em>SENA </em>deals with a \"single obsolete roadbed,\" and the present case deals with \u201cCecil County\u2019s vital water and wastewater facilities.\u201d Further, Appleton points out that the closure and conveyance of a road bed is very different from a sale of an entire water and wastewater system under the condition that it continue to operate as a water and wastewater system serving the public. <em>See infra </em>420 Md. at 178-80, 21 A.3d at 1120-21 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">.
