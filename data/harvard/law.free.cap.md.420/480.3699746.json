Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). It is undisputed that Petitioner Warren Lee Ballard received proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings and validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before interrogation began. The question we must answer is whether, mid-way through the interrogation, Petitioner unequivocally invoked his right to counsel when he uttered the words, \u201cYou mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that those words constituted an unequivocal invocation of the right to counsel. Therefore, pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny, the interrogating detective was required at that moment to cease all questioning. Rather than do so, the detective continued the interrogation and elicited statements from Petitioner that he was entitled to have suppressed as the product of the <em>Mi</em>randasiolative interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Petitioner was tried on an agreed statement of facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreed-upon facts disclose that, on December 13, 2007, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>approximately 10:30 p.m., in Salisbury, Maryland, James Miller contacted authorities upon finding the body of his sister, Shirley Smith, in the apartment they shared. Dr. Pamela Southall, Assistant Medical Examiner, performed an autopsy on December 14, 2007, and discovered Ms. Smith had a broken hyoid bone in her neck. Based on that finding, Dr. Southall determined that the manner of death was homicide by asphyxia, the signs of which were consistent with strangulation. After learning of Dr. Southall\u2019s findings, police began a criminal investigation into Ms. Smith\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">On December 27, 2007, the police found Petitioner in possession of the SIM card<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> associated with Ms. Smith\u2019s cellular phone account, and took him into custody. Four days later, Detective Kaiser conducted a videotaped interrogation of Petitioner, during which he made several incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Petitioner was indicted on charges of first degree murder and related offenses. He filed a motion to suppress a portion of what he disclosed during that interrogation. Petitioner, through counsel, acknowledged at the outset of the hearing on the motion that he was \u201cMirandized\u201d and waived the <em>Miranda </em>rights. The interrogating officer, Detective Kaiser, did not testify but an excerpt of the videotaped confession was played for the court and a transcript of the excerpt portion was entered into evidence. The parties agreed that the tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>scribed excerpt, with some handwritten corrections on it, accurately reflected the content of the portion of the interrogation played for the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The first page of the transcript excerpt, which is numbered page 27, begins with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">[Petitioner]: I wasn\u2019t upset, she wasn\u2019t upset, nobody was upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">Det. Kaiser: So what, so then you\u2019re telling me that it was a mistake of what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">[Petitioner]: Pm saying when I left ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">Det. Kaiser: Let\u2019s back up, OK?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">[Petitioner]: No one was hurt, no one was injured when I left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">Det. Kaiser: Let\u2019s go back up. Explain to me why this happened. Because I need an explanation from you. I know what the evidence is telling me. I already know that. DNA collected from various parts of her body matches DNA from your body. OK? Matching up somewhat of what we just talked about, but there\u2019s still a missing point here. And a missing factor in this whole thing right now. OK? And we need to sit here and work this out because what I don\u2019t want to happen is, you know, let\u2019s not read the evidence. I think there\u2019s a really important explanation as to why this occurred. We know what happened, we need to know why. Was it rough sex? That got out of hand? She have a weapon? Did she come at you with a weapon? Those are key factors to this Warren. You need to understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>[Petitioner]: I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Det. Kaiser: Very very important key factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">[Petitioner]: Oh man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">Det. Kaiser: The only way for [you,] Warren to deal with this is to let it out, explain your side of the story so that you can sleep at night. And you can have a clear head, that\u2019s it. Tell me what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">[Petitioner]: You mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">Det. Kaiser: What benefit is that going to have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO1\">[Petitioner]: I\u2019d feel more comfortable with one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">Det. Kaiser: Well, you understand that by doing that, OK, it kind of cuts our ties off somewhat, OK, and um you don\u2019t have to say a word. Pm going to explain something to you here. You know, your opportunity to explain why this happened is going to be out the door. OK? And I think that, and I\u2019m telling you right now, OK and it came out of my mouth, that the explanation of why this happened is a very very important aspect of this investigation. OK? But in order for us to talk and you to tell me that, OK, now that you just said what you just said, is going to throw it all away. I want you to keep that in mind. This is your opportunity. There\u2019s not going to be another opportunity. I\u2019m willing to work with you here. All right? So, before we go any further, you had just made mention a couple of minutes ago that you wanted an attorney, that\u2019s what you told me, OK, so that stops me. OK. And if you feel like you want to say any more, which I think it\u2019s probably in your best interest to, OK, we\u2019re going to go back over some of your rights, OK, that you have. But that\u2019s your option. Now, what I want to know is, do you want to explain to me and give me an explanation as to what happened that night? [Petitioner]: Let me use the bathroom and I\u2019ll tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">Det. Kaiser: Huh? Hold on, hold on, don\u2019t say a word. What do you want to do? Do you want an attorney present with you right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>[Petitioner]: I\u2019ll talk to you when I use the bathroom, alright. I don\u2019t need no attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">Det. Kaiser: You don\u2019t want an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">[Petitioner]: Mm mm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">Det. Kaiser: Do you understand and know what you\u2019re doing right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">[Petitioner]: Hanging myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">Det. Kaiser: No no no no, do you understand and know what you\u2019re doing at this point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">[Petitioner]: I guess, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">Det. Kaiser: Well it\u2019s yes or no. Do you understand and know what you\u2019re doing? Let me just reiterate this form to you. OK?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">At that point, Detective Kaiser reissued the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and Petitioner indicated that he understood his rights. He was then permitted to use the restroom. When Petitioner returned, Detective Kaiser reconfirmed that Petitioner understood the rights explained to him and \u201cwanted to get this off [his] chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">The transcribed excerpt of the interrogation that was admitted at the suppression hearing does not disclose much of what Petitioner said during the remainder of the interrogation. The complete transcript of the interrogation admitted at trial discloses that Petitioner made a series of statements to Detective Kaiser admitting that he and Ms. Smith had an altercation, he \u201cdid a choke hold on her,\u201d he \u201cmay have hit her in the mouth,\u201d and she ended up \u201claying on the bed\u201d but was still breathing when he ran out of the apartment. At Detective Kaiser\u2019s suggestion, Petitioner wrote a letter of apology stating that he was \u201csorry that this could have happened,\u201d it was \u201can accident on [his] behalf,\u201d he \u201cnever knew that this was so serious,\u201d and he \u201cstill can\u2019t believe that it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">Petitioner argued at the suppression hearing that, by uttering the words, \u201cYou mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this,\u201d he unequivocally and unambiguously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>invoked his rights to counsel and to silence. He focused his argument, though, on the invocation of the right to counsel and argued that, under <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), Detective Kaiser was required to cease all questioning as soon as Petitioner uttered those words.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The court denied the motion. The court agreed with the State that Petitioner\u2019s statement was an ambiguous and equivocal statement that did not sufficiently invoke Petitioner\u2019s right to counsel and, consequently, his subsequent statements to Detective Kaiser were not the product of an <em>Edwards </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider the suppression ruling. The court heard argument on the motion and again denied the motion to suppress, explaining in detail its reasons for that ruling. Among other things, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">Now, I had previously concluded that it was not clear and unambiguous, that it was, rather, equivocal and ambiguous, and I think in this regard also, I should make clear it\u2019s not the words alone but rather the context of the words and in this particular case, it\u2019s not only the typed word on a piece of paper, but I also heard [Petitioner\u2019s interview with Detective Kaiser, so I also have the opportunity to consider his inflection, of the tone and things of that sort, and I concluded at the earlier hearing that it was an ambiguous assertion of right to counsel, and I believe I still feel that way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">At the subsequent trial on an agreed statement of facts, the court found Petitioner guilty of second degree murder and lesser charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner challenged the denial of the motion to suppress. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ments of conviction, agreeing with the trial court that Petitioner\u2019s statement, \u2018You mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this,\u201d was an ambiguous invocation of both the right to counsel and the right to silence. The intermediate appellate court therefore held that Detective Kaiser\u2019s conduct during the remainder of the interrogation did not violate <em>Edwards </em>and, as a consequence, the trial court properly denied the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted to answer the following question: \u201cWhether Petitioner\u2019s statements made during his custodial interrogation after he invoked his right to counsel and right to remain silent should have been suppressed.\u201d Notwithstanding his phrasing of the question presented, Petitioner in his brief and at oral argument concentrated on whether he was deprived of the right to counsel, under <em>Edwards. </em>Because we resolve the appeal on the ground that the police committed an <em>Edwards </em>violation, there is no need to address Petitioner\u2019s less strenuously argued right to silence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny are grounded in that portion of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution that reads: \u201cNo person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself____\u201d The <em>Miranda </em>Court, recognizing the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation, 384 U.S. at 445-48, 86 S.Ct. 1602, held that an individual taken into custody,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An9-\">must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">\u201cThe rights expressed in the <em>Miranda </em>warning pertain throughout the interrogation.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>418 Md. 136, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>150, 12 A.3d 1238, 1246 (2011) (citing <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2263-64, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (\u201cIf the right to counsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any point during questioning, further interrogation must cease.\u201d); <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (\u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.... If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d)). Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">when an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights ... [He] is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\"><em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880. The protection afforded under <em>Edwards </em>provides a \u201csecond layer of prophylaxis for the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel.... \u201d <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 176, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991). The <em>Edwards </em>rule establishes a \u201cbright-line\u201d prohibition against all subsequent questioning because, in the absence of such a prohibition, \u201cthe authorities through \u2018badgering\u2019 or \u2018overreaching\u2019\u2014explicit or subtle, deliberate or unintentional\u2014might otherwise wear down the accused and persuade him to incriminate himself notwithstanding his earlier request for counsel\u2019s assistance.\u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984) (per curiam) (citations and brackets omitted). Accordingly, the Court has \u201cemphasized that a valid waiver \u2018cannot be established by showing only that [the accused] responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation.\u2019 Using an accused\u2019s subsequent responses to cast doubt on the adequacy of the initial request <em>itself </em>is even more intolerable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 105 S.Ct. 490 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The accused\u2019s invocation of the right to counsel, though, cannot be equivocal or ambiguous. The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Davis v. United </em>States, 512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994), that applicability of the <em>Edwards </em>rule \u201crequires courts to determine whether the accused <em>actually invoked </em>his right to counsel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.) That inquiry, moreover, is \u201cobjective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458-59, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (\u201cTo avoid difficulties of proof and to provide guidance to officers conducting interrogations, this is an objective inquiry.\u201d). Consequently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">[invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel \u201crequires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u201d But if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Rather, the suspect must unambiguously request counsel. As we have observed, \u201ca statement either is such an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not.\u201d Although a suspect need not \u201cspeak with the discrimination of an Oxford don,\u201d he must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney. If the statement fails to meet the requisite level of clarity, <em>Edwards </em>does not require that the officers stop questioning the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The <em>Davis </em>Court allowed that, if a suspect makes an ambiguous reference to an attorney, it would be \u201cgood police practice\u201d to ask clarifying questions to determine the suspect\u2019s desire in that regard, but police are not required to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350. The <em>Davis </em>Court\u2019s holding is expressed as follows: \u201cWe therefore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>clearly requests an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350. In short, if, from the perspective of a reasonable officer, the suspect\u2019s statement is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for counsel, then the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The question boils down to whether Petitioner\u2019s statement, \u201cYou mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this,\u201d was a sufficiently clear articulation of his desire to have counsel present during the remainder of the interrogation, such that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances of Detective Kaiser \u201cwould understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350. We conclude that the answer to that question is \u201cyes\u201d; Petitioner\u2019s words were an unambiguous and unequivocal assertion of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We disagree with the State\u2019s suggestion that Petitioner\u2019s statement, assessed either alone or in context, was both equivocal and ambiguous, thereby permitting Detective Kaiser to continue the interrogation. The State urges a comparison between Petitioner\u2019s statement and the statement, \u201cMaybe I should talk with a lawyer,\u201d which the Supreme Court held in <em>Davis </em>was an ambiguous invocation of the right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 462,114 S.Ct. 2350. And the State seems to agree with the suppression court that Petitioner\u2019s statement is akin to the statement at issue in <em>Matthews v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 725, 737-38, 666 A.2d 912, 917 (1995). In that case, the Court of Special Appeals held that the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cWhere\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>my lawyer?\u201d was an ambiguous assertion of the right to counsel. The State also relies on <em>Minehan v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 432, 443-44, 809 A.2d 66, 72 (2002). In <em>Minehan, </em>the Court of Special Appeals commented in dicta that the statement, \u201cShould I get a lawyer,\u201d was no more effective as an assertion of the right to counsel than \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer,\u201d deemed ambiguous in <em>Davis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Petitioner\u2019s statement is distinguishable from the statements considered in <em>Davis, Matthews </em>and <em>Minehan. </em>None of the statements under consideration in those cases\u2014\u201cWhere\u2019s my lawyer,\u201d \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer,\u201d or \u201cShould I get a lawyer\u201d\u2014provides any indication that the suspect, at the time the statement was uttered, actually desired to have a lawyer present for the remainder of the interrogation. When Matthews asked \u201cWhere\u2019s my lawyer?\u201d a reasonable officer could and likely would infer either that Matthews was wondering about his lawyer\u2019s whereabouts or, perhaps, whether a lawyer had been provided for him. The questions \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer,\u201d and \u201cShould I get a lawyer\u201d suggest that the suspect <em>might </em>want a lawyer, which, under <em>Davis, </em>is insufficient to require the officer to cease questioning. 512 U.S. at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Petitioner\u2019s words, by contrast, even if understood to be phrased as a question, as the suppression court evidently found them to be,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> transmit the unambiguous and unequivocal message that he wanted an attorney. A speaker who begins a statement with the phrase, \u201cyou mind if ...\u201d suggests to his or her audience that the speaker is about to express a desire, whether to do something or have something occur. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>phrase \u201cyou mind if ...\u201d in this context is a colloquialism; it is reasonably assumed that the speaker is not actually seeking permission to do the thing desired or to have the desired thing occur. <em>Cf. Prioleau v. State, </em>411 Md. 629, 645, 984 A.2d 851, 861 (2009) (agreeing with the analysis that the phrase \u201cwhat\u2019s up,\u201d is \u201ca general term of salutation\u201d that could not reasonably be viewed as designed to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">But even if viewed not as a colloquialism but rather as having literal meaning, the import of the words is no different. Viewed from the perspective of a reasonable police officer in the position of Detective Kaiser, the most that could be said about Petitioner\u2019s words, \u201cYou mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this,\u201d is that Petitioner, though undoubtedly asking for an attorney, sought to couch the request in polite or (more likely, given the context) deferential terms.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, to the extent that the phrase \u201cyou mind if ...\u201d is understood as Petitioner genuinely posing a question, the only question he reasonably posed was whether Detective Kaiser \u201cmind[ed]\u201d if Petitioner stopped talking and got an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Petitioner\u2019s statement is no less unambiguous than statements by a suspect that he or she would \u201crather\u201d have an attorney, which courts have treated as unambiguous assertions of the right to counsel. <em>See, e.g., State v. Harris, </em>305 S.W.3d 482 (Mo.Ct.App.2010) (holding suspect invoked right to counsel by stating \u201cI\u2019d rather appoint a lawyer\u201d); <em>McDaniel v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 432, 506 S.E.2d 21 (1998) (holding suspect invoked right to counsel by stating \u201cI think I would rather have an attorney here to speak for me\u201d). Although not a direct demand for counsel, a suspect stating he would rather have counsel unambiguously indicates his desire to have counsel present. The only question that remains is whether he will be permitted to have counsel present.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In short, we are persuaded by our independent view of the record that Petitioner, by uttering the words, \u201cYou mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this\u201d made an unambiguous invocation of his right to counsel. At that time, Detective Kaiser was required to cease all further questioning. <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 458, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (citing <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">But even were we to assume for the sake of discussion that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that Petitioner <em>might </em>have been invoking the right to counsel when he said \u2018You mind if I not say no more and just talk to an attorney about this,\u201d then what occurred immediately thereafter resolved all doubt. The transcript reveals what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">[Petitioner]: You mind if I not say no more and just talk to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">an attorney about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Det. Kaiser: What benefit is that going to have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">[Petitioner]: I\u2019d feel more comfortable with one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Even if a reasonable officer would not have understood Petitioner\u2019s first, \u201cyou mind if ...\u201d statement to be a clear invocation of his right to counsel, his second statement, \u201cI\u2019d feel more comfortable with one,\u201d made in response to Detective Kaiser\u2019s inquiry, clarified Petitioner\u2019s desire for an attorney. Therefore, had we concluded that the prior assertion was ambiguous (we did not), the ambiguity was resolved when Petitioner explained precisely why he wanted counsel. At that point, even if not before, all questioning should have ceased. Detective Kaiser, though, did not cease the interrogation, and during the ensuing interrogation Petitioner made statements that the court should have suppressed. Because the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>made substantive use of those statements at Petitioner\u2019s trial on an agreed statement of facts, we shall order the judgments of conviction reversed, with a remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY AND REMAND FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY WICOMICO COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-12\">. Prior to trial, the parties entered into a \"Disposition Agreement\u201d stating that Petitioner would waive his right to a jury trial and be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>by the court on an agreed statement of facts. The Agreement also specified that Detective Kaiser\u2019s interrogation of Petitioner would be admitted as an exhibit, but that Petitioner reserved his continuing objection based on his previous motion to suppress statements he made during the interrogation. The Agreement was entered into evidence at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">.

A transcript of the entire videotaped confession and a DVD recording were entered into evidence at trial. The parties in their briefs refer to the version of the transcript introduced at that proceeding. That transcript, however, differs from the excerpted transcript the parties presented to the suppression court, albeit not in material respect. When reviewing a court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we are constrained to rely solely on what was before the suppression court. <em>Lee v. State, </em>418 Md. 136, 148, 12 A.3d 1238, 1245 (2011).

In coming to that conclusion, we have borne in mind our responsibility to \"view the evidence and inferences that may be reasonably drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion\u201d and to \"defer to the motions court\u2019s factual findings and uphold them unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>418 Md. at 148, 12 A.3d at 1245-46 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \"We, however, make our own independent constitutional appraisal, by reviewing the relevant law and applying it to the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148-49, 12 A.3d at 1246.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">.
