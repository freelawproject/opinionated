State, </em>370 Md. 99, 803 A.2d 518 (2002), a case in which we determined that a provision that prohibited an activity and a separate provision that penalized that same activity, though separated during a recodification, could nonetheless be read <em>in pari materia </em>as penalizing the act of possessing unstamped cigarettes. We now address whether a statute criminalizing conduct, which does not contain or have a related penalty provision, as a result of substantive revisions by the Legislature, can constitute a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Petitioner, Leroy Evans, Jr., seeks to overturn his conviction on Count Nine of the Indictment against him for the unlawful obliteration, removal, change, or alteration of a manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm, pursuant to Section 5-142 of the Public Safety Article, Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Code (2003),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> asserting that Section 5-142 does not contain a penalty provision and that the penalty provision in Section 5-143(b) of the Public Safety Article does not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals affirmed Evans\u2019s conviction on Count Nine of the Indictment, and we granted certiorari, <em>Evans v. State, </em>415 Md. 607, 4 A.3d 512 (2010), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\">Did the circuit court err in sentencing Petitioner for obliterating the serial number on a firearm where the Legislature has not provided a penalty for that offense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We shall hold that the omission of a penalty provision in or related to Section 5-142, which prohibits obliterating, removing, changing, or altering the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number, renders Section 5-142 incapable of sustaining a criminal conviction, so that Evans\u2019s conviction on Count Nine of the Indictment must be reversed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Evans was indicted and tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in 2007 on eleven drug and firearm counts, one of which was Count Nine, which charged him as follows: \u201cLeroy Evans, Jr. on or about the 28th day of December, Two Thousand Six, in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, did obliterate the manufacturer\u2019s mark or number on a firearm in violation of \u00a7 5-142 of the Public Safety Article.\u201d Evans was convicted on Count Nine, and the court sentenced him to a five-year term of incarceration,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was to run consecutive to a different sentence on another count.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Evans noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and argued that the Circuit Court erred by imposing multiple sentences for possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, for imposing multiple sentences for unlawful possession of a firearm and for imposing a sentence for obliterating the serial number on a firearm on Count Nine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s sentences in an unreported opinion, and as to Count Nine, reasoned that \u201c[b]y obliterating the serial number on the handgun, appellant knowingly participated in the illegal possession of a regulated firearm in violation of the subtitle, and he was properly sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five years pursuant to PS \u00a7 5-143(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Why we appear to be absorbed by the issue of what to do when a statute internally does not contain a penalty provision is because, generally, criminal statutes must contain language that criminalizes the forbidden act, as well as a provision that penalizes the behavior.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This proposition, as hornbook law, is succinctly stated by Wayne R. LaFave in the 2010 edition of one of our oft-quoted tomes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">[A] crime is made up of two parts, forbidden conduct and a prescribed penalty. The former without the latter is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>crime. The modern criminal penalties are: the death penalty, imprisonment with or without hard labor, and the fine. In many cases the section of the statute that describes the forbidden conduct concludes with a statement of the punishment; or perhaps one section sets forth the forbidden conduct and the next section the punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law \u00a7 1.2(d), at 12 (5th ed.2010) (footnotes omitted). See <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 438, 450, 639 A.2d 675, 680, 685 (1994), in which we reversed a trial court\u2019s application of a mandatory ten-year penalty for drug offenders that \u201cpreviously [have] been convicted\u201d of similar offenses to an offender who had been convicted of a drug offense after the conviction of the principal offense. In so doing, we relied on the fundamental principle that \u201ccriminal statutes [must] be sufficiently clear and definite to inform a person of ordinary intelligence what conduct is punishable and what the penalty for such conduct might be <em>before </em>the criminal conduct is committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, n. 16, 639 A.2d at 683, n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">When a statute, as the instant one, fails to internally contain a penalty provision, its ability to criminalize conduct becomes more complicated. LaFave is of assistance in identifying the spectrum of issues in this regard, including in the first instance, those about which there is \u201clittle difficulty\u201d for a court to determine criminality:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">Sometimes, however, the statute forbidding the conduct may refer to another statute for the punishment, such as the rather common statute providing that whoever commits embezzlement (defining it) shall be punishable as if he committed larceny, with the larceny statute providing for a certain penalty of fine or imprisonment. Another method sometimes encountered is for the statute, after forbidding certain conduct, to conclude \u201cshall be guilty of a felony\u201d (or \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d), without setting forth the penalty; but another catch-all statute provides that one who commits a felony (or a misdemeanor) not otherwise punishable shall be punished in a prescribed way. Similarly, the statute defining certain conduct as criminal may say that this crime is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>felony or misdemeanor of a certain classification; another statute then indicates the permissible punishment for each classification. In all of these cases there is little difficulty in concluding that, since the statutes set forth both forbidden conduct and criminal penalty, the legislature has created a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">LaFave, \u00a7 1.2(d), at 12-13. For example, in <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 803 A.2d 518 (2002), we were faced with a penalty provision that, due to a recodification, appeared in a different title of the Tax-General Article than the forbidden conduct it punished, namely the possession of unstamped cigarettes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We determined that the two sections in issue could be read <em>in para materia </em>in a plain meaning analysis to warrant application of the penalty provision in what was a separate statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In the more difficult situation, however, the omission of a penalty provision in or related to a statute cannot support a criminal conviction for its violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">But sometimes the legislature forbids conduct and then omits (in most cases unintentionally) to provide for a penalty; and there is no catch-all statute of the type mentioned above. In such a situation one who engages in the forbidden conduct is not guilty of a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">LaFave, \u00a7 1.2(d), at 13.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where the present case falls along the LaFave spectrum is the conundrum. The present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>we shall determine, is at the far end of the LaFave spectrum\u2014the absence of a penalty provision renders Section 5-142 incapable of criminalizing the conduct in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">To assist in resolving the present issue, we rely on one oft-cited statutory standard of review, which we articulated in <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 978 A.2d 736 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. Occasionally we see fit to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent merely as a check of our reading of a statute\u2019s plain language. In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body, and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 404-405, 978 A.2d at 747-748 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">Section 5-142 of the Public Safety Article provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014A person may not obliterate, remove, change, or alter the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(b) Presumption.\u2014If on trial for a violation of this section possession of the firearm by the defendant is established, the defendant is presumed to have obliterated, removed, changed, or altered the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on the firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Section 5-143 of the same Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, a dealer or other person may not knowingly participate in the illegal sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt of a regulated firearm in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">(b) Penalty.-\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $10,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-12\">(c) <em>Separate </em>crime.\u2014Each violation of this section is a separate crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Clearly, there is no internal penalty provision in Section 5-142. Also, Section 5-143(b), a penalty provision, does not explicitly refer to Section 5-142.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">Section 5-142 attempts to criminalize the act of obliteration, removal, change or alteration of a manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm, which has been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>(i) a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">(ii) the frame or receiver of such a weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">(2) \u201cFirearm\u201d includes a starter gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Maryland Code (2003), Section 5-101(h) of the Public Safety Article.

Reconciliation of the two provisions in a plain meaning analysis, then, is difficult. Clearly, the Legislature could have added the term \u201cregulated firearm\u201d to Section 5-142, in addition to \u201cfirearm,\u201d in order to remedy this inconsistency but it did not, as it specifically did in other statutes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The difficulty of reconciling the two sections is further exacerbated by the fact that the acts of \u201cobliterat[ing], removing], changing], or altering] the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number\u201d in Section 5-142(a) are not synonymous to the acts of \u201cillegal sale, rental, transfer, purchase, possession, or receipt\u201d in Section 5-143(a). The terms \u201cobliterate, change, remove, or alter\u201d are not defined in the \u201cRegulated Firearms\u201d Subtitle, but generally, \u201cobliterate\u201d is \u201c[t]o wipe out, rub off, or erase (a writing or other markings),\u201d \u201cremove\u201d is \u201cto change the location, position, station, or residence of,\u201d \u201cchange\u201d is \u201cto make different in some particular,\u201d and \u201calter\u201d is \u201cto make different without changing into something else.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1181 (9th ed. 2009); Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 35, 206, 1053 (11th ed. 2005). Conversely, the term \u201cpossession,\u201d while not defined in the \u201cRegulated Firearms\u201d Subtitle, generally denotes \u201c[t]he fact of having or holding property in one\u2019s power.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1281 (9th ed. 2009). Thus, even the criminalizing conduct language in the two statutes is dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The State avers that the term \u201cpossession\u201d in Section 5-143(a) includes the presumptive possession language of Section 5-142(b), that is, if \u201cpossession of the firearm by the defendant is established, the defendant is presumed to have obliterated, removed, changed, or altered the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on the firearm,\u201d so that Evans is guilty of possessing a firearm with an obliterated identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>tion mark or number. Evans, however, was convicted of obliterating the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm in Count Nine, not of possession. The presumption of possession is an evidentiary one, and thus, Section 5-142(b) does not place the act of obliterating the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm in Section 5-142 and illegal possession of a regulated firearm in Section 5-143(a) on the \u201csame footing.\u201d <em>Keller v. State, </em>11 Md. 525, 536 (1857). The State\u2019s reliance on <em>Keller </em>is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The State, unavailingly, also supports reconciling the plain language of the two statutes by emphasizing that Section 5-143 must be the penalty for the Section 5-142 conduct, because of the inclusion in Section 5-143(a) of the language \u201cexcept as otherwise provided.\u201d The penalty provision of Section 5-143(b), however, does not contain the same language and, in fact, is limited to language of \u201cthis section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In the absence of a favorable response to its plain meaning argument, the State points us to the legislative histories of Sections 5-142 and 5-143 and asserts a favorable conciliation of the two statutes. The legislative record, however, does not support the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">In 1941, the General Assembly enacted a \u201cPistols\u201d Subtitle to the Maryland Code with a purpose of regulating the \u201csale, identification marks and possession of pistols.\u201d 1941 Maryland Laws, Chapter 622. One section of the Subtitle forbade \u201canyone to obliterate, remove, change or alter the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on any firearms,\u201d without a correlative firearms definition, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">It shall be unlawful for anyone to obliterate, remove, change, or alter the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on any firearms. Whenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or have had possession of any such firearms, such fact shall be presumptive evidence that the defendant obliterated, removed, changed or altered the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">1941 Maryland Laws, Chapter 622, Section 531C. Importantly, the language is almost identical to that of Section 5-142, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the exception of the substitution of the phrase \u201ca firearm\u201d for \u201cany firearms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Its penalty provision was also enacted in 1941 at the end of a series of four prohibited acts, which included the obliteration, removal, change or alteration of a manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm and read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">Any person violating any of the provisions of this sub-title shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than Three Hundred Dollars ($300) or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">1941 Maryland Laws, Chapter 622, Section 531G. The other prohibited acts in the list included proscriptions on selling or transferring a pistol or revolver to persons convicted of a crime of violence or who were fugitives from justice, possessing a pistol or revolver if a person had been convicted of a crime of violence or who were fugitives from justice, and possessing, selling, transferring, or disposing of a stolen pistol or revolver. 1941 Maryland Laws, Chapter 622, Sections 531D and 531 E, respectively. The latter two sections explicitly dealt with a \u201cpistol or revolver,\u201d a term which was defined as \u201cany firearm with barrel less than twelve inches in length.\u201d 1941 Maryland Laws, Chapter 622, Section 531A.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In 1966, the Legislature substantially affected the \u201cPistols\u201d Subtitle, although the provision related to obliterating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>manufacturer\u2019s identification mark on a firearm remained the same in number, Section 444 of Article 27, and in substance. Regarding the other prohibitions, the Legislature expanded the classes of individuals who could not receive or possess pistols or revolvers. The catch-all penalty provision was also altered to increase the maximum penalty, and a new provision was added to the section for making false statements in an application to purchase a pistol or revolver, to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">Any person violating any of the provisions of this subtitle unless otherwise stated herein shall upon conviction be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned for not more than three years, or both. Any prospective purchaser making a false material statement on an application to purchase or transfer required by section 442 or any dealer making a false material statement on an application for a pistol and revolver dealer\u2019s license required by section 443 shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned for not more than two (2) years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">1966 Maryland Laws, Chapter 502, Section 448, codified as the same section in Article 27, Maryland Code (1957, 1966 Supp.).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The Maryland Gun Violence Act of 1996 changed the landscape of firearms provisions. The \u201cPistols\u201d Subtitle was renamed \u201cRegulated Firearms.\u201d 1996 Maryland Laws, Chapters 561 and 562. The prohibition on obliterating the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm remained unchanged, however. In the other three prohibitory provisions originally associated with obliteration, the Legislature replaced the terms \u201cpistol or revolver\u201d with \u201cregulated firearm.\u201d 1996 Maryland Laws, Chapters 561 and 562, Sections 445 and 446, codified as the same sections in Article 27, Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Legislature also differentiated \u201cregulated firearm\u201d from \u201cfirearm,\u201d as those definitions exist today.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The former catch-all penalty provision, enacted in 1941, which later had been amended to increase its penalty, was repealed. 1996 Maryland Laws, Chapter 562, Section 448.

Section 449(e) is of particular importance because its language is substantially similar to the language of Section 5-143. The Floor Report for Senate Bill 215 explained that Section 449 of Article 27 \u201cadd[ed] five penalty provisions.\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report on SB 215, at 13 (1996).

Each violation of this section is a separate crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Albeit tortuous, the legislative history of Sections 5-142 and 5-143 supports the conclusion that the act of obliterating, removing, changing or altering the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number became inadvertently orphaned from a penalty provision in part because of its inclusion of the term \u201cfirearm,\u201d rather than \u201cpistol or revolver.\u201d Unlike the other three prohibited acts enacted in 1941, which were ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>amended from \u201cpistol or revolver\u201d to the terms \u201cregulated firearm,\u201d the prohibited act of obliterating the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm did not enjoy the same attention and did not evolve with the rest of the former \u201cPistols\u201d Subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">To forestall this lineage breakdown, the State has asserted that, considering the purpose of the 1996 Act, to address firearms violence, it is absurd to conclude that the Legislature intended to repeal the crime of obliterating, removing, changing, or altering the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on a firearm. Absurdity aside, it is clear that an oversight led to the failure to provide a penalty provision in or related to Section 5-142 and that we now cannot add the language. As we emphasized in <em>Graves v.

Where an individual is convicted pursuant to a charge that does not constitute a crime, that conviction must be reversed and the sentence vacated. <em>See Bruce v.
