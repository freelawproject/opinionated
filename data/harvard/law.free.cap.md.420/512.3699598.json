An airborne newspaper sparked an altercation between the defendant, Andre Arthur, and Corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ral Eric Stanley, resulting in criminal charges against Arthur for failure to obey a lawful order and resisting arrest. At trial, Arthur presented evidence that Corporal Stanley did not have probable cause to arrest him, and thus Arthur had a right to resist. Yet, the trial court refused to instruct the jury on the right to resist an unlawful arrest. A jury convicted Arthur on both counts. On appeal, Arthur attacked the trial court\u2019s refusal to issue his instruction, as well as the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his failure to obey a lawful order conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions, holding that the evidence was sufficient and that, although Arthur had generated the requested jury instruction, it was adequately covered by other instructions given. Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing Arthur\u2019s instruction. Arthur then petitioned this Court, presenting the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">1. Is the evidence sufficient to sustain Mr. Arthur\u2019s convictions for failure to obey a lawful order and resisting arrest where the record only shows that he used foul language after being told by a police officer to \u201clower his voice[,] ... settle down\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ags\">2. Did the trial court err in failing to instruct the jury, upon request, that a person is privileged to resist an unlawful warrantless arrest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In response, the State filed its own petition, seeking answers to the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">1. Did Arthur fail to preserve his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his convictions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">2. Did the trial court correctly conclude that an instruction on the right to resist an unlawful arrest was not generated by the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">We granted both petitions, and for the reasons stated below, we shall reverse the holding of our intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">A few minutes before midnight on Independence Day 2007, Corporal Eric Stanley of the Frederick Police Department was driving his police vehicle northbound on Market Street when he observed a group of three people, including Arthur, walking together on the sidewalk. According to Stanley, he noticed Arthur \u201creach[ ] down and pick[ ] up a newspaper that had been left on the sidewalk[.]\u201d As Stanley continued past the group, he \u201cheard the thump of an item hitting [his] patrol vehicle[,]\u201d and when he looked back, he realized that Arthur no longer had the newspaper in his hand. Stanley then stopped and exited his vehicle, saying to Arthur, \u201c[H]ey, let me talk to you.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Stanley later testified that, when he approached Arthur, the latter began yelling obscenities at him, specifically saying, \u201cyou get the fuck away from me, leave me the fuck alone[,]\u201d and other words to that effect. Stanley responded by saying \u201chey, settle down. I need to talk to you[.]\u201d Yet Arthur \u201ccontinued with his verbal ... onslaught[,]\u201d attracting the attention of people standing outside of a restaurant farther up the block.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stanley told him \u201cto lower his voice, to settle down, and he continued to refuse.\u201d It was at this point that Stanley told Arthur that he was under arrest, placing his hand on Arthur\u2019s shirt. Arthur reacted by \u201ctry[ing] to pull from [Stanley] in a yanking, jerking motion[,]\u201d and Stanley \u201ccalled for another police officer to back [him] up to affect the arrest.\u201d Arthur continued to struggle as three officers attempted to arrest him, leading them to \u201ctake him to the ground ... to prevent his fleeing[.]\u201d Once on the ground, Arthur continued \u201ckicking and pulling[,]\u201d causing Stanley to sprain his ankle. Eventually, the officers were able to take Arthur into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>At trial, Arthur and his companions offered a different version of the night\u2019s events. Danielle Brigham, Arthur\u2019s girlfriend, testified that, while walking -with Arthur down Market Street, she stopped to talk to a friend. When she turned around, \u201cthere was a cop that was approaching [Arthur] and he had asked him to put his hands behind his back and [Arthur] asked ... why am I getting arrested?\u201d But the officer \u201cjust told him to put his hands behind his back.\u201d When Arthur did so, the officer \u201cput him on the ground and had put him eventually in the back of the car.\u201d Danielle contradicted Stanley\u2019s account, saying that there hadn\u2019t been any struggle. Arthur\u2019s brother, DaSean, also testified that he was walking ahead of Arthur and turned around to see \u201cthe officer approaching him and [Arthur] asked ... why am I getting locked up[?]\u201d \u201c[A]t that moment that\u2019s when [the officer] grabbed him and just threw him to the ground for no reason[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">When Arthur took the stand, he explained that on the night of his arrest, he, his girlfriend, and his brother were returning from the park where they had viewed the Fourth of July fireworks. Arthur said that Stanley approached him, telling him to place his hands behind his back. Arthur then asked the officer if he was under arrest, and \u201c[h]e said no.\u201d So Arthur \u201ccontinued to walk[,]\u201d believing that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really have to continue to talk to him\u201d because he was not under arrest. Stanley then \u201ctook [Arthur] by the shirt [and] slammed [him] up against the wall[.]\u201d Arthur maintained that as he was talking to Stanley, he wasn\u2019t \u201cusing profanity. I\u2019m not cursing. [I] just sa[id] that you don\u2019t have to be so aggressive and [I] plac[ed] one of my hands behind my back.\u201d He also claimed that he sustained some injuries from the encounter with the police officers, receiving a cut on his hand because one of the officers smashed the handcuffs onto his finger instead of his wrist. Other injuries included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM1\">a knee injury. [One of the officers] placed his knee into my neck. I had to get a head scan at the hospital for a, um, I believe it was a pinched nerve in my neck. I had shoulder injuries. I had about four or five cuts on my body from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>them just, you know, hitting me. One guy hit [me] with the baton like at least I would say four times, four or five times he hit me with the baton, and I was on my backside. While I was laying on my stomach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Arthur did admit, however, that, before Stanley approached him, he had picked up the newspaper, and was tossing it across the street to one of his buddies who lived on that side of the street. He explained that he was not throwing the paper at any vehicles, but was simply \u201cplaying catch.\u201d He also admitted that he had been \u201cdrinking a little bit[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, Arthur\u2019s counsel unsuccessfully moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that he had a right to resist the arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">Apparently the officer says that he was under arrest ... concurrently with him grabbing him and saying you\u2019re under arrest. Based on that, Your Honor, he was never told why he was under arrest, what he had done. I\u2019m also having problems that it kind of conflicts with what was in the report. But just based on the testimony you\u2019re under arrest, I mean I think he had a right to resist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Arthur then renewed his motion at the close of all evidence, arguing that the \u201cState had failed to show that [Arthur] was a, failure to regard ... he failed to obey a lawful order and the fact that he wasn\u2019t disregarding a lawful order there was no right to arrest[.]\u201d The court denied the motion for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">As the trial was drawing to a close, the court notified both parties that it would instruct the jury according to the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction for resisting a warrantless arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defense counsel asked the court to also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>instruct the jury that a person has the right to resist an unlawful arrest,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but the court was not receptive to this request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If you determine the Defendant was not lawfully arrested and no arrest warrant was used then the Defendant had the right to resist arrest and that\u2019s pursuant to case law. Resisting unlawful arrest is not a crime in Maryland. If an arrest is illegal the arrestee may use any reasonable means to, even force to affect his escape. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s Maryland case law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">THE COURT: The problem that you get into in this case is there\u2019s, I don\u2019t really want to have a sub-litigation issue about whether his arrest, because there, there could be four or five different things that he could have been arrested for according to the police officers. According to him, nothing. I\u2019m gonna give the Pattern and no embellishment to [ ] it in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not asking for embellishment. I would object to just a Pattern. I\u2019m just stating that under Maryland law it is [not] illegal to resist an illegal arrest. If the jury concludes that of any of the four theories that he was legally arrested then he has no defense. But if the jury concludes that there wasn\u2019t no\u2014a, a legal arrest, under Maryland law he has the right to resist and we have generated that instruction. I would just simply ask that that instruction be added.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">THE COURT: How do you believe that you, you have generated that instruction? From the Defendant\u2019s initial, own testimony, best case he was littering. Second, he was acting, I, I mean, looking at it objectively the Defendant\u2019s own conduct constituted a particular offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The court rejected counsel\u2019s request because the modification was not in the pattern instruction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and because it believed the defendant had not generated the instruction. The court explained that it would \u201cinstruct the jury that they do have to find that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Defendant had committed a crime for him to be guilty of that offense [but] that\u2019s as far as [it would] go.\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s instruction mirrored the pattern.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The jury convicted Arthur of failing to obey a lawful order and resisting arrest and he was sentenced to a term of 60 days incarceration for failure to obey a lawful order and a concurrent term of one year incarceration for resisting arrest. Arthur timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his convictions. In a reported opinion, the Court agreed with Arthur that the issue was generated, but held that the trial court did not err in using the pattern jury instruction because the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d language adequately conveyed that the arrest must be lawful. <em>Arthur v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 446, 459, 997 A.2d 899, 907 (2010). The Court also held that there was sufficient evidence to support Arthur\u2019s convictions in the form of Stanley\u2019s testimony that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>arrested Arthur \u201cbecause of the volume of [Arthur\u2019s] verbalizations and not their content[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 997 A.2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">I. Sufficiency Of The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Arthur first challenges the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that there was sufficient evidence to support his convictions. Arthur contends that his convictions were improper because: \u201c(1) [] Stanley\u2019s order for [] Arthur \u2018to lower his voice, to settle down\u2019 was an unlawful regulation of [ ] Arthur\u2019s right to free expression; and (2) [ ] Arthur was privileged to resist his unlawful arrest, and the acts of resistance were reasonable in scope to the officer\u2019s unlawful arrest.\u201d The State contests this assertion, arguing that Stanley\u2019s order was content-neutral, intended only to warn Arthur to lower his voice. In any event, asserts the State, this Court need not reach the issue because Arthur\u2019s challenge is not preserved for appellate review because, in his Motions for Judgment of Acquittal, Arthur did not challenge the lawfulness of Stanley\u2019s order on First Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201cIt is well settled that appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case tried by a jury is predicated on the refusal of the trial court to grant a motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 574, 3 A.3d 1210, 1214 (2010) (quoting <em>Starr v. State, </em>405 Md. 293, 302, 951 A.2d 87, 92). Here, Arthur moved for judgment of acquittal both at the close of evidence offered by the State and again at the close of all evidence, as permitted by Maryland Rule 4-324. Subsection (a) of that same governing rule requires the defendant to \u201cstate with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\u201d Md. Rule 4-324(a). This means that a defendant must \u201cargue precisely the ways in which the evidence should be found wanting and the particular elements of the crime as to which the evidence is deficient.\u201d <em>Starr, </em>405 Md. at 303, 951 A.2d at 92-93 (quoting <em>Fraidin v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 231, 244-45, 583 A.2d 1065, 1072 (1991)). To be sure, \u201can appellant/petitioner is entitled to present the appellate court with a more detailed version of the argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>advanced at trial[; however,] this Court has refused to require trial courts to imagine all reasonable offshoots of the argument actually presented to them before making a ruling on admissibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 951 A.2d at 93. Accordingly, a defendant \u201cis not entitled to appellate review of reasons stated for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Starr, </em>405 Md. at 302, 951 A.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">With regard to the necessary level of particularity, we find instructive our decision in <em>Starr v. State, </em>405 Md. 293, 951 A.2d 87 (2008), where we held that the defendant failed to preserve his argument for review. There, the defendant had been convicted of first degree assault and related offenses, including openly wearing and carrying a dangerous weapon with intent to injure, after he fired a \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d over the head of another person. <em>Starr, </em>405 Md. at 295, 951 A.2d at 88. At trial, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that \u201cmere possession of a \u2018sawed-off shotgun\u2019 did not violate [the statute] and that the shotgun was not a dangerous weapon because [it was not listed in the statute as such.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 951 A.2d at 91. On appeal, however, the defendant argued that he had been charged under the wrong statute because the sawed-off shotgun was, in effect, a handgun, which was expressly excluded from the statutory list of deadly weapons. <em>Id. </em>We held that, because the defendant\u2019s \u201ctrial counsel never argued to the circuit court that the \u2018sawed-off shotgun\u2019 described by the State\u2019s witnesses was actually a \u2018handgun\u2019 as that term is defined in [the Criminal Law Article], this argument [was] not ... preserved for our review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301-02, 951 A.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Another illustrative case is <em>Polk v. State, </em>378 Md. 1, 835 A.2d 575 (2003), in which the defendant was arrested for disturbing the peace after she began yelling obscenities in a public hospital and then refused an officer\u2019s order to lower her voice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the end of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>initial orders to \u201cstop cursing\u201d were unlawfully directed at the content of her speech and that a \u201cdomino effect\u201d made her subsequent arrest illegal. She maintained that, by using profanity toward the officer, she was engaging in protected speech. According to [the defendant], because she had not disobeyed a lawful police order and the officer had no reason to arrest her, she rightfully resisted the attempts to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 5, 835 A.2d at 577-78. The defendant presented the same argument on appeal, and this Court addressed the issue of whether the officer\u2019s order constituted an unconstitutional regulation of the defendant\u2019s speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Here, neither of Arthur\u2019s motions preserved his contention that Stanley\u2019s order impermissibly attempted to restrict Arthur\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of speech. Arthur cannot even find salvation in reading the two motions in harmony, for neither supplies the essential component lacking from the other. Arthur\u2019s motion at the close of all evidence lacked the depth necessary to preserve the issue. In stark contrast to the grounds supplied by counsel in <em>Polk, </em>Arthur\u2019s argument was simply that the State \u201cfailed to show that ... he failed to obey a lawful order\u201d and that because the order was not lawful, \u201cthere was no right to arrest[.]\u201d Counsel, however, did not explain why the order was unlawful. Maryland Rule 4-324(a) is not satisfied by merely reciting a conclusory statement and proclaiming that the State failed to prove its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Reliance on Arthur\u2019s first motion is equally futile because, like the defendant in <em>Starr, </em>Arthur now appeals on different grounds. At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, Arthur argued that he had a right to resist arrest because \u201che was never told why he was under arrest, what he had done.\u201d Yet, before this Court, he now contends that he had a right to resist the arrest because Stanley\u2019s order unconstitutionally regulated the content of Arthur\u2019s speech. The basic tenets of fairness prevent us from evaluating the trial court\u2019s denial of Arthur\u2019s motion on grounds not presented to or contemplated by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>For these reasons, we will not address Arthur\u2019s sufficiency of evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">II. Trial Court\u2019s Refusal To Administer Arthur\u2019s Instruction On The Right To Resist Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Both parties also attack the Court of Special Appeals decision regarding Arthur\u2019s proposed jury instruction, albeit for different reasons. Arthur submits that the Court erred by condoning the \u201ctrial court[\u2019s failure] to instruct the jury as to the long-recognized privilege to resist an unlawful warrantless arrest.\u201d The State, on the other hand, protests the Court\u2019s holding that the issue of an unlawful arrest was factually generated. Alternatively, the State argues that, even if generated, the modified instruction was not required because \u201cthe pattern jury instruction sufficiently covered the law under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> \u201cWe review a trial judge\u2019s decision whether to give a jury instruction under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>See Thompson v. State, </em>393 Md. 291, 311, 901 A.2d 208, 220 (2006). Upon the request of any party, a trial court is required to \u201cinstruct the jury as to the applicable law and extent to which the instructions are binding.\u201d Md. Rule 4-325(c). \u201cThe court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201c[w]e have interpreted this rule to require a trial judge to give a requested instruction that correctly states the applicable law and that has not been fairly covered in instructions actually given.\u201d <em>State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 356, 619 A.2d 992, 994 (1993). \u201c[T]o merit an instruction, the issue as to which the request is made must have been generated by the evidence adduced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 619 A.2d at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">For an instruction to be factually generated, the defendant must produce \u201csome evidence\u201d sufficient to raise the jury issue. <em>See Martin, </em>329 Md. at 359-61, 619 A.2d at 996-97 (upholding trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on imperfect self defense because the defendant did not satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard). As we described in <em>Martin, </em>this standard is a fairly low hurdle for a defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\"><em>Some evidence </em>is not strictured by the test of a specific standard. It calls for no more than what it says\u2014\u201csome,\u201d as that word is understood in common, everyday usage. It need not rise to the level of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201cpreponderance.\u201d The source of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant. It is of no matter that the self-defense claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support [defense], the defendant has met his burden. Then the baton is passed to the State. It must shoulder the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury that the [defense does not apply.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><em>Martin, </em>329 Md. at 359, 619 A.2d at 995-96 (quoting <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216, 571 A.2d 1251, 1256 (1990)). <em>See also Dishman v. State, </em>352 Md. 279, 292, 721 A.2d 699, 705 (1998) (\u201cThe task of this Court on review is to determine whether the criminal defendant produced the minimum threshold of evidence necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case[.]\u201d) The evidence is evaluated in the light most favorable to the accused. <em>See Brogden v. State, </em>384 Md. 631, 650, 866 A.2d 129, 140 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In this case, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the issue of an unlawful arrest was generated. In denying Arthur\u2019s contention that the underlying arrest was unlawful, the trial court reasoned that \u201c[f]rom the Defendant\u2019s initial, own testimony, best case he was littering.... I mean, looking at it objectively the Defendant\u2019s own conduct constituted a particular offense.\u201d Yet, on the witness stand, Arthur explained that he had been tossing the newspaper with a friend, and that it had never hit Stanley\u2019s police cruiser. Moreover, Arthur and his witnesses testified that, after the newspaper volley, Stanley jumped out of his car and began harassing Arthur for no apparent reason, and would not tell him why he was being arrested. Examining this evidence in the light most favorable to Arthur, we agree with the Court of</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Special Appeals that, \u201c[i]f the jury believed [Arthur] and his witnesses, they might conclude that [ ] Stanley had no reason to arrest [Arthur].\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>193 Md.App. at 457, 997 A.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Our next step is to evaluate whether the pattern jury instruction fairly covered the issue of whether Stanley had probable cause to arrest Arthur. \u201c[A] requested instruction need not be given where other instructions \u2018fairly cover\u2019 the subject matter of the requested instruction.\u201d <em>See Gunning v. State, </em>347 Md. 332, 348, 701 A.2d 374, 382 (1997). It is on this point that we diverge from the Court of Special Appeals. Our intermediate appellate court reasoned that the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d language provided in the pattern instruction \u201cproperly conveys the concept of probable cause.\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>193 Md.App. at 457-58, 997 A.2d at 906. In doing so, that Court hung its hat on language we have used in describing probable cause as \u201ca non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458, 997 A.2d at 906 (citing, <em>inter alia, Haley v. State, </em>398 Md. 106, 132-33, 919 A.2d 1200 (2007)). Yet, we have also used the same phrase to describe \u201creasonable articulable suspicion,\u201d a standard that is not sufficient to permit an arrest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">The second level of interaction, known as a <em>Terry </em>stop, allows a police officer to forcibly stop a citizen if the officer has reasonable grounds for doing so, <em>ie., </em>that the officer can point to specific and articulable facts that warrant the stop. The level of suspicion necessary to constitute reasonable, articulable suspicion is less demanding than that for probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\"><em>Haley, </em>398 Md. at 132, 919 A.2d at 1214-1215 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). <em>See also Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 16, 997 A.2d 768, 776-777 (2010) (\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018reasonable grounds,\u2019 in [Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article] equates to \u2018a reasonable articulable suspicion,\u2019 as that term is understood in Fourth Amendment parlance.\u201d). Because the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d language can be used to describe two different standards, it can be ambiguous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>depending on the context. If the jury interpreted the given jury instruction as meaning \u201creasonable articulable suspicion,\u201d it may have wrongly concluded that the \u201cprobable cause\u201d element of the resisting arrest crime was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The \u201cNOTES ON USE\u201d commentary to the Pattern Instruction suggests that the drafters recognized that the naked pattern instruction would not work well in all contexts. Instead, they suggested that trial courts, in cases where probable cause is at issue, modify the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d factor accordingly: \u201cIf probable cause is an issue, the court should draft a fact-specific version of, or supplement to, [the requirement that \u2018the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant [was committing] [had committed] (crime)\u2019].\u201d Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n, <em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions </em>4:27.1 (2007). Here, because the evidence presented at trial generated the issue of whether Stanley had probable cause to arrest Arthur, we think the only way for Arthur to have a fair trial is for the jury to understand the law concerning his right to resist an unlawful arrest. A reasonable juror, without the benefit of an instruction on this point, might believe that, when a police officer tells him he is under arrest, he must succumb, regardless of the circumstances, and wait for relief (and release) until he is taken before a judicial officer. The trial court abused its discretion in failing to provide the jury instruction on such law. This error may have unfairly prejudiced Arthur on both counts, because the jury may have improperly believed that if Stanley had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to arrest Arthur, Stanley\u2019s earlier order must have been a lawful one. Accordingly, Arthur is entitled to a new trial on the charges of resisting arrest and failure to obey a lawful order.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

If you find that the defendant was lawfully arrested, you must then proceed to determine whether he refused to submit to that arrest, whether that resistance was to an officer of the law in the performance of his legal duties, and whether the officer had identified himself as such.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\">Resisting an unlawful arrest is not a crime in Maryland. If an arrest is illegal, the arrestee may use any reasonable means even force, to effect his escape.

In my opinion, however, the failure to deliver such an instruction does not constitute error when the jury has convicted the defendant of both (1) the crime for which he or she was arrested, and (2) the crime of resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In the case at bar, the Petitioner\u2019s \u201cfailure to obey\u201d conviction necessarily established that he did not have the right to resist his warrantless arrest on that charge. That conviction rendered unnecessary, as a matter of law, an instruction to the effect that a defendant who is subjected to an unlawful warrantless arrest may use reasonable force to resist that arrest. Because the Petitioner was convicted of both charges, I dissent from the holding that he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Judges HARRELL and BATTAGLIA have authorized me to state that they join this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">.
