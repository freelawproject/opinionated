Specifically, we are asked whether records of an investigation undertaken by the County Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs Division, related to alleged violations of administrative rules of the Department by Sergeant Edward Shropshire and Captain Willie Parker-Loan, Appellees, in connection with an automobile accident involving Assistant Fire Chief Gregory J. DeHaven, can be disclosed to the County\u2019s Inspector General.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">After a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ordered the disclosure of records of the internal investigation, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>information \u201cof a personal nature.\u201d Both parties appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but, before the appeal could be decided by the intermediate appellate court, we granted a Petition for Writ of Certiorari filed by Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Montgomery County v.

[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">We shall hold that records of an internal investigation pertaining to the alleged violation of administrative rules are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to Section 10\u2014616(i) of the State Government Article<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, therefore, may not be disclosed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Maryland Public Information Act to the Montgomery County Inspector General.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In November 2008, Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan of the Montgomery County Police Department responded to an automobile accident involving Montgomery County Assistant Fire Chief Gregory J. DeHaven. A complaint subsequently was filed questioning the police officers\u2019 conduct during the accident investigation, in which it was alleged that both had violated various administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">At the conclusion of the investigation on May 26, 2009, the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) of the County\u2019s police department determined that Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan had committed \u201cno administrative violations\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">The Internal Affairs Division has completed its investigation stemming from the event of November 30, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">The investigation concluded that there were no administrative violations on your part, and after a careful review, I concur with this finding. This investigation will be available for expungement in three years under the provisions of the Expungement Directive, Function Code 309.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Memorandum from Captain David Faleinelli, Director, Internal Affairs Division, to Sergeant Edward Shropshire (May 26, 2009); Memorandum from Captain David Faleinelli, Director, Internal Affairs Division, to Captain Willie Parker-Loan (May 26, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Even before the close of the internal affairs investigation, on January 9, 2009, the Montgomery County Inspector General initiated an investigation into the handling of the accident \u201cto determine whether [the Department\u2019s] methods to investigate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Gregory J. DeHaven\u2019s vehicle accident on November 30, 2008 and any improper actions on the part of those involved in the accident are consistent with generally accepted investigative standards to ensure legal, fiscal, and ethical accountability in Montgomery County government organizations.\u201d The Inspector General submitted a request to the Chief Administrative Officer of the Offices of the County Executive for numerous records, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">1. Name, rank, duty assignment and duty station of all Police Department employees who responded to the traffic accident involving Assistant Fire Chief Gregory J. DeHaven on November 30, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">2. The duty status of each individual who responded to the accident scene on November 30; if on duty, what time did each individual start and end their work day and what was the pay status (regular time or overtime) for each individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">3.

Copies of all applicable Police Department policies, procedures and training instructions with regard to completing the State of Maryland Motor Vehicle Accident Report....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Before the records were disclosed, Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan filed a complaint in the Circuit Court seeking a declaration prohibiting the custodian of records from releasing the internal investigation records to the Inspector General. The officers alleged that the records were exempt from disclosure, because they were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d or, alternatively, were \u201cconfidential under State law,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>14. Records of police internal affairs investigations are personnel records under Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-616(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">15. Personnel records are confidential under Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-616(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">16. Records of police internal affairs investigations are confidential under State law and thus exempt from disclosure pursuant to Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-615(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">17. Plaintiffs assert that [the custodian of records] has a clear duty to deny the Inspector General access to IAD File 09-0001 pursuant to Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10-615(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">18. Plaintiffs assert that [the custodian of records] has a clear duty to deny the Inspector General access to IAD File 09-0001 pursuant to Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7 10\u2014616(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">19. Plaintiffs assert that they have a plain and clear right to have [the custodian of records] deny the Inspector General access to IAD File 09-0001 FI pursuant to Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 10-615(1) and 10-616(i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">20. Defendants maintain that the custodian of records is required to give the Inspector General access to IAD File 09-0001. Defendants also contend that the Inspector General is seeking the records for an investigation that he is conducting and that therefore, Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 10-615(1) and 10\u2014616(i) do not prohibit their disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">21. Plaintiffs will face irreparable harm if their confidential personnel records are disclosed to the Inspector General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">In the second count of the complaint, Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan also sought a writ of mandamus to prohibit the Inspector General from accessing the internal affairs records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Thereafter, Montgomery County filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the internal affairs investigation records were not \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d but rather were \u201cinvestigatory records,\u201d because no evidence of wrongdoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>was found by either officer, such that \u201cno documentation ha[d] been placed in [the officers\u2019] personnel file[s] about the investigation.\u201d The County further argued that because the Inspector General is charged with preventing and detecting \u201cfraud, waste and abuse in government activities,\u201d disclosure of the records was mandated by County law.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan responded and also filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the internal affairs records in the present case constitute \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to Section 10\u2014616(i) of the State Government Article and are, therefore, protected from disclosure. In the alternative, the officers contended that the records were protected from disclosure by Section 10-615(1) of the State Government Article, prohibiting disclosure of those records that are \u201cconfidential\u201d by virtue of State law, because \u201cpolice internal affairs investigative records are confidential under LEOBR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">After a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the Circuit Court judge delivered an oral opinion, granting the Inspector General access to the disputed internal affairs investigation records, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">[T]he custodian of records is authorized to release records relating to the investigation by the Internal Affairs Division into the conduct of the [officers] in the underlying matter, provided however, that the custodian may not release information within the file that is of a personal nature, unless such personal information is directly relevant to the underlying investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">And by way of illustration, date of hire was mentioned. Well, certainly, date of hire would generally be personal information and not investigatory information. It would generally not fall within the definition of an investigatory record. However, if, for instance, the date of hire, the fact that an officer was a rookie, had just recently begun\u2014and I don\u2019t suggest for a moment that was the case here, but I\u2019m just trying to give by way of an illustration\u2014that if date of hire was relevant to the conduct of the investigation; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>is, that it in part explained perhaps why an officer did or did not do something, then it would be subject to disclosure. So if the personal information is relevant, directly relevant to the investigation, it could be disclosed, but not unless directly relevant to the investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">With respect to Count 2, where I\u2019m asked to grant a writ of mandamus, mandamusing the custodian to abide by his or her statutory duties, and because there is no evidence before me that would lead me to believe, and no reason to believe, that the custodian will not follow his or her statutory duties, in fact because the Court has every reason to believe that the custodian will follow their statutory duties, the Court will grant the County judgment as to Count 2, all under the request for a writ of mandamus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">Let me finally say that the County has made an alternative argument that even if it\u2019s personal information, that it nevertheless would be subject to disclosure, notwithstanding the mandatory provisions of Section 10-616, because it could nevertheless be disclosed in light of the County ordinance which created the Office of Inspector General and empowered the Inspector General to investigate issues concerning waste, management, et cetera, of various departments; and further, that the ordinance directed the custodian of records to provide, upon request, the information to the Inspector General in the conduct of those duties. The Court finds, in light of the controversy as it was described by the parties, that it is unnecessary for the Court to reach that issue in this case, and particularly in light of the fact that there\u2019s no cross-claim for declaratory judgment, or any other kind of relief, I decline to decide that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The Circuit Court entered an order granting the County\u2019s motion for summary judgment and stating that the Inspector General was permitted to access the internal affairs records, with the exception of \u201cinformation of a personal nature\u201d unless \u201cdirectly relevant to the underlying investigation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED, as to Count I, that pursuant to State Government Article \u00a7 10\u2014618(f) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Custodian of Records is authorized to release records relating to the investigation by the Internal Affairs Division into the conduct of the [officers] in the underlying matter, provided, however, that the custodian may not release information within the file that is of a personal nature, unless such personal information is directly relevant to the underlying investigationf.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The County appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, asserting that the records, in their entirety, should be disclosed to the Inspector General, and the officers also appealed, arguing that the internal affairs investigation records were prohibited from disclosure as \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d or alternatively, as \u201cconfidential\u201d by law pursuant to the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights. This Court issued a writ of certiorari at this juncture, before the intermediate appellate court acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Montgomery County Inspector General</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The Office of the Montgomery County Inspector General is a relatively new institution, created in 1997,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> identified in Section 2\u2014151(a) of the Montgomery County Code as having three objectives, namely to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">1. review the effectiveness and efficiency of programs and operations of County government and independent County agencies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>2. prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in government activities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">3. propose ways to increase the legal, fiscal, and ethical accountability of County government departments and County-funded agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The Inspector General is appointed by the County Council for a four year term and has powers granted by ordinance, including the power to \u201cconduct investigations\u201d and \u201cdevelop recommendations,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">(h) <em>Powers and Duties. </em>The Inspector General must attempt to identify actions which would enhance the productivity, effectiveness, or efficiency of programs and operations of County government and independent County agencies.

Moreover, Section 2-151(J) provides that each \u201cdepartment or office in County government\u201d is required to provide any information concerning its operations to the County Inspector General, although the Inspector General \u201cmust comply with any restrictions on public disclosure of the document or information that are required by federal or state law\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">1. The Inspector General is legally entitled to, and each department or office in County government and each independent County agency must promptly give the Inspector General, any document or other information concerning its operations, budget, or programs that the Inspector General requests. The Inspector General must comply with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>restrictions on public disclosure of the documents or information that are required by federal or state law. The Inspector General must immediately notify the Chief Administrative Officer, the County Attorney, and the President of the Council if any department, office, or agency does not provide any document or information within a reasonable time after the Inspector General requests it. The Chief Administrative Officer (for departments and offices in the Executive branch of County government), the County Attorney (for independent County agencies), and the Council President (for offices in the legislative branch of County government) must then take appropriate action (including legal action if necessary) to require the department, office, or agency to provide the requested document or information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">2. If the Inspector General does not receive all necessary information under paragraph (1), the Inspector General may issue a subpoena to require any person to appear under oath as a witness or produce any record or other material in connection with an audit or investigation under this Section. The Inspector General may enforce any subpoena issued under this Section in any court with jurisdiction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Internal Police Investigations</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Internal investigations of law enforcement officers are governed by Sections 3-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article, Maryland Code (2003), known as the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights (LEOBR).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, Section 3-104 of the Public Safety Article is controlling whenever a law enforcement officer is under investigation or subjected to interrogation by a law enforcement agency \u201cfor a reason that may lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014The investigation or interrogation by a law enforcement agency of a law enforcement officer for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>reason that may lead to disciplinary action, demotion, or dismissal shall be conducted in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJE\">Montgomery County Police Department Function Code 301, \u201cDisciplinary Process for LEOBR\u2014Covered Sworn Officers,\u201d provides guidelines for the disciplinary process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">An internal investigation is initiated by a \u201ccomplaint\u201d or \u201callegation of misconduct made against an employee of the department.\u201d The Director of the Internal Affairs Division reviews the complaint and determines whether it merits further investigation.

Section 10-618, however, is a discretionary provision, stating that \u201cif a custodian believes that inspection of a part of a public record by the applicant would be contrary to the public interest, the custodian <em>may </em>deny inspection by the applicant of that part\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">The \u201cRubik\u2019s Cube\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the present case involves whether the records of the internal affairs investigation in issue are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>deemed \u201cpersonnel records\u201d and not disclosable or are records of \u201cinvestigations\u201d and the subject of discretionary disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The County argues that the internal affairs records constitute \u201cinvestigative\u201d records subject to discretionary disclosure pursuant to Section 10\u2014618(f), because the investigation \u201cyielded no evidence that the officers were involved in any wrongdoing, so no disciplinary action ensued.\u201d Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan counter that the internal affairs records are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to Section 10-616(i), no matter what, because an investigation of alleged administrative rule violations \u201cnecessarily entails the employer\u2019s narrowly focused assessment of the employee\u2019s performance and ability to do a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">There is no statutory definition of \u201cpersonnel records\u201d in the Maryland Public Information Act. <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, 352 </em>Md. 74, 721 A.2d 196 (1998), was our first foray to consider the contours of the phrase \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to Section 10-616\u00ae of the State Government Article. We recognized that the language of subsection (i) \u201cdiscloses what type of documents the Legislature considered to be personnel records,\u201d and determined that personnel records were those relating to hiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving an employee\u2019s status. In that case, a collegiate newspaper had requested documents from the University of Maryland relating to campus parking violations committed by members of the men\u2019s basketball team, as well as the team\u2019s head coach. We concluded that the University had erroneously denied the requests on the basis of the \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exception, asserting that parking tickets received by the coach were nondisclosable \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d In so doing, we reasoned that tickets issued by campus police did not relate to the coach\u2019s hiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving his status as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>employee, and, therefore, did not fit within the commonly understood meaning of the term \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 721 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">Subsequently, in <em>Governor v. Washington Post, </em>360 Md. 520, 759 A.2d 249 (2000), we reinforced the tenets of <em>Kirwan </em>when we emphasized that scheduling and telephone records were not \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d because they did not relate to an employee\u2019s \u201chiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving his status as an employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, 759 A.2d at 264. In that case, the Washington Post had requested telephone and scheduling records from the Office of the Governor. We determined that the records did not fall within the purview of \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d because, for instance, the record of telephone numbers called by the Governor or members of his staff about possible future appointments did not relate to an employee\u2019s hiring, discipline, or status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">The identification of the telephone number which the Governor or a member of his staff called, or the identification of someone with whom the Governor met, concerning a possible future appointment to a judgeship or position in the executive branch of state government, would not amount to a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d as defined in <em>Kirwan. </em>The simple record of what number was called, or with whom the Governor met, about possible <em>future </em>employment would not relate to the discipline, promotion, dismissal, status, job performance, or achievement of an existing or former employee. Again, while the substance of the conversations might in some cases fall in the category of \u201capplication for employment\u201d or relate to \u201chiring,\u201d the fact that the Governor or a staff member telephoned or met with an identified individual would not be a \u201cpersonnel record\u201d under any \u201ccommonly understood meaning of the term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 548, 759 A.2d at 264, quoting <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d at 200.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In <em>Baltimore v. Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. 78, 617 A.2d 1040 (1993), we considered, in the context of discretionary denial by the custodian of records, whether the police department had appropriately denied access to records of an internal investigation into complaints regarding the conduct of two police officers during the service of a subpoena duces tecum. Although we were not presented with the issue of whether the internal affairs records constituted \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d we, nevertheless, reasoned that the records of the investigation, which determined that the allegations against the officers were \u201cnot sustained,\u201d were permissibly precluded from disclosure by the custodian, in the interests of fairness to the investigated officers as well as the integrity of the investigatory process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">[WJhere, as here, the investigation concludes with a determination that the allegations are not sustained, fairness to the investigated officers and the avoidance of needless publicity to the cooperating witnesses, with possible inhibiting effects on future investigations, justify on public interest grounds the custodian\u2019s denial of inspection to one other than a person in interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 95, 617 A.2d at 1048. In so doing, we noted that \u201c[mjistaken or even deliberately false reports and accusations are made against members of the department,\u201d and that, \u201c[i]n some instances, the most conscientious and hardworking members will be the subject of such reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 617 A.2d at 1043. We further emphasized the significant public interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>in preserving the confidentiality of internal police investigations both in promoting cooperation by civilian witnesses and police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In the present case, the Internal Affairs Division inquiry explored whether Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan had committed administrative rule violations in connection with the accident investigation involving Assistant Fire Chief Gregory J. DeHaven. Specifically, the internal affairs investigation examined \u201c[ajllegations of administrative misconduct ... that, if true, would or could result in disciplinary action.\u201d As we emphasized in <em>Kirwan </em>and its progeny, because the internal affairs records involving Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan related to employee discipline, the records are indeed \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exempt from disclosure pursuant to Section 10\u2014616(i) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Moreover, as we recognized in <em>Maryland Committee, </em>where, as here, an investigation clears the officers of wrongdoing, there is a significant public interest in maintaining confidentiality, both in fairness to the investigated officers and cooperating witnesses. This policy is embodied in Section 3-104(n) of the Public Safety Article, which states that an investigated officer must \u201cexecute a confidentiality agreement\u201d before obtaining a copy of his or her investigatory file at the close of an investigation. As evidenced by the deposition testimony of Internal Affairs Division Chief, Captain David Falcinelli, attached to Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \u201ceven the best officers could be subject to false or baseless complaints,\u201d so that an officer\u2019s professional life and reputation are challenged. Finally, records of internal investigations contain significant personal information, such as the investigated officer\u2019s name, date of birth, address, social security number, level of education, as well as the complaint, transcripts of witness interviews, and the investigator\u2019s notes, that if disclosed, could be potentially detrimental to not only the officers, but also the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The County asserts that the internal affairs records are, nevertheless, disclosable, referring us to <em>Maryland State Police v. NAACP Branches, </em>190 Md.App. 359, 988 A.2d 1075 (2010), <em>cert. granted Maryland State Police v. NAACP Branches, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010), which also was relied upon by the Circuit Court in the present case, in which the Court of Special Appeals considered whether documents relating to allegations of illegal racial profiling were \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act. In that case, the NAACP and the Maryland State Police (\u201cMSP\u201d) had entered into a consent decree in federal court in 2003, in order to settle litigation between the parties that obligated the MSP to prevent any incidents of racial profiling by its officers. In 2007, the NAACP became suspicious that the MSP was not fulfilling its obligations under the consent decree and filed a request with MSP for \u201cdocuments obtained or created in connection with any complaint of racial profiling,\u201d pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act. The MSP denied the request on the ground that the documents were \u201cpersonnel records of an individual\u201d pursuant to Section 10\u2014616(i) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The Court of Special Appeals in <em>NAACP Branches </em>determined that the documents were disclosable, because they were not \u201cpersonnel records;\u201d the records were not indexed by the name of the employee or by the employee\u2019s identification number, but rather were stored in a central location, suggesting that the records were significant in the aggregate, as providing statistical information, rather than pertaining to the hiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any other employee matter relative to particular employees. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 988 A.2d at 1080-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The present case is distinguishable, because the internal affairs records specifically reference the acts taken by Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan during the investigation of a discrete motor vehicle accident and the unsustained allegations against them, rather than statistics compiled regarding the acts of a group of officers without identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of their personal information. Records of alleged systemic racial profiling by a police department as a whole clearly are differentiated from records investigating alleged administrative rule violations by identified police officers in connection with a specific incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Finally, the County\u2019s reference to <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>107 Md.App. 178, 667 A.2d 917 (1995), in which a police officer, who was disciplined for \u201csexual misconduct,\u201d filed a Section 1983 claim alleging that he was a victim of race discrimination and requesting answers to interrogatories relating to all departmental investigations involving sexual misconduct, is misplaced because the Maryland Public Information Act was not implicated in that case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Superintendent v. Henschen, </em>279 Md. 468, 473-74, 369 A.2d 558, 561 (1977) (reasoning that \u201cwhether or not due process considerations might make [] records available to ... a party in [a civil or] administrative proceeding ... does not determine whether they are available under the Public Information Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In sum, the internal affairs records involving alleged administrative rule violations by Sergeant Shropshire and Captain Parker-Loan are \u201cpersonnel records\u201d pursuant to Section 10-616(i) of the State Government Article, and are, therefore, mandatorily exempt from disclosure by the custodian of records. We shall direct that the case be remanded to the Circuit Court for entry of an appropriate declaratory judgment to that effect, in conformance with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR ENTRY OF A DECLARATORY</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>JUDGMENT IN CONFORMANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">ADKINS and BARBERA, JJ., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\">.

Subsequently, in <em>Baltimore Police v.

The defendant sought records of an Internal Affairs Division investigation concerning an accusation that a detective, who had participated in the defendant\u2019s arrest and was scheduled to testify at his trial on drug charges, had been dishonest in an unrelated matter, to cross-examine the officer at trial. The Court of Special Appeals, guided by <em>Kirwan, </em>agreed that the records indeed constituted \"personnel records,\u201d but determined that the trial judge could compel disclosure after having balanced the criminal defendant\u2019s need for relevant information in the records against the privacy rights of other persons and the custodian\u2019s duty to maintain confidentiality. <em>Id. </em>at 290, 857 A.2d 148, 857 A.2d at 158, citing <em>Blades v.

Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 84, 721 A.2d 196, 200 (1998) (\u201c[T]he policy of the Public Information Act is to allow access to public records.\u201d). This objective is memorialized in the statute itself, MPIA \u00a7 10-612(a) (\u201cAll persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.\u201d), and reiterated in its legislative history, House Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee 1976 REPORT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND at 111 (\u201cBy amending the law in this manner, it makes clear that in construing even the withholding section the law should be viewed in a manner which would permit disclosure.\u201d). Accordingly, we have repeatedly held that \u201cthe statute should be interpreted to favor disclosure.\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 84, 721 A.2d at 200. Here, however, the majority glosses over this policy in order to rush to a conclusion that would undermine it.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">This case presents us with a tug of war, between the police and the public, over the boundaries of \u201cinvestigative\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d records. The playing field is not level, however, as the burden to show that an exemption exists rests squarely on the shoulders of the party seeking to prevent disclosure, in this case, the police officers. <em>Cf. Cranford v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 759, 780, 481 A.2d 221, 231-32 (1984) (holding that the presentation of evidence at trial to support the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>of petitioner\u2019s MPIA request was \u201csimply too general and conclusory, standing alone, to meet the [custodian\u2019s] burden of proof\u2019); <em>Fioretti v. Maryland State Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 87, 716 A.2d 258, 268-69 (1998) (custodian was \u201crequired to show that the documents it [sought] to withhold [were] investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes, [and] that disclosure of the records would have prejudiced its investigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The MPIA sheds some light onto the types of documents that are \u201cpersonnel records.\u201d Although the MPIA does not explictly define the term, its language \u201cdiscloses what type of documents the Legislature considered to be personnel records,\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 82, 721 A.2d at 200, by listing three categories of documents: (1) an application for employment; (2) performance rating; and (3) scholastic achievement. Keeping in mind the doctrine of ejusdem generis, <em>see generally In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. 186, 190, 634 A.2d 53, 55-56 (1993),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this list suggests that the term \u201cpersonnel records\u201d be interpreted to include \u201conly those [records] of the same class or general nature as those specifically antecedently mentioned.\u201d <em>Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 295, 558 A.2d 399, 408-09 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">I first observe that the type of records developed during an investigation, like the records at issue in this case, are a far cry from the three examples enumerated in the statute. This is so even if, as the majority asserts, that investigation concerns a discrete event and involves only a few, identifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>employees. Indeed, the <em>Kirwan </em>Court reasoned that, in light of the MPIA\u2019s policy favoring disclosure, it did \u201cnot believe that the General Assembly intended that <em>any </em>record identifying an employee would be exempt from disclosure as a personnel record. Instead, the General Assembly likely intended that the term \u2018personnel records\u2019 retain its common sense meaning.\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 84, 721 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Here, the Inspector General was attempting to determine whether both the accident and internal affairs investigations were consistent with generally accepted investigative standards. Thus the purpose of the request went to investigation technique and not to evaluating the performance of the individual officers. We should not, as I submit the majority does, extend the term \u201cpersonnel records\u201d to include all records relating to an officer\u2019s actions in the course of his duty. Not only would this holding impair the Inspector General in performing its oversight role, but would also shield the police, who are public officers, from public scrutiny, an outcome completely at odds with the spirit of the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">This is not the first time Maryland courts have distinguished \u201cinvestigation records\u201d and \u201cpersonnel records\u201d with regard to investigations of potential police misconduct. In <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Maryland State Conference of NAACP Branches, </em>190 Md.App. 359, 988 A.2d 1075 (2010), the Court of Special Appeals held that internal affairs files relating to investigations into complaints of illegal racial profiling were investigative records and not personnel records. The Court began by emphasizing the \u201cbroad remedial purpose\u201d of the MPIA, which is to ensure \u201cthat citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 988 A.2d at 1079 (quoting <em>A.S. Abell Publg. Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068, 1071 (1983)). The Court then applied this reasoning to the records of racial profiling complaints, concluding that the public has an interest in protecting against racial profiling by its government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">Racial profiling complaints against Maryland State Troopers do not involve private matters concerning intimate details of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the trooper\u2019s private life. Instead, such complaints involve events occurring while the trooper is on duty and engaged in public service. As such, the files at issue concern public actions by agents of the State concerning affairs of government, which are exactly the types of material the Act was designed to allow the public to see. A State Trooper does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to such records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><em>NAACP Branches, </em>190 Md.App. at 368, 988 A.2d at 1080 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Here, the officers were on duty and engaged in public service when they investigated the automobile accident. The internal affairs staff were also on duty and engaged in public service when they investigated whether the officers\u2019 investigation violated any administrative rules. Undeniably, the public has an interest in protecting against abuse, bias, and conspiracy by the very people it has hired for protection. Therefore, like the records in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>\u201cthe files at issue concern public actions by agents of the State concerning affairs of government, which are exactly the types of material the Act was designed to allow the public to see.\u201d 190 Md.App. at 368, 988 A.2d at 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In <em>NAACP Branches </em>the Court also reasoned that, because the records so clearly fell within the \u201crecords of investigations\u201d exemption under the MPIA, the General Assembly could not have intended that those same records would also be subject to the more general \u201cpersonnel records\u201d exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ats\">It is illogical to believe that the General Assembly, when it adopted a permissible degree exception for \u201crecords of investigations conducted by ... a police department,\u201d and set forth detailed provisions governing when such records could be withheld <em>(see </em>section 10-618(f)) also intended that a custodian of records must withhold investigatory files of a police department under the much more general \u201cpersonnel record[s] of an individual\u201d exception as set forth in section 10-616(i). Because the records the NAACP seeks in this case fit precisely within the class of records governed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>section 10-618(f), we see no reason why its provision should not control, rather than section 10\u2014616(i) of the Act[,] upon [] which the MSP relies. In other words, the specific statutory provision takes precedence over the more general one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">190 Md.App. at 370-71, 988 A.2d at 1081. This logic holds true for the records here. The requested documents concern an internal affairs investigation, meaning that they are, quite plainly, \u201crecords of investigations conducted by ... a police department.\u201d Accordingly, they fall under the permissible denial section of the MPIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The Majority attempts to distinguish this case on the grounds that the racial profiling records at issue in <em>NAACP Branches </em>did not contain personal information on the individual officer and were stored in a central location:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">[T]he records [in <em>NAACP Branches </em>] were not indexed by the name of the employee or by the employee\u2019s identification number, but rather were stored in a central location, suggesting that the records were significant in the aggregate[. Here,] the internal affairs records specifically reference the acts taken by [the two officers] during the investigation of a discrete motor vehicle accident and the unsustained allegations against them, rather than statistics compiled regarding the acts of a group of officers without identification of their personal information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Maj. Op. at 382, 23 A.3d at 217. It is true that, in <em>NAACP Branches, </em>the records \u201cwere not indexed by the name of the employee or by the employee\u2019s identification number[,]\u201d but instead were \u201ckept in one filing cabinet located in the MSP\u2019s Internal Affairs Office.\u201d 190 Md.App. at 369, 988 A.2d at 1080. Yet, as the County argues, that also seems to be the case here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">All internal affairs files are maintained at the Internal Affairs Division of the Police Department. When an internal affairs investigation does not result in disciplinary action, no documentation about the investigation is placed in the investigated officer\u2019s personnel file. Only when the investigation results in a \u201csustained\u201d ruling and the punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ment implemented is more than an oral admonishment does a copy of the statement of charges of the internal affairs investigation become part of the investigated officer\u2019s personnel file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">More importantly, as the majority concedes, the internal affairs records pertain to \u201cthe <em>investigation </em>of a discrete motor vehicle accident[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). The fact that only a few officers were involved in the underlying investigation, making them easily identifiable, does not transform the <em>investigation </em>records into personnel records. Indeed, in our electronic age, a simple word search can yield all documents pertaining to a particular officer. Under the majority\u2019s logic, this keystroke would transform those records into personnel records, regardless of whether a more appropriate label exists. The <em>Kirwan </em>Court recognized this as an absurd result, and it concluded that the General Assembly did not intend that <em>\u201cany </em>record identifying an employee would be exempt from disclosure as a personnel record.\u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 84, 721 A.2d at 200. For these reasons, I conclude that the records here are not personnel records.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Ironically, my belief that internal review records are records of investigation is shared by the officers\u2019 comrades in arms. In <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Md. Committee Against the Gun Ban, </em>329 Md. 78, 617 A.2d 1040 (1993), it was the police department that characterized such records as falling under the \u201cinvestigation\u201d exemption of the PIA. Just like the documents here, the records at issue in that case were generated in the course of an investigation conducted by the Internal Investigation Division (IID) of the police department in Baltimore City. That investigation was initiated by civilian complaints about the conduct of police officers during the service of a subpoena duces tecum on the Maryland Committee Against the Gun Ban (\u201cCommittee\u201d). When the Committee sought disclosure of those records, the director of the IID rejected the request by relying on the records of \u201cinvestigations\u201d exemption of the MPIA. 329 Md. at 86, 617 A.2d at 1044. The records in the present case are of the exact same type as those in <em>Gun Ban; </em>they are the product of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>internal review investigation into the techniques employed by its officers during the execution of a public service.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Because the records in this case are \u201cinvestigation records,\u201d thereby falling under the permissible denial section of the MPIA, Montgomery County law demands that the custodian release them to the Inspector General. As we have previously explained, \u201cthe \u2018permissible denial\u2019 provisions of the MPIA authorize custodians to exercise discretion in granting or denying requests for certain information. Therefore, home rule counties may direct or guide the exercise of this discretion, or even eliminate it entirely, by local enactment.\u201d <em>Police Patrol Security Systems v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>378 Md. 702, 712, 838 A.2d 1191, 119 7 (2003). <em>See also Caffrey v. Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>370 Md. 272, 305, 805 A.2d 268, 287 (2002) (\u201cThe permissible denials of the MPIA are also subject to waiver by the County.\u201d). Here, the County has expressly directed that every County department is to provide the Inspector General with certain records upon request: \u201cThe Inspector General is legally entitled to, and each department or office in County government and each independent County agency must promptly give the Inspector General, any document or other information concerning its operations, budget, or programs that the Inspector General requests.\u201d Montgomery Code \u00a7 2-151(i)(1). Accordingly, the IAD records in this case must be released to the Inspector General.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully dissent. Judge Barbera authorizes me to state that she joins in the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\">. As this case describes, a general statutory term followed by a list of particulars is to be interpreted narrowly to \u201cinclude only those things or persons of the same class or general nature as those specifically mentioned.\u2019\u2019 <em>In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. 186, 190, 634 A.2d 53, 55-56 (1993). The rule applies when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">(1) the statute contains an enumeration by specific words; (2) the members of the enumeration suggest a class; (3) the class is not exhausted by the enumeration; (4) a general reference supplementing the enumeration, usually following it; and (5) there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a broader meaning than the doctrine requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-5\">. The officers also allege that disclosure would be improper because the IAD records are made \u201cconfidential by law\u201d pursuant to the Law Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights (\"LEOBR\u201d). This Court has employed a balancing test when dealing with the confidentiality interest of a police officer under the LEOBR. In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 730 A.2d 181 (1999), a robbery conviction was reversed because petitioner was not allowed access to prior statements by police officer witnesses made to the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. The IAD was investigating the discharge of the officer\u2019s weapon during the defendant's arrest. The LEOBR \"limits access to the internal investigation file to the affected officer, and then only to exculpatory information, and does not expressly provide for access by anyone else.\u201d 354 Md. at 308, 730 A.2d at 192. Nevertheless, this Court held that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to examine those records was in error, as it violated the defendant's right under the \"Jencks\u201d rule, <em>see generally Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 582-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>83, 530 A.2d 743 (1987), <em>vacated, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 L.Ed.2d 916, <em>aff\u2019d in part and vacated on other grounds, </em>314 Md. 111, 549 A.2d 17 (1988), to examine all written reports or statements previously made by a witness to determine whether they contained any inconsistency with the testimony given at trial. In reaching this conclusion, the Court balanced the confidentiality interest \"against the confrontation and due process rights of the defendant!!,]\u201d reasoning that \"[w]hile confidentiality does go to discoverability, it does not guarantee insulation of the confidential matter from disclosure.\u201d 354 Md. at 309, 730 A.2d at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Here, the police officers\u2019 confidentiality interest must be balanced against the public interest in transparency. The Inspector General was created specifically to \"prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in government activities!!.]\u201d Montgomery County Code \u00a7 2-151(a)(2). Indeed, the public has a vital interest in preventing abuse in government activities. On the other side of the scale, the possibility that the IAD file will be released to the public at large is minor, because under the County Code, the \u201cInspector General must comply with any restrictions on public disclosure of the document or information that are required by federal or state law.\u201d Montgomery County Code \u00a7 2-151(0(1). Thus, the confidentiality interest extends only to preventing the Inspector General from viewing the file. Here, the Inspector General is acting as the government\u2019s auditor of the IAD, much like the IAD was the government\u2019s auditor of the underlying police investigation. I do not see how the officers view their confidentiality interest as being further hindered by the same type of investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
