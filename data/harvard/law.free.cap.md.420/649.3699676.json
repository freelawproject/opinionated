According to Ms. Roberson, she filed her petition because Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC (\u201cFord\u201d) wrongfully repossessed her car in the wake of her prior chapter 7[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] bankruptcy discharge and she wanted to redress that wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">Ms. Roberson filed a previous chapter 7 bankruptcy case (bankruptcy case no. 07-20394) on October 22, 2007 and she received a discharge of her debts on January 30, 2008. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the bankruptcy schedules in her chapter 7 case, she listed Ford as a creditor and the vehicle she financed through Ford (the \u201cVehicle\u201d) as an asset. She did not reaffirm the Vehicle during her chapter 7 bankruptcy case. There appears to be no dispute that at all times before, during and after Ms. Roberson\u2019s chapter 7 bankruptcy case, she timely made all monthly payments on the Vehicle to Ford and the Vehicle was, at all times, properly insured and titled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Ms. Roberson had entered into a \u201cMaryland Simple Interest Vehicle Retail Installment Contract,\u201d containing an <em>ipso facto </em>clause,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in which, among other contingencies, the filing of a bankruptcy petition was characterized as a default:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">To consummate the purchase and finance of the Vehicle, Ms. Roberson and Ford executed a Maryland Simple Interest Vehicle Retail Installment Contract (the \u201cVehicle Contract\u201d) dated on or about July 11, 2004. The Vehicle Contract contains an <em>ipso facto </em>clause as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">F. Default: You will be in default if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">4. You file a bankruptcy petition or one is filed against you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">If you do not cure a default where allowed by law, the Creditor may require you to pay at once the unpaid Amount Financed, the earned and unpaid part of the Finance Charge and all other amounts due under this contract. He may repossess (take back) the vehicle, too. He may also take goods found in the vehicle when repossessed and hold them for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">Vehicle Contract at page 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">After Ms. Roberson\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy case was closed, Ford Motor Credit repossessed the car because Ms. Roberson failed to cure the default by executing a reaffirmation agreement. Ms. Roberson, thereafter, filed a Chapter 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>bankruptcy petition, the sole basis for which was to \u201cfacilitate recovery\u201d of the car and to seek damages from Ford Motor Credit for \u201cwrongfully, illegally and maliciously\u201d repossessing the car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">On February 19, 2008, about three weeks after Ms. Roberson received her chapter 7 discharge, Ford repossessed Ms. Roberson\u2019s Vehicle on the basis that she had breached the <em>ipso facto </em>clause in the Vehicle Contract by virtue of having filed for bankruptcy protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">Two days after the repossession of the Vehicle, on February 21, 2008, Ms. Roberson filed the instant chapter 18 case. Ms. Roberson alleges that her sole motivation in filing this case is to redress her rights <em>vis a vis </em>Ford and to attempt to obtain her Vehicle from Ford based on what she asserts was a wrongful taking under Maryland law. Although Ms. Roberson initially filed an Emergency Motion for Return of Vehicle in her main bankruptcy case, she later filed an adversary complaint against Ford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">Ford argues that its repossession of Ms. Roberson\u2019s Vehicle was lawful because Ms. Roberson filed a bankruptcy petition and failed to take steps in her previous chapter 7 case to reaffirm the debt owing to Ford. Accordingly, Ford claims, under Maryland state law and the Vehicle Contract, Ford was permitted to repossess Ms. Roberson\u2019s vehicle based on the <em>ipso facto </em>clause, <em>ie., </em>based on nothing more than the fact that Ms. Roberson filed for bankruptcy protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">There appears to be no dispute that at all relevant times, Ms. Roberson was current on her payments to Ford, was current on her insurance obligations under the Vehicle Contract and had not breached her contract with Ford in any way, other than having filed a bankruptcy petition. Based on this breach alone, and based on its interpretation of Maryland law, Ford repossessed Ms. Roberson\u2019s car after the dismissal of her first bankruptcy case and before she filed her second bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">Now, in the context of her second bankruptcy case, Ms. Roberson is attempting to redress the allegedly wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>repossession of her vehicle by Ford. Ford is defending based on its interpretation of Maryland law and the <em>ipso facto </em>clause in the governing contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Ms. Roberson alleged that the repossession was in violation of the \u201cDischarge Injunction\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in her Chapter 7 case, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq. </em>(2006), the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Sections 13-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), the Maryland Consumer Debt Collection Act, Sections 14-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), was a breach of contract, and also formed the basis for trespass and conversion actions. She also filed an \u201cEmergency Motion for Return of Vehicle,\u201d as well. Ford Motor Credit returned the car to Ms. Roberson after, according to the creditor, she had provided \u201cadequate protection.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The action for damages is the crucible for the certified question. During the proceedings, Ford Motor Credit filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>motion for summary judgment, asserting that it did not violate the discharge injunction as a matter of fact or law, was not a \u201cdebt collector\u201d as that term is used in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 <em>et seq. </em>(2006) and that the Bankruptcy Court lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction over the [remaining] state law allegations.\u201d Before the Bankruptcy Court ruled on the motion for summary judgment, Ms. Roberson filed a motion seeking certification of the instant question, which the Bankruptcy Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The crux of the certified question is whether a secured creditor is permitted under Maryland law to repossess a car in which it maintains a security interest when the debtor has filed a bankruptcy petition and has failed to reaffirm the indebtedness, but has otherwise made timely payments before, during, and after bankruptcy proceedings. To address the question in order to establish its context, we review the choices available to a debtor who seeks to keep her car which is encumbered by a loan, when the debtor opts for discharge as a Chapter 7 bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">When a buyer finances the purchase of a car with funds advanced by a creditor, the creditor often retains a security interest in the car as collateral. <em>See </em>Section 12-1021 of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl. Vol.) (stating that if the \u201cconsumer borrower is in default,\u201d the \u201ccredit grantor may repossess tangible personal property securing the loan\u201d). The creditor, in turn, may also define what constitutes a default under the loan, and Ford Motor Credit defined default in the vehicle retail installment contract in the present case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">F. Default: You will be in default if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">1. You do not make any payment when it is due; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">2. You gave false or misleading information on your credit application relating to this contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">3. Your vehicle is seized by any local, state, or federal authority and is not promptly and unconditionally returned to you; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>4. You file a bankruptcy petition or one is filed against you; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">5. You do not keep any other promise in this contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">If you do not cure a default where allowed by law, the Creditor may require you to pay at once the unpaid Amount Financed, the earned and unpaid part of the Finance Charge and all other amounts due under this contract. He may repossess (take back) the vehicle, too. He may also take goods found in the vehicle when repossessed and hold them for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Once the debtor files a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, the protection of the automatic stay is triggered, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362, which \u201coperates as a stay against lawsuits and lien enforcement!.]\u201d Richard B. Levin, <em>Fundamentals of Bankruptcy Law </em>175 (7th ed. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">At this juncture, the debtor has two options: either \u201creaffirm\u201d the debt by assuming personal liability for the loan or redeem the car by paying the entire balance due on the note. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(a)(2), (a)(6) (2006). Because a debtor is not legally obligated to repay a discharged debt, a creditor whose debt is secured by collateral, such as a car, may insist that the debt be reaffirmed. 13A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00a7 CS20.11 (15th ed. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">In the present case, Ford Motor Credit tendered a reaffirmation agreement to Ms. Roberson after her Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, which, although not relevant to the question before us, would have formed the basis for a new contract between Ford Motor Credit and Ms. Roberson. The Bankruptcy Court would have also had to ratify the agreement for it to be valid. 13A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>at \u00a7 CS20.11 [2]-[3], Ms. Roberson, however, refused to execute a reaffirmation agreement, instead stating that she intended to \u201cretain\u201d the car and \u201cpay pursuant to original contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Ford Motor Credit argues that because Ms. Roberson neither reaffirmed the debt nor paid off the remainder of the loan, it was permitted to repossess the car by Section 12-1023(b) of the Credit Grantor Closed End Credit Provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>(\u201cCLEC\u201d), Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), which Ford Motor Credit elected to govern the retail installment contract, pursuant to Section 12-1013.1 of CLEC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Ms. Roberson counters that the bankruptcy clause default provision in the contract is prohibited by Maryland law, specifically Section 12-1023 of CLEC, as well as any other potential governing statutes, those being Section 12-607 of the Retail Installment Sales Act (\u201cRISA\u201d), Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 RepLVol.) and Section 12-923 of the Credit Grantor Revolving Credit Provisions (\u201cOPEC\u201d), Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The relevant statutory provisions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Section 12-1023(b) of CLEC states, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">(2) An agreement, note, or other evidence of a loan may not contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">(ii) An acceleration clause under which any part or all of the unpaid balance of the loan not yet matured may be declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>due and payable because the credit grantor deems itself insecure!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Section 12\u2014923(b) of OPEC states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">(2) An agreement governing a revolving credit plan or any instrument which evidences or secures an extension of credit under the plan may not contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">(ii) An acceleration clause under which any part or all of the unpaid balance of any extension of credit not yet matured may be declared due and payable because the credit grantor deems itself insecure!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Section 12-607(a) of RISA states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">(a) <em>Provisions prohibited.\u2014A </em>holder may not take or receive any instrument from a buyer or a surety for a buyer, which contains:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">(4) A provision for the repossession of the goods or for the acceleration of the time when any part or all of the time balance becomes payable, if the condition of the repossession or acceleration is that the holder considers himself insecure!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Sections 12-1023 of CLEC, 12-923 of OPEC, and 12-607 of RISA, all prohibit the creditor from taking certain actions if it considers itself \u201cinsecure.\u201d The term \u201cinsecure\u201d is not expressly defined in the Commercial Law Article, although a number of its provisions recognize \u201cinsecurity\u201d as a condition which gives rise to the need for a debtor or another who is expected to give assurance to the creditor or one needing assurance that performance of a contract will occur.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>example, Section 2-210 of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2002 Repl.Vol.), governing sales, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Section 2-609 of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2002 RepLVol.), also provides that, \u201cA contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other\u2019s expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.\u201d Finally, Section 2A-401 of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2002 RepLVol.), involving leases, also integrates the term \u201cinsecurity,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">(2) If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assurance of due performance. Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable, the insecure party may suspend any performance for which he (or she) has not already received the agreed return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Other Commercial Law provisions incorporating the term include Section 22-504(c) of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), which states that, \u201cA party to the original contract, other than the transferor, may treat a transfer that conveys a right or duty of performance without its consent as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and, without prejudice to the party\u2019s rights against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>transferor, may demand assurances from the transferee under \u00a7 22-708 of this title,\u201d and Section 22-708(a) of the Commercial Law Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2005 Repl.Vol.), which provides that, \u201cA contract imposes an obligation on each party not to impair the other\u2019s expectation of receiving due performance. If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the aggrieved party may .. . [d]emand in a record adequate assurance of due performance[.]\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">With this sense of what the term \u201cinsecure\u201d or \u201cinsecurity\u201d means and the breadth of its inclusion in the Commercial Law Article, we turn to the statutory sections in issue. RISA, the oldest of the three statutory schemes, was enacted by Chapter 851 of the Maryland Laws of 1941 to address abuses in retail installment contracts, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">This legislation reflects the view that \u201cimprovident and careless consumers who buy on the installment plan need legal protection\u201d (Report of Committee on Consumers Credit, Massachusetts, 1936), and that without such protection \u201cin the usual case the buyer probably is discouraged from reading the contract and might not fully understand its terms even if he did read it.\u201d This legislation aims to eliminate \u201ccontract abuses\u201d by requiring the contract to be in writing, to be delivered to the purchaser within a definite period, to contain certain information and not to contain certain provisions. Research Report No. 6. Thus, the Maryland act aims not only to prevent actual frauds <em>(Cooke v. Real Estate Trust Co., </em>180 Md. 133, 139, 22 A.2d 554), but to close avenues to fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\"><em>Stride v. Martin, </em>184 Md. 446, 451-52, 41 A.2d 489, 491-92 (1945). Section 12-607 of RISA, the specific provision, was also enacted by Chapter 851 of the Laws of 1941, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>113. <em>Provisions Forbidden in Instruments. </em>No seller, sales finance company, or holder shall at any time take or receive any instrument from a buyer, or from any surety or guarantor for the buyer, which contains:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">(d) <em>any provision for repossession of the goods or for the acceleration of the time when any part or all of the time balance becomes payable, </em>if the condition of such repossession or acceleration is in substance that the seller or holder deems himself to be insecure[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">(emphasis added). The Section was repealed and reenacted as Section 12-607 of the Commercial Law Article by Chapter 49 of the Maryland Laws of 1975, but otherwise remained substantively unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Section 12-1023 of CLEC and Section 12-923 of OPEC have more circuitous origins. As we described in <em>Biggus v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>328 Md. 188, 613 A.2d 986 (1992), CLEC and OPEC were enacted as the \u201cCredit Deregulation Act\u201d by Chapter 143 of the Laws of 1983, to entice creditors to do business in the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">Prior to the 1983 session of the General Assembly, four Maryland banks transferred certain of their operations to Delaware where the banking laws were more favorable. These included the credit card operations of two major banks based in Baltimore. Some 1,000 jobs were lost in the Baltimore area. The response by the General Assembly was Chapter 143 of the Acts of 1983, the enactment of which was urged by then Mayor Schaefer of Baltimore and others. Chapter 143 has become known as the Credit Deregulation Act of 1983.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 197, 613 A.2d at 991. Both CLEC and OPEC enable a creditor to unilaterally elect the legal framework for structuring a form contract to be offered to potential borrowers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Section 12-1028 of CLEC and Section 12-923 of OPEC were added to their respective subtitles by Chapter 404 of the Maryland Laws of 1993. Section 12-1023 of CLEC states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">(a) This section applies only to a loan made by a credit grantor under this subtitle to a consumer borrower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">(b) (1) Paragraph (2) of this subsection applies only to a loan or an extension of credit primarily for personal, household, or family purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">(2) An agreement, note, or other evidence of a loan may not contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">(ii) An acceleration clause under which any part or all of the unpaid balance of the loan not yet matured may be declared due and payable because the credit grantor deems itself insecure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">1993 Maryland Laws, Chapter 404. A nearly identical provision was added to Section 12-923 of OPEC, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">(a) This section applies only to a plan established by a credit grantor under this subtitle for a consumer borrower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">(b) (1) Paragraph (2) of this subsection applies only to a loan or an extension of credit primarily for personal, household, or family purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">(2) An agreement governing a revolving credit plan or any instrument which evidences or secures an extension of credit under the plan may not contain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">(ii) An acceleration clause under which any part or all of the unpaid balance of any extension of credit not yet matured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>may be declared due and payable because the credit grantor deems itself insecure[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">1993 Maryland Laws, Chapter 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Ms. Roberson interprets these provisions as having prohibited Ford Motor Credit from repossessing her car based solely on her Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. Ford Motor Credit counters that Section 12-1023 of CLEC prohibits only acceleration in the face of creditor insecurity, and therefore permits repossession when a debtor files bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In addressing this conundrum, our decision in <em>Biggus, </em>328 Md. at 188, 613 A.2d at 986, is informative, largely because of the Legislature\u2019s reaction to that opinion. In <em>Biggus, </em>we were asked to consider the interrelationship of RISA and CLEC. In that case, Mr. Biggus had purchased a used Ford van, entering into a \u201cMaryland Retail Installment Contract,\u201d which included the grant of a security interest in the vehicle to the creditor, and the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">G. General: Any change in this contract must be in writing and signed by you and the Creditor. The law of Maryland applies to this contract including Subtitle 10 of the Maryland Commercial Law Article. If the applicable law does not allow all of the agreements in this contract, the ones that are not allowed will be void. The rest of this contract will still be good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 191-92, 613 A.2d at 988. When he failed to make two consecutive scheduled payments, the van was repossessed and sold at a public auction. Ford then filed suit against Mr. Biggus in the District Court to collect a deficiency of $2,248.92, and Mr. Biggus responded by alleging that Ford had not complied with the repossession provisions of RISA, such that he was absolved from any deficiency liability. The District Court agreed with Mr. Biggus, but the Circuit Court reversed, holding that CLEC rather than RISA applied and entered judgment in favor of Ford Credit. We affirmed the Circuit Court, reasoning that the contract elected CLEC both \u201cby express election and also by structuring the document consistently with CLEC,\u201d such that the disclosure and storage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>of vehicle provisions of RISA were not applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 613 A.2d at 994. In so holding, we reasoned that \u201c[t]he repossession systems of RISA and CLEC are respectively complete in themselves, in the sense that each is intended to be applied independently of the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 613 A.2d at 996. We also addressed, in dicta, the question of whether CLEC was intended to apply exclusively to all aspects of a transaction for which CLEC had been elected, even if CLEC was silent on, but RISA spoke about, the issue.

That is correct as to any aspect, such as interest, disclosure, or repossession, as to which the Legislature manifested an intent that CLEC have that effect.
