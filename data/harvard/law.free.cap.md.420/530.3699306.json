Holton, Respondent, was charged with bribery, malfeasance in office, nonfeasance in office, and perjury. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City granted her motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>to dismiss those charges on the ground of legislative privilege. After that ruling was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>State v. Holton, </em>193 Md.App. 322, 997 A.2d 828 (2009), the State filed a petition for writ of certiorari in which it presented two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">I. DID THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ERR IN HOLDING THAT THE COMMON LAW PROHIBITS THE USE OF EVIDENCE OF LEGISLATIVE ACTS OF A <em>LOCAL </em>OFFICIAL IN A <em>STATE </em>CRIMINAL PROSECUTION?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">II. DID THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ERR IN HOLDING THAT \u00a7 5-501 OF THE COURTS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS ARTICLE PROVIDES LEGISLATIVE IMMUNITY TO <em>LOCAL </em>OFFICIALS IN <em>STATE </em>CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS OTHER THAN PROSECUTIONS FOR DEFAMATION?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">We granted the State\u2019s petition. 416 Md. 272, 6 A.3d 904 (2010). The first question presented, although interesting, is moot. For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cno\u201d to the second question and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The indictment at issue includes the following assertions:</p>\n<p id=\"An7\">The Grand Jurors of the State of Maryland for the City of Baltimore do on their oath present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">\n<em>FACTS COMMON TO ALL COUNTS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">8. Prior to January 2007, Helen L. Holton served as Chairperson of the Economic Development and Public Financing Subcommittee and commencing on or after January, 2007, Helen L. Holton served as the Chairperson of the Taxation and Finance Committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>9. At all times pertinent, as a member of the Baltimore City Council, Helen L. Holton was prohibited by the Baltimore City Ethics Ordinance from soliciting or accepting gifts from any person seeking to do business, in any amount with the Baltimore City Council, or engaged in activity regulated or controlled by the Baltimore City Council, or with a financial interest that might be substantially and materially affected, in a manner distinguishable from the public generally, by the performance or non-performance of her official duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">15. On or about June 12, 2006, at the regularly scheduled 3:00 p.m. meeting of the Baltimore City Council, Councilwoman Helen L. Holton, acting for the Economic Development and Public Financing Subcommittee, reported favorably to the City Council on Bill 05-0301, the proposed PILOT for Parcel B portion of the Inner Harbor East project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">22. On or about June 4, 2007, a Baltimore City Council Bill, Legislative ID number 07-0700 (hereinafter \u201cBill 07-0700\u201d) pertaining to the parcel D portion of the Inner Harbor East project was introduced to the Baltimore City Council and assigned to the Taxation and Finance Committee chaired by Councilwoman Helen L. Holton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">28. On or about July 19, 2007, the Taxation and Finance Committee of the Baltimore City Council held a public hearing on Bill 07-0700. Of the five members of the Committee, Chairperson Helen L. Holton and two other committee members voted to report favorably on the Bill, with amendments. One member as absent and the fifth member abstained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>34. On or about August 13,2007, Helen L.

On or about September 24, 2007, the City Council approved Bill 07-0700, authorizing tax relief benefits in the form of a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) for Parcel D of Inner Harbor East, with Councilwoman Helen L. Holton casting her vote in favor of the Bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">38. In her Financial Disclosure Statement, Helen L. Holton was asked whether she had received any significant gifts, directly or indirectly, from any person that does business with the City or is regulated or lobbies before the City during calendar year 2007. Helen L. Holton answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question and attached Schedule 4 which required a description of all gifts. In response to the question on Schedule 4 about the nature of the gifts, Helen L. Holton responded: \u201cevents for which all council members were invited.\u201d No other gifts were disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>COUNT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqN\">\n<em>BRIBERY</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">(Criminal Law Article, Section 9-201)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">39.

The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 38 are re-alleged and incorporated herein as if set forth in full.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment at issue was accompanied by a MEMORANDUM in which it (1) rejected the State\u2019s argument that the doctrine of legislative immunity has no application whatsoever to a <em>criminal </em>prosecution of a member of the Baltimore City Council, (2) found \u201cthat prohibited legislative material was used and relied on in bringing [the charges against Respondent],\u201d and (3) explained why dismissal of the indictment was required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-11\">These legislative acts are realleged in each of the four counts of the indictment. They form the factual predicate for the charge in Count I that the payment by Doracon Contracting Inc. of $12,500.00 for the survey constituted the receipt of a bribe[ ]; in Count II, that the alleged solicita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tion and acceptance of that same money constituted a gift and malfeasance in office[ ]; in Count III, that the failure to list the receipt of the $12,500.00 gift on Ms. Holton\u2019s 2007 Financial Disclosure Form constituted perjury[ ]; and in Count IV, that this failure also constituted nonfeasance in office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">The State makes no fail-back or alternative argument that its conduct of the prosecution could be shown to have complied with the State and federal law cited above. For example, cases have indicated that the State may, without violating the privilege, rely on some acts \u201ccasually or incidentally related to legislative affairs but not part of the legislative process itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>408 U.S. 501, 528, 92 S.Ct. 2531, 33 L.Ed.2d 507 (1972). This doctrine provides prosecutors with some leeway to make incidental references to legislative matters without impairing the privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">The Court reads the failure of the State Prosecutor to make such a showing or proffer, despite being provided several opportunities to do so, including at oral argument on the motion on April 23rd, as a functional concession and admission that, on the current record, it cannot show compliance with the requirements to screen the grand jury from prohibited and prejudicial legislative related evidence in [Respondent\u2019s case].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The opinion of the Court of Special Appeals included the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">A fair reading of [CJ] \u00a7 5-501 intimates a legislative imperative that local legislators enjoy the same protection as the protection that State legislators have against being forced to defend or explain their legislative conduct. Section 5-501 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">Action for defamation against local government official. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>A civil or criminal action may not be brought against a city or town councilman, county commissioner, county councilman, or similar official by whatever name known, for words spoken at a meeting of the council or board of commissioners or at a meeting of a committee or subcommittee thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We do not share the parties\u2019 view that the statute is limited to defamation actions against local legislators. Such a view improperly elevates the effect of a mere caption and ignores the plain language of the statute itself as well as its legislative history. The statute was initially enacted by 1973 Md. Laws, ch. 287 for the purpose, according to its title, of providing that \u201ccertain officials shall not be liable in <em>any </em>civil action or <em>criminal prosecution </em>for words spoken in debate.\u201d (Emphasis added). Intending to cover all local legislators it added, in nearly identical language, to each of the Code articles dealing with municipal and county legislative bodies (Articles 23A, 25, 25A and 25B) that no such local legislator\u2014town councilman, county commissioner, county councilman, code county commissioner or in debate at [a meeting of the applicable legislative body].\u201d The meaning and effect of that statute could not be clearer. That language was lifted directly from Article III, Section 18 of the Maryland Constitution and must be construed as having the same effect\u2014to provide the same level and scope of protection to the local legislators as is enjoyed by members of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">A few months after the enactment of that statute, the General Assembly returned for a special summer session in order to begin implementation of the code revision process\u2014the non-substantive re-writing of the 1957 Code in a more topical and coherent manner. One of the volumes produced at that special session was the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which was intended as a generally non-substantive collection and revision of the laws relating to judicial proceedings. <em>See </em>1973 Md. Laws (1st Sp.Sess.) Ch. 2, \u00a7 1. In furtherance of that purpose and intent, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>sections added to Articles 23A, 25, 25A and 25B just months earlier were consolidated and re-styled as Section 5-304 of the new Article. The new section read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">A civil or criminal action may not be brought against a city or town councilman, county commissioner, county councilman, or similar official by whatever name known, for words spoken at a meeting of the council or board of commissioners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">That no substantive change was intended by the rewording of the language is evident from the Revisor\u2019s Note that immediately followed the section: \u201cThis section is new language derived from Art. 23A, \u00a7 1A, Art. 25, \u00a7 1A, Art. 25A, \u00a7 3, and Art. 25 B, \u00a7 10A....\u201d -45-In 1976, the statute was expanded to provide protection not only for legislative conduct at meetings of the council or board itself but also subcommittee meetings. <em>See </em>1976 Md. Laws, Ch. 355. In 1977, the section was moved to its present location, Section 5-501, without any substantive change.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Unfortunately, the advisory body tasked with drafting the new Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article added as a caption to the section \u201cAction for defamation against local government official\u201d and that caption has remained with the section. The parties have seized upon that caption as limiting the scope of the statute itself, which we find to be inappropriate and inadmissible. In determining the meaning of a statute, we look to the words of the statute itself, not a caption. <em>W. Corr. Inst. v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 141[, 807 A.2d 32, 41] (2002).... Captions and headings are mere catchwords and can never be taken to limit or expand the plain meaning of the statutory language. The Legislature itself has made that clear. Article 1, Section 18 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">The captions or headlines of the several sections of this Code which are printed in bold type, and the captions or headlines of the several subsections of this Code which are printed in italics or otherwise, are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the sections and subsections. They are not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>deemed or taken as titles of the sections and subsections, or as any part thereof; and, unless expressly so provided, they shall not be so deemed or taken when any of such sections and subsections, including the captions or headlines, are amended or reenacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">[W]e conclude that the privilege or immunity enjoyed by local legislators should be extended to criminal proceedings, as a matter of common law and C.J.P. \u00a7 5-501. Local legislators constitute the most direct form of representative democracy. They are the closest to the People and they often set the policies that most directly affect the health, safety and quality of life of the people residing in their communities. They must enjoy the same ability to speak and act in their legislative capacities, without fear of retribution, either criminally or civilly, because of what they say or how they vote. They may be called upon to answer for their legislative conduct to the citizens who elected them, which is what democracy is all about, but they may not be compelled to defend their legislative conduct to a prosecutor, to a grand jury or to a court. The record in this case shows that that is precisely what Ms. Holton was asked to do, and the circuit court was correct in not permitting it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>State v. Holton, </em>193 Md.App. at 362-70, 997 A.2d at 852-56. (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We agree with the above quoted analysis of the Court of Special Appeals. Whether local legislators enjoyed a common law \u201cspeech and debate\u201d immunity from <em>criminal </em>prosecutions is presently a moot question because the General Assembly has, by statute, provided that immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The following rules of statutory interpretation are applicable to the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Ordinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay2\">In fact, all statutory interpretation begins, and usually ends, with the statutory text itself, <em>Marriott Employees [Federal Credit Union </em>] <em>v. MVA, </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997), for the legislative intent of a statute primarily reveals itself through the statute\u2019s very words. <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 335, 748 A.2d 478, 483 (2000). A court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">Where the statutory language is free from [any] ambiguity, courts will neither look beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent nor add to or delete words from the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\"><em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJv\">If the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinary ends and we need investigate no further, but simply apply the statute as it reads. [ ] We interpret statutes to give every word effect, avoiding constructions that render any portion of the language superfluous or redundant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-8\"><em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426, 427 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Having applied those rules to CJ \u00a7 5-501, we conclude that the General Assembly meant what it said when it provided that a \u201ccriminal action may not be brought against a [member of the Baltimore City Council] for words spoken at a meeting of the council ... or at a meeting of a committee or subcommittee thereof.\u201d Because any other interpretation of CJ \u00a7 5-501 would violate the well established rule that a statute should be interpreted in a way that does not render nugatory or superfluous any word, clause, sentence, or phrase included therein, the case at bar is not one in which we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cgo hunting the ghost of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Franklin Square Hospital v. Laubach, </em>318 Md. 615, 619, 569 A.2d 693, 695 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Moreover, the legislative history actually confirms our conclusion that the doctrine of local official legislative immunity is applicable to a criminal prosecution. The \u201cpurpose\u201d clauses of the applicable bills make it clear that the General Assembly intended to provide local legislators with immunity from both civil and criminal actions based upon words spoken in their legislative capacities. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, the General Assembly had several opportunities to\u2014 but never did\u2014remove the immunity provisions set forth in CJ \u00a7 5-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Ordinarily, because there is no limitation on the character of evidence that may be presented to a grand jury, a defendant is not entitled to the dismissal of an indictment founded on evidence that is inadmissible at trial. As this Court stated in <em>State v. Bailey, </em>289 Md. 143, 422 A.2d 1021 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">In passing upon the validity of a motion to dismiss an indictment, the appellate courts of this State have been steadfast in holding that: (1) the motion is not a proper vehicle for testing the admissibility of testimonial evidence at trial, <em>Richardson v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 334, 255 A.2d 463 (1969); (2) an unlawful arrest is not a ground for quashing an indictment, <em>Matthews v. State, </em>237 Md. 384, 206 A.2d 714 (1965); (3) a defendant is not entitled to dismissal simply because the prosecution acquired incriminating evidence in violation of law, even if tainted evidence was presented to the grand jury, <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, 337 A.2d 100 (1975); (4) an indictment should be dismissed where it has been returned by grand jurors who had been required to show a belief in God, <em>State v. Madison, </em>240 Md. 265, 213 A.2d 880 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 149-150, 422 A.2d at 1025. (Footnotes omitted). In <em>Everhart, supra, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Although in <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 292 A.2d 86 (1972), aff'g <em>State v. Siegel, </em>13 Md.App. 444, 285 A.2d 671 (1971), this Court sustained the dismissal of an indictment because of an invalid order authorizing an electronic surveillance, it seems clear under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court that \u201ca defendant is not entitled to have his indictment dismissed before trial simply because the government \u2018acquire[d] incriminating evidence in violation of the [law],\u2019 even if the \u2018tainted evidence was presented to the grand jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U.S. 41, 60, 92 S.Ct. 2357, 33 L.Ed.2d 179 (1972), citing <em>United States v. Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 255, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966). <em>See also Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958); <em>Costello v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">274 Md. at 486-487, 337 A.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The case at bar presents a rare exception to the general rule that suppression of inadmissible evidence, rather than dismissal of the indictment, is the appropriate relief. Although CJ \u00a7 5-501 does not provide Respondent with complete immunity from prosecution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the protection provided by that statute is not limited to the exclusion of evidence of \u201cwords spoken\u201d by the defendant at a meeting or subcommittee meeting of the elected body on which the defendant is or was serving. CJ \u00a7 5-501 provides that \u201c[a] ... criminal action may not be <em>brought against </em>[Respondent] for words spoken at a meeting of the Council or ... at a meeting of a committee or subcommittee thereof.\u201d The indictment at issue in the case at bar, which is permeated with assertions that Respondent engaged in conduct for which she does have immunity, is a criminal action that has been brought in violation of CJ \u00a7 5-501. The remedy for that violation is dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">HARRELL and ADKINS, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">.

Holton (\u201cHolton\u201d or \u201cRespondent\u201d) accepted the in-kind value of a campaign poll, valued at $12,500, in exchange for her favorable votes benefitting the actual payor\u2019s interest in two Baltimore City Council (\u201cthe Council\u201d) real property development bills. The evidence presented to the grand jury included evidence of Holton\u2019s votes related to the bills. The questions presented for our consideration involve whether legislative immunity extends to local legislators, either through interpretation of the Maryland Constitution\u2019s version of the Speech and Debate Clause, Md. Const. Art. Ill, \u00a7 18,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings (\u201cC.J.\u201d) Article, \u00a7 5-501.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In my view, the Majority Opinion concludes properly that \u00a7 5-501 applies to disallow the use in criminal prosecutions of evidence of legislative acts against local legislators. After laying out in some detail why dismissal of an indictment is not a favored remedy, however, the Majority Opinion concludes (unjustifiably) that \u201c[t]he case at bar presents a rare exception to the general rule that suppression of inadmissible evidence, rather than dismissal of the indictment, is the appropriate relief.\u201d 420 Md. 530, 24 A.3d 678 (2011) (Majority op. at 543, 24 A.3d at 685). As the Majority Opinion points out, this Court long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>has recognized that dismissal of an indictment is disfavored. Dismissal of an indictment is appropriate only in the most extreme of circumstances, as the potential for harm outweighs greatly the benefits. Because, in my view, this case is not such an extreme circumstance, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The U.S. Supreme Court long has held that the bar for handing down a valid indictment under the Fifth Amendment is not set very high. <em>See Costello v.

The Fifth Amendment requires nothing more.\u201d) (footnote omitted). The facial validity <em>vel non </em>of an indictment hinges only on the composition of the grand jury, and if that is found valid, courts will not inquire generally beyond the four corners of the indictment. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>995 F.2d 480, 487 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201cThe longstanding rule of law that courts may not \u2018look behind\u2019 grand jury indictments if \u2018returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury[ ]\u2019 is the touchstone for any inquiry into the legality of indictments.\u201d) (quoting <em>Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 363, 76 S.Ct. at 409, 100 L.Ed. at 402-403). Accordingly, the validity of an indictment does not hinge upon whether the facts advanced there are sufficient. <em>See State v.

United States, </em>218 U.S. 245, 31 S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910), testimony held ultimately to be inadmissible was offered by the Government to the grand jury. Despite the fact that \u201cthere was very little evidence against the accused,\u201d other than the inadmissible testimony, the Supreme Court held that dismissal of the indictment was not the proper disposition. <em>Holt, </em>218 U.S. at 247, 31 S.Ct. at 4, 54 L.Ed. at 1028. The Court \u201crefused to hold that such an indictment should be quashed, pointing out that \u2018[t]he abuses of criminal practice would be enhanced if indictments could be upset on such a ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 363, 76 S.Ct. at 408, 100 L.Ed. at 402 (quoting <em>Holt, </em>218 U.S. at 248, 31 S.Ct. at 4, 54 L.Ed. at 1028). The proposition that an indictment, otherwise valid on its face, is dismissed rarely on an evidentiary technicality is, therefore, long-settled. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Blue, </em>384 U.S. 251, 255, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 1419, 16 L.Ed.2d 510, 514 (1966) (holding that evidence presented to the grand jury and obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s Self-Incrimination right is cause for suppression of the evidence, but not dismissal of the indictment); <em>Lawn v.

As the Majority Opinion recognizes, quoting <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, 486-87, 337 A.2d 100, 116 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">Although in <em>State v.

This alignment with the views of the Supreme Court is recognized as far back as <em>Pick v. State, </em>143 Md. 192, 121 A. 918 (1923). In <em>Pick, </em>Bessie Pick was charged with \u201clarceny of certain sums of money and with receiving stolen goods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pick argued that, having been subpoenaed to testify in front of the grand jury, she testified against herself and her co-defendant without being informed that her testimony would be used against her. <em>Pick, </em>143 Md. at 194, 121 A. at 919. The indictment, she argued, \u201cwas directly found upon said testimony so given ... under compulsory process and under the other circumstances and conditions aforesaid, and that said indictment and the proceedings upon which it was found were in violation of the Declaration of Rights and the Constitution and Laws of the State of Maryland.\u201d <em>Pick, </em>143 Md. at 195, 121 A. at 919. This Court, citing <em>Holt </em>with approval, held that incompetent testimony of the type presented there before a grand jury was not enough to quash the indictment. <em>See Pick, </em>143 Md. at 196, 121 A. at 919 (\u201cThe law is well settled, that the competency of testimony before the grand jury will not be inquired into by the courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">More recently, in <em>Everhart, </em>274 Md. at 486, 337 A.2d at 116, although there was no motion to dismiss the indictment filed in the trial court, this Court \u201cincluded, within the scope of our writ of certiorari, [a] question ... whether the petitioner was indicted and arrested on the basis of a search and seizure warrant without probable cause.\u201d Everhart filed a motion to suppress the property seized during a search which he claimed was beyond the boundaries of the warrant. <em>Everhart, </em>274 Md. at 463, 337 A.2d at 103. This Court, addressing whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>motion to dismiss the indictment would have been a proper motion and remedy, explained that, \u201ceven the submission unto the grand jury of evidence obtained in violation of [the petitioner\u2019s] constitutional rights would not impair the validity of his indictment____\u201d <em>Everhart, </em>274 Md. at 487-88, 337 A.2d at 116. The Court concluded that, \u201c[a]s we see it, the only proper manner in which to present the issue raised by the petitioner was\u2014as he did\u2014through a motion to suppress----\u201d <em>Everhart, </em>274 Md. at 488, 337 A.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The general rule in Maryland, therefore, is that dismissal of an indictment is improper where the indictment is supported by inadmissible evidence. <em>See Bailey, </em>289 Md. at 149, 422 A.2d at 1025 (noting that a motion to dismiss an indictment \u201cis not a proper vehicle for testing the admissibility of ... evidence at trial\u201d); <em>see also Bartram v. State, </em>280 Md. 616, 374 A.2d 1144 (1977) (discussing the lengthy history of disfavoring dismissal of indictments on evidentiary grounds under Maryland Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The disfavoring of dismissals of indictments is supported by sound policy. In <em>Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 363, 76 S.Ct. at 408-09, 100 L.Ed. at 402, the Supreme Court, although asked to formulate a rule instructing federal courts that an indictment based solely upon hearsay is invalid, explained that \u201c[t]he result of such a rule would be that before trial on the merits a defendant could always insist on a kind of preliminary trial to determine the competency and adequacy of the evidence before the grand jury.\u201d The ability to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the grand jury would create effectively the possibility of mini-trials to test the strength of the State\u2019s evidence. In my view, there is no convincing reason why \u00a7 5-501 should allow such a preliminary evidentiary disposition as the Majority dispenses here.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">The potentiality of these \u201cpreliminary trials\u201d would impair judicial efficiency. <em>See Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 363, 76 S.Ct. at 408, 100 L.Ed. at 402 (\u201cIf indictments were to be held open to challenge on the ground that there was inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury, the resulting delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>would be great indeed.\u201d). Defendants could protract the trial process by first challenging the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the grand jury and/or evidentiary references in the indictment, and if unsuccessful, follow that with a traditional motion to suppress evidence or perhaps a later motion in limine to exclude evidence. In effect, sanctioning the dismissal of the indictment here may disrupt the orderly administration of justice by encouraging proliferation of yet another form of pre-trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In addition, the purpose behind the use of a grand jury would be eroded if a party were allowed to challenge indictments more freely based on the sufficiency of the evidence. The grand jury serves the \u201c \u2018dual function of determining if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and of protecting citizens against unfounded criminal prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sells Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>463 U.S. 418, 423, 103 S.Ct. 3133, 3137, 77 L.Ed.2d 743, 752 (1983) (quoting <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 686-687, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2659, 33 L.Ed.2d 626, 644 (1972)) (footnote omitted). In order to perform these important functions, the grand jury, therefore, is not constricted by the formal rules of evidence. <em>See United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 617, 38 L.Ed.2d 561, 568-69 (1974) (\u201cThe grand juryf\u2019s] ... operation generally is unrestrained by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing the conduct of criminal trials.\u201d). If the grand jury is limited in its ability to investigate, free from the limitations of evidentiary rules (like C.J. \u00a7 5-501), its operation and function would be diminished without, in my view, a sufficient counter-balancing benefit or detriment on the other side of the ledger. <em>See Sells Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>463 U.S. at 424, 103 S.Ct. at 3138, 77 L.Ed.2d at 752 (\u201cThese broad powers are necessary to permit the grand jury to carry out both parts of its dual function. Without thorough and effective investigation, the grand jury would be unable either to ferret out crimes deserving of prosecution, or to screen out charges not warranting prosecution.\u201d). It is for this reason that the Supreme Court held that establishing a rule that permits defendants to challenge indictments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>grounds that the indictments are not supported by adequate or competent evidence,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules. Neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires such a change. In a trial on the merits, defendants are entitled to a strict observance of all the rules designed to bring about a fair verdict. Defendants are not entitled, however, to a rule which would result in interminable delay but add nothing to the assurance of a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACy\"><em>Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 364, 76 S.Ct. at 409, 100 L.Ed. at 403. Allowing dismissal of the indictment on the ground that it contains on its face recitation of, or reference to, privileged legislative activities opens the door to the diminished significance of grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In a backhanded way, the Majority Opinion makes the case that dismissal of the indictment in the present case is not the proper disposition. It states: \u201cOrdinarily, because there is no limitation on the character of evidence that may be presented to a grand jury, a defendant is not entitled to the dismissal of an indictment founded on evidence that is inadmissible at trial.\u201d 420 Md. 530, 24 A.3d 678 (2011) (Majority op. at 542, 24 A.3d at 685). The Majority then states abruptly, \u201c[a]l-though CJ \u00a7 5-501 does not provide Respondent with complete immunity from prosecution, the protection provided by that statute is not limited to the exclusion of evidence of \u2018words spoken\u2019 by the defendant at meeting or subcommittee meeting of the elected body on which the defendant is or was serving.\u201d 420 Md. 530, 24 A.3d 678 (2011) (Majority op. at 543, 24 A.3d at 685) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">As support for this assertion, the Majority cites <em>State v. Panagoulis, </em>253 Md. 699, 253 A.2d 877 (1969), which addressed whether a defendant was immune from prosecution because his compelled testimony was offered to the grand jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Panagoulis, then chief of police for Prince George\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>County, \u201cmoved to dismiss the indictments on the ground that, having testified before the grand jury ... without formally waiving his privilege against self-incrimination, he had acquired an immunity from prosecution under Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 39.\u201d <em>Panagoulis, </em>253 Md. at 701, 253 A.2d at 878. The issue, then, was whether Panagoulis\u2019s later testimony, given the nature of his earlier statements to the grand jury, was voluntary, therefore waiving his explicit, statutorily-granted immunity from prosecution. <em>Panagoulis, </em>253 Md. at 707, 253 A.2d at 882. The Court held that he was compelled, and therefore \u201c[ujnder the facts of this case we cannot say that Panagoulis\u2019 conduct mounted up to a waiver of the immunity conferred by statute.\u201d <em>Panagoulis, </em>253 Md. at 710, 253 A.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The present case is distinguished easily from <em>Panagoulis. </em>Holton is not claiming that she is immune from prosecution on the bribery charges;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the issue, rather, is the recitation of, or reference to, legislative acts in the indictment. The Majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Panagoulis </em>conflates an evidentiary privilege and immunity from prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even this conflation, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>er, does not explain substantively why the Majority concludes that this case is a \u201crare exception\u201d to the general rule. It, therefore, runs the very real risk of opening an ill-defined loophole allowing for the dismissal of indictments on evidentiary grounds. Without making the case for the exceptionality of the circumstances, the Majority Opinion opens the doors to the potentiality of motions to dismiss based upon issues that are handled ably later in the course of proceedings by motions to suppress or motions in limine. <em>See Bailey, </em>289 Md. at 149, 422 A.2d at 1025 (\u201c[A] defendant is not entitled to dismissal [of the indictment] simply because the prosecution acquired incriminating evidence in violation of the law, even if tainted evidence was presented to the grand jury....\u201d); <em>Hayward v. State, </em>278 Md. 654, 658, 366 A.2d 52, 55 (1976) (\u201c[T]he proper sanction to be invoked where evidence has been seized in violation of [constitutional] rights is the application of the exclusionary rule, not the dismissal of the indictment.\u201d). Rather than dismiss the indictment, the proper remedy is ruling later on the admissibility of the legislative activities evidence. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">While the general common-law practice is to admit evidence despite its illegal origins, this Court in a number of areas has recognized or developed exclusionary rules where evidence has been gained in violation of the accused\u2019s rights under the Constitution, federal statutes, or federal rules of procedure. <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383[, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914) ]; <em>Rogers v. Richmond, </em>365 U.S. 534[, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961) ]; <em>Mapp v.

In my view, the present case is no exception. Respondent challenges that the \u201cinfection\u201d of the indictment by the tainted evidence is so extensive that excision of the barred evidence is not possible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the prosecution cannot prove its case without the use of the legislative materials, then the fact that this particular case may be so hobbled by a lack of other non-legislative evidence is not grounds to declare arbitrarily the case a \u201cspecial exception,\u201d establish precedent for evidentiary mini-trials, facilitate potential delay in the administration of justice, erode the purpose of the grand jury, and invite exploitation of an ill-defined loophole.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In <em>Bailey, </em>289 Md. at 150, 422 A.2d at 1025, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">[A] motion to dismiss the indictment will properly lie where there is some substantial defect on the face of the indictment, or in the indictment procedure, or where there is some specific statutory requirement pertaining to the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ment procedure which has not been followed. In the absence of statutory authority to the contrary, where the object of appellate review of a dismissal is to test a pre-trial ruling of the court dealing with the admissibility of evidence, appellate review of such pretrial ruling should be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV9\">Because I would hold that there is no \u201csubstantial defect on the face of the indictment, or in the indictment procedure,\u201d finding that there is no \u201cspecific statutory requirement pertaining to the indictment procedure which has not been followed,\u201d I would conclude that the dismissal of the State\u2019s indictment against Holton is not the proper disposition of the present case. Accordingly, I dissent as to the remedy sanctioned by the Majority Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Judge ADKINS authorizes me to state that she joins in the views expressed in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">. Md. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 18 provides, in pertinent part, \u201d[n]o Senator or Delegate shall be liable in any civil action, or criminal prosecution, whatever, for words spoken in debate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">. Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-501 provides: \"A civil or criminal action may not be brought against a city or town councilman, county commissioner, county councilman, or similar official by whatever name known, for words spoken at a meeting of the council or board of commissioners or at a meeting of a committee or subcommittee thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\">. The statutes at issue in <em>Panagoulis, </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27 \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 39, are now consolidated and renumbered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>as Md.Code (2002), Criminal Law Art., \u00a7 9-204. It provides, in pertinent part, \"[a] person compelled to testify for the State under this section is immune from prosecution for a crime about which the person was compelled to testify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. Respondent argues aptly, and I agree that, \u201d[i]n addressing immunity that is extended to local legislators, Petitioner often equates legislative immunity with immunity from prosecution. Respondent has never argued that she is immune from prosecution. The issue is, and has always been, whether the State may use evidence of her legislative acts in prosecuting her for an alleged offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\">. The Majority opinion highlights that part of C.J. \u00a7 5-501 which states that a \"criminal action may not be <em>brought against </em>[Holton] for words spoken at a meeting of the Council,\u201d reasoning that \"[t]he indictment at issue in the case at bar ... is a criminal action that has been brought in violation of CJ \u00a7 5-501,\u201d and, therefore, \"the remedy for that violation is dismissal of the indictment.\u201d 420 Md. 530, 24 A.3d 678 (2011) (Majority op. at 543, 24 A.3d at 685). The present case, however, was not \"brought against\u201d Holton for \"words spoken at a meeting of the Council,\" rather, the case was \"brought against\u201d Holton for bribery, malfeasance in office, perjury, and nonfeasance in office\u2014charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>supported by <em>evidence </em>of her \"words spoken at a meeting of the Council.\u201d This is not a distinction without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The bribery counts aside, Counts III and IV of the indictment relate to Holton's failure to list a gift from a contractor on a financial disclosure form, and, therefore, were unrelated to any \"words spoken at a meeting of the Council,\u201d within the contemplation of CJ \u00a7 5-501. Accordingly, even if one subscribes to the Majority's analysis vis \u00e1 vis CJ \u00a7 5-501, Counts III and IV of the indictment do not implicate CJ \u00a7 5-501 and, thus, should not have been dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">. To support this argument. Respondent relies on <em>United States v. Helstoski, </em>635 F.2d 200 (3d Cir.1980). Cases deeming dismissal to be the appropriate remedy are all federal appellate courts applying the federal Speech or Debate Clause. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Rostenkowski, </em>59 F.3d 1291 (D.C.Cir.1995) <em>opinion supplemented on denial of reh\u2019g, </em>68 F.3d 489 (D.C.Cir.1995); <em>United States v.

The present case is not decided under the federal Speech or Debate Clause, nor even the Maryland Constitution's version of the Speech or Debate Clause. This case is determined by C.J. \u00a7 5-501, which is a limitation on the use of \"words spoken at a meeting of the council or board of commissioners or at a meeting of a committee or subcommittee thereof.\u201d It is not decided upon <em>constitutional </em>immunity to legislators, but rather on <em>statutory </em>limitations on the use of evidence. In that regard, it is a State law governing State criminal procedure, just as any other evidentiary privilege granted by statute. It should be treated as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
