The State\u2019s evidence, which included the testimony of the alleged victim (Petitioner\u2019s niece, Brittany B, \u201cBrittany\u201d), was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses during the first four months of 2008. That evidence, however, included a written report made to Detective Mike Carin of the Montgomery County Police Department by Stephen C. Boos, M.D., who did not testify at trial. The Circuit Court overruled Petitioner\u2019s objection to the introduction of that report. After that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ruling was affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unreported opinion, Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, in which he presented a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">Did the trial court err in admitting the report prepared by Dr. Stephen Boos, who was not present at trial, and in allowing Dr. Evelyn Shukat to testify as to it contents, when such report had not been made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We granted the petition. 416 Md. 272, 6 A.3d 904 (2010). For the reasons that follow, we hold that Dr. Boos\u2019 report to Detective Carin should have been excluded on the ground that it was prepared in anticipation of litigation, and was not admissible under either the \u201cbusiness records\u201d exception or the \u201cstatements in contemplation of treatment\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay. We also hold that the erroneous decision to admit the report into evidence was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">On April 28, 2008, Brittany told her mother that she had been abused by Petitioner, and her mother took Brittany to Holy Cross Hospital. The records of that hospital, which are admissible under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(6), show that the \u201cfollow up instructions\u201d that were given to Brittany include: \u201cShady Grove Hospital as directed by police for your forensic exam and interview.\u201d The investigating officers, however, referred Brittany to The Tree House Child Assessment Center of Montgomery County (Tree House).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">On April 28, 2008, Dr. Boos was the Medical Director of the Tree House. The State\u2019s case-in-chief included (1) a \u201credacted\u201d version of Dr. Boos\u2019 report to Detective Carin, and (2) expert testimony based on that report, presented by Dr. Elizabeth Shukat, who was the Tree House\u2019s Medical Director at the time of Petitioner\u2019s trial. The first page of the report was prepared on paper with the following letterhead:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\n<em>The Tree House</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV7\">Montgomery County Child Assessment Center 7300 Calhoun PI, Suite 604 Rockville, MD 20855</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">(Telephone &amp; Fax numbers appear on original)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The report included the following assertions:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Monday, April 28, 2008</p>\n<p id=\"AJA\">To: Detective Mike Carin Thomas Earl</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">From: Stephen C.

She presented here on April 28, 2008, accompanied by her mother, Doris B[ ]. She was referred for a medical history recommendation[ ] pursuant concerns of child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">Past medical history:</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">On a review of systems the child reported stomachaches since last week. She feels this as a very brief rumbling pain in her supra umbilical area in the afternoon. As noted, the pain is brief and it occurs less than every day. For genital symptoms, Brittany reported burning urination sometimes. She spontaneously commented \u201cit started when Uncle [ ] do that.\u201d I asked her how long it lasts after [ ] \u201cdo that,\u201d and she said for a few days. She has no history of constipation, no history of past genital injury, and no medical attention for genital or anal complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">History from Brittany B[ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b588-16\">I spoke with Brittany about the things she likes to do in her school environment to become more familiar with her. I reminded her that I was a doctor and we needed to talk about doctor things. I told her that doctors have two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>problems when they talk to patients. First, sometimes kids want to give an answer when an adult asks a question, and they may not know the answer or not understand the question. I told her that I needed her to tell me if she didn\u2019t understand the question and ask me to rephrase it. I also told her that if she didn\u2019t know the answer she should tell me that rather than guessing, because that would not help me take care of her. I then continued that doctors talked about very private things and sometimes kids want to keep a secret. I encouraged her either to tell me the truth, or if she just could not reveal something, to tell me that it was secret, but never to lie to me because if I made a decision based on the lie, I might not take proper care of her. I then asked her to agree to not lie, not guess and not keep secrets. She agreed to these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">I then asked Brittany if she knew why she needed to see a doctor today. She replied, \u201cno, not really.\u201d I then asked her if anything different happened to her than happens to other kids so that she might need some special doctor\u2019s care. She nodded, indicating yes. I asked her to tell me about it. She responded \u201cI was sexually assaulted.\u201d I told her that I needed to know exactly how that happened. She replied \u201cmy grandma and my mother and my aunt go out, and [ ] tell me to come in his room, and [ ] make me suck his private part.\u201d [ ] I told her that she also referred to \u201che\u201d or \u201chis\u201d and I needed to know who \u201che\u201d or \u201chis\u201d was. She answered \u201cUncle Wayne.\u201d [ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">[ ] I asked her if something [ ] ever happened to her body. She answered \u201cmy Uncle Wayne licked my private part.\u201d I pointed out that previously she had said that she had to suck \u201chis\u201d private part. I wanted to know what private part she was referred to. She responded \u201c[ ] Uncle Wayne.\u201d When I asked her if it was every somebody else, she replied \u201cno.\u201d I asked her if any other things happened to her body that she didn\u2019t like or thought were bad and she replied \u201cno.\u201d I asked if there was any other kind of touching that she didn\u2019t like, and she again asserted \u201cno.\u201d I pointed out that before she had said that it burned her to pee after what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>happened to her. She immediately responded \u201cwhen I use the bathroom, [ ]. I asked her what made it so that it hurt when she peed. She replied \u201cbecause it\u2019s in my area.\u201d I pointed out that I didn\u2019t understand this, and she explained \u201cbecause when he licked my private part, he pressed down too hard.\u201d I asked her if any other private parts touched on her private part, and she replied \u201cno. I then asked her how about things happening with hands. She answered \u201cno,\u201d so I asked her \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any rubbing or touching\u201d and she correct herself, just answering \u201crubbing.\u201d I then asked her, tell me about rubbing. She answered \u201che would take his hand or his finger and stick it down my pants.\u201d I asked her what he did there and she replied \u201che would rub, on me, my private area.\u201d I asked her who she was referring to this time, and she said \u201cUncle Wayne.\u201d She also told that this made it burn when she urinated.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">I returned to the question about sucking on private parts. [ ] I[ ] asked her about Uncle Wayne, and if anything from him got on her. She shook her head no. I added or in your mouth, and she nodded her head, indicating yes. I reaffirmed \u201cso you had to suck his private too,\u201d and she reasserted this, saying yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">I next asked Brittany if she thought about things like this sometimes. She said that she did and it \u201cpops in my mind,\u201d when we\u2019re talking about stuff. She added \u201csometimes I think I should tell my mom, sometimes I think she won\u2019t believe me.\u201d I asked Brittany if her Uncle Wayne [] wanted her to tell, and she stated \u201cno.\u201d I asked her how she knew this, and she replied \u201cthey would say if I told bad things would happen to me.\u201d I asked her if [ ] said this, and she said [\u201cjUncle Wayne.[\u201d]</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">I next asked Brittany why she told her mom\u2019s friend. She answered \u201cI needed someone to talk to; I wanted to share my feelings.\u201d I asked her to tell me more about that and she said \u201cI felt that I should talk to somebody before I told my mom.\u201d When I asked her why, she said \u201cso I could get my story straight, so she would understand it.\u201d Because of this utterance I asked her whether or not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>things she had been saying were all true. She asserted that they were, saying \u201cyes.\u201d I asked her if anything was exaggerated beyond what had really happened, and she shook her head and said \u201cno.\u201d I then asked her how she felt now that she had told. She replied \u201chealthy, good.\u201d And she smiled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">I asked Brittany if she is having any problems with her body now. She denied that she was. She said that sometimes it hurts in her private, like a little pinch every once in a while. She denied any discharge or any bleeding. She also said it no longer hurt to void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The following transpired when Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel moved <em>in limine </em>that the State be prohibited from introducing Dr. Boos\u2019 report into evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: The State wants to offer this document from\u2014that\u2019s been generated by the Tree House and signed by Dr. Boos\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]:\u2014in this matter. It\u2019s obviously a hearsay document. I believe that the State is going to rely upon this being under the exception for medical treatment purposes. I am suggesting to the Court, most respectfully, that it does not fit within that rubric. Prior to going\u2014being taken by the police\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. I don\u2019t think that this is a statement made by Brittany for the purposed [sic] of treatment to Dr. Boos. One of the reasons that I would suggest to the Court that this wasn\u2019t for the purposes of treatment is, the fact that she was already taken to Holy Cross. When she gets to Holy Cross, she\u2019s examined by them. The report says what they do. Gives her directions as to what to do in terms of followup. When she gets\u2014if you look at the report to Dr. Boos, the original report, not the redacted version, when Brittany gets\u2014well, first of all, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>look at to whom the report is directed. It\u2019s directed to Detective Mike Carin and Thomas Earl from Dr. Boos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: That has\u2014he would be doing that there\u2014if you look at <em>[State </em>u] <em>Coates </em>[, 405 Md. 181, 950 A.2d 114 (2008) ] and you do the analysis that <em>Coates </em>follows in this case, questions concerning the identify of the perpetrator\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">THE COURT: They\u2019ve redacted those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]:\u2014are not relevant in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">THE COURT: Well, actually, I think <em>Coates </em>says that they normally aren\u2019t. They may or may not be, and I think that it referred to an earlier case where as if\u2014where the child is still symptomatic, possibly identity might be pathologically germane, but they redacted the references as to the name, so it\u2019s a non-issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And, I guess the other thing that I would point out to the Court is, Dr. Boos, who took the history in this particular case, is the one who reported this information. I have no right to cross-examine. I can\u2019t cross-examine the report, and obviously one of the protections that my client has is to cross-examine Dr. Boos. He\u2019s available. He\u2019s in Boston. They could have brought him down, rather than trying to put this report in, yet they didn\u2019t. My client has a right to confront his accusers, and what\u2019s in this report essentially is being used as an accusation. These are statements taken, part of a forensic review\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">THE COURT: So that, you know, I\u2019m not inclined, since you have the other witness who is here, subject to cross-examination, to admit the assessment portion of the report. I mean, it would appear to me that the history portion and what the child reports, and we\u2019ve had the mother here and, I think, [Petitioner\u2019s counsel] even asked the mother what she told the doctor, so as to the history portion of the exam, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>[Petitioner\u2019s counsel], quite frankly, it would appear to me that that does fall within the hearsay exceptions, statements made for purposes of diagnoses or treatment, and I think it was <em>Coates </em>and or other cases, but I believe it\u2019s <em>Coates </em>that says you can clearly have dual purposes, and although she initially says, you know, \u201cPm not sure why Pm here,\u201d the doctor explains what he needs to do and why he needs to do it, and the proffer is it\u2019s done that same day as the initial report, which may be within a week. It\u2019s a little unclear of the last assault, so, I mean, it clearly seems to me that it does related to diagnosis and treatment. So Pm inclined, frankly, to admit the history portion of what she relates occurred, but not the doctor\u2019s assessment. Although I mean, that\u2019s the physical exam. I don\u2019t have a problem necessarily with the physical exam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Are you talking about where [it] says \u201cpast medical history\u201d? Is that the part that you\u2019re saying you are willing to admit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">THE COURT: Pm talking about \u201cpast medical history, social history, history from Brittany B.\u201d I\u2019m talking about the first four pages. It\u2019s all part of the history as far as I\u2019m concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: You just mentioned that there can be dual purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: and one of the things, I think, that comes out in <em>Coates, </em>when you read <em>Coates </em>carefully, and Pm sure you\u2019ve [read] it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]:\u2014as closely as I have, is we have to look at the primary purpose, and one of the words that <em>Coates </em>uses, I think, quite clearly is the over arching purpose of the interview. Is it for medical? Is it for forensic purposes? Is it, you know\u2014which one of them prevails, or is both? And in this particular case, she\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>already had a medical evaluation before she ever got to Dr. Boos, and if this was for medical purposes, I don\u2019t see one thing in Dr. Boos\u2019 report where there\u2019s any suggestion as to what she should do for treatment of this problem, and\u2014 THE COURT: Well, he refers her\u2014I mean, at the bottom\u2014I mean, he orders certain testing. He also says that she should have evaluation, I believe, for\u2014I mean, as I see it, frankly, it seems to me that he is probably\u2014appears to be more focused on the mental health aspects, at least towards the end, than the concerns about the physical, although he orders certain tests to rule out a sexually transmitted diseases and or issues about AIDS, I guess, because of the exposure to semen, but he specifically says, he\u2019s cultured her for chlamydia, gonorrhea, he sends her for blood tests for HIV, hepatitis, syphilis, cultured the anus and the vagina. Says if these tests are negative, then she has no specific traditional medical needs stemming from her child abuse, so he clearly is investigating that. He doesn\u2019t know yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">And then I think he goes on to say she\u2019s not currently reporting, but he says a medical health assessment is mandatory in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, I don\u2019t want the assessment in if I have to accept anything, and the other part is, it\u2019s\u2014we\u2019ve had testimony about all of this already. We\u2019ve had [Brittany\u2019s mother]. I mean, this is certainly cumulative, but\u2014that\u2019s my objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">THE COURT: Overruled, I think, I mean, first of, I think <em>Coates </em>makes clear that the real test if what the declarant thinks why they were there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well yes. What\u2019s the state of mid [sic] of the declarant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">THE COURT: But I think as you read through that, he explains to the declarant the need to find this information out, the purposes of it, and it does appear, for reviewing the entire report, that he is addressing potentially for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>purposes, but very much so, one of the purposes at least, is assessing what treatment, whether it is traditional physical, as her [sic] refers to, and or mental health treatment that she may need. I believe that was communicated to her throughout the, I mean, based on the body of the report, and it occurs the same day that she reports it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The State\u2019s case included Brittany\u2019s testimony. During her testimony, however, Brittany was not questioned about her understanding of why she had been \u201creferred\u201d to the Tree House.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Maryland Rule 5-801(c) defines \u201chearsay\u201d evidence as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d During Brittany\u2019s testimony, she was not asked if she understood why she had been (in the words of Dr. Boos\u2019 report) \u201creferred for a medical history recommendation\u201d at the Tree House, which (in the words of the State\u2019s brief) \u201cprovides ... victim advocacy [and] forensic interviews.\u201d The Circuit Court nonetheless found that, when Brittany was answering Dr. Boos\u2019 questions, she understood that she was providing information for the purpose of medical treatment or diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">As the above quoted proceedings show, the Circuit Court\u2019s finding that Brittany\u2019s statements to Dr. Boos were \u201cin contemplation of treatment\u201d was based solely upon Dr. Boos\u2019 report to Detective Carin. The report, which was \u201chearsay\u201d evidence of Brittany\u2019s state of mind when she was interviewed by Dr. Boos, should have been excluded pursuant to Md. Rule 5-802. The report was not admissible to establish that Brittany\u2019s statements to Dr. Boos qualified under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(4) as statements made for purposes of medical treatment or medical diagnosis in contemplation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Nowhere in the record is there a valid explanation for why the \u201chospital records\u201d hearsay exception should extend to the report at issue. It is doubtful that, even if Dr. Boos testified, he could have provided such an explanation. Unfortunately, although both Maryland and Massachusetts have adopted the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the State made no attempt to use the provisions of the Act to secure the attendance of Dr. Boos. Under these circumstances, the Circuit Court erred in overruling Petitioner\u2019s objection to the introduction of the report at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Moreover, even if Dr. Boos had testified as a State\u2019s witness, his report to Detective Carin would have been inadmissible unless Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel somehow \u201copened the door\u201d to its introduction. Although the State could certainly have used the report to refresh Dr. Boos\u2019 recollection, under Md. Rule 5-612, portions of a writing used to refresh a witness\u2019s memory are only admissible \u201cfor the limited purpose of impeaching the witness as to whether the item in fact refreshes the witness\u2019s recollection.\u201d If the report qualified as \u201cpast recollection recorded,\u201d under Md. Rule 5-802.1(e), the report could \u201cnot itself be received as an exhibit unless offered by an adverse party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">A witness\u2019s prior consistent statement may be admitted (1) under Md. Rule 5-802.1(b), \u201cto rebut an express or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>implied charge against the [witness] of fabrication, or improper influence or motive;\u201d and/or (2) under Md. Rule 5\u2014616(c)(2), if the statement \u201chaving been made detracts from the impeachment.]\u201d These rules, however, become applicable only if \u201cthe defendant\u2019s opening statement and/or <em>cross-examination </em>of a State\u2019s witness has \u2018opened the door\u2019 to evidence that is relevant (and <em>now </em>admissible) for the purpose of ... rehabilitation!.]\u201d <em>Johnson v.

Continental Baking Co., </em>172 Md. 24, 190 A. 768 (1937), after a plaintiffs witness was cross-examined about a written statement that he had given to a \u201crepresentative\u201d of the plaintiff, the plaintiff offered that statement into evidence. While affirming the ruling that the cross-examination had \u201copened the door\u201d to the introduction of the statement, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">[T]he only purpose it could serve the plaintiff, except for its effect on the jury, was to set the witness fairly before the jury and tend to relieve him of the imputation that he was not telling the truth, as might be implied from the questions put to him on cross-examination.

Our opinion in <em>Shpigel </em>included the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">Somewhat analogous to the instant matter is <em>Chadderton v. M.A. Bongivonni, Inc., </em>101 Md.App. 472, 647 A.2d 137 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(1994). <em>Chadderton </em>was a workers\u2019 compensation case in which the insurer and the Subsequent Injury Fund succeeded in placing in evidence in the circuit court copies of the reports rendered to them by the physicians to whom they had referred the claimant for the purpose of obtaining an opinion on the nature and extent of disability. Closely following the analysis in <em>Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc., </em>249 F.Supp. 681 (S.D.N.Y.1965), the Court of Special Appeals held that the reports were inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Chadderton, </em>applying the <em>Yates </em>rationale, held that the reports rendered by physicians to whom the claimant had been referred by the workers\u2019 compensation insurer and the Subsequent Injury Fund were not admissible when introduced by the parties who had arranged for those reports, essentially for a lack of trustworthiness. <em>Chadderton, </em>101 Md.App. at 483-84, 647 A.2d at 142. Erroneously admitting the reports was held to be prejudicial, because the plaintiff was unable to cross-examine the physicians whose opinions were introduced in report form. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 647 A.2d at 144. Thus, although the circuit court in <em>Chadderton </em>had been persuaded that the reports were admissible under a section of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act stating that \u201c \u2018the proceedings in an appeal shall be informal and summary,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 479, 647 A.2d at 140, and although the circuit court had found the reports to be sufficiently trustworthy, the Court of Special Appeals focused only on the trustworthiness aspect of that ruling. The appellate court in effect held that the circuit court had abused its discretion in concluding that the reports were trustworthy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 132-134, 741 A.2d at 1213-14 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Our opinion in <em>Shpigel </em>also cited with approval the case of <em>Kelly v. HCI Heinz Construction Co., </em>282 Ill.App.3d 36, 218 Ill.Dec. 112, 668 N.E.2d 596 (1996), <em>appeal denied, </em>169 Ill.2d 569, 221 Ill.Dec. 439, 675 N.E.2d 634 (1996), in which the Court of Appeals of Illinois affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>excluding the records of a treating physician that had been prepared in anticipation of litigation. 218 Ill.Dec. 112, 668 N.E.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"> In the case at bar, in which the investigating officers referred Brittany to Dr. Boos, Dr. Boos\u2019 report to Detective Carin was inadmissible hearsay when offered to establish Brittany\u2019s state of mind at the time of her interview. We are therefore required to order a new trial unless we are \u201cpersuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that [the inadmissible evidence admitted over Petitioner\u2019s objection] did not contribute to the guilty verdict[s] returned against [him].\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Whether the erroneous evidentiary ruling in the case at bar is \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d can be determined by examining the use that the State made of Dr. Boos\u2019 report. The record shows that Dr. Shukat\u2019s testimony was based entirely upon that report.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record also shows that the prosecutor\u2019s summation included the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADx\">How else do we know that Brittany is telling the truth in this case? We heard expert testimony from Dr. Shukat. She said that she had conducted exams on thousands of children and what she told you, ladies and gentlemen, is that in a case involving abuse that occurred where the abuse is oral sex, that we wouldn\u2019t expect to find physical findings. She did tell you, however, that the painful urination that Brittany said she was experiencing in the days after the abuse, that that is consistent with somebody performing oral sex upon her. She talked to you about these and why a child would not be able to conclusively say a specific date when abuse occurred, and she told you that this was common in her field, that often times children delay in disclosure because, number one, it\u2019s a painful memory and they\u2019re trying to suppress it, but also because they have had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>express or implied threat. In this case, we know there was an express threat. He told her that if she told somebody, something bad was going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">When asked about whether or not the detail that Ms. Brittany B[ ] provided, whether or not that was consistent with a child who had been exposed to pornography, Dr. Shukat told us that it was. She told us that the detail that Brittany B[ ] provided went beyond her developmental age. A child who had been exposed to pornography would not have the detailed accounts that the victim gave about how ejaculation occurred, more importantly, what the consistency of semen is. You\u2019ll recall that Brittany B[ ] described the semen\u2019s consistency as being gooey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">Dr. Shukat also told you that a victim of child abuse who had been exposed to pornography would not know that genital pain resulted from those sexual acts, and the fact that Brittany disclosed that she suffered genital pain, that that was not consistent with her watching pornography.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">The examination that was given at the Tree House by Dr. Boos also corroborates the abuse that occurred. You\u2019re going to be able to look at that document and you\u2019re going to be able to look at the statements that Ms. Brittany B[ ] gave. And she stated when he, the defendant, \u201clicked my private part, he pressed down too hard,\u201d and after he pressed down too hard, it burned for her to urinate. She also corroborated what she told you on the stand, which is that, \u201cWhen my grandmother, and my mother, and my aunt go out, Uncle Wayne tells me to come to his room and makes me suck his private part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">She also corroborated the disclosure about the cunnilingus. She said, \u201cUncle Wayne licked my private part,\u201d and she also corroborated that the defendant had threatened her. The defendant told her he didn\u2019t want her to tell anyone and if she did, bad things were going to happen to her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Under these circumstances, we are unable to declare that the erroneous reception of Dr. Boos\u2019 report was harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner is therefore entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS THAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY BE VACATED, AND THE CASE BE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">HARRELL and ADKINS, JJ., Dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">.

The State had the opportunity to\u2014but did not\u2014ask Dr. Shukat to base her opinions on Brittany\u2019s testimony, or on Brittany\u2019s (admissible) out-of-court statement to a licensed social worker.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\">ADKINS, J., dissenting, in which HARRELL, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Most respectfully, I dissent from the majority opinion because it seems to superimpose an additional requirement on the Maryland Rule 5\u2014803(b)(4) hearsay exception, i.e., that there be an explicit statement from the child that she understood why she was referred to the health care provider. Although I do not dispute that the pertinent inquiry in deciding whether to admit such evidence is whether the patient believed that the health care provider was going to diagnose or treat her, I think that the trial judge may make such determination based on the circumstances of the medical examination, without an explicit statement from the patient. <em>See United States v. Edward J., </em>224 F.3d 1216, 1220 n. 3 (10th Cir.2000) (evidence other than the express testimony of the victims sufficiently indicated that they understood the evaluation was for medical purposes, specifically, the victims\u2019 ages (eight and ten), the frequency with which the victims had been to that medical clinic before, and the level of maturity demonstrated by their request for a female physician); <em>United States v. Pacheco, </em>154 F.3d 1236 (10th Cir.1998) (evidence that physician explained to victim why she was being evaluated and the process for such evaluation, including showing the child the medical instruments, was sufficient to admit the victim\u2019s statements even though the victim did not expressly testify that she knew the procedure was for medical purposes). Although the State has the burden to establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>medical examination exception applies, that burden can be satisfied from the content of the medical report itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In this case, the child victim was taken to the \u201cTree House Child Assessment Center For Montgomery County\u201d after her release from Holy Cross Hospital on April 28, 2008, the same day she reported the sexual abuse to the police. Dr. Boos \u201creminded her that [he] was a doctor and we needed to talk about doctor things,\u201d and that she should \u201cnever lie to [him] because if [he] made a decision based on the lie, [he] might not take proper care of her[.]\u201d This case contrasts with the circumstances in <em>State v. Coates, </em>405 Md. 131, 143-45, 950 A.2d 114, 122-23 (2008), where the child\u2019s question\u2014\u201care you going to go out and find him now?\u201d\u2014indicated that she thought the examination was part of an investigation rather than an assessment for medical purposes. In that case we agreed with the Court of Special Appeals that the trial court had erred in admitting the hearsay statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my opinion, the advisements given by Dr. Boos to the child, the occurrence of the examination on the same day that she visited the hospital, and other circumstances evident to the trial judge, were sufficient to justify the judge\u2019s conclusion that the hearsay statements fell within the medical examination exception, and thus its admission did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Judge HARRELL authorizes me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\">. <em>Coates </em>instructed that a statement made by a child sexual assault victim to a physician or other health care provider in connection with medical examination or treatment, which has some value for that purpose, is admissible under this exception even though the health care provider had the dual motive of diagnosis/treatment and utilizing the examination for forensic purposes in connection with the assault. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Coates, </em>405 Md. 131, 143-45, 950 A.2d 114, 122-23 (2008). The Court in <em>Coates </em>emphasized that \"a declarant\u2019s statements about the cause of an injury or identity of a culprit must be related to diagnosis or treatment to be admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 123-24. It cautioned, moreover, that the exception \"does not apply to cases in which a non-treating physician is merely preparing to testify on the patient\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 950 A.2d at 121.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
