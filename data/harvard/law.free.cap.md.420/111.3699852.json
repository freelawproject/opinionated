You think Kojak was making this ... up? No way, bunk, we\u2019re talking sacred freedoms here, notably your Fifth ...

We consider in this case a defendant that followed Simon\u2019s and <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>advice\u2014he remained silent. Yet the State used that silence against him at trial, and now asks us to decide whether his post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was admissible properly against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Raymond Charles Lupfer (\u201cLupfer\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d) challenges a judgment of the Court of Special Appeals that reasoned in its opinion that the prosecution was entitled, under the circumstances here and the \u201cfair response doctrine,\u201d as established in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988), to elicit testimony regarding the fact that Lupfer remained silent after he was arrested and advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We hold, for reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>that, because Lupfer did not \u201copen the door\u201d sufficiently with his statements at trial regarding his pre-arrest actions and intentions, the State was not entitled to elicit testimony regarding his post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The State\u2019s evidence at trial was sufficient, if believed, to establish that, on 16 June 2007, Lupfer shot and killed Jeremy Yarbray (\u201cYarbray\u201d) outside of a residence at 159 Mahogany Drive in Cecil County, Maryland. The details of how the fatal shooting occurred were disputed sharply at Lupfer\u2019s trial in the Circuit Court for Cecil County.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Yarbray was invited to the residence\u2014owned by an acquaintance of Lupfer\u2014to sell narcotics to Lupfer\u2019s companions. Lupfer testified that, upon coming out of a bathroom, he observed Yarbray in the living room engaged in a confrontation with Derek Patton, another of Lupfer\u2019s acquaintances. Lupfer testified further that he saw a handgun laying in the middle of the floor near the confrontation and, sensing a \u201cthreatening situation,\u201d reached down to pick up the gun, at which time Yarbray reached simultaneously for and grabbed the gun. Allegedly, during the course of a brief struggle between Lupfer and Yarbray, the gun discharged three times. Lupfer\u2019s defense at trial was that the gun discharged accidentally in the course of the struggle, and that Lupfer had no intent to kill or inflict deadly harm upon Yarbray.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The State\u2019s witnesses attested to renditions of the events leading up to the fatal shooting different than Lupfer\u2019s version. Patton and Joshua Jackson (Patton\u2019s cousin) testified that, when Yarbray entered the townhouse, Lupfer asked Yarbray, \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d A struggle ensued between the two. Jesse Kennedy, yet another acquaintance of Lupfer, testified that Lupfer struck Yarbray in the face with a handgun and, after Yarbray \u201ccrawl[ed] out [the] front door\u201d and \u201cstumbled down the steps, ... [Lupfer] went over to the door and opened the door and began to fire shots.\u201d Jackson testified that, after Lupfer asked Yarbray, \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d he saw Yarbray \u201cpush[ ] his hands up in the air,\u201d and that, after Jackson ran out the back door of the residence, he heard approximately three gunshots. Kyle Slayman, a neighbor, testified that he saw \u201ca guy running and ... [saw] gunshots shooting him and he fell to the ground,\u201d and that he saw Lupfer \u201ccoming from the house\u201d while \u201cshooting the guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">A few days after the shooting, a resident of a nearby trailer park found a handgun laying near his pickup truck and called 911. Ballistics testing showed that the gun recovered from the trailer park fired at least one of the bullets recovered from Yarbray\u2019s body. Forensic analysis revealed Lupfer\u2019s DNA on the trigger guard and handgrip of the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Lupfer testified that, following the shooting, he ran out the back of the residence, threw the gun in the nearby woods, and encountered a former co-worker who agreed to give him a ride in his truck to New Jersey, where Lupfer claimed to have another friend with whom he could stay. After reaching New Jersey, Lupfer claimed he called his girlfriend, Pam Hamilton, in Maryland, to come pick him up, \u201c[b]ecause I had time to think about what was going on and I needed to come back to Maryland.\u201d Lupfer stated that, on his return to Maryland, he intended to go to Hamilton\u2019s house \u201c[bjecause I had been up for almost two days and I wasn\u2019t prepared mentally or physically to deal with going to turn myself in instantly,\u201d and, therefore, he was going to \u201c[t]ry to get some sleep and prepare to go talk to the police.\u201d Upon Hamilton\u2019s arrival in New Jersey, a truck driver agreed to drive Lupfer and Hamilton to a truck stop in Cecil County. Ultimately, the police arrested Lupfer later that night, as he was resting in the cab of the truck driver\u2019s truck, now back in Cecil County.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">After the conclusion of Lupfer\u2019s direct testimony, the following bench conference ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, may we approach briefly, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">[COURT]: Come on up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, among other things that this defendant has said in the course of his testimony is that he intended to speak to police. In fact, after he was arrested he was questioned and he elected not to say anything to police. Ordinarily I could not comment upon that, but it appears to me that when a defendant such as Mr. Lupfer gives testimony that he intended to speak to police, even as he was in New Jersey according to his testimony, deliberating about the issue of turning himself in, I believe that has now opened the door to that cross-examination. Before I go there, I just wanted to bring that matter to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">[COURT]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t think that he is. And the reason is because Mr. Lupfer originally did not think that there was going to be a serious charge such as murder brought against him. And when the police arrested him and told him that, he said, [o]h, shit, this is more serious than I thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">[COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I better talk to my attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">[COURT]: Okay. Well, you can bring that out but I think the door has been opened. I think you\u2019re right, [prosecutor].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Thereafter, the prosecutor cross-examined Lupfer in the following fashion regarding his return to Cecil County from New Jersey:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: [Y]ou were coming back to Cecil County because you wanted to turn yourself in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">[LUPFER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: You wanted to talk to the police, right? [LUPFER]: I wanted to get the situation straightened out. [PROSECUTOR]: You wanted to try to clear yourself, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">[LUPFER]: I wanted to get the situation\u2014I\u2019m not sure of my intentions, but running was not my intention. It was just going to get worse and I knew there is only one person that is going to say what needs to be said, and that was me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: Mr. Lupfer, after the police arrested you, they took you back to the police station, right? [LUPFER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: And they asked you if you wanted to talk about what had happened, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-15\">[LUPFER]: No, they did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. I objected, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>[COURT]: The objection and the reason therefore is on the record. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: They asked you if you wanted to talk about what happened; is that correct, Mr. Lupfer? [LUPFER]: No, sir. It\u2019s not correct. Would you like me to tell you what took place when I got there? [PROSECUTOR]: Well, I\u2019m sure they took your fingerprints and took your photographs. I mean, we know that so I\u2019m not interested in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">[LUPFER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: But I\u2019m just wanting to know whether they offered you the opportunity to tell your side of the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">[LUPFER]: No. Before they slid the charges charging me with first degree murder, before they slid them charges in front of me, no, they did not give me a chance to say anything. And when I seen the charges, I asked for a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">As a rebuttal witness, the State called Sergeant David J. Sexton of the Maryland State Police, who acted as the lead investigator in the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: What, if any, efforts did you make to question Mr. Lupfer about this case subsequent to arrest? And I take Mr. Brown\u2019s objection to be preserving the record for his earlier objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">[COURT]: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">[SERGEANT SEXTON]: When we brought him back to the barrack, we placed him in an interview room. I came in with another investigator, Corporal or TFC Bachtell. Basically I sat down with [Lupfer] and advised him that\u2014I asked him, I said, [Lupfer], you know why you\u2019re here, but before I start asking any questions of you, I\u2019m going to read you your advice of rights, and I read them verbatim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">During that time [Lupfer] had asked me what he was being charged with. I told him he was being charged with murder as a result of what happened over in Timberbrook, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and that\u2019s when I read him his advice of rights and he elected not to answer any questions. He said he would have to talk to a lawyer because those charges were very serious and he wanted to speak to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The jury acquitted Lupfer of first-degree murder, but convicted him of second-degree murder, first-degree assault, and use of a handgun in a crime of violence. The Circuit Court sentenced Lupfer to forty years\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Petitioner appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. A panel of the intermediate appellate court, in a reported opinion, <em>Lupfer v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 216, 4 A.3d 32 (2010), affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, explaining that, although this Court stated in <em>Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 258, 718 A.2d 211, 219 (1998), that \u201c[ejvidence of post-arrest silence, after <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given, is inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment,\u201d we \u201cdid not hold that post <em>-Miranda </em>silence was inadmissible in the situation where it is offered for a purpose other than as substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Lupfer, </em>194 Md.App. at 231, 4 A.3d at 41. The Court of Special Appeals cited with approval federal cases holding that introducing a defendant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence is permissible where the \u201csilence is introduced for the limited purpose of rebutting an impression created by the defendant that he cooperated fully with the police.\u201d <em>Lupfer, </em>194 Md.App. at 235, 4 A.3d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Applying its understanding of the law relating to the admissibility of post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence, the intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">Here, [Lupfer] testified that, although he fled to New Jersey after the shooting, he returned to Maryland to turn himself in to the police. On cross-examination, before being questioned regarding his actions after arrest, appellant testified that he wanted to talk to the police \u201cto get the situation straightened out,\u201d stating that he \u201cknew that there was only one person that is going to say what needs to be said, and that was me.\u201d This testimony created the impres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>sion that appellant was cooperating fully with the police. Pursuant to the above authorities, it was not fundamentally unfair for the State to rebut this impression of cooperation and elicit evidence that appellant subsequently declined to talk with the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><em>Lupfer, </em>194 Md.App. at 237,4 A.3d at 44.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Petitioner filed timely a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Lupfer v. State, </em>417 Md. 384, 10 A.3d 199 (2010), to consider whether \u201cthe trial court err[ed] when it permitted the State, over objection, to introduce evidence that after being arrested, <em>\u2018Mira,ndized,\u2019 </em>and informed of the charges against him, Mr. Lupfer did not make a statement to police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>and asked to speak to an attorney[.]\u201d For reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and direct remand of the case to the Circuit Court for Cecil County for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">It is well-settled that \u201ctrial judges have wide discretion to admit or exclude items of evidence.... \u201d <em>Gauvin v. State, </em>411 Md. 698, 710, 985 A.2d 513, 520 (2009). Where the evidentiary ruling is a discretionary one, \u201ca trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed pursuant to the \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 583, 976 A.2d 300, 310 (2009). Where, however, the evidentiary ruling case \u201cinvolves an interpretation and application of ... case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a [non-deferential] standard of review.\u201d <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175, 184 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states by incorporation through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>see Sapero v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>398 Md. 317, 343, 920 A.2d 1061, 1076 (2007), provides, in pertinent part, \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself....\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. In <em>Miranda, v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706-07 (1966), the Supreme Court held that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Although the <em>Miranda </em>warnings inform a suspect in a criminal investigation of the potential consequences of making a statement to law enforcement personnel, they do not speak directly to any potential consequences for remaining silent. To this point, in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, 98 (1976), the Supreme Court noted that, \u201cwhile it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings carry no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings.\u201d <em>See Dean v. Young, 777 </em>F.2d 1239, 1241 (7th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe state may not first implicitly warn the defendant that silence will not be used against him and then accost him at trial once he remains silent.\u201d); <em>Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 527, 784 A.2d 1102, 1107 (2001) (\u201cAn inherent component of this guarantee is that one who invokes the privilege against self-incrimination shall remain free from adverse presumptions surrounding the exercise of such right.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>[T]he prosecution may not use statements ... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards.... Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>For the last number of decades, the courts of this State and other states, as well as the federal courts, have fleshed out the reach of the prohibition against \u201cpenalizing\u201d a defendant for remaining silent. The caselaw differentiates generally between pre-<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and post-arrest silence, and regarding post-arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>silence, between pre-<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>post-Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>silence. This case presents us with the opportunity to determine whether the State\u2019s use of Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence may be used against him to \u201cfairly respond\u201d to an argued inference that Petitioner sought to create a favorable impression that he returned to Maryland intending to cooperate with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">I. The Sounds of Silence</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The Supreme Court, this Court, and commentators warn at length about the dangers of introducing at trial the fact that a defendant in a criminal case decided not to speak to law enforcement personnel, especially where that refusal occurred following arrest and after the defendant is advised of his or her <em>Miranda </em>rights. In <em>United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975), the Supreme Court noted generally that, \u201c[i]n most circumstances!!,] silence is so ambiguous that it is of little probative force\u201d and more specifically regarding post-arrest, post-Miranda silence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">[T]he situation of an arrestee is very different, for he is under no duty to speak and ... has ordinarily been advised by government authorities only moments earlier that he has a right to remain silent, and that anything he does say can and will be used against him in court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>At the time of arrest and during custodial interrogation, innocent and guilty alike\u2014perhaps particularly the innocent\u2014may find the situation so intimidating that they may choose to stand mute. A variety of reasons may influence that decision. In these often emotional and confusing circumstances, a suspect may not have heard or fully understood the question, or may have felt there was no need to reply. He may have maintained silence out of fear or unwillingness to incriminate another. Or the arrestee may simply react with silence in response to the hostile and perhaps unfamiliar atmosphere surrounding his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA\"><em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 176-77, 95 S.Ct. at 2136-37, 45 L.Ed.2d at 104 (internal citation omitted); <em>see Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 618, 96 S.Ct. at 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d at 97 (\u201cSilence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested.\u201d). In addition to explaining why post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence has scant probative value, the Supreme Court went on to discuss the \u201csignificant potential for prejudice\u201d inherent in admitting evidence relating to a defendant\u2019s silence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">The danger is that the jury is likely to assign much more weight to the defendant\u2019s previous silence than is warranted. And permitting the defendant to explain the reasons for his silence is unlikely to overcome the strong negative inference that the jury is likely to draw from the fact that the defendant remained silent at the time of his arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFK\"><em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. at 2138, 45 L.Ed.2d at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In Maryland, we have said that, \u201c[i]n general, silence is evidence of dubious value that it is usually inadmissible under Maryland Rule 5-402 [relevance] or 5-403 [prejudice].\u201d <em>Kosh v. State, </em>382 Md. 218, 227, 854 A.2d 1259, 1265 (2004). On the issue of probity of post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence, in <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 254-55, 718 A.2d at 218, we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">[A] defendant\u2019s failure to come forward does not constitute an admission, and lacks probative value. Citizens ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>have no legal obligation to come forward to the police. Failure to come forward to the police may result from numerous factors, including a belief that one has committed no crime, general suspicion of the police, or fear of retaliation. Such silence is simply not probative as substantive evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">(Citations omitted.); <em>see Snyder v.

As a constitutional matter, allowing such evidence would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process. As an evidentiary matter, such evidence is also inadmissible. When a defendant is silent following <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he may be acting merely upon his right to remain silent. Thus, a defendant\u2019s silence at that point carries little or no probative value, and a significant potential for prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 258, 718 A.2d at 219-20 (some citations and quotation marks omitted); <em>see Younie v.

In <em>Grier, </em>however, we did not rely only on the aforementioned principles; we also addressed the State\u2019s contentions that the admission of evidence relating to post-arrest silence was permissible under either the \u201copening the door\u201d and \u201cfair response\u201d doctrines.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Regarding the opening the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>door doctrine, we stated that, although the doctrine operates to make \u201cevidence which was previously irrelevant ... now relevant through the opponent\u2019s admission of other evidence on the same issue,\u201d <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 260, 718 A.2d at 221 (quoting <em>Clark v.

Notwithstanding this general statement, the State argues the evidence relating to Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence was admissible under the \u201cfair response\u201d doctrine. Because Petitioner does not contest the viability <em>vel non </em>of the fair response doctrine, our task is to determine whether eliciting evidence relating to Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence was permissible under the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The Supreme Court has provided little guidance as to what circumstances entitle the prosecution to a fair response. <em>See </em>Frank R. Herrmann <em>&amp; </em>Brownlow M. Speer, <em>Standing Mute at Arrest as Evidence of Guilt: The \u201cRight to Silence\u201d Under Attack, </em>35 Am. J.Crim.

From <em>Doyle, </em>we learn that the prosecution may employ a fair response relating to a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence to \u201ccontradict a defendant who testifies to an exculpatory version of events and claims to have told the police the same version upon arrest.\u201d <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 620 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. at 2246 n. 11, 49 L.Ed.2d at 99 n. 11.

Further, from <em>Robinson, </em>we learn that the prosecution is entitled to a fair response regarding a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence when either defendant or \u201chis counsel urgeL ] ... that the Government ha[s] not allowed [defendant] to explain his side of the story.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>485 U.S. at 26, 108 S.Ct. at 866, 99 L.Ed.2d at 27; <em>see, e.g., People v.

Aside from these gleanings, the Supreme Court has said little else to clarify in what circumstances the State may be entitled to a fair response. <em>See Robinson, </em>485 U.S. at 32, 108 S.Ct. at 869, 99 L.Ed.2d at 31 (stating only that there is no violation \u201cwhere ... the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s [silence] ... is a fair response <em>to a claim made by defendant or his counsel </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added). Surveying caselaw from other courts seems apropos.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In <em>United States v. Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d 1378, 1380 (5th Cir.1975), defendant was convicted of receiving stolen vehicles, in violation of the Dyer Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313. During cross-examination of an investigating FBI agent, defendant\u2019s counsel asked the agent: \u201cDuring the period of time that this investigation has been going on, to your knowledge has Mr. Fairchild cooperated fully with the FBI and U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in responding with anything that you all wanted?\u201d <em>Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d at 1383. The detective responded that the defendant, after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, refused to make a statement to law enforcement officials. <em>Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d at 1382. In holding that eliciting evidence of the defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence was not error, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals explained that such evidence is \u201cadmissible for the purpose of rebutting the impression which [the defendant] attempted to create: that he cooperated fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>with the law enforcement authorities.\u201d <em>Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d at 1383. Although by cross-examining the FBI agent as he did, the defendant \u201copened the door to a full and not just a selective development of that subject,\u201d the federal appeals court upheld the ruling of the district court ultimately because defendant\u2019s counsel did not object or move to strike the agent\u2019s response. <em>Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d at 1383, 1384. Thus, the reasoning in <em>Fairchild </em>may be read to endorse, procedural mis-steps aside, the proposition that when either the defendant or his counsel states expressly that the defendant cooperated fully with law enforcement officials, the prosecution may introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post-Miranda silence for the purpose of showing that the defendant, in fact, had not been cooperative with law enforcement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>461 F.3d 1338, 1348 (11th Cir.2006) (stating in dicta that evidence relating to defendant\u2019s post-Miranda silence was admissible \u201cfor the purpose of rebutting his claim that he ... was, in essence, working with law enforcement in the fight against internet child predators\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Some cases have gone further, holding that the Government may introduce permissibly evidence relating to post-arrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>silence, not only when a defendant or his counsel states expressly that he cooperated with law enforcement, but also when the defendant \u201ccreated an impression of general cooperation with police after arrest----\u201d <em>United States v. Shue, </em>766 F.2d 1122, 1129 (7th Cir.1985). In <em>Shue, </em>defendant was convicted of bank robbery and conspiracy. <em>Shue, </em>766 F.2d at 1125. At trial, the prosecutor cross-examined Shue at length regarding his refusal to talk to authorities after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Shue, </em>766 F.2d at 1128. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals explained that, because the defendant stated that he cooperated when asked for fingerprints, hair and handwriting samples, and to appear in lineups, \u201calthough [defendant] never directly claimed to have cooperated fully with the authorities after his arrest, this exchange did create the impression of general cooperation,\u201d and, thus, the \u201cdefendant should not be permitted to twist his <em>Miranda </em>protection to shield lies or false impressions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>government attack.\u201d <em>Shue, </em>766 F.2d at 1129. Thus, the line of cases that <em>Fairchild </em>and <em>Shue </em>represent stands for the proposition that \u201ca defendant may open the door to cross-examination for impeachment purposes by testifying or creating the impression through his defense presentation he has cooperated with police when, in fact, he has not.\u201d <em>State v. McIntosh, </em>358 S.C. 432, 595 S.E.2d 484, 491 (2004); <em>see Lupfer v.

Rather, using the State\u2019s words, \u201cLupfer ... created the impression for the jury that he fully <em>intended </em>to cooperate and speak with the police,\u201d at some unspecified, undetermined, future time when he reached Maryland. Although the distinction between claiming to have cooperated with police and claiming to intend, at some undetermined point in the future, to cooperate with police may seem subtle, it is not a distinction without a difference in the context of this analysis. As one court stated, \u201ccourts have recognized situations in which it is not a violation of due process for the prosecutor to elicit on cross-examination the fact of the defendant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>silence for the purpose of impeaching the defendant\u2019s testimony <em>about his or her interactions with the police after the arrest.\u201d State v. Cockrell, </em>306 Wis.2d 52, 741 N.W.2d 267, 271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>(2007) (emphasis added). In the present case, the testimony-proffered by the State to suggest that Petitioner opened the door did not relate to \u201chis interactions with the police after the arrest\u201d (e.g., fully cooperating with police, making a statement to police, etc.); rather, they involved only his actions and intentions <em>before </em>he was arrested (e.g., while in New Jersey, he intended to return to Maryland to \u201cprepare to go talk to the police,\u201d etc.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">As noted <em>supra, </em>the \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine operates to make \u201cevidence which was previously irrelevant ... now relevant through the opponent\u2019s admission of other evidence on the same issue.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>332 Md. at 85, 629 A.2d at 1240. Consistent with this precept, evidence of post-arrest silence may be admissible to rebut a defendant\u2019s claim that he made a statement to police following arrest, as both the testimony relating to the post-arrest silence and the testimony regarding the statement are \u201cevidence on the same issue.\u201d In the present case, however, it cannot be said that both (1) the sum of Petitioner\u2019s testimony as to what he intended (in the words of Petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel, \u201cpotentially and eventually\u201d) to do at some undermined time in the future; and (2) Sergeant Sexton\u2019s testimony regarding Petitioner\u2019s post-arrest, post-post <em>Miranda </em>silence are \u201cevidence on the same issue,\u201d as an individual may choose not to carry out his expressed intentions (equivocal ones, at that) for any number of reasons. Stated differently, it is not inconsistent necessarily for Petitioner to have testified, on one hand, that he, at some undetermined point in the future, intended to speak with police, and, on the other hand, to have remained silent after being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and seeing a charge of first-degree murder made manifest.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>when the prosecution elicits evidence relating to a defendant\u2019s post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence to rebut an implication that the defendant merely <em>intended, </em>at some undetermined point in the future, to cooperate with police, the probative value of such evidence is dwarfed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

We have stated that \u201c[a]n error is not harmless unless, upon an independent review of the record, a reviewing court is able to declare beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 263, 718 A.2d at 222; <em>see Weitzel v.

It may well be so that the jury did \u201ctake the bait.\u201d In our nation, the advice of rights upon arrest, and particularly of the right to remain silent upon arrest ... is widely known.
