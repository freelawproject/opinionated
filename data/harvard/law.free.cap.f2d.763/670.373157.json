Before us, he advances two issues for reversal: that the evidence, properly viewed, revealed a mere failure of communication, not a contempt; and that the fines imposed, aggregating almost fifteen thousand dollars, were excessive. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-22\">The record indicates that Dr. Reehlman\u2019s practice brought him to court frequently to testify on behalf of his patients, often under subpoena. On the day of a previous setting of Mr. Hesler\u2019s case, he had been under four subpoenas, had cancelled the day\u2019s appointments, and had spent the day cooling his heels when all of these matters were cancelled, settled or continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-23\">Mr. Hesler\u2019s case was reset for trial on August 20, his attorney notifying Dr. Reehlman by letter of April 10. To this, Dr. Reehlman responded that it was too early to fix his schedule. Counsel wrote again on July 13, reminding Dr. Reehlman of the August 20 setting and advising him that he would be subpoenaed. To this, he did not reply. On August 8, he was served. A week later, on the Thursday before trial, Dr. Reehlman suddenly decided to take a Spanish vacation, leaving the next day without attempting to be excused from the subpoena. On Monday, after the jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>empanelled, it was discovered that Dr. Reehlman was gone. At the show cause hearing, he testified that because no one had called to schedule his testimony and because a call to counsel\u2019s office on Friday had not been returned, he assumed that the case had been settled or continued. The court held him in criminal contempt, fining him various sums designed to compensate Hesler, various counsel and the clerk for their lost time and expense and directing that he pay these amounts to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Appellant\u2019s first point comes to no more than a claim that the court was required to accept his explanation of how he came to disobey its lawful process in breach of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3). Criminal contempt is a crime. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>622 F.2d 830 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1127, 101 S.Ct. 946, 67 L.Ed.2d 114 (1981). As such, the requisite standard of proof is \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Certainly, on the evidence that we have sketched above, the court could have concluded with that degree of certainty that Dr. Reehlman decided simply to flout the court\u2019s order by departing on a spur-of-the-moment foreign trip at a time when he knew he was under subpoena without determining that he had been released.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">As for the claim that the aggregate fine imposed was excessive, we commence with the assumption that the proceeding was a criminal one, despite the secondary, remedial purpose of the order. <em>Thyssen, Inc. v. S/S Chuen On, </em>693 F.2d 1171, 1174 n. 4 (5th Cir.1982). Neither this circuit nor the Supreme Court has adopted any bright-line rule limiting fines in criminal contempt proceedings. <em>Muniz v. Hoffman, </em>422 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 2178, 45 L.Ed.2d 319 (1975) ($10,000 fine against union did not require jury trial). The fines imposed here were substantial, but so was the expense and inconvenience to which he deliberately put the parties for whose benefit, in part, the fines were levied. It is apparent from the record that the amounts fixed by the court represented its conscientious effort to make whole those whom Dr. Reehlman\u2019s willful act had injured. It will be an unusual case in which fines fixed in such a manner will be found excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
