Dollar Rent-A-Car Systems, Inc., </em>719 F.2d 806 (5th Cir.1983), we stated in response to the argument that a \u201cForm for Appearance of Counsel\u201d constituted the equivalent of a notice of appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">Nor can the Form for Appearance of Counsel be construed as the equivalent of notice of an independent appeal. [Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c) ] dictates that \u2018[t]he notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken.\u2019 The Form for Appearance of Counsel which it filed fails to indicate whether Dollar Rent-a-Car is appellant or appellee. It does not refer to the final order of the trial court which is the subject of the appeal. It is a standard form that signifies no more than a usual step to tell this court who sponsors the premature notice of appeal which Rule 4(a)(4) says \u2018shall have no effect.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">719 F.2d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The Appeal Information Sheet relied on by Eckels does not designate in any fashion what \u201cjudgment, order or part\u201d is appealed from. It is clear that Eckels\u2019 opponent and the court were on notice of the appeal in this case, but we are bound by the requirements of Rule 3(c) and <em>Van Wyk. </em>\u201cA liberal construction of the requirements of Rule [3(c) ] cannot be allowed to nullify the plain provision of Rule 4(a)(4) that a premature notice of appeal \u2018shall have no effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Wyk, </em>719 F.2d at 807. The petition for hearing is therefore DENIED. No member of the panel nor Judge in regular active service of this Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 35), the suggestion for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
