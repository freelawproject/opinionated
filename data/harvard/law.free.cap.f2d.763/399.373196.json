Appellees argue on rehearing that because appellant\u2019s constitutional claims were rejected by the Georgia State Board of Education, the federal full faith and credit statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738, precludes litigation of those claims in federal court under the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., </em>465 U.S. 75, 104 S.Ct. 892, 79 L.Ed.2d 56 (1984). We note that \u00a7 1738 applies only to the preclusive effect of \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d of state courts, <em>see McDonald v. City of West Branch, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 104 S.Ct. 1799, 1804, 80 L.Ed.2d 302, 306-07 (1984); <em>Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 466-72, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1889-93, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982), and, thus, would be inapplicable to proceedings in front of the Georgia State Board of Education. Nevertheless, the preclusive effect, in a 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 case, of state administrative proceedings, by analogy to \u00a7 1738, is a difficult and arguably open question in this circuit which may be subject to differing analyses depending on the character of the administrative proceeding and the type of claim being raised in the federal action. <em>Compare Gorin v. Osborne, </em>756 F.2d 834, 838 n. 5 (11th Cir.1985) (open question); <em>Griffen v. Big Spring Ind. Sch. Dist., </em>706 F.2d 645, 654 n. 4 (5th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 525, 78 L.Ed.2d 709 (1983), <em>with </em>the panel opinion in this case, <em>Holley v. Seminole County School District, </em>755 F.2d 1492, 1500-02 (11th Cir.1985) (citing numerous \u00a7 1983 and Title VII cases in which administrative hearings were not given preclusive effect and <em>de novo </em>review was had in federal court, perhaps because preclusion was not argued); <em>see also McDonald, </em>\u2014 U.S. at---, 104 S.Ct. at -, 80 L.Ed.2d at 307-10 (in case brought under \u00a7 1983, a federal court may not accord res judicata or collateral estoppel effect to unappealed decision in arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to collective bargaining agreement).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>since appellees did not brief or argue the applicability of \u00a7 1738 or any related doctrine of administrative preclusion in their briefs to this panel we will not entertain these thorny questions presented for the first time in appellees\u2019 petition for rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-16\">. Moreover, even if appellees\u2019 claim of administrative preclusion were otherwise viable, preclusion may have been unavailable in this case because the administrative tribunals failed to give appellant a \u201cfull and fair hearing\" on his First Amendment claim. As we noted in the panel opinion, an important part of appellant's First Amendment claim is that other similarly situated employees were not disciplined as he was, although they were \u201cguilty\u201d of similar misconduct, providing some inference that appellant\u2019s discharge was in retaliation against appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>lant\u2019s First Amendment protected activity. At appellant\u2019s hearing, the hearing examiner repeatedly refused to allow appellant to introduce evidence of unequal treatment. We held that on remand the district court was obligated to admit such evidence prior to submitting the First Amendment issue to the jury. <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Seminole County School District, </em>755 F.2d 1492, 1505 <em>&amp; </em>n. 17 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
