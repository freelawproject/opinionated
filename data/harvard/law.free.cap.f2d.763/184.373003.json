The motion also took the position that the plaintiff had no private right of action for a violation of section 11(c), and that any lawsuit in respect thereto could be brought only by the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The motion for summary judgment did not fix a \u201csubmission date.\u201d Under Rule 14B of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, where the suit was filed, the motion therefore was \u201cconsidered automatically set for submission on Monday next following the expiration of twenty (20) days from the date of filing of the motion, without notice from the Clerk.\u201d The same rule provides that responses to motions will be filed with the clerk no later than the submission day. Accordingly, the submission day for this motion was Monday, December 17, 1984. Plaintiff was on notice of this. <em>Hamman v. Southwestern Gas Pipeline, Inc., </em>721 F.2d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1983). No response was filed prior to January 2,1985. On the latter date, the district court entered an order reciting that \u201cDefendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment being meritorious and unopposed is GRANTED. An action such as this must be brought by the Secretary of Labor.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Also on January 2, 1985, the plaintiff filed a response to the motion for summary judgment in which he in effect admitted executing the January 27,1982 Department of Labor form settlement agreement, copy of which was attached to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and receiving the back wages called for thereby. The response does not deny that plaintiff\u2019s personnel records were cleared. Plaintiff also states in this response that he \u201chad the option of either accepting re-instatement with the company or accepting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>settlement as was.\u201d He states in effect that he declined reinstatement because he was afraid of his employer due to a knifing incident which had occurred in; December 1979.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">On January 18, 1985, plaintiff filed his notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s January 2, 1985 dismissal of pis suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">As subject matter jurisdiction here was asserted solely on a federal Question basis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and as the only law, treaty or provision of fhe Constitution of the United States under /which plaintiff\u2019s action is suggested to arise is section 11(c), we believe it appropriate to determine whether federal law creates a private right of action for a private employer\u2019s violation of section 11(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In the only case which has made a square holding on the matter, the Sixth Circuit ruled that there is no private cause of action for a retaliatory discharge contrary to section 11(c)(1). <em>Taylor v. Brighton Corp., </em>616 F.2d 256 (6th Cir.1980). The Second Circuit has also stated, although in what appears to be dicta, that there is no private right of action. <em>Donovan v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Commission, </em>713 F.2d 918, 926 (2d Cir.1983). <em>See also </em>this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Donovan v. Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers International Union, </em>718 F.2d 1341, 1348 n. 27 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2344, 80 L.Ed.2d 818 (1984) (quoting the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion). In <em>Donovan v. Square D Co., </em>709 F.2d 335, 338-39 (5th Cir.1983), we stated that \u201cthe government alone possesses the right to bring suit under Section 11(c). A private cause of action does not exist.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) However, this statement was made as a basis for this Court\u2019s holding in that case that state statutes of limitations do not apply to section 11(c) suits by the Secretary of Labor, and in a footnote to the above-quoted statement we further explained that we were not directly passing on whether a private person could bring such a section 11(c) suit, inasmuch as the case then before the Court was brought by the Secretary and not by the discharged employee. <em>Id. </em>at 339 n. 9. Accordingly, the courts which have spoken to the matter have said that there is no private cause of action under section 11(c). Although we have not directly ruled on the point, we have recognized the authority so stating, and have also based a holding concerning limitations on the assumption that there is no private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">The Sixth Circuit in <em>Taylor </em>thoroughly considered this question, the relevant Supreme Court decisions and the legislative history. We are persuaded by and are in general agreement with Taylor's analysis, which it would serve no good purpose to merely repeat here. We therefore hold that there is no private cause of action under federal law for a private employer\u2019s retaliatory discharge of an employee contrary to section 11(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">We note that <em>Taylor </em>relied heavily on <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979), in giving particular significance to section 11(c)(2)\u2019s express provision for employee complaints of retaliatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>discharge to be made to the Secretary of Labor and for the Secretary to bring suit against the employer if the Secretary finds a violation of section 11(c)(1). Since <em>Taylor, </em>this aspect of Transamerica\u2019s rationale was reaffirmed in <em>Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Association, </em>453 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 2623, 69 L.Ed.2d 435 (1981), where the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\u201cAs we stated in <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, supra, </em>\u2018it is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.\u2019 444 U.S., at 19, 100 S.Ct., at 247____ In the absence of strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent, we are compelled to conclude that Congress provided precisely the remedies it considered appropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">We recently quoted and applied the same language in <em>Tyler v. Mmes. Pasqua &amp; Toloso, </em>748 F.2d 283, 286 (5th Cir.1984). Moreover, a holding that a private cause of action does not exist is in harmony with the language and rationale of our <em>Square D Co. </em>opinion, while the contrary result would not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Accordingly, the district court having correctly dismissed the suit on the ground that the plaintiff had no private cause of action under federal law for his employer\u2019s retaliatory discharge in violation of section 11(c)(1), the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-16\">. Section 11(c) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEH\">\"(c)(1) No person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding or because of the exercise by such employee on behalf of himself or others of any right afforded by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ame\">\"(2) Any employee who believes that he has been discharged or otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of this subsection may, within thirty days after such violation occurs, file a complaint with the Secretary alleging such discrimination. Upon receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall cause such investigation to be made as he deems appropriate. If upon such investigation, the Secretary determines that the provisions of this subsection have been violated, he shall bring an action in any appropriate United States district court against such person. In any such action the United States district courts shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown to restrain violations of paragraph (1) of this subsection and order all appropriate relief including rehiring or reinstatement of the employee to his former position with back pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGJ\">\u201c(3) Within 90 days of the receipt of a complaint filed under this subsection the Secretary shall notify the complainant of his determination under paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-13\">. A separate judgment was also entered on the same day. The district court also had before it at that time the plaintiffs response to the defendant's original answer, which response had been filed on December 27, 1983, in which plaintiff referred to \"the OSHA settlement\u201d and \"the fact that I resigned as a result of an OSHA settlement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\">. Plaintiff states in this connection, \"Since I had pursued seeking retribution over the knifing incident, I certainly did not want to go back to work at the same company where the incident occurred,\" and \u201cI could not accept re-instatement at Aztec because of my pursuit of the knifing incident,\" and \"I could not accept re-in-statement after going to Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office about the knifing and also to the Houston City Council about it.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">On January 5, 1985, plaintiff filed with the court a document entitled \"Disclosure of Unusual Feature Pursuant to Local Rule Five.\u201d Local Rule 5 calls for parties to advise the clerk if a case is related to another pending case or is complex or otherwise unusual. In this particular disclosure, plaintiff made reference only to a previous suit he had filed \"against OSHA in regard to my signing the Aztec Settlement.\" He says that one of his contentions in that previous suit against OSHA was that the OSHA representative had told him in effect that he would have to sign the settlement or receive nothing. Plaintiff attached to this January 5, 1985 filing a copy of this Court\u2019s unpublished opinion of August 31, 1984 in its Causes Nos. 84-2282 and 84-2179, in which this Court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's previous suit against OSHA. 742 F.2d 1451 (5 Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
