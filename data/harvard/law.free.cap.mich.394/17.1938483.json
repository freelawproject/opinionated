Fitzgerald, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">Defendant, a physician in general practice, was charged with violation of \u00a7 7 of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, 1937 PA 343 as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in prescribing certain narcotic drugs by written prescription for certain persons known to him to be narcotics users and addicts, otherwise than in \"good faith and in the course of his professional practice\u201d. He was convicted by jury verdict. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Concluding that the jury was improperly instructed on the statutory meaning of \"good faith\u201d, we reverse and remand for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\n<em>Case History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Testimony at trial indicated that in August of 1966 two police officers on separate occasions informed defendant that his practice of prescribing significant quantities of narcotic drugs to known users and addicts violated both the standards of professional practice as set out by the American Medical Association and Federal law. On both occasions, defendant acknowledged that the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>scriptions to which the officers made reference had in fact been issued by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Defendant continued his practice of prescribing significant quantities of narcotic drugs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the first half of 1967 defendant prescribed narcotic drugs on numerous occasions to known addicts Mario Divita, Shirley Davies, Peter Giordino, Robert Krueger and Louis Nebulone.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The people introduced the testimony of expert witness Dr. Irvin Kurtz,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who testified that the ordinary physician <em>(i.e., </em>defendant) was not qualified to treat drug-dependent persons and that the treatment of drug-dependent persons \"is entirely relegated to specialized institutions or specialized physicians who are so designated, recognized and known\u201d. He indicated that maintenance of a drug dosage was permissible only for a number of days, and then only if other treatment was contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The testimony of Dr. Kurtz was contradicted by testimony of two defense expert witnesses. Dr. Elliott Luby<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> testified that there were enormous numbers of drug-dependent persons in the Detroit metropolitan area, that there were not nearly enough beds to take care of everyone and that it was not necessarily so that a physician who does not have the necessary psychiatric training should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>not treat the patient. He stated that a general practitioner might not be able to obtain admission of a drug-dependent person into a \"recognized\u201d facility and then he would be faced with a dilemma:</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\"So the doctor, recognizing the discomfort of both patient and his family, is faced with a moral dilemma. And this is essentially a moral dilemma: shall I do something for the patient and indeed face whatever problem might occur such as those which Dr. Downes [the defendant] is currently experiencing, or shall I tell the patient and his family to leave? I can\u2019t treat you. And place them really back in the community, providing them with no help whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\"It is a dilemma which many doctors face today. And, indeed, some of them handle it by refusing treatment completely. Others, by doing whatever they can for the patient in their own particular way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Dr. Luby was also asked whether it would be \"bad faith for a doctor to give a drug-dependent person a prescription for an amount of drugs which might last for a week or two\u201d. He answered \"No\u201d. The general thrust of Dr. Luby\u2019s testimony was to indicate that the defendant had issued the prescriptions not in bad faith but rather to manage drug dependence as best as it could be managed under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Dr. Thomas Sullivan,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who familiarized himself with defendant\u2019s treatment of the patients he was charged with improperly treating, testified that defendant\u2019s actions were \"directed toward a cure\u201d and added that he was not really maintaining the addicts on narcotics. The dosages of narcotics he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>gave were preparatory to withdrawal and therefore defendant\u2019s treatment was consonant with the standards set forth by the American Medical Association. Dr. Sullivan testified that the defendant \"could * * * honestly believe * * * in good faith and in sincerity that in accordance with his professional practice that the prescriptions he issued complied with good medical practice in this community for general practitioners\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Dr. George Downes, the defendant, testified on his own behalf, indicating that his actions in prescribing narcotics were taken in good faith in the course of his professional practice and directed toward a cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The case was submitted to the jury upon instructions and defendant\u2019s conviction resulted. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 49 Mich App 532; 212 NW2d 314 (1973). We granted leave to appeal. <em>People v Downes, </em>391 Mich 786 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">On appeal defendant raises seven issues. We will discuss only the two issues which we deem determinative of the outcome. These critical issues are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">(1) Is the \"good faith\u201d standard of \u00a7 7 of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, the statute under which defendant was charged and convicted, unconstitutionally vague, thereby violating defendant\u2019s right to due process under the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">(2) Did the trial court err in failing to clearly instruct the jury, as requested by defendant, that \"good faith in the course of his professional practice\u201d, as those terms were employed in \u00a7 7 of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, was \"good faith\u201d according to fair or reasonable medical standards <em>as understood by the defendant?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">Section 7 of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\"(1) A physician or a dentist, in <em>good faith </em>and in the course of his professional practice only, may prescribe, administer, and dispense narcotic drugs, or he may cause the same to be administered by a nurse or interne under his direction and supervision.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Section 20 of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\"Any person duly licensed under the preceding provisions of this act who violates any provision of this act shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 10 years or by a fine of not more than $10,000.00 or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Following conviction by jury under the first section for failure to prescribe narcotic drugs in good faith and in the course of his professional practice, defendant was sentenced to five years probation with payment of a fine of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Defendant contends that the term \"good faith\u201d as used in the statute is hopelessly vague and indefinite, pointing out that it is unclear whether the term as employed was intended to mean honesty in fact, a subjective standard, or \"good faith\u201d determined by evaluation of defendant\u2019s conduct in light of proper professional standards, an objective standard. Framed in this manner, defendant\u2019s contention directly relates to the discussion in part II of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">In support of this argument we are referred to numerous general authorities indicating that conviction under a vague criminal statute violates due process of law. A sampling of these references are here set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">\" 'That the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties, is a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law. And a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u2019 <em>Connally v General Construction Co, </em>269 U.S. 385, 391 (46 Sup. Ct. Rep. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322) [1926].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\" 'But, in order to constitute a crime, the act must be one which the party is able to know in advance whether it is criminal or not. The criminality of an act cannot depend upon whether a jury may think it reasonable or unreasonable. There must be some definiteness and certainty.\u2019 <em>Tozer v United States, </em>52 Fed. 917.\u201d <em>People v Austin, </em>301 Mich 456, 463-464; 3 NW2d 841 (1942).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">\"A criminal statute must be definite as to the persons within the scope of the statute and the acts which are penalized. If it is not definite, the due process clause of state constitutions and of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution, whichever is applicable, is violated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">\"If the statute is so vague and uncertain that a reasonable man would be compelled to speculate at his peril whether the statute permits or prohibits the act he contemplates committing, the statute is unconstitutional. The legislature, in the exercise of its power to declare what shall constitute a crime or punishable offense, must inform the citizen with reasonable precision what acts. it intends to prohibit, so that he may have a certain understandable rule of conduct. If on its face a criminal statute is repugnant to the due process clause, specifications of details of the offense intended to be charged will not serve to validate it, it being the statute and not the accusation under it that prescribes the rule to govern conduct and warns against transgression.\u201d 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7 18, p 32.'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Commentary mirroring the above may be found on many pages of our now-voluminous collection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Michigan Reports. On one such page the issue defendant raises prompted this Court to make the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\"A criminal statute ought to be so plain and unambiguous that 'he who runs\u2019 may read, and understand whether his conduct is in violation of its provisions.\u201d <em>People v Ellis, </em>204 Mich 157, 161; 169 NW 930 (1918).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We have no quarrel with the general proposition defendant sets forth. Such difficulties for defendant as here arise do so in application of the principle to the statutory language under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The Uniform Narcotic Drug Act for many years has been law in a substantial number of states. Although no case defining or treating \"good faith\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 7 of the uniform act has arisen in Michigan, courts in other jurisdictions have reviewed this precise language in the face of an argument that the language is unconstitutionally vague. In <em>Smith v State, </em>214 Ind 169; 13 NE2d 565 (1938), the Indiana Supreme Court rejected defendant\u2019s implicit contention that \"good faith\u201d language of the statute was vague, commenting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">\"[G]ood faith means 'good intentions and the honest exercise of his best judgment as to the need of [defendant doctor\u2019s] patient\u2019;\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">\"'Good faith\u2019 needs no definition other than that implied by the words themselves.\u201d 214 Ind 169, 174; 13 NE2d 562, 565.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">This contention was likewise rejected in <em>People v Guagliata, </em>362 Ill 427; 200 NE 169; 103 ALR 1035 (1936), with the Illinois Supreme Court concluding that \"good faith\u201d means \"honest, lawful intent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>and as used in the statute has \"a definite and well-understood meaning * * * free from ambiguity * * * \u201d. <em>Supra, </em>432.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\"Good faith\u201d as employed in a statute similar to that here considered (but not framed in the precise language of the uniform act) was found to have a \"well-defined and generally understood meaning\u201d and was determined to be inoffensive to constitutional due process by the California Supreme Court in <em>People v Nunn, </em>46 Cal 2d 460; 296 P2d 813 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">In resolving the question at hand we confront defendant\u2019s contention that \"good faith\u201d as used in the statute may import both a \"subjective\u201d and \"objective\u201d standard. We disagree with defendant\u2019s construction, concluding that \"good faith\u201d as used in this criminal statute necessarily imports a subjective standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\"Good faith\u201d consistently has been deemed a standard measuring the state of mind and perception of the defendant \u2014 a measure of honest belief and intention. See, <em>e.g., People v Averill, </em>179 Mich 224; 146 NW 189 (1914); and <em>People v Rice, </em>161 Mich 657; 126 NW 981 (1910). The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol 5, p 32, defines good faith as: \"honesty of intention in entering into engagements\u201d. Even the Uniform Commercial Code, operating in a commercial law context, defines \"good faith\u201d generally as \"honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned\u201d. MCLA 440.1201(19); MSA 19.1201(19).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The interjection of the modifying terms \"in the course of his professional prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tice\u201d into the statutory formulation does not change the obvious and clear import of \"good faith\u201d in the absence of express manifestation of legislative intention indicating such change. Moreover, to construe the statute as defendant would have us construe it would be to acknowledge that the statute may measure criminality by lack of conformity to professional standards which are not set forth in cognizable form in the statute itself. The source of such standards is unclear and, indeed, the standard of \"proper\u201d professional conduct is the subject of considerable dispute within the profession, as attested by the disparate medical expert testimony on this record. Such a construction would necessarily require a finding of unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Clear construction upholding the validity of a statute is to be favored over unconstitutional construction. <em>People v Babcock, </em>343 Mich 671; 73 NW2d 521 (1955); <em>People v Padgett, </em>306 Mich 545; 11 NW2d 235 (1943); and <em>People v Dubina, </em>304 Mich 363; 8 NW2d 99; 145 ALR 886 (1943). This observation but confirms our conclusion that the unmistakable import of \"good faith in the course of his professional practice\u201d as those terms are used in the statute is to focus on the state of mind of the defendant. We do not find the statutory prescription unconstitutionally vague. Accord: <em>Smith, supra, </em>and <em>Guagliata, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Pursuant to its theory the defense, prior to the court\u2019s rendering of instructions, tendered to the court a request to charge respecting the definition of good faith. The request appears to have been based upon certain language from <em>United States v Anthony, </em>15 F Supp 553 (SD Cal, 1936), indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>(at 559) that \"good faith\u201d meant that a physician in prescribing narcotics \"must act with honest belief, <em>based upon his medical knowledge, </em>that the case reasonably requires such treatment\u201d and that the appropriate standard was \"good faith according to fair or reasonable medical standards <em>as understood by him\u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Defendant\u2019s request was modified by the trial court and the jury was ultimately instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">\"Now the third element of this offense is that the defendant in the course of his professional practice dispensed or prescribed the narcotic drugs to patients not in good faith. Now, the principal element, then, with which you will be involved in fyour deliberation is the element of good faith or a lack of good faith. Did the defendant act in good faith or in bad faith in prescribing the narcotics to his patients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\"><em>\"Good faith means intention and an honest exercise of his, the physician\u2019s, best judgment as to the needs of the patient. </em>If you should find that the defendant made erroneous judgment in prescribing for his patients or that the results of his practice were not favorable, that would not alone be sufficient to convict him. You must find beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict the defendant that he acted improperly and in bad faith and not according to accepted medical standards for general practitioners in the prescribing of narcotic drugs to his patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\"Now, the law, of course, does not prohibit a physician from prescribing to an addict for self-administration or for the purpose of relieving conditions, mental or physical, which may be the product of addiction to narcotics or conditions \u2014 physical conditions or mental conditions caused by other factors such reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>amounts, one dose or a number of doses of narcotics, as fair medical standards recommend. In doing this, the physician must act with honest belief, <em>based upon accepted medical standards that the case of his patient reasonably requires such treatment. </em>A physician is not to be held accountable for mere error of judgment in such a case. Nor is he to be criminally responsible merely because the results are not as favorable as he expected or anticipated. The physician\u2019s responsibility is different. He will not <em>[sic] he </em>held criminally accountable under the law if he, not using his best medical judgment in determining that the patient is in need of treatment, issues prescriptions at the request of an addict merely to furnish such a supply of drugs as the addict desires, <em>or if he acts contrary to accepted medical standards for general practitioners.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">\"In determining whether a physician has acted in good faith in prescribing narcotics for a patient, you are to consider what the accepted opinion of the medical profession is upon that point. If reputable physicians honestly hold two opinions; some justifying the administration of narcotics in the manner and in the quantity shown to have been administered by Dr. Downes to the subjects named in the information, and the other is honestly opposed to that opinion, and if the defendant held honestly to the opinion shown to be that of one group of reputable medical practitioners and in good faith acted accordingly, he would not be guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">\"You have that question, of course, to decide. And you are required to make up your judgment on all of the evidence submitted to you on that point. Good faith on the part of the accused is an important element in the offense charged. <em>Good faith, according to reasonable medical standards. </em>That is, if you find that the defendant used good faith, then he would not be guilty. If you find in considering all of the evidence that he did not use good faith, that he acted in bad faith, then it would of course be your duty to convict him. But, of course, it is not simply bad judgment which is held to be criminal action. But bad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>At the close of instructions the following colloquy took place between counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><em>\"[The Court]: </em>Are there any misstatements or omissions to which you would want to call the court\u2019s attention, Mr. Mandlebaum [prosecuting attorney], Mr. Sherman [defense attorney], Mr. Barr [defense attorney]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\"(Separate record out of the presence of the jury.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\"><em>\"Mr. Sherman: </em>We do accept <em>[sic] </em>to your Honor\u2019s failure to give \u00f3ur request of charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\"><em>\"Mr. Barr: </em>In that you said upon accepted medical standards instead of upon his medical knowledge.

What the trial court here \"let go\u201d was an instruction which was a confusing blend of what we have in section I of this opinion termed \"objective\u201d and \"subjective\u201d conceptions of good faith. \"Good faith\u201d in \u00a77 of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, the statute under which defendant was charged, is subjective good faith looking to the state of mind and intentions of the defendant. See I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The trial court\u2019s instructions must be viewed in the context of what was in many respects a trial by expert testimony. Under these instructions defendant\u2019s conviction may have resulted because the jury, without regard for or focus upon defendant\u2019s state of mind, concluded that defendant\u2019s conduct did not measure up to professional standards. The following closing comments recently made by this Court in reversing and remanding for new trial on the ground of instructional error in <em>People v St Cyr, </em>392 Mich 605, 612; 221 NW2d 389 (1974), appropriately sum up the effect of instructional error in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\"Fair jury consideration of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence under the law was [by the instructional error complained of] rendered impossible. The result was a miscarriage of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">See, <em>e.g., People v Liggett, </em>378 Mich 706; 148 NW2d 784 (1967); MCLA 769.26; MSA 28.1096 and other authorities cited in <em>St Cyr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">In concluding, as we do, that the instructions given the jury in this case were fatally and, indeed, reversibly defective, we do not mean to suggest that expert testimony as to professional standards has no place in criminal proceedings involving a subjective good-faith standard. Objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tive indicia of good faith are necessary in a proceeding involving subjective good faith, for a defendant\u2019s state of mind will always be evidenced by objective indicia. The focus, however, must be upon objective indicia <em>as they pertain to defendant\u2019s animus. </em>It may be that evidence of professional standards, when measured against defendant\u2019s conduct, will, with considerable probative force, indicate that a particular state of mind motivated defendant. This is not to say, however, that guilt or innocence under a criminal statute such as that here involved may be determined alone by measurement of defendant\u2019s conduct against professional standards.

He was chief of surgery at Redford Community Hospital. While he did not treat drug-dependent persons during the regular course of his practice, he was a member and former past president of the State Board of Registration of Medicine which, on occasion, dealt with problems of the medical treatment of drug-dependent persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\"> Doctor Luby\u2019s qualifications indicated that since 1954 he was a physician specializing in psychiatry practicing at the Lafayette Clinic in Detroit, an institution which routinely treats drug-dependent persons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b109-10\"> Doctor Sullivan\u2019s qualifications indicated that he was a trained psychiatrist practicing since 1963 at the Lafayette Clinic and at the time held the title of head of Community Psychiatry, which involved control of drug abuse programs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b114-9\"> The Code departs from such general definition in Article 2 on sales, defining \"good faith\u201d in the case of a merchant to be \"honesty in fact <em>and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade\".
