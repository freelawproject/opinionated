Mr. Justice Holmes wrote: \"It is one of the misfortunes of the law that ideas become encysted in phrases and thereafter for a long time cease to provoke further analysis\u201d. <em>Hyde v United States, </em>225 US 347, 391; 32 S Ct 793; 56 L Ed 1114 (1912) (Holmes, J. dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>On such reexamination the rule stated in <em>Holland </em>will no longer be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The doctrine that commencement of an action within the time stipulated in a statute creating a right is an absolute precondition to its exercise developed as a rule of conflict of laws which impeded forum shopping for a favorable limitation <em>period. </em>The rule was extended to bar invocation of <em>saving </em>provisions which otherwise would enlarge the applicable limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The conditional-right doctrine developed in the context of the conflicts rule that the law of the place where the claim arose governed questions of substantive law while questions of procedural law were governed by the law of the forum. Statutes of limitations have generally been regarded as procedural in Anglo-American law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The analysis that time limitations for the maintenance of actions were procedural and governed by the law of the forum enabled English judges to keep claims which accrued in countries with relatively long statutes of limitations out of their courts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This analysis, however, facilitated forum shopping. A plaintiff time-barred in the jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>tion in which his claim accrued could maintain his action in another forum having a longer statute of limitations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The judicial response<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was to formulate exceptions to the general rule that the law of the forum governed choice of the controlling statute of limitations. Actions based on a foreign statute with its own special \"built-in\u201d statute of limitations could not be maintained in the forum state beyond the time permitted by the foreign statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">A substantive aspect was ascribed to the built-in limitation period.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It was no longer a procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>matter for the forum state, but rather a condition attached to the right by the enacting state. Most importantly, the condition traveled with the statutorily-created right into different jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Some commentators pierced the judicial gloss over this built-in/substantive development and attacked it as a specious \"means of escape from the harsh or absurd consequences of invariably applying the <em>lex fori\u201d, </em>\"turning upon the language rather than upon the sense of limitation acts\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Another said, \"it is difficult to see how mere physical incorporation or the fact that the limitation refers to a statutory cause of action affects the substantive or procedural character of limitations\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">This substantive treatment of built-in statutes of limitations was given impetus by the United States Supreme Court in the case of <em>The Harrisburg, </em>119 US 199, 214; 7 S Ct 140, 147; 30 L Ed 358, 362 (1886). An action for wrongful death resulting from negligent operation of a vessel off the coast of Massachusetts had been commenced as an in rem admiralty action in a United States District Court in Pennsylvania. Both the Pennsylvania and Massachusetts wrongful death statutes had a built-in limitation period of one year. The Court refused to allow the otherwise time-barred claim: \"[I]f the admiralty adopts the statute as a rule of right to be administered within its own jurisdiction, it must take the right subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>limitations which have been made a part of its existence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In oft-quoted language, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\"The statutes create a new legal liability, with the right to a suit for its enforcement, provided the suit is brought within twelve months, and not otherwise. The time within which the suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created, and not of the remedy alone. It is a condition attached to the right to sue at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\"Time has been made of the essence of the right, and the right is lost if the time is disregarded. The liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are, therefore, to be treated as limitations of the right.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">This analysis surfaced in Michigan jurisprudence in <em>Bement v Grand Rapids &amp; I R Co, </em>194 Mich 64, 65, 68; 160 NW 424 (1916). The question was whether a defendant was estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense to an action under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. The FELA, creating a liability unknown at common law, had a built-in limitation period of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">This Court declared that the FELA \"creates a new liability, and takes away defenses formerly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>available, and the right of action therein created is conditioned upon its enforcement within a prescribed period\u201d. Preliminarily to that statement, the Court said \"the statute in question being a Federal statute, we should be governed in its construction by the decisions of the Federal courts\u201d, which, based on <em>The </em>Harrisburg; had already adopted the conditional right analysis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The conditional right analysis thus became a part of Michigan jurisprudence without independent evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In <em>Bigelow v Otis, </em>267 Mich 409, 412; 255 NW 270 (1934), this Court, extrapolating from <em>Bement, supra, </em>held without further discussion that \"[t]he general statute of limitations (3 Comp Laws 1929, \u00a7 13976) and the saving provisions therein have no application to a cause of action created by statute and conditioned on time therein expressed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">By the time of <em>Holland v Eaton, supra, </em>the \"rule\u201d of <em>Bement, supra, </em>and <em>Bigelow, supra, </em>was so well established that the plaintiffs conceded that general saving provisions did not affect the tolling of a limitational period which is built into a statute creating the remedy and focused their efforts on an attempt to distinguish their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The enactment in this century of borrowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>statutes by over three-fourths of the states<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> has eliminated the need for judicial resort to the built-in test and other permutations<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to correct perceived anomalies and inequities resulting from the conflicts rule categorizing limitation periods as procedural. The Michigan borrowing statute provides that the shorter of the limitation periods of the place where the claim accrued or of the forum governs.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In states which have enacted borrowing statutes, the vestiges of the built-in test, which prevented application of the forum\u2019s statute of limitations to foreign causes of action, now, anomalously, serve primarily, if not only, to bar maintenance of domestic causes of action in domestic courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The conceptualization of limitation periods as substantive and procedural, developed in the context of conflict of laws, was extended with inadequate or no analysis to domestic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The sweeping, all-encompassing language of cases such as <em>The Harrisburg </em>prompted state courts to apply the substantive-procedural analysis even to actions domestically created and enforced. The substantive analysis, ascribing to statutory causes of action \"conditional\u201d limitation periods, transcended its conflict of laws origin and justification and became a general law principle. The absolute nature ascribed to such limitations when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>foreign statutes were sought to be enforced in other jurisdictions was similarly read into domestic statutes sought to be enforced domestically. The \"indispensable condition\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of these time limitations was extended to exempt all such limitation periods, domestic as well as foreign, from the general saving provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Whether domestic statutes of limitations should govern enforcement of a right created by a foreign statute is manifestly a different question than whether general saving provisions of the forum extend the time for commencing an action to enforce a statutorily created right, especially a right created by the legislature of the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">As noted by one commentator: \"Although the reasons for postponing the [limitation] period may be equally strong in this instance [of built-in limitations], the rule is nevertheless followed without attempt at reasoned justification\u201d. In fact, if anything, \"at least when a state legislature creates a new right including its own limitation, there appears no general intent to reject the usual exceptions. Where the limitation in question does not indicate that the legislative intent would be frustrated by the application of the particular statutory exception concerned, postponement or suspension of the period would probably further the general purpose of the legislature\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">While conditional right analysis requires that statutory actions be commenced within any built-in time limitations unenlarged by general saving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>provisions, the question is one of legislative policy and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The intentions of at least two different legislatures are at issue. Conditional right analysis ascribed an absolutist intent to the foreign legislature which enacted the right sought to be enforced domestically. There is no need to ascribe a like intent to the domestic legislature regarding the application of domestic saving provisions to domestic enforcement of domestic statutory actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">There is scant reason to ascribe to a legislature an intent to distinguish between common-law and statutory causes of action in the application of saving provisions. This is especially without warrant in the application of domestic saving provisions to domestic statutory causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The need and desirability for saving in one case are the same as in the other. Infants or insane persons are under the same disability whether their actions be common-law or statutory; the defendant in one case is generally in no greater need than the defendant in, the other of protection from delay in commencement of the action. We are unable to distinguish the two cases or to ascribe to the Legislature such an intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">There is no basis for indulging the assumption that the Legislature, aware of our former decisions, adopted the conditional right analysis. <em>Bigelow v Otis, supra, </em>the first case to apply this analysis to saving provisions, was decided in 1916, after the enactment of the Judicature Act of 1915. The language of the saving provisions was, as previously indicated, changed in 1961 to cover \"any action\u201d when the Revised Judicature Act was adopted. <em>Holland, </em>although decided in 1964, arose under the 1915 Act. This is the first consideration by this Court of this question in terms of the saving provisions of the Revised Judicature Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>We hold that the general saving provisions of the Revised Judicature Act apply to causes of action created by Michigan statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Reversed and remanded for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-7\">T.
