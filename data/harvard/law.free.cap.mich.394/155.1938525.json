There is no need in this case to address the instructional issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Witnesses testified that shortly before 7:30 p.m. they saw a Volkswagen and a silver gray \"Firebird or a Camaro\u201d parked together alongside the Pleasant Valley Road exit ramp of westbound 1-96. The Volkswagen, which was driven by the deceased, a young woman, and the silver gray automobile driven by a young man wearing a T-shirt and Levis, drove up the ramp, turned right and pulled immediately into a parking area adjacent to the exit ramp on Pleasant Valley Road. The fatal assault occurred in the parking area.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">By 7:30 p.m. the deceased, although fatally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>wounded, had driven to a friend\u2019s house approximately three-tenths of a mile from the parking area. She died within the hour of \"hemorrhage related to multiple lacerations and stab wounds\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The question at trial was whether Hoffmeister, who owned a silver gray Firebird, was the person who killed the deceased. The description given by several witnesses of the man seen with the deceased on the exit ramp and in the parking area resembled Hoffmeister. One witness identified Hoffmeister in response to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry whether \"anyone in the courtroom * * * appears to look like this man\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Physical evidence corroborated Hoffmeister\u2019s guilt. His fingerprints were found on decedent\u2019s Volkswagen near the engine. Tire tracks in the parking area were identified as made by Hoffmeister\u2019s car and blood of the same type as decedent\u2019s was found near those tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The Penal Code defines first-degree murder as \"wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while second-degree murder is defined residually as ,\"[a]ll other kinds of murder\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This \"legislative classification of murder into two degrees would be meaningless if 'deliberation\u2019 and 'premeditation\u2019 were construed as requiring no more reflection than may be involved in the mere formation of a specific intent to kill\u201d. <em>People v Anderson, </em>70 Cal 2d 15, 26; 447 P2d 942, 948; 73 Cal Rptr 550, 556 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The additional elements of premeditation and deliberation need not be established by direct evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>dence. The requisite state of mind may be inferred from defendant\u2019s conduct judged in light of the circumstances. Such an inference, however, must have adequate basis in record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Hoffmeister moved for a directed verdict, arguing that \"there is no evidence from any witness that [Hoffmeister] did form or did any act with premeditation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The prosecutor responded that \"the nature of the wounds, [and] the number of wounds\u201d inflicted on the deceased together with his \"several moments with\u201d her were sufficient facts from which the jury could reasonably infer premeditation and deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The brutality of a killing does not itself justify an inference of premeditation and deliberation. \"The mere fact that the killing was attended by much violence or that a great many wounds were inflicted is not relevant [on the issue of premeditation and deliberation], as such a killing is just as likely (or perhaps more likely) to have been on impulse.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">There is no basis on this record for an inference that between the successive, potentially lethal blows the killer calmly, in a cool state of mind, \"measure[d] and evaluate[d]\u201d and subjected \"the nature of his response to a 'second look\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\"It is well established that the brutality of a killing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>cannot in itself support a finding that the killer acted with premeditation and deliberation.\u201d <em>People v Anderson, supra, </em>p 24.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\" * * * [M]any murders most brutish and bestial are committed in a consuming frenzy or heat of passion, and that these are in law only murder in the second degree. The Government\u2019s evidence sufficed to establish an intentional and horrible murder \u2014 the kind that could be committed in a frenzy or heat of passion. However the core responsibility of the court requires it to reflect on the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\"The violence and multiple wounds, while more than ample to show an intent to kill, cannot standing alone support an inference of a calmly calculated plan to kill requisite for premeditation and deliberation, as contrasted with an impulsive and senseless, albeit sustained, frenzy.\u201d <em>Austin v United States, </em>127 US App DC 180, 190; 382 F2d 129, 139 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">While the murder weapon was never found, it appears to have been a knife. The use of a lethal weapon is supportive of a finding of second-degree murder. But alone it is not sufficient to support a conviction of first-degree murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\" 'The use of a lethal weapon is not in itself sufficient evidence to warrant a verdict of murder in the first degree but in addition to this there must be evidence in the case, as to circumstances surrounding the killing or the manner in which the weapon is used, from which a logical inference may be drawn that there was willfulness, deliberation and premeditation.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Vinunzo, </em>212 Mich 472, 475; 180 NW 502 (1920).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>No motive for the crime was shown. It was not suggested that Hoffmeister and decedent had met before and there was no evidence that he had a larcenous or sexual purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Some time span between initial homicidal intent and ultimate action is necessary to establish premeditation and deliberation. The testimony that Hoffmeister and decedent were together for a short period of time leaves open the possibility of premeditation and deliberation. There is no basis, however, on this record for concluding that adequate time for reflection, for a \"second look\u201d, intervened between formation of the homicidal intent and commission of the crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\"That there was a half-hour period (4:30 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.) during which appellant had ample time to premeditate and deliberate is not evidence that appellant actually did cogitate and mull over the intent to kill.\u201d <em>Austin v United States, supra, </em>p 190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">That the two cars were moved the short distance from the exit ramp to the parking area does not establish, as suggested by the prosecutor, that Hoffmeister guided the deceased \"to a more secluded spot\u201d as part of a preformulated plan to kill her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">We reduce the degree of Hoffmeister\u2019s murder conviction to second degree and remand for entry of a modified judgment of conviction and resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The evidence was sufficient to establish second-degree murder. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude, as it necessarily did when it found Hoffmeister guilty of first-degree murder, that he intentionally killed the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">It is proper to remand for entry of a judgment of conviction of the lesser included offense where the jury has returned a verdict of guilty of the higher charged offense upon evidence sufficient only to prove the lesser offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Where the defendant is convicted of the higher charged offense, it is apparent that the verdict was not the product of compromise.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction of second-degree murder and resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>T.

Even if the court did err by failing to so instruct the jury, in this case the proper remedy would be reduction of the degree of the conviction. The elements of second-degree murder were proven. A jury which returns a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree necessarily finds that the lesser included offense of second-degree murder was committed (see part III, <em>infra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\">MCLA 750.316; MSA 28.548.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Aio\"> MCLA 750.317; MSA 28.549.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law, \u00a7 73, p 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">It is not claimed that the evidence would permit a finding that the wounds were inflicted over such a period of time that there was an intervening period for premeditative reflection by the assailant.
