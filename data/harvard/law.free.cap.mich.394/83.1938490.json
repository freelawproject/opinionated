For each 20 sold, they received 2 tickets as compensation. Although each would put his name on one of the tickets, Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>claims they agreed that the tickets were jointly owned and all winnings would be divided equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">A ticket bearing Radikopfs name won and yielded in excess of $487,000. After Radikopf refused to surrender any of the proceeds, Miller commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The trial court, stating that the alleged agreement was \"spawned in violation of statute\u201d, granted Radikopf a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The Court of Appeals, referring to \u00a7 372 of the Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which prohibits the \"set[ting] up or promotion of a] lottery\u201d, affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">\"It is true that receiving a lottery award voluntarily paid, is not prohibited. <em>People v Watson, </em>75 Mich 582; 42 NW 1005 (1889). The general policy of this state against the holding of lotteries, MCLA 750.372 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 28.604 <em>et seq., </em>would be seriously compromised, however, if lottery winners were allowed to successfully bring suit for their prizes. Although the Court will not interfere where a lottery prize is voluntarily given the winner, public policy demands that courts not give support to the maintenance of lotteries in this state by allowing prize winners judicial process to collect their winnings.\u201d <em>Miller v Radikopf, </em>51 Mich App 393, 395; 214 NW2d 897 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">This is not, however, an action to collect prize winnings from a lottery promoter.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">The narrow question to be decided is whether a contractual claim to a share of money legally paid by the Irish Sweepstakes and legally possessed by the defendant may be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">We would hold that the public policy of this state does not preclude Miller from attempting to enforce his claim and, accordingly, would reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>It is a crime to \"set up or promote\u201d a lottery in this state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is similarly a crime for a person to \"sell\u201d, \"offer for sale\u201d, or \"have in his possession with intent to sell or offer for sale\u201d lottery tickets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">However, it does not appear that Irish law prohibits the payment of money to holders of winning sweepstakes tickets. Nor does any statute or rule of law of this state prohibit the holder of a winning ticket from receiving and retaining proceeds paid voluntarily by a lottery without legal action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Th\u00e9re being no statute barring enforcement of the claim asserted in this case, the question whether its enforcement would be in accord with public policy is for judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">There were several contracts preceding the contract sued upon. Miller and Radikopf agreed to sell sweepstakes tickets and to accept as consideration \"free\u201d tickets. Each ticket so received by them was a separate contract binding the lottery promoters to pay the holder of a winning ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">As neither Miller nor Radikopf is presently attempting to enforce the antecedent contracts, their possible illegality and attendant public policy ramifications need not concern us. Whatever their legality, those contractual obligations were fulfilled. A different question would be presented if Miller or Radikopf sought by legal action to collect either their compensation for selling tickets or lottery winnings directly from the promoters of the sweepstakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Miller in this action seeks to enforce the agreement he claims was made by him and Radikopf \"that should either of the tickets win any prize, the prize would be split equally between the two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>them\u201d. The consideration exchanged by each was a promise to the other to pay one-half of any proceeds won on tickets held in his name. Since receipt and retention of sweepstakes winnings voluntarily paid by the Irish promoter violates no Irish or Michigan statute or rule of law, a promise to share amounts so received constitutes legal consideration. A contract based on the exchange of legal consideration is a legal contract and its enforcement does not violate public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Agreements to share possible proceeds from Irish Sweepstakes tickets are not an \"essential part\u201d of the sale and distribution of those tickets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The continued success of the Irish Sweepstakes in this state is in no way dependent on the enforceability of agreements to share winnings. Miller\u2019s and Radikopf s collateral agreement to divide their prospective winnings was not an essential part of their sale and distribution of those tickets. Nor was their agreement dependent on illegal conduct in the acquisition of the lottery tickets; they might have acquired the tickets in a manner free of any suggestion of illegality and then entered into an agreement to share proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">However this case is decided, the courts of this state will continue to refuse to entertain actions seeking an accounting of proceeds obtained from illegal enterprises such as the illegal sale of narcotics and bank robberies. Additionally, enforcement or an accounting will be denied, without regard to whether the proceeds sought to be divided have been legally obtained, if the consideration offered is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Judicial nonenforcement of agreements deemed against public policy is considered a deterrent for those who might otherwise become involved in such transactions. While nonenforcement of Miller\u2019s claim might tend to discourage people from agreeing to split their legal winnings, nonenforcement would not tend to discourage people from buying or selling Irish Sweepstakes tickets. Both Miller and Radikopf have been compensated for selling the tickets and Radikopf has received the winnings as the holder of a particular ticket. No interest of the state would be furthered by nonenforcement of Miller\u2019s claim that he is the owner of one-half of those legal winnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">It is consonant with the public policy of this state to encourage performance of legal contracts and to foster the just resolution of disputes. Non-enforcement of the agreement claimed by Miller would not tend to discourage the sale of Irish Sweepstakes tickets. It could reward, without any corresponding benefit, promissory default. We conclude that public policy would not be offended by enforcement of the claimed agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>We would reverse and remand for trial with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-4\">T. G. Kavanagh, C. J., and Swainson and Williams, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b178-5\">M. S. Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoZ\"><em>(to affirm). </em>Through no moral recoil or illusion of piety, but as a matter of law, I am compelled to dissent from my colleagues\u2019 decision. It is true that the Irish Sweepstakes lottery is well operated and legal at its source. It is also true that it is illegal to sell the tickets in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The statement of the controlling question by the majority is not as I see it. To me, it is whether a contract to share remuneration for an illegal act is judicially enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In December 1970 plaintiif and defendant began on a regular basis to participate in the sale of Irish Sweepstakes tickets. For every 20 tickets they sold, they received two free tickets. Each would place his name upon one. Plaintiif alleges\u2014 and defendant <em>denies </em>\u2014 an oral agreement between them that the free tickets were to be jointly owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and that all prizes won by either would be divided equally. In June 1972 defendant, a super prize winner, won approximately $487,000. Plaintiff requests that a constructive trust be impressed upon half that amount. The lower court found the alleged contract illegal and granted defendant summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">I also would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Plaintiff submits that there is no law against the ownership of an Irish Sweepstakes ticket. He admits \u2014 and correctly so \u2014 that MCLA 750.372; MSA 28.604 and MCLA 750.373; MSA 28.605 forbid the setting up, promoting and selling of lottery tickets. However, he finds those statutes of little consequence. He bases his claim upon his one-half interest in the winning ticket. He requests this Court to impose a constructive trust upon half the winnings paid to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Unlike the plaintiff, I do not find the statutes insignificant. They make unlawful the activity engaged in by these parties and enunciate state policy. When an agreement to share concerns the proceeds of illegal activity, the Court should not be available to enforce the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The Court in <em>Dettloff v Hammond, Standish &amp; Co, </em>195 Mich 117, 136; 161 NW 949 (1917), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\"A contract is void if it contemplates acts that are illegal, or contrary to public policy. <em>Drake v Lauer, </em>182 N.Y. 533 [75 NE 1129 (1905)] ([aff'g] 93 App. Div. 86, 75 N.E. 1129). A contract which in its execution contravenes the policy and spirit of a statute is equally void as if made against its positive provisions. <em>Hunt v Knickerbacker, </em>5 Johns. (N.Y.) 327 [1810]; <em>Wetmore v Brien, </em>3 Head (40 Tenn.), 723 [1859].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The Court of Appeals was correct when it stated that beneficiaries of illegal schemes should not be heard to complain that they did not receive their contemplated rewards. Here the plaintiff illegally sold Irish Sweepstakes tickets. He cannot be heard to complain that the consideration he sought from his illegal activities failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Plaintiff relies strongly upon <em>Manning v Bishop of Marquette, </em>345 Mich 130; 76 NW2d 75 (1956). Mrs. Manning, after a bingo game, had stepped into a hole in the church parking lot. She sued the bishop. In allowing her suit, the Court observed that \"even a rogue may have a cause of action\u201d, but the Court continued to say that it did not lend its aid \"to the furtherance of an unlawful project\u201d, nor would the Court \"decide, as between 2 scoundrels, who cheated whom the more\u201d. The Court noted that Mrs. Manning (neither a rogue nor a scoundrel so far as we know) had ceased her illegal activity and was on her way home when she was injured. It found that there was not a substantial causal relationship between Mrs. Manning\u2019s prior bingo game and her fall in the parking lot. The bingo game was a \"remote link in the chain of causation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Such is not the case here where the unlawful act was the source of the asserted \"right\u201d. The prize was an integral part of the illegal sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">I would follow <em>Kukla,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>agreeing that \"public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>policy will not permit a party to enforce a promise which he has obtained by an illegal act\u201d. Like the <em>Cook </em>court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would \"leave the parties where they have placed themselves\u201d and hold that neither law nor equity will grant relief to violators of the law who seek to benefit as a result of their own violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Plaintiff also contends that the Lottery Act, 1972 PA 239; MCLA 432.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 18.969(1) <em>et seq. </em>establishing a state operated lottery evinces a public policy in favor of lotteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">1 disagree. Section 37 of that act, MCLA 432.37; MSA 18.969(37), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">\"Any other law providing any penalty or disability for the sale of lottery tickets or any acts done in connection with a lottery shall not apply to the sale of tickets or shares performed pursuant to this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The Legislature authorized only one type of lottery: a lottery run by the State of Michigan. All other lotteries remain illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Court in <em>Lieberthal v Glen Falls Indemnity Co of Glen Falls New York, </em>316 Mich 37, 40; 24 NW2d 547 (1946), unequivocally said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\"Public policy of a State is fixed by its Constitution, its statutory law, and the decisions of its courts; and when the legislature enacts a law within the limits of the Constitution, the enactment insofar as it bears upon the matter of public policy, is conclusive. See <em>In re McKee\u2019s Estate, </em>71 N.D. 545 (3 N.W. [2d] 797) [1942], wherein, quoting from an earlier case, it is said: 'Public policy is but the manifest will of the State. * * * And when the legislature has spoken and enacted a law embodying a certain principle, the policy is determined.\u2019 Michigan\u2019s public policy touching the phase of the law under consideration has been definitely fixed by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Likewise, Michigan\u2019s public policy with respect to lotteries has been fixed by statute and that policy against lotteries other than those conducted by the state has been recently reaffirmed with the enactment of the Lottery Act of 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Plaintiff presents several public policy arguments<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with which we are sympathetic. Nevertheless, these arguments are more appropriately addressed to the Legislature rather than to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">We do not sit to pass judgment on the sagacity of the Legislature. The statutes have been promulgated and public policy thereby established. I re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>spectfully acknowledge the legislative authority to establish such policy. To hold, in the face of the lottery statutes, that public policy dictates the relief sought by plaintiff would be to usurp that authority. I would not superimpose our judgment upon that of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">If his story is true, I sympathize with plaintiff, but believe that the possible damage to the state of the law outweighs any inclination to bend it to accommodate either an individual or my personal inclinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">If the Legislature wishes to recognize th\u00e9 Irish Sweepstakes as a lawful lottery, it may do so. Until then, the courts of this state should be unavailable to enforce an agreement to divide the proceeds of a ticket obtained in remuneration for illegally selling Irish Sweepstakes tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-9\">J. W. Fitzgerald, J., and the late Justice T. M. Kavanagh took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-13\">MCLA 750.372, <em>etseq.;UBK </em>28.604, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-9\"> MCLA 750.372; MSA 28.604.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-10\"> MCLA 750.373; MSA 28.605.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b175-11\"><em> See People v Watson, </em>75 Mich 582, 586; 42 NW 1005 (1889); 38 Am Jur 2d, Gambling, \u00a7 59, p 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\"> In <em>Kukla v Perry, </em>361 Mich 311, 324-325; 105 NW2d 176 (1960), the illegal aspect of the contractual relationship was an \"essential part\u201d of the agreement sought to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\"><em>See, generally, </em>6A Corbin on Contracts, part 8, ch 90, \u00a7 1529, pp 784-794.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"> The New York Court of Appeals in <em>Intercontinental Hotels Corp v Golden, </em>15 NY2d 9, 14-15; 203 NE2d 210, 212-213; 254 NYS2d 527, 530-531 (1964), declined to determine public policy \"by mere reference to the laws\u201d of New York: \"Strong public policy is found in prevailing social and moral attitudes of the community\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">In holding enforceable in New York a gambling debt incurred in Puerto Rico where gambling was legal and judicially enforceable, the Court was motivated in part by \"the changing attitudes of the People of the State of New York\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\"The legalization of pari-mutuel betting and the operation of bingo games, as well as a strong movement for legalized off-track betting, indicate that the New York public does not consider authorized gambling a violation of 'some prevalent conception of good morals, [or] some deep-rooted tradition of the common weal.\u2019 <em>(Loucks v Standard Oil Co </em>[224 NY 99, 111; 120 NE 198, 202 (1918)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\"The trend in New York State demonstrates an acceptance of <em>licensed </em>gambling transactions as a morally acceptable activity, not objectionable under the prevailing standards of lawful and approved social conduct in a community.
