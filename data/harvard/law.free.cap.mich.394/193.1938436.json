J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADp\">On September 28, 1970, an employee of a Flint baking company reported to the police that a van was illegally parked in the company\u2019s parking lot. The police came to investigate and found the defendant\u2019s wallet in the van as well as a palm print later shown to be that of the defendant. At the trial the baking company employee identified the defendant as the man he had observed in the van going through a lady\u2019s purse subsequently identified as belonging to Sally Ann Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">Sally Ann Wright\u2019s body was found in the Flint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>River near a site described by defendant to his mother. This site was some distance from the place where the van had been parked. It was established that Sally Ann Wright had been driving the van on the day of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Defendant\u2019s mother testified that on the day of the crime her son came home and told her that he had raped and killed a woman and that he had thrown the body in the river and that he had left the van in the baking company\u2019s parking lot. She testified that the defendant asked her to help find his wallet which he had lost. After riding past the lot where the van had been abandoned and finding the police already there, defendant asked his mother to drive to the site where the body had been thrown into the river in the hope that he could recover his wallet there. Defendant\u2019s mother persuaded him to see their family attorney and then took him to a psychiatric clinic where defendant had been undergoing preliminary interviewing and testing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Through arrangements made by defendant\u2019s mother, defendant was met and arrested by police at the psychiatric clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">At the beginning of the trial defendant and his appointed attorney, William J. Hayes, had some disagreement over the fact that defendant wanted to waive a jury and attorney Hayes did not. Defendant requested different counsel, additionally complaining that he had been in jail approximately 109 days and had not seen his attorney until just a few minutes prior to trial. Attorney Hayes explained that he had not visited defendant because he had prepared his insanity defense by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>having weekly meetings with defendant\u2019s mother. After a recess, the court convened again and the defendant executed a written waiver of jury trial and the court denied defense counsel\u2019s request to withdraw since the event precipitating the dissatisfaction was no longer operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The next day defendant again expressed his displeasure with appointed counsel. The court abided by its earlier ruling denying defendant\u2019s request that appointed counsel be withdrawn. However, as the trial progressed, defendant expressed his complete satisfaction with Mr. Hayes.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The trial proceeded without incident until the conclusion of the plaintiffs proofs. At that time the defense began to establish a new theory of defense. This theory, as it later developed, was that the victim\u2019s husband, a probation officer, for a monetary consideration and a promise to effect a deal whereby defendant Strodder would receive no more than a four-year sentence for the rape charge for which he was awaiting trial and this crime, induced defendant Strodder to assume responsibility for this murder and leave sufficient identification about (print and wallet) whereby he would be apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Defense attorney Hayes dramatically called the victim\u2019s husband to the stand and accused him of murdering his wife. Mr. Hayes then demanded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">\"The procedures are unimportant. I am asking that the whole record in this case be impounded, that no further prosecutions go on in this county, that this court and the prosecutor of this county be immediately suspended from office, and that Mr. Mandric Strodder immediately be set free. He is completely, absolutely innocent of this charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Mr. Hayes continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\"He\u2019s willing to live in this society as a free man if the people of the State of Michigan are willing to pick up his expenses for the rest of his natural life. Is that right Mr. Strodder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\"><em>\"The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">When the trial court refused to accede to these requests, defense attorney and defendant refused to have anything to do with the proceedings and the court adjourned. The next day, June 29, 1971, the court appointed Mr. Ivor Jones co-counsel for defendant Strodder, at the same time indicating that the court would entertain a motion for mistrial. Defendant said that he wanted Mr. Hayes to continue as his attorney and after the judge expressed his doubts about Mr. Hayes\u2019s sanity stated that he did not think it necessary that Mr. Hayes submit to psychiatric examination. The court agreed to adjourn the trial for a week in order to give attorney Jones a chance to familiarize himself with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The court arranged to have a psychiatrist observe defense counsel at trial. The psychiatrist testified that in his opinion defense counsel was able to perform his duty. The court later read into the record a letter from attorney Hayes\u2019s personal physician indicating, \"No unusual psychiatric manifestations were noted by me. He has attended my office regularly and continues to show steady improvement\u201d. The last comment referred to a physical condition for which Mr. Hayes was being treated.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Throughout the balance of the trial, defense counsel was incredibly abusive to the trial judge, the prosecutor, and other public officials, but the trial judge said that he believed he could freely try the facts and issues without prejudice to either side. Defense counsel Hayes, at the conclusion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the trial, apologized for his attacks on the judge and expressed his confidence that the judge would make an honest decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The trial judge, exhibiting unusual patience, repeatedly offered defendant the opportunity to move for mistrial, all of which were declined by defendant and his attorney, indicating a complete willingness to proceed to judgment with Judge Elliott.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The judge found the defendant guilty and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">We have carefully considered each of the matters urged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">They were all considered by the Court of Appeals, and without expressly approving that Court\u2019s treatment of the various issues, we are not disposed to say their holdings were erroneous in any particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Nonetheless from our examination of the entire record we are left with the abiding conviction that the procedure followed here did not accord the defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">For this reason, without impugning the ability, integrity or good will of the prosecutor, trial judge or Court of Appeals we reverse the conviction and order a new trial, pursuant to GCR 1963, 865.1(7).</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-12\">Levin, J., concurred with T. G. Kavanagh, C. J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b288-13\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmS\"><em>(to reverse). </em>The issue in this first-degree murder case is whether defendant was deprived of a fair trial because of ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel failed to see his client during the 109 days preceding trial, failed to interview or call probably important witnesses, failed to perfect an available insanity defense, concocted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>irrational defense, and conducted himself in a bizarre if not contemptuous manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">This opinion would reverse because of ineffective counsel for failure of adequate competence and adequate diligence to assure a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">I \u2014Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The facts of the instant case indicate the trial judge exhibited unusual patience and heroically attempted to try the facts and issues without prejudice to either side in the midst of a series of amazing attacks on his credibility and honesty. On the other hand, defense counsel abruptly changed course in midstream, and instead of presenting a planned insanity defense, dramatically attempted to pin the crime on the victim\u2019s husband, during the course of which he was irrational and abusive of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Defendant Strodder, who was undergoing psychiatric interviewing and testing pending his trial on a rape charge, was arrested and charged with raping and killing another woman in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Strodder was represented by appointed counsel William Hayes during a competency hearing, the preliminary examination and trial. Hayes filed notice of his intention to use the defense of insanity and indicated he would use only one witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Almost as soon as trial began, defendant objected that he was not prepared as he had not seen his attorney during the approximately 109 days preceding the opening of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Counsel contended he had been having weekly conferences with defendant\u2019s mother concerning the case, and had used that information to prepare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the insanity defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counsel also noted that defendant had made no request to see him at the preliminary examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">However, later on at trial, Hayes admitted that he had not seen his client because he was afraid of him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">\"I bought the program, and I bought the theory that Strodder\u2019s nuts. In fact, being perfectly candid with you, I was scared stiff every time Strodder talked to me about anything. I figured maybe the guy was going to go off his tree, and with his propensities who knows what he might do. You\u2019ll notice he has a fond eye for Mr. Black, though.\u201d (Mr. Black was the prosecutor.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Still later, he also admitted that the lack of contact may have adversely affected his client\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">\"No, probably Strodder could have beaten the rap, and I suggest to you that I\u2019m probably more at fault than anybody else, because as you pointed out right in the beginning of this trial, if I had visited him in those 109 days very possibly there might have been a different deal. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">To the court\u2019s credit, Judge Elliott indicated such negligence on the part of Hayes was \"outrageous\u201d. However, when Hayes tried to use the court\u2019s displeasure at this failure to properly prepare as an excuse to withdraw from the case, the judge refused. This was only the beginning of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>apparent tug of war on the part of both Strodder and Hayes during the first part of the trial to be rid of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">At one point, defendant pleaded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">\"If he\u2019s going to represent me, I want somebody here fighting my case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Apparently, the cause of this controversy was that defendant wanted to waive a jury trial while counsel did not. In the end, defendant prevailed and jury trial was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Although Hayes at this point began to get along better with Strodder, with defendant expressing complete satisfaction with counsel, his relations with the trial judge deteriorated. Things went downhill when, after the court gave him permission to hire an investigator, Hayes chose Matthew Buder, a former Genesee County attorney who had been disbarred and imprisoned as a result of unprofessional conduct. Several altercations occurred between defense counsel and judge, based on the judge\u2019s belief that Buder was acting as an informal counsel on the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The courtroom began to take on the appearance of a television drama when Hayes apparently abandoned the insanity defense and suddenly one morning requested that the husband of the alleged victim take the stand. B. James Wright, the requested witness, had not been indorsed. Hayes explained his unusual request for the appearance by claiming:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\"Mr. B. James Wright strangled his wife. Will you get up and testify, sir?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">When his examination did not result in a Perry Mason-type confession blurted from the stand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Hayes wished to review the contents of the police file. The prosecutor objected, but he contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\"The procedures are unimportant. I am asking that the whole record in this case be impounded, that no further prosecutions go on in this county, that this court and the prosecutor of this county be immediately suspended from office, and that Mr. Mandric Strodder immediately be set free. He is completely, absolutely innocent of this charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">He refused to explain his actions further, but instead maintained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">\"I ask that Mr. Strodder be reinstated on his bond. He is willing and has authorized me to say he\u2019s willing to compromise this case as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\"He\u2019s willing to live in this society as a free man if the people of the State of Michigan are willing to pick up his expenses for the rest of his natural life. Is that right Mr. Strodder?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The Defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">\"Yes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Shortly thereafter counsel announced that he did not want to participate \"any further in these proceedings\u201d, and answered in the negative when the court asked \"are you going to continue with the defense of this matter?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\"><em>\"The Court: </em>I\u2019m going to order you to continue with the defense of this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\"><em>\u201cMr. Hayes: </em>We have nothing further to say. Is that right, Mr. Strodder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-15\">'The <em>Defendant: </em>Yes, sir, Mr. Hayes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-16\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Am I correct Mr. Hayes that you\u2019re telling me that you are refusing the order of the court to continue with the defense of this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>\"Mr. Hayes (to the defendant): </em>Don\u2019t talk about the case any further.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Following a recess, the court offered Strodder a mistrial, but the parties opted to continue. The next day the court approved Ivor Jones as co-counsel. The judge then requested Strodder\u2019s permission to perform a psychiatric examination of counsel \"because it seems to me that the events of yesterday raised some question of whether Mr. Hayes is in possession of his reason\u201d. The court, however, was later assured by Hayes\u2019 co-counsel and a psychiatrist who observed counsel in the courtroom that although Hayes was suffering from stress and was deeply involved in the case, there was no question of an unstable mental condition. Although he had some ideas which were delusionary, he appeared to be mentally competent. This opinion was echoed in a letter from Hayes\u2019 personal physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The trial proceeded relatively calmly until the judge became aware that Hayes was going to go to extraordinary lengths to embarrass the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For example, defense counsel requested that the judge disqualify himself because he had been acquainted with both the victim\u2019s husband and defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>stepfather. The request was made despite the fact that the judge had himself offered to step down before the trial had even begun. That offer had been refused. Now the judge indicated he did not think this should be sufficient to disqualify him. He added, frankly, that such attempts by the defense did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">\"endear either Mr. Hayes or Mr. Buder to me, and I will continue on this case as the trier of fact if Mr. Strodder desires me to. But if there\u2019s to be any question about my being an impartial trier of fact, I want it to be raised now and not after there\u2019s been a verdict in this case, if it happens that the verdict that I finally announce would be against Mr. Strodder. I have no way of knowing at this time what the verdict will be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Strodder and counsel again refused the court\u2019s offer to move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Further disagreements between court and counsel occurred when Hayes\u2019 request for adjournment while he went on vacation for a few days was first denied, then granted, with Hayes first excusing, and then calling the same witnesses,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Hayes attempted to call the judge as witness. Hayes had other troubles with witnesses when he decided to retain the insanity defense after all.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Hayes learned in the course of examination of his sole expert witness, a psychiatrist who had examined defendant in 1968, that defendant had been tested and examined at a psychiatric clinic in 1970. When the court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to his attempt to subpoena these witnesses because -they were not listed on the pretrial notice, Hayes was left with one witness. He apparently did not follow up the prosecution witnesses either. When the court refused his objections to the testimony of two doctors from the Center for Forensic Psychiatry as prosecution rebuttal witnesses, he set off to seek a writ of superintending control on the issue of their competency to testify, leaving co-counsel, who was unfamiliar with any of their findings, to perform that cross-examination. Although he had known since June 16th that the two would testify, it was not until July 29th, the date they actually testified, that he made the trip to Lansing.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Upon closing argument, defense counsel acknowledged that things might have gone differently had he visited Strodder before trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\"><em>\"Mr. Hayes: </em>* * * You know I haven\u2019t given you much credit, Judge, but when I look back on the whole thing, perhaps if I had visited him in those 109 days he might have opened up to me. It\u2019s doubtful when I hear Mr. Ennis say how tight-lipped he was, further doubtful when even after I pleaded five times to get out of this case I asked him 'Under those circumstances, do you want me to represent you?\u2019, and he says 'If you do what you\u2019re supposed to do, yes. If you\u2019re not going to do what you\u2019re supposed to do, no,\u2019 and I immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>think the guy is out of his skull, he talks in riddles. Now I know what that meant; if I\u2019m part of the fix, if I go along with the deal, do the job. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Counsel, although claiming that so much of the trial \"appears to me a collusive effort on behalf of Mr. Wright and the Prosecutor to protect Mr. Wright from even investigation\u201d, and that \"[s]o much of our trial procedure has really been a game\u201d, apologized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\"Now a final point. I want to apologize to the Court for anything I have done, and I know I\u2019ve done some things that have been personally offensive to the Court. I did anything and everything I did with my conscience to the best interest of my client as I saw it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">\"I do not wish to exonerate myself of some of the misbehavior I know I engaged in; that is, on a number of occasions I was rude to the Court, I did yell and shout, I did say things that I shouldn\u2019t have. I apologize to you personally; I really don\u2019t mean to do that, and I\u2019m really sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">\"I know I have done another thing that is probably unconscionable, and that is I may well have ruined things for Mandric Strodder for the rest of his life. Because of the extraordinary nature of the case and the way it\u2019s progressed, it\u2019s very likely that somebody will say 'Well, he had incompetent counsel, and let\u2019s get him a new trial.\u2019 But they need not try him anew, they\u2019ve got other charges pending against him, so he can be packed away anyway. If I did that to him, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The trial court found the defendant guilty as charged of first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Said the judge,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">\"I do not have the slightest doubt of his guilt of this murder in the first degree. There is not a speck of evidence in support of the transparent and inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>unbelievable fabrication he recently concocted at the invitation of his lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Mandric Strodder was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor in solitary confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that defendant had expressed satisfaction with counsel on numerous occasions, that no prejudice arose from lack of consultation before trial, and that numerous incidents, including the choice not to move for mistrial were questions of trial strategy, which, if erroneous, \"is not a basis for finding a denial of effective counsel\u201d. 46 Mich App 395, 403; 208 NW2d 187 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">II \u2014Incompetence of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">\n<em>A. The Relevant Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to counsel and is applicable to the states by way of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Gideon v Wainwright, </em>372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799; 93 ALR2d 733 (1963). The right to counsel means at least the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Powell v Alabama, </em>287 US 45; 53 S Ct 55; 77 L Ed 158; 84 ALR 527 (1932). The validity of the adversary system and the legal and ethical requirements of the profession obligate the attorney to provide diligent and skillful representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">No single standard for determining whether counsel was in fact effective has received universal acceptance. At first, based on the concept that the Sixth Amendment guarantees no more than the formal appointment of competent counsel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>approach was that to show ineffective assistance of counsel, one had to show the proceedings amounted to a \"sham trial\u201d. The entire representation of defendant must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\"[T]he trial was a farce, or a mockery of justice, or was shocking to the conscience of the reviewing court, or the purported representation was only perfunctory, in bad faith, a sham, a pretense, or without adequate opportunity for conference and preparation.\u201d <em>Williams v Beto, </em>354 F2d 698, 704 (CA 5, 1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">See also, <em>People v Husband, </em>50 Mich App 46; 212 NW2d 746 (1973); <em>People v Greene, </em>42 Mich App 154; 201 NW2d 664 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Dissatisfaction with this as the sole approach appeared in the law reviews<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the case law<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as it became apparent that guaranteeing counsel without in turn assuring adequate performance would defeat the ultimate purpose of appointing counsel in the first place, that of giving defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>a fair trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rejecting \"the low standard of effectiveness required by <em>Williams v Beto, </em>which would do no more than prevent the trial from becoming 'a farce, or a mockery of justice\u2019 \u201d, <em>West v Louisiana, </em>478 F2d 1026, 1033 (CA 5, 1973), the Fifth Circuit returned to the standard it had announced in <em>MacKenna v Ellis, </em>280 F2d 592, 599 (CA 5, 1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\" 'We interpret the right to counsel as the right to effective counsel. We interpret counsel to mean not errorless counsel, and not counsel judged ineffective by hindsight, but counsel reasonably likely to render <em>and rendering </em>reasonably effective assistance.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>West v Louisiana, </em>478 F2d 1026, 1033 (CA 5, 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Other courts have interpreted this approach as did the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, requiring defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her attorney did not possess \"the normal customary skill and knowledge of the law. This test, which has characteristics in common with the malpractice standard applied to physicians and other professions, has worth in that it provides the court with measurable indicia with which to judge and compare counsel\u2019s efforts.\u201d <em>State v Thomas, </em>\u2014 W Va \u2014; 203 SE2d 445 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We think this search for a fairer objective standard than \"sham trial\u201d alone was greatly advanced by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Beasley v United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>States, </em>491 F2d 687 (CA 6, 1974). This case also demonstrates the problem of utilizing the \"sham trial\u201d approach alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">In <em>Beasley, </em>the district court had found defense counsel guilty of a long list of incompetencies and lack of diligence,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but nonetheless held that defendant had not been deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel because the trial had not been rendered \" 'a farce and a mockery, shocking to the court.\u2019 \u201d 491 F2d 687, 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The Sixth Circuit then rejected the subjective \"sham trial\u201d standard which had produced this incongruous result \"except as it may be considered a conclusory description of the objective standard we adopt\u201d. 491 F2d 687, 696. As ably detailed by Judge Celebrezze, the Court outlined this approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\"We hold that the assistance of counsel required under the Sixth Amendment is counsel reasonably likely to render and rendering reasonably eifective assistance. It is a violation of this standard for defense counsel to deprive a criminal defendant of a substantial defense by his own ineffectiveness or incompetence. * * * Defense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in the crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>nal law and must conscientiously protect his client\u2019s interest, undeflected by conflicting considerations. * * * Defense counsel must investigate all apparently substantial defenses available to the defendant and must assert them in a proper and timely manner. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\"It is a denial of the right to the effective assistance of counsel for an attorney to advise his client erroneously on a clear point of law if this advice leads to the deprivation of his client\u2019s right to a fair trial. * * * Defense strategy and tactics which lawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law would not consider competent deny a criminal defendant the effective assistance of counsel, if some other action would have better protected a defendant and was reasonably foreseeable as such before trial. * * * If, however, action that appears erroneous from hindsight was taken for reasons that would appear sound to a competent criminal attorney, the assistance of counsel has not been constitutionally defective.\u201d (Citations omitted.) 491 F2d 687, 696.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\"><em>Beasley </em>appears to us as a good explication of the lack of competency part of an objective ineffective assistance of counsel rule. The other part must relate to lack of due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\"><em>Beasley </em>held \"that the petitioner did not receive the effective assistance of counsel before and during trial\u201d. 491 F2d 687, 696. While the opinion spoke largely to questions of competency, this reference must also include the district court\u2019s findings of failure \"to interview any <em>res gestae </em>witnesses before trial\u201d except one poor one, and of counsel conducting \"no more than a cursory investigation of the facts prior to trial\u201d. 491 F2d 687, 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Lack of due diligence bearing on ineffectiveness of counsel has been recognized in many of the Federal cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Lack of due diligence was recognized as a factor to be considered in ineffectiveness of counsel by this Court. In <em>Holt v State Bar Grievance Board, </em>388 Mich 50; 199 NW2d 195 (1972), we noted that \"Canon 6 requires generally that 'A Lawyer Should Represent a Client Competently.\u2019 \u201d 388 Mich 50, 63. According to Disciplinary Rule 6-101(A)(2), Failing to Act Competently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\"(A) A lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\"(2) Handle a legal matter without preparation adequate in the circumstances.\u201d 388 Mich 50, 63.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In our opinion, the most generally cited Michigan case in relation to ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>People v Degraffenreid, </em>19 Mich App 702; 173 NW2d 317 (1969), is not inconsistent with the rule here developed. While it is often cited as a \"sham\u201d rule case,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> when the whole opinion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>read, it is considerably broader.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><em>Degraffenreid </em>dealt with the two different aspects of the problem of effective representation by counsel that this opinion deals with. First, as to incompetency there is the familiar analysis of \"sham\u201d trial. However, at a different point in his <em>Degraffenreid </em>opinion, Justice, then Judge Levin, spoke more broadly on the question of competence in the light of a fair trial. He noted that, \"Where the lawyer\u2019s mistake is of such serious proportion that it may have been decisive\u201d, a new trial may be appropriate. 19 Mich App 702, 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Thus, under <em>Degraffenreid, </em>defendant may claim he received a \"sham\u201d trial because he was \"represented by a bad lawyer\u201d, 19 Mich App 702, 717, or may request \"a new trial because of a serious mistake made by a good lawyer\u201d. 19 Mich App 702, 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">As to the second, or diligence, standard, the very <em>Williams v Beto </em>language setting forth the \"sham\u201d trial rule, includes the second or diligence standard as well, \"without adequate opportunity for conference and preparation\u201d. 354 F2d 698, 704, cited at 19 Mich App 702, 710. Thus many of the points in this opinion were at least touched upon in <em>Degraffenreid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We recognize, of course, that effective assistance of counsel means something other than successful assistance. <em>Mitchell v United States, </em>104 US App DC 57; 259 F2d 787 (1958). But, as Chief Justice Burger\u2019s arguments have helped focus the attention of our profession on the competence of trial advocates,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> so we on our Court must ensure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>basic constitutional requirement that the quality of counsel does not fall below the minimum level necessary to a fair trial. That minimum level requires that counsel demonstrate both the capacity and diligence which constitute the constitutional right to effective representation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\n<em>B. Performance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We hold that Mandric Strodder did not receive a fair trial because of ineffective assistance of counsel. An examination of the record in the instant case demonstrates the applicability of the proposed test.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\n<em>1. Failure of due diligence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Counsel\u2019s incompetence in the instant case was manifested by many of the same factors condemned by the district court in <em>Beasley, supra, </em>fn 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">He did not interview or call all possible witnesses and, in fact, did not discover most of them until in the midst of trial, when it was, in fact, too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">He failed to meet with his client during the period before trial and, consequently, did not develop a coherent strategy with defendant, did not learn the details of defendant\u2019s history, and was unable to construct a viable defense, when there was, in fact, ample evidence available had he assiduously prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">\n<em>2. Failure of competence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The <em>Beasley </em>Court outlined some of the hallmarks to which an appellate court should look when analyzing this aspect of the test. Counsel must be \"reasonably likely to render and render<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ing reasonably effective assistance\u201d. 491 F2d 687, 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Counsel must not \"deprive a criminal defendant of a substantial defense by his own ineffectiveness or incompetence.\u201d 491 F2d 687, 696.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\"Defense counsel must investigate all apparently substantial defenses available to the defendant and must assert them in a proper and timely manner.\u201d 491 F2d 687, 696.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The insanity defense was a viable approach, and counsel himself recognized this when he returned to it following his attack on the victim\u2019s husband. However, attorney Hayes did not uncover all witnesses, did not fully learn defendant\u2019s psychiatric history, did not call all witnesses (partly because of his later discovery of two witnesses), and did not adequately cross-examine the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal witnesses. This left defendant\u2019s only realistic defense in a shambles around his attorney\u2019s feet.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\"Defense strategy and tactics which lawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law would not consider competent deny a criminal defendant the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d 491 F2d 687, 696.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In the instant case, defense counsel neither investigated the viable defense he planned to present, nor the controversial one he chose to present. Additionally, his conduct was neither proper nor uncontemptuous. Witnesses he did call, including the victim\u2019s husband and the judge, could only be rationalized by a bizarre and implausible defense strategy. He used the court-financed investigator in a manner disapproved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Little more appears to be necessary to say about this than that undoubtedly a lawyer of ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>training and skill in the criminal law would not use the defense strategy and tactics which outraged the court in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Thanks to the heroic efforts of the judge, the trial itself was saved from becoming a \"farce\u201d or \"mockery\u201d. However, the strain the same circumstances imposed on the adversary process and trial procedure, combined with the failure to present a substantial defense, created a situation constituting ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\n<em>C Defendant\u2019s Expression of Approval</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">That defendant manifested his approval of counsel is indicative, but not dispositive. This is particularly true when dealing with a defendant of limited capacity, but in general it is entirely too much to expect an untrained lay person in defendant\u2019s shoes to know when counsel is being ineffective by legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">We do not urge a rule whereby counsel can be dismissed because of insignificant disagreements between attorney and client. However, we do not wish to insist on retaining a situation which consists of a continuing pattern of disagreement, agreement, disagreement, agreement. Such a situation is injurious to any relationship, but certainly doubly so to the kind of intimate association which is the hallmark of any successful attorney-client relationship. Of itself, this would not be enough for us to find error, but combined with other factors it is. Further, it is unfair to insist that the approval of his counsel\u2019s performance by a person whose competence was at issue should be construed to outweigh other factors relating to his attorney\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The United States Supreme Court held the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to effective assistance of counsel to be so basic that every reasonable presumption would be indulged against waiver of this right. <em>Glasser v United States, </em>315 US 60; 62 S Ct 457; 86 L Ed 680 (1942). In addition, the harmless error standard is inapplicable when dealing with so basic a right.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\"The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice resulting from its denial.\u201d 315 US 60, 76.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Counsel would have us believe that the judge should have disqualified himself because of bias. On the contrary, the record is filled with a rather heroic effort on the part of the judge to prevent himself from being influenced by the personal attacks and unorthodox behavior of counsel. Any indication we have on the record is that the attorney was in fact given almost every opportunity that he requested to present his case, including the appointment of an investigator, full and complete examination of the victim\u2019s husband, and even an offer of proof concerning unindorsed witnesses. However, it would be better if the judge did not participate upon retrial, but this is not because of any unjudicial behavior during trial. Rather, when a new trial is required on the basis of incompetence of counsel, it seems well that a new judge who was not privy to the unfortunate preceding circumstances should have jurisdiction in order to give defendant the benefit of a completely clear record.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">We hold that an examination of the record indicates that Mandric Strodder did not receive a fair trial because of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the circuit court for a new trial. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>for other issues claimed by defendant, we do not consider them at this time.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> Defendant had allegedly committed other rapes and at the time of the instant crime was out on bond pending trial on another rape charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-13\"> He later attempted to use two additional witnesses, but the trial court refused permission because of lack of notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\"> Counsel\u2019s close work with defendant\u2019s mother did not, however, apparently result in a relationship in which they both worked hand-in-hand for the benefit of defendant. Counsel pleaded at one point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">\"I wish to renew my motion to withdraw from this case because I feel if the advice of counsel is just shunted aside, then I don\u2019t think I am performing the best function I could possibly do in representing my client, because I think there\u2019s a conflict or potential conflict of interest with respect to myself and Mrs. Simmons [appellant\u2019s mother] and her interest in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\"> For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\"><em>\"Mr. Black: </em>Let the record reflect he\u2019s conferring with Mr. Buder again, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-12\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Yes, he has throughout the course of the last couple of days, and I would I expect want to indicate that my failure to make any comment is in no way a reflection of approval of obtaining any legal advice from Mr. Buder, if that is in fact what occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-13\"><em>\"Mr. Hayes: </em>No. Wait a minute.

For example, the first lawyer didn\u2019t raise the point that the defendant didn\u2019t know the victim and had no demonstrable connection with him. Nor did he point out that there was nothing to link the murder weapon with the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\" 'In all, I found seven holes in the prosecutor\u2019s evidence that were never argued,\u2019 says the New York attorney. Nevertheless, the appeals court refused to order a new hearing and the man went to prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">\"Ironically, it\u2019s nearly impossible to persuade judges to change a ruling on the ground that a client\u2019s counsel was incompetent. In most jurisdictions, the complaining client must show that he was denied a fair trial. Usually, that means he must prove that his lawyer\u2019s performance turned the trial into 'a farce and a mockery of justice\u2019. Judges say the standard of proof must be high to prevent criminals from automatically using claims of slipshod legal defense as excuses to challenge their convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">\"Still, some courts are moving to ease the client\u2019s burden. In 1973, the U. S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia established a less stringent standard in reviewing the conviction of one Willie DeCoster for aiding and abetting an armed robbery and assault. It said a client shouldn\u2019t have to prove he was denied fundamental fairness, but only that he didn\u2019t get 'reasonably competent\u2019 assistance, which the appeals court said is required by the Constitution\u2019s right-to-counsel provisions. If that can be shown, the appeals court said, then the prosecutor assumes the burden of proving the defendant wasn\u2019t hurt by his counsel\u2019s incompetence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\"The appeals court ordered further hearings to determine if Mr. DeCoster was inadequately represented under this new standard. In so doing, the court noted that his defense counsel had been late in filing a bond-review motion and then had filed it in the wrong court, and that he had agreed to go to trial while acknowledging that he wasn\u2019t prepared. The court also said the attorney had neglected to check properly the outcome of separate cases against Mr. DeCoster\u2019s alleged accomplices.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 19, col 6.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b310-4\">M. S. Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_a\"><em>(dissent). </em>My examination of this case fails to leave me with an abiding conviction that the procedures followed deprived defendant of a fair trial. I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">There can be no claim that Judge Elliott\u2019s verdict was contrary to the evidence. The record reveals more than sufficient testimony to support the trial judge\u2019s finding that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in this murder case.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">There can be no claim that defendant was unable to comprehend the events at trial. He was found mentally competent to stand trial. He participated in planning trial strategy, including the request for a bench trial. Judge Elliott several times afforded defendant an opportunity to discharge his attorney or seek a mistrial. Defendant indicated during trial that he wanted to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">There certainly can be no reversible error in Judge Elliott\u2019s conduct. It was impeccable, demonstrating the highest level of patience, fairness and concern for justice. The Court said he exhibited \"unusual patience\u201d. The Court of Appeals commended him \"for his conduct and in retaining his composure and objectivity under the most trying circumstances\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">The judge was in the untenable position of having good reason to believe that he would be reversed if he dismissed counsel over defendant\u2019s objection. He therefore pursued a wise course in appointing co-counsel to ensure a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The judge also was faced with good reason to believe that his declaring a mistrial over objection of the defendant would lead to a finding of double jeopardy upon review.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>All admit that he conducted himself admirably and patiently heard the case to the end. The defendant received exactly what he requested. I cannot see where the judge erred. In my opinion he is greatly to be commended.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The Court of Appeals, in an excellent analysis could find no reversible error in the conduct of this trial. This Court can point to no specific error. Defendant should stand properly convicted of this murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b311-6\">J. W. Fitzgerald, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzL\"><em>(for affirmance). </em>Our Olympian view of the specter of justice under fire on the courtroom battle front suggests repugnance at the sulfurous odor and frightful din below. Resisting the subtle siren of suggestion, I share Justice M. S. Coleman\u2019s view that defendant was not deprived of a fair trial in these extraordinary proceedings. I would adopt the excellent opinion of Judge Danhof, writing for a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals, at 46 Mich App 395; 208 NW2d 187 (1973).</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-7\">Swainson, J., and the late Justice T.
