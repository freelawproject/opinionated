MCLA 125.273; MSA 5.2963(3). The township planning act provides that the township \"planning commission shall make and adopt a basic plan as a guide for the development of unincorporated portions of the township\u201d. MCLA 125.326; MSA 5.2963(106).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">While most zoning enabling acts require that zoning be in accordance with a \"plan\u201d or more commonly \"in accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d (from the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act), \"the 'comprehensive plan\u2019 with which zoning was to accord has hardly ever been identified with the 'master plan\u2019 established by the Planning Act\u201d. Hagman, Urban Planning and Land Development Control Law, \u00a7 24, p 55.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\"It is thus clear that the 'comprehensive plan\u2019 of the zoning statute is not identical with the 'master plan\u2019 of the Planning Act and need not meet the formal requirements of a master plan.\u201d <em>Kozesnik v Montgomery Twp, </em>24 NJ 154, 166; 131 A2d 1, 7 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The \"plan\u201d limitation in the zoning enabling act requires that the community zone in a pre-established and comprehensive manner rather than on an ad hoc basis. The \"plan\u201d required for zoning purposes is not dependent on the adoption of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>master plan and may properly emanate from the zoning ordinance or map itself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In Michigan, and generally elsewhere, zoning enabling acts and zoning ordinances were enacted before legislation authorizing planning commissions and adoption of master plans.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\"As a result, there appears to have been a judicial tendency to interpret the statutory directive that zoning ordinances shall be 'in accordance with a comprehensive plan\u2019 as meaning nothing more than that zon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ing ordinances shall be comprehensive \u2014 that is to say, uniform and broad in scope of coverage. The lack of a master plan is deemed irrelevant to the validity of zoning measures. And this is hardly surprising. For when one considers the usual chronology of the legislative enactment of zoning and planning enabling legislation in any state, the indefinite statutory language, and the far greater prevalence of zoning than planning at the municipal level, it <em>would strain judicial reasoning to the breaking point to imply a legislative intent that zoning ordinances be considered authorized only if drafted in accordance with a previously enunciated master plan. \u201d </em>Haar, <em>In Accordance With a Comprehensive Plan, </em>68 Harv L Rev 1154, 1157 (1955). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">With the exception of states where the zoning enabling act specifically provides that zoning shall be \"in accordance with the master plan for land use\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> no case has been found requiring adoption of a master plan as a precondition to the enactment of a valid zoning ordinance. The authorities are uniformly to the contrary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">There is no statutory requirement that a township establish a planning commission; the statute authorizing the creation of township planning commissions is permissive. MCLA 125.323; MSA 5.2963(103). Requiring that any township that does establish a planning commission immediately adopt a master plan or otherwise face invalidation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>of its previously enacted zoning ordinances would serve as a strong deterrent to taking the initial step toward long-range planning \u2014 the creation of a planning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Substantial time may be required to develop and adopt a sound master plan. \"If no zoning regulation were possible until the master plan was completed and adopted, in counties where fast growth was occurring, it might do so in an incongruous and uncontrolled manner which the planning commission would find it difficult or perhaps impossible to keep abreast of, or to devise a master plan that would be of much benefit; and thus the whole purpose of effective zoning might be frustrated.\u201d <em>Gayland v Salt Lake County, </em>11 Utah 2d 307, 310; 358 P2d 633, 635 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Invalidation of otherwise valid zoning regulations solely because they were enacted in the period between creation of a planning commission and actual adoption of a master plan would result in wholesale invalidation of zoning regulations leaving an absolute void of any land use regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We concur in affirmance.</p>\n<judges id=\"b629-7\">T.

Where a community has neither adopted such a plan, nor even taken the first steps to produce one, we will, in the future, go beyond the rule we adopted in <em>Biske v City of Troy,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and find the zoning ordinance invalid per se. However, as this ruling is prospective only, it does not affect the validity of the Monroe Township Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">As to confiscation, the <em>Kropf </em>rule, \"the ordinance comes to us clothed with every presumption of validity\u201d \"that * * * [a] reasonable governmental interest [is] being advanced by the present zoning classification\u201d is here recognized but is not here applicable. Rather the second <em>Kropf </em>rule \"that an ordinance may be unreasonable because of its purely arbitrary, capricious and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate land use in the area in question\u201d governs the issue of confiscation. We hold that \"it is the burden of the party attacking to prove\u201d \"that if the ordinance is enforced the consequent restrictions on his property preclude its use for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted\u201d. 391 Mich 139, 162-163. On review of the opinions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals, we find a close question of fact exists which we resolve in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">As to spot zoning, the zoning ordinance provided for mobile-home parks within districts zoned commercial but only on approval of the Board of Appeals. Plaintiffs, however, not being owners in an area zoned commercial, lack standing to challenge the validity of such an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>I \u2014Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 property, an irregular, but mainly rectangular parcel of approximately 86 acres in Monroe Township, is currently zoned for residential uses. Although having a basically interior location, at two different points it abuts the main roads of Hull and Dunbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On the north, across Dunbar Road is a stone quarry in which heavy machinery is used and where blasting occurs frequently. Testimony at trial indicated that occasionally pieces of rock have been hurled by this blasting into a neighboring business area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On the east, part of the parcel bounds on Hull Road. Directly east of that is an auto salvage yard. Still further east are the southbound tracks of the New York Central Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Most of the southern portion of the area is currently farm land, except for the southwest corner, which contains housing subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">On the west, the general area is bounded by South Dixie Highway where, in strips not exceeding 600 feet deep on both sides, is commercial development such as restaurants and auto dealerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">About 75% of the whole area, including plaintiffs\u2019 parcel, is zoned RB, a classification permitting single-family and multiple residential units. Most remaining land is zoned commercial. The map of Existing Land Use exhibit submitted by defendants indicates that the area within approximately 1 mile of the center of plaintiffs\u2019 property is roughly 75-80% vacant land. Figure 1. Plaintiffs\u2019 property is now vacant, too, although it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>been used at various times for agriculture and as a commercial nursery.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The township has never hired a professional planner and has never produced a master plan. It does, however, have a zoning ordinance which permits mobile-home parks in commercial zones upon approval by the Board of Appeals. There is no district zoned specifically for mobile-home parks, but two such parks already exist. Plaintiffs seek to have their land rezoned commercial in order to construct a mobile-home park on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">At first the Township Board did not, and then it did, tentatively approve the zoning change. So did the Planning Commission. However, following a public meeting, plaintiffs\u2019 petition was finally rejected by the Township Board. The next step was a suit filed in Monroe Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Plaintiffs argued that retaining the present residential zoning was confiscatory as to their property. Stone-rock formation made construction of sewer and water lines for single and multiple units impractical, while proximity to the quarry blasting made it difficult to construct structures which could withstand the vibration. Mobile homes, because of their flexible construction, could withstand the shaking, and did not require pipelines as deep as conventional residential units. There was no market for multiple units, while there was a great, unfulfilled need for lower-cost housing, and the two existing mobile-home parks in the township had waiting lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Because of poor drainage and the presence of nursery stock, plaintiffs felt that, without extensive changes, the land could not be used for the typical crops normally grown in Monroe County. Therefore, the only practical use for the property, say plaintiffs, would be for a mobile-home park.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>They also attempted to show that a mobile-home park would be good planning. Proposed density of 5.9 units per gross acre would be the same as for single units in the same area. An expert testified that a mobile-home park would be a buffer between other land uses. Additionally, a mobile-home park is already located in an area of similar land uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Plaintiffs also pointed out that the township lacks a master plan and has never hired a professional planner. Although there is a zoning ordinance, the only way mobile-home parks may be located in the township is by special permission of the Board of Appeals, which, plaintiffs contend, is spot zoning, an invalid use of the zoning power.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Defendant argued that building a mobile-home park would adversely affect its planning, as evidenced by the zoning ordinance. The township did not object to mobile-home parks per se, but found the combination of factors, including the limited access to main roads, proximity to single-family residences and the largely residential nature of the neighborhood, as well as the irregular shape of the land, militated against a mobile-home park in this particular location. The private roads characteristic of mobile-home parks cause serious problems of access, maintenance, and snow removal, and this, combined with a failure to provide connecting streets with the rest of the area, and anticipated increase in population density, would overburden facilities and be contrary to good planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The ordinance, defendant contends, is not confiscatory. The poor market for single-family or multiple-family units was not exclusive to the subject property, but was a presently-existing market condition affecting the whole area. Apparently, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>fendant points out, both the quarry blasting and nature of the soil have not deterred others from building single-family residences in the general vicinity of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Although defendant did not disagree that a new tile and pump system at a probable cost of $200 per acre would be necessary before the land could be used for agriculture, sale of the nursery stock could defray some of the expenses of removal. Additionally, it was suggested that the land could be used for pick-your-own type crops such as strawberries if plaintiffs found they could not profitably grow such staples as wheat and corn.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The township defends its zoning policies by pointing out that it already has two mobile-home parks, including one with 260 units which has room to expand another 315 spaces. There is no single mobile-home park district, because to restrict such parks to one place, defendant contends, would be to unduly limit the growth of mobile-home parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">A township, it says, does not need a master plan, because a zoning ordinance satisfies the statutory requirement of a basic plan. Much thought went into the zoning ordinance, it explains, which has been revised as township conditions changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The trial court found that there was no confiscation, and that \"the property in question can be used as agricultural property, profitably, and that it can be developed as a site for single or multiple dwellings\u201d. Citing <em>Biske v City of Troy, </em>381 Mich 611; 166 NW2d 453 (1969), as authority, the court found that the effect of a master plan which is only informally adopted is that it is accorded less evidentiary value than one which has been adopted according to statute. Therefore the trial court held the lack of a master plan by itself was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>not sufficient to invalidate the township ordinance. The trial court found the zoning ordinance reasonable as to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> finding that construction and market difficulties combined to make the property so devoid of feasibility for use as zoned that the ordinance was deemed confiscatory. The Court did not consider the effect of the lack of a master plan or the alleged spot zoning scheme. 46 Mich App 344; 208 NW2d 57 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">II \u2014Is the Township Zoning Ordinance Void as not Based on a Master Plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the township ordinance is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because a master plan had not been adopted and the township had never retained the services of a professional planner.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Defendant township does not dispute these facts but maintains, on the other hand, that while cities may be required to adopt a master plan, townships need only consider a basic plan. It argues that a basic plan may be the zoning ordinance itself, and therefore failure to adopt a master plan has no bearing on the presumed validity and reasonableness of a township zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>This is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">There are two statutes regulating township zoning: the township planning act, MCLA 125.321 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2963(101) <em>et seq., </em>and the Township Rural Zoning Act, MCLA 125.271 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2963(1) <em>et seq. </em>Monroe Township has elected to come under the township planning act, which very specifically requires a plan. However, since Monroe Township could withdraw from the township planning act and proceed under the Township Rural Zoning Act, this opinion considers the requirements of that act also. We conclude that the Township Rural Zoning Act also requires that zoning be based on a plan. In other words, a township cannot legally zone until it has developed a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>A. Township Zoning Requires A Master Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The township planning act requires: \"[t]he provisions of the zoning ordinance shall be based upon a plan\u201d, MCLA 125.273; MSA 5.2963(3); \"[t]he planning commission shall make and adopt a basic plan as a guide for the development of unincorporated portions of the township\u201d, MCLA 125.326; MSA 5.2963(106); and the plan should provide a basis for the \"future development of the township\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Furthermore, MCLA 125.321; MSA 5.2963(101) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">\"Sec. 1. As used in this act:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\"(1) 'Basic plan\u2019 means master plan, general development plan, guide plan, or the plan referred to in Act No. 184 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being sections 125.271 to 125.301 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, <em>being the basis on which the zoning plan is developed. </em>\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The statute also sets out procedures for adoption of the plan or any parts thereof, including provisions for public hearings. MCLA 125.328; MSA 5.2963(108); MCLA 125.329; MSA 5.2963(109).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">However, even where the township does not come under the planning act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the mandate to plan applies just as strongly to townships which are under the 1943 Township Rural Zoning Act, MCLA 125.271 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2963(1) <em>et seq. </em>To better illustrate the pervasiveness of the legislative commitment to planning and the interrelationship of Michigan zoning and planning, it is useful to examine the zoning act.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">\n<em>B. Township Rural Zoning Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The Township Rural Zoning Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\"The township board of any organized township in the state of Michigan <em>may </em>provide by ordinance for the establishment of zoning districts * * * .\u201d MCLA 125.271; MSA 5.2963(1). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The statute also requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\"[T]he provisions of the zoning ordinance <em>shall </em>be based upon a plan.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> MCLA 125.273; MSA 5.2963(3). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Therefore, once a township proceeds to zone, even without the aid of the planning commission permitted under the township planning act, it is clear that the Legislature required townships which zoned to have a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The Township Rural Zoning Act includes other references reinforcing this interpretation. The statute refers to both a \"zone plan\u201d and a \"zoning ordinance\u201d. Only MCLA 125.279; MSA 5.2963(9),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>or MCLA 125.281; MSA 5.2963(H)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are unclear as to whether \"ordinance\u201d and \"plan\u201d are the same, or different things. All subsequent references, however, concerning adoption and amendment procedures clarify this, and these refer only to the \"ordinance\u201d. See MCLA 125.282 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2963(12) <em>et seq. </em>Furthermore, MCLA 125.277; MSA 5.2963(7)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> also suggests that the \"plan\u201d and the \"ordinance\u201d were intended to be two different things. This approach also clarifies MCLA 125.281; MSA 5.2963(11), <em>supra, </em>fn 10, for it is then evident that the township board is to vote upon adoption of a zoning <em>ordinance </em>only after the township zoning board submits its recommended zoning <em>plan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Therefore even without the new planning statute, the Legislature intended exactly what the plain language of MCLA 125.273 says, that \"the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>zoning ordinance shall be based upon a plan\u201d. If a township in the State of Michigan decides to zone, it must first plan, even if the township chooses to do so without the aid and resources of a township planning commission.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We do not see how these statutes can be under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>stood to require anything less than formal adoption of a township plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The statutes clearly contemplate two separate documents, a zoning ordinance and a plan on which the ordinance is based. If an ordinance is to be based on a plan, it cannot be the same thing as a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Therefore, we do not have the same concern as our Brother Levin, that townships may choose to evade the requirements of the planning act by disbanding their planning commissions and relying, instead, on the zoning act. The zoning act also requires a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Michigan requires that a zoning ordinance be based on a plan, and that the plan is something different from the ordinance. From this foundation, certain consequences follow, namely, if the ordinance is not based on a plan, the statute has not been followed, and the zoning is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Precedent from other states is not persuasive, because the Michigan statute is unique.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Ill \u2014Michigan Statute Compared with Other States</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\n<em>A. The Plan and Zoning Ordinance Distinguished</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">The Michigan statute, as is true of most other zoning and planning legislation, does not require that the plan take any prescribed form. The planning act in fact officially recognizes this flexibility by defining the basic plan required by the act as \"master plan, general development plan, guide plan, or the plan referred to in Act No. 184 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>125.271 to 125.301 of the Compiled Laws of 1948, being the basis on which the zoning plan is developed\u201d. Thus, while the contents of plans produced under the township planning act are required by 125.327, <em>supra, </em>fn 6, and those produced under the Township Rural Zoning Act are required by 125.273, <em>supra, </em>fn 8, the formats or names are not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">This is similar to what has happened in other jurisdictions, and is partly a matter of historical accident, depending on when particular statutes were drafted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, whatever the term selected, the statutes are still discussing the \"basic instrument\u201d of planning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">\"This master plan, a 'comprehensive, long-term general plan\u2019 for the physical development of the community, embodies information, judgments, and objectives collected and formulated by experts to serve as both a guiding and predictive force. Based on comprehensive surveys and analyses of existing social, economic, and physical conditions in the community and of the factors which generate them, the plan directs attention to the goals selected by the community from the various alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>natives propounded and clarified by planning experts, and delimits the means (within available resources) for arriving at these objectives. With different local agencies concentrating on streets, parks, roads, and schools, and with the increasing tendency to delegate new techniques such as urban renewal or public housing to <em>ad hoc </em>authorities, there is danger that diverse legislative activities affecting the physical environment will not be coordinated, and that inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and waste will result. And in the press of day-to-day determinations in the field of land use, it is vital that there be some concrete unifying factor providing scope and perspective. Hence the need for city planning and the master plan, 'guiding and accomplishing,\u2019 in the words of the Pennsylvania enabling statute, 'a coordinated, adjusted, and harmonious development of the city. * * * \u2019\u201d (Notes omitted.) Haar, fn 14 <em>supra, </em>1155.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">This, of course, is different from the zoning ordinance. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York ably distinguished the two by defining a master plan<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as \"a long-term, general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>outline of projected development\u201d, while the zoning ordinance \"is but one of the many tools which may be used to implement the plan\u201d. <em>Fornaby v Feriola, </em>18 AD2d 215; 239 NYS2d 185 (1963), cited in 1 Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning &amp; Planning, Supplement 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\n<em>B. Other State Statutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Although there appears to be general understanding that there is a difference between planning and zoning, courts have often misconstrued the relationship between the two when interpreting statutes based upon the language of the model zoning enabling act.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The Standard State Zoning Enabling Act requires zoning regulations to \"be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d. Standard State Zoning Enabling Act (United States Department of Commerce [1926]), \u00a7 3, cited in 40 ALR3d 379. The enabling legislation of most states also includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>some variation of this requirement, 1 Anderson, American Law of Zoning, \u00a7 5.02, cited id.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Most court decisions in other states have relied on construing the precise language of their state statutes. These statutes are all different from the compulsory planning-zoning language of the Michigan act, and, to that extent, are not valid precedent for interpreting our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The leading case cited as holding that ordinance and plan are one and the same is <em>Kozesnik v Montgomery Twp, </em>24 NJ 154; 131 A2d 1 (1957). The language of this case, as accurately cited by my Brother Levin, relied on a statutory construction different from that written by our Legislature,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and required that zoning regulations be \"in accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d. Noting with some implicit apology that \"historical development did not square with the orderly treatment of the problem which present wisdom would recommend\u201d, 24 NJ 165; 131 A2d 1, 7, <em>i.e., </em>planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>did not precede zoning, the Supreme Court of New Jersey attempted to reconcile the two by holding that \" 'plan\u2019 connotes an integrated product of a rational process and 'comprehensive\u2019 requires something beyond a piecemeal approach\u201d, 24 NJ 166; 131 A2d 1, 7, and that therefore the comprehensive plan need not be manifested in some physical form outside the zoning ordinance itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Whatever the wisdom of this statutory interpretation, the language it analyzes is not the language of the Michigan statute. Its validity is further reduced by the grudging acceptance of the approach by some courts,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and by the even nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>rower contortions taken by other courts cited by 'my Brother Levin which have derived their reasoning from <em>Kozesnik </em>and their statutory language from the enabling act.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There is still another line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>of cases which has attempted to resolve the problem more properly by analyzing the basic relationship between planning and zoning<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> with results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>different from those in <em>Kozesnik </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">Thus, the judicial construction of individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>state zoning and planning statutes is not quite as homologous as one might suppose from a reading of some commentators. The concern expressed in the opinions is both to protect the landowner from arbitrary restrictions on the use of his or her property, as well as to ensure that local authorities act for the benefit of the community as a whole following a deliberate consideration of alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">To this end, our Legislature has required that township zoning ordinances \"be based upon a plan\u201d. Such language and such intent militates against our analyzing whether the zoning ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>nance is a comprehensive plan. To do so is to ignore a carefully-thought-out statutory scheme requiring a plan, and then a zoning ordinance to implement the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">It is obvious that Monroe Township did not fulfill the plan requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\n<em>C What Are the Consequences?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The decisions of this Court have supported the approach of requiring township planning. As far as we can tell, however, this is the first time we have been faced with the problem of a township which has no planning at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In <em>Biske v City of Troy, </em>381 Mich 611; 166 NW2d 453 (1969), a unanimous Court held that an unadopted master plan would not be given the evidentiary weight of reasonableness of an adopted one. Since the Michigan Legislature has established a requirement of community review of land planning, MCLA 125.38; MSA 5.2998, we said this review could not be evaded. 381 Mich 611, 614-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Further, this Court recognized that one reason for attributing a presumption of reasonableness to community zoning ordinances is that the ordinance is based on sound planning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-11\">\"The mandatory requirement, that 'The commission shall make and adopt a master plan for the physical development of the municipality, including any areas outside of its boundaries which, in the commission\u2019s judgment, bear relation to the planning of the municipality\u2019 (see PA 1931, No 285, \u00a7 6 [CL 1948, \u00a7 125.36], as amended by PA 1962, No 138 [Stat Ann 1969 Cum Supp \u00a7 5.2996]), is of no little significance when courts are called upon to consider the reasonableness of zoning which depends upon the predictions of such a plan and the need for reasonable stability thereof once the plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>has been adopted pursuant to the procedure required by section 8 of the act (CL 1948, \u00a7 125.38 [Stat Ann 1958 Rev \u00a7 5.2998]). In short, we are not disposed to grant any municipal master plan, not yet adopted according to section 6 (CL 1948, \u00a7 125.36, as amended by PA 1962, No 138 [Stat Ann 1969 Cum Supp \u00a7 5.2996]), the evidentiary value of reasonableness which Division 2 accords this one. The point is that the statutory requirement of formal adoption has a purpose, a rather manifest one, and our decision here should tend to effectuate that purpose.\u201d 381 Mich 611, 616.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">It is apparent that the ordinance itself may not be considered as ipso facto evidence that zoning determinations are reasonable if there is no master plan available.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">One year after <em>Biske, </em>we noted that the \"absence of a formally adopted municipal plan, whether mandated by statute or not, does not of course invalidate municipal zoning or rezoning. But it does, as in <em>Biske, supra, </em>weaken substantially the well known presumption which, ordinarily, attends any regular-on-its-face municipal zoning ordinance or amendment thereof.\u201d <em>Raabe v City of Walker, </em>383 Mich 165, 178; 174 NW2d 789 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\"><em>Biske </em>and <em>Raabe </em>are weaker cases than the instant case. In <em>Biske, supra, </em>there was a plan, but it had not been adopted. In <em>Raabe, supra, </em>rezoning was based on a plan which also had not been formally adopted. Even in <em>Yale Development Co v City of Portage, </em>11 Mich App 83; 160 NW2d 604 (1968), cited to us by defendant, Portage had contracted for the services of a city planning consulting firm, but the proposals had not been completed. 11 Mich App 83, 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Therefore, the total lack of any planning in the instant case does more than merely affect the presumption of reasonableness we attribute to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>properly adopted zoning ordinance. While <em>Biske </em>and <em>Raabe </em>are correct in applying a weakened presumption where there is an existing, but unadopted, master plan, the absence of any plan at all requires stronger sanctions. The Legislature has decreed that there must be planning before zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In the future, if this Court is presented with such a zoning ordinance implemented in a manner contrary to and without reference to statute, we will find that ordinance to be invalid. However, we take judicial notice of the confusion attending the appropriate interpretation of our statute, and recognize, therefore, that it would be inequitable to so hold in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This does not mean, however, that Monroe Township may continue zoning without planning. We remand to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Monroe Township is hereby ordered to make good faith efforts to establish a plan. If such efforts are not undertaken within 90 days of the entry of this order, and if reasonable continued progress is not made, then any property owner so desiring may begin proper suit and stand in the same stead as plaintiffs in this suit. At that juncture, it will be appropriate for the trial court to apply the rule invalidating ordinances undertaken without planning. During the aforementioned 90 days, the rule of <em>Biske </em>will control.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">As for plaintiffs, relief is granted on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">IV \u2014Is Residential Zoning of Plaintiffs\u2019 Property Invalid as Confiscatory?</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Plaintiffs allege that the zoning ordinance is invalid as applied to their property because, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the circumstances, requiring it to be used for residential purposes amounts to confiscation. The land, they argue, <em>supra, </em>can be used as a practical matter only for a mobile-home park. No other use would be profitable. The mobile-home park use will not only be profitable, but the community needs mobile-home parks. It does not need more single and multiple-family residences. Additionally, plaintiffs say, a mobile-home park on that site is good planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Defendants contend, <em>supra, </em>that there is no confiscation because the land can be used successfully as zoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">This raises the second principle in <em>Kropf v Sterling Heights, </em>391 Mich 139; 215 NW2d 179 (1974).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We stated the standards by which allegations of confiscation are determined. This principle is that plaintiff has the burden of proving \"that an ordinance may be unreasonable because of the purely arbitrary, capricious and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate land use in the area in question\u201d, 391 Mich 139, 158, and that \"if the ordinance is enforced the consequent restrictions on his property preclude its use for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted\u201d. 391 Mich 139, 162-163. And of course, as in all equity cases, \"considerable weight\u201d is given \"to the findings of the trial judge\u201d. 391 Mich 139, 163, quoting <em>Christine Building Co v City of Troy, </em>367 Mich 508, 518; 116 NW2d 816 (1962). If plaintiff thus sustains an attack<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> on the validity of the ordinance, he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>entitled to the land use he is petitioning for under normal and regular conditions unless such use would be a nuisance. To do otherwise would leave petitioner with property no one can use.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In the instant case, the trial court found no confiscation. We hold that the trial court used an inappropriate standard to determine whether the ordinance was indeed confiscatory as to plaintiffs\u2019 property when it found that \"the plaintiffs have not demonstrated by a preponderance of the proofs that the continual zoning of the premises as RB is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare in the township\u201d. Further, it was error to hold that the zoning ordinance was itself evidence of the general plan of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The trial court held that \"the property in question can be used as agricultural property, profitably, and that it can be developed as a site for single or multiple dwellings\u201d. The Court of Appeals, however, reviewing the evidence <em>de novo, </em>although giving \"considerable weight\u201d to the trial judge\u2019s finding of facts, reversed that holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">\"The record discloses persuasive evidence that the high cost of removing obstacles on the property, alleviating drainage problems, and employing a sewage lift pump precluded the use of plaintiffs\u2019 property for agricultural purposes. Likewise, the construction difficulties created by the surrounding uses for the development of either single or multiple residences and nonexistent market for the construction of multiple units indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that the subject parcel was unsuitable for either of the remaining uses permitted by the defendant\u2019s ordinance. Upon these facts the property is so devoid of feasibility for use as zoned that the ordinance is deemed confiscatory.\u201d 46 Mich App 344, 350.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">This is not a situation where plaintiffs argue that the difference in value alone, between land used as the existing ordinance requires, and land used as they would like to, is of such substantial disparity as to render that ordinance confiscatory as applied to their land. The problem in the instant case is that while the land will have some value if used as zoned, it would require such extensive changes at tremendous cost as to virtually transform the nature of the property. In <em>Fenner v Muskegon, </em>331 Mich 732; 50 NW2d 210 (1951), we found application of a zoning ordinance restricting land to residential use \"in practical effect, confiscatory of plaintiffs\u2019 property\u201d. 331 Mich 732, 736. The subject property, low marshy land, was \"not suitable for the erection of residences or homes, or buildings of any kind without expending substantial sums for footings, excepting a strip along the northerly line of the property including an area where plaintiffs have removed sand\u201d. 331 Mich 732, 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The reasoning of the Court of Appeals in the instant case was consistent with this approach, finding, as in <em>Spanich v Livonia, </em>355 Mich 252; 94 NW2d 62 (1959), where we adopted the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>court\u2019s holding, that \"it would be financially unsound to develop [the property] for residences\u201d. 355 Mich 252, 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We therefore affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that the ordinance amounted to confiscation as applied to plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">V \u2014Is the Monroe Township Mobile-Home Park Zoning Invalid as Spot Zoning?</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The Monroe Township zoning ordinance has no separate classification for mobile homes. Mobile homes are permitted only within districts zoned commercial upon approval by the Board of Appeals on a case-by-case basis. Thus, the ordinance permits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\"\u00a7 9.1(g) A trailer coach park if the Board of Appeals finds such would be constructed and operated in accordance with the State law, but no permit therefor shall be issued until after a public hearing has been had thereon by the Board of Appeals after five days\u2019 previous notice in writing thereof has been given to all property owners within 1/2 mile of the perimeter of the site of the proposed Trailer Coach Park, and the Board of Appeals determines after such hearing that the use of the proposed site as a Trailer Coach Park would not be detrimental to the interest of the majority of the property owners within 1/2 mile of the perimeter of the proposed site and subject to such other general limitations and guides as herein established for the Board of Appeals including public notice of such hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Plaintiffs contend that such a scheme is invalid as spot zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 property is not in a commercial zone so they have no standing to challenge the validity of such an ordinance, on the one hand. On the other hand, plaintiffs have not in this case chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>lenged the validity of the ordinance on the basis of exclusion, so we are not called upon to consider whether exclusion exists. In any event, we have found the ordinance invalid for lack of a master plan so the case is otherwise disposed of in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">VI \u2014Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The Court of Appeals reversal of the trial court is affirmed but for a different reason. The Court of Appeals opinion as to which mobile-home park standards apply is vacated for the reasons that this matter was not argued in the trial court and there is no proper record for the Court of Appeals or this Court upon which to make a decision.

That conclusion affords neither a workable standard \u2014 if it can be called a \"standard\u201d \u2014 nor any furtherance of the legislative objectives in zoning enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The legislature, acting properly within its competence, has in this case placed the zoning authority in the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The Court\u2019s role is to ascertain that correct procedures are followed and that appropriate standards are employed.

There are moderate-priced homes to the northwest, a higher-priced development to the southwest, a subdivision described as \"upper middle class\u201d directly west of the quarry (across Dixie Highway), and additional residential areas north of the quarry.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">Similarly, despite the rock formation underlying much of the township, including plaintiffs\u2019 property, subdivisions have been developed with single-family residences. The testimony tends to show that sewer and water mains have been and can be installed and that the additional cost would not substantially increase the cost of a dwelling unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">Plaintiffs introduced evidence that there was not \"very much\u201d residential development in the \"very immediate\u201d area during the last ten years; that \"at the present time the demand and the market does not warrant\u201d the investment required to construct multiple dwellings and that a 100-unit multiple development operated by the plaintiffs located in the City of Monroe has a 10% vacancy factor. That evidence is not so overwhelmingly persuasive as to leave us with a definite and firm conviction that the trial judge erred in finding that plaintiffs\u2019 property could feasibly be developed for single-family or multiple uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The immediate area may not have been ripe for development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>during the last ten years; the record does not establish that the area cannot be developed now or in the near future for single-family use. Nor does the unelaborated testimony concerning current market conditions as it affects investment in multiple development inexorably lead to the conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 property cannot presently or in the near future be so developed. For all that appears on the record, the conditions complained of are temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">A different result might be in order if the record established that by reason of improbability of substantial reduction in present high costs of construction and financing and of substantial improvement in demand for conventional housing at this location, a competent and prudent developer of land, production or custom homes or multiple dwellings would not, and in the near future is not likely to be willing to, make the investment required to bring into reality the planned use of this property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b625-13\"> The facts are fully stated in the opinions written by Justice Williams.

S. 1951 \u00a7 403\u201d. 361 P2d 191, 193-194.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In <em>Gayland v Salt Lake County, </em>11 Utah 2d 307; 358 P2d 633 (1961), the Court held that a county planning commission has authority to pass a valid zoning ordinance prior to adoption of a master plan. The Court could do nothing else, because, while a Utah county board of commissioners <em>may </em>appoint a county planning commission whose function it is to make and adopt a master plan, the statutes permitting the county commissioners to zone do not require them to do so with regard to any plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">\"The boards of county commissioners of the respective counties within the state are authorized and empowered to provide for the physical development of the unincorporated territory within the county and for the zoning of all or any part of such unincorporated territory in the manner hereinafter provided.\u201d UCA 1953 17-27-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">While the planning commission, once created, is empowered to adopt a master plan, \"its purpose and effect shall be solely to aid the planning commission in the performance of its duties\u201d. UCA 1953 17-27-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Therefore, there is little value in using Utah law as precedent for interpreting our Michigan statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">The District of Columbia statute construed in <em>Citizen\u2019s Association of Georgetown, Inc v Zoning Commission of the District of Columbia, </em>155 US App DC 233; 477 F2d 402 (1973), provided that zoning be made \"in accordance with a comprehensive plan\u201d. This plan was different, said the Court, from the comprehensive plan referred to in the National Capital Planning. Act, and referred to the legislative history of the planning act in which the Legislature specifically rejected the suggestion that the local zoning commission be bound by the planning agency\u2019s comprehensive plan, instead intending that the plan be purely advisory. This was in 1926, and the Court found no indication that Congress, in subsequent enactments, intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>change this relationship. 155 US App DC 233, 238, fn 16; 477 F2d 402, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Alabama statute, too, requires that zoning regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\"><em>Come v Chancy, </em>289 Ala 555; 269 So 2d 88 (1972), dealt not with whether a plan must precede an ordinance, but with whether a city must be bound by a master plan when rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Although quoting with approval that part of <em>Shelton v Bellevue, supra, </em>which explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">\"Municipal 'zoning\u2019 on the other hand, is, in effect, a part of and an end result or product of effective municipal 'planning,\u2019 for it is through the medium of enacted and enforceable zoning regulations that the aims and objectives of the land-use-classification facet of over-all municipal 'planning\u2019 may be carried to fruition. Because an ad hoc, piecemeal approach to municipal 'zoning\u2019 lends itself more readily to arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or spot zoning situations, it follows that there must be a direct and tangible link between over-all municipal 'planning\u2019 and over-all municipal 'zoning.\u2019 \u201d 73 Wash 2d 28, 35-36; 435 P2d 949, 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">The Alabama court found that the zoning ordinance must govern. Therefore, if a city such as Tuscaloosa, which had a comprehensive plan, including master guidelines and zoning ordinances, rezoned, then that amendment becomes part of the comprehensive plan, displacing all contrary provisions. The Court did, however, go beyond those courts which have merely required zoning in accordance with the general welfare, and require that the growth and welfare of the entire city be taken into account. 289 Ala 555, 563; 269 So 2d 88, 95-96. Thus, even with statutory language of the enabling act, this appears to be another court groping uncomfortably with equating zoning and planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">In <em>Raabe v City of Walker, </em>383 Mich 165, 178; 174 NW2d 789 (1970), this Court was evaluating the effect of an unadopted plan, rather than the total absence of any plan. Further, although we did not emphasize the unique language of the Michigan statute, it should be noted that <em>Raabe, </em>as did <em>Biske v City of Troy, </em>381 Mich 611; 166 NW2d 453 (1969), refused to give a zoning ordinance provided without an adopted plan the same presumption of validity as \"any regular-on-its-face\u201d ordinance or amendment, 383 Mich 165, 178. While <em>Raabe </em>and <em>Biske </em>dealt with the absence of formally adopted plans, this is the first time we have been asked to review the effect of an ordinance promulgated without any planning at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b648-12\"> \"Appellants urge that the action of the council was unreasonable and in excess of the authority delegated to it by Ordinance No. 90500 for the reason that the conditional use permit does not harmonize with the elements or objectives of the master plan. It would appear that the 'Master Plan\u2019 is something distinct from the zoning ordinance. It is authorized by 'The Planning Act of 1929\u2019 (Stats. 1929, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>1805; 2 Deering\u2019s General Laws, Act 5211b). A reading of the Planning Act of 1929 reveals the 'Master Plan\u2019 to be 'a comprehensive, long-term, general plan for the physical development of the city * * * which in the commission\u2019s judgment bears relation to the planning thereof.\u2019 The zoning ordinance may have been adopted to implement the 'Master Plan,\u2019 but it is not the plan itself.\u201d <em>Wheeler v Gregg, </em>90 Cal App 2d 348; 203 P2d 37 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">An intermediate approach was taken by the Supreme Court of Connecticut in <em>Dooley v Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>154 Conn 470; 226 A2d 509 (1967), which concluded by construing the statutes that the law of Connecticut was that although the master plan was not the zoning ordinance, neither was the master plan binding on the zoning commission. In a modified <em>Kozesnik </em>approach, the Court held that the statutory comprehensive plan is found in the zoning regulations themselves, but that the zoning commission considered the recommendations in the master plan of development, and noted changes in accordance with it. Most useful to this discussion, however, was the observation:</p>\n<p id=\"AJn\">\"Pursuant to the town charter and, presumably acting under General Statutes \u00a7 8-23 as a planning commission, the plan and zoning commission in 1961 adopted v/hat it termed a comprehensive plan 'to serve as a guide to the future growth, improvement, and development of the Town of Fairfield.\u2019 It also recognized at the time \u201cthe necessity for regularly reviewing, updating and revising\u2019 such a \u00a1plan 'in the changing conditions and unforeseen needs\u2019 of the town. There is a difference in the functions of a zoning commission and the functions of a planning commission even though, as in Fairfield, these functions may be exercised by a single commission as provided for under General Statutes \u00a7 8-4a. 'Its duties in each category are separate yet related.\u2019 The 1961 plan of development is properly called a master plan.\u201d 154 Conn 470, 472-473; 226 A2d 509, 511. (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The Oregon Supreme Court, in <em>Fasano v Board of County Commissioners, </em>264 Or 574; 507 P2d 23 (1973), construed that state\u2019s statutes thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">\"The basic instrument for county or municipal land use planning is the 'comprehensive plan.\u2019 Haar, <em>In Accordance with a Comprehensive Plan, </em>68 Harv. L. Rev. 1154 (1955); 1 Yokley, Zoning Law and Practice, \u00a7 3-2 (1965); 1 Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning and Planning, \u00a7 9-1 (3d ed 1969). The plan has been described as a general plan to control and direct the use and development of property in a municipality. * * * In Oregon the county planning commission is required by ORS 215.050 to adopt a comprehensive plan for the use of some or Eill of the land in the county. Under ORS 215.110(1), after the comprehensive plan has been adopted, the planning commission recommends to the governing body of the county the ordinances necessary to 'carry out\u2019 the comprehensive plan. The purpose of the zoning ordinances, both under our statute and the general law of land use regulation, is to 'carry out\u2019 or implement the comprehensive plan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>1 Anderson, American Law of Zoning, \u00a7 1.12 (1968). Although we are aware of the analytical distinction between zoning and planning, it is clear that under our statutes the plan adopted by the planning commission and the zoning ordinances enacted by the county governing body are closely related; both are intended to be parts of a single integrated procedure for land use control. The plan embodies policy determinations and guiding principles; the zoning ordinances provide the detailed means of giving effect to those principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">\"ORS 215.050 states county planning commission 'shall adopt and may from time to time revise a comprehensive plan.\u2019 In a hearing of the Senate Committee on Local Government, the proponents of ORS 215.050 described its purpose as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\" ' ** * * The intent here is to require a basic document, geared into population, land use, and economic forecasts, which should be the basis of any zoning or other regulations to be adopted by the county. * * * \u2019\u201d [Note omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">\"In addition, ORS 215.055 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">\" '215.055 Standards for plan. (1) The plan and all legislation and regulations authorized by ORS 215.010 to 215.233 shall be designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and shall be based on the following considerations, among others: The various characteristics of the various areas in the county, the suitability of the areas of particular land uses and improvements, the land uses and improvements in the areas, trends in land improvement, density of development, property values, the needs of economic enterprises in the future development of the areas, needed access to particular sites in the areas, natural resources of the county and prospective needs for development thereof, and the public need for healthful, safe, aesthetic surroundings and conditions.\u201d 264 Or 574, 582-583; 507 P2d 23, 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">The Court held, that because zoning changes must be \"in conformance with the comprehensive plan\u201d 264 Or 574, 583; 507 P2d 23, 28, it was necessary to have portions of that plan before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> In <em>Kropf, </em>we indicated two principles by which zoning could be declared invalid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\"[F]irst, that there is no reasonable governmental interest being advanced by the present zoning classification itself * * * or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">\"[SJecondly, that an ordinance may be unreasonable because of the purely arbitrary, capricious and unfounded exclusion of other types of legitimate land use in the area in question.\u201d 391 Mich 139, 158.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b654-10\"> To sustain this burden, it is not sufficient to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>property might have been worth more if zoned as plaintiff wishes. <em>Patchak v Lansing Twp, </em>361 Mich 489; 105 NW2d 406 (1960); <em>Paka Corp v City of Jackson, </em>364 Mich 122, 127; 110 NW2d 620 (1961). The value differential, however, is an element which the court will consider in determining whether the existing zoning ordinance amounts to such confiscation. Thus, if property is rendered almost worthless, <em>North Muskegon v Miller, </em>249 Mich 52; 227 NW 743 (1929), and evidence is produced indicating a lack of marketability, <em>Pederson v Harrison Twp, </em>21 Mich App 535; 175 NW2d 817 (1970), indicia of confiscatory hardship are presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"> The Court of Appeals used criteria similar to those in <em>Alderton v Saginaw, </em>367 Mich 28; 116 NW2d 53 (1962).
