In my opinion supplying either school supplies or textbooks to private school students as called for in 1974 PA 242, \u00a7 18(3), violates Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2 [Proposal C] as previously interpreted in <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390; 185 NW2d 9 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">A. <em>The scope of the advisory opinion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">In sections I and III of his opinion Justice Levin limits the scope of the issues under consideration in two ways. First, in section I he restricts the Court\u2019s review to the question specifically raised by the Senate in its formal request for an advisory opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">\u201cIs section 18(3) of Enrolled House Bill No. 6100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>constitutional in relation to section 2 of Article VIII of the Constitution of Michigan, as amended, * * * ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Then, in section III Justice Levin eschews consideration of any other state or Federal constitutional issues which might arguably arise in the course of reviewing \u00a7 18(3) in light of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2. Justice Levin states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">\"Proposal C [Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2, second paragraph] does not speak of religion but of nonpublic schools. Proposal C, in contrast with the First Amendment, does not preclude establishment or interference with religion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">\"We therefore have no need to consider whether the challenged program unduly benefits or burdens religion but only whether it directly or indirectly aids or maintains a nonpublic school.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">While the scope of review becomes exceedingly narrow under Justice Levin\u2019s formulation, I believe that he has proposed a reasonable approach for the Court to follow in this advisory opinion. By definition, we are required to proceed in a factual vacuum and interpret the law without the benefits of prior fact finding and legal review. We are accordingly forced to make assumptions concerning how the questioned statute would operate once effective. I think that it is wise for the Court to therefore limit its own range of conjecture as much as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">B. <em>The Constitutionality of \u00a7 18(3) under Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2 (Proposal C).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390; 185 NW2d 9 (1971), this Court outlined the impact of Proposal C on various types of educational assistance programs. Proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>from the premise that the voters in adopting Proposal C were simply intent on outlawing parochiaid,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court found it unnecessary to adopt \"a strict 'no benefits, primary or incidental\u2019 rule\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 384 Mich 390, 413. Instead, the Court favored a reasonable construction of the amendments language. Under this construction the Court concluded that shared time programs \u2014 if properly controlled by the public school system \u2014 and auxiliary services such as health care and remedial reading programs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> could be provided to private schools consonant with the mandate of proposal C.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In my opinion the Court reached correct conclusions in the Traverse City School District case because the services examined therein were properly classified as \"incidental\u201d to a private school\u2019s establishment and existence. (See fn 2, supra). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Such programs as shared time and auxiliary services, to be sure, do help a private school compete in today\u2019s harsh economic climate; but, they are not \"primary\u201d elements necessary for the school\u2019s survival as an educational institution. These incidental services are useful only to an otherwise viable school and are not the type of services that flout the intent of the electorate expressed through Proposal C.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A very different situation is presented, I find, in the case of the textbooks and supplies that would be made available to private schools under \u00a7 18(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When we speak of textbooks and supplies we are no longer describing commodities \"incidental\u201d to a school\u2019s maintenance and support. Textbooks and supplies are essential aids that constitute a \"primary\u201d feature of the educational process and a \"primary\u201d element required for any school to exist. I quote from <em>Bond v Ann Arbor School Dist, </em>383 Mich 693, 702; 178 NW2d 484; 41 ALR3d 742 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\"Applying either the 'necessary elements of any school\u2019s activity\u2019 test or the 'integral fundamental part of the elementary and secondary education\u2019 test, it is clear that books and school supplies are an essential part of a system of free public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">However Proposal C is to be construed, I believe that if the will of the electorate is to be respected it must be read to bar public funding for primary and essential elements of a private school\u2019s existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>As I understand Justice Levin\u2019s opinion he does not actually read Proposal C differently than I do herein. He states, for example, that \"Proposal C clearly bars state support of a nonpublic school\u2019s general educational programs\u201d; and, he points to the same language from <em>Bond v Ann Arbor School Dist </em>that I have quoted above. Furthermore, he reaches the conclusion that providing school supplies to private schools does violate the prohibition of Proposal C. Turning to the textbooks, however, Justice Levin, at least for the moment, reaches a different result by engrafting a new test onto the interpretation of Proposal C expressed in <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, supra. </em>He argues that supplying textbooks to private schools is permissible if the \"dominant effect of the program is furtherance of a substantial governmental purpose, educational or noneducational, clearly distinguishable from support of general educational programs.\u201d While I find this to be an interesting test, I do not think that it has any applicability to our present problem. Proposal C forbids the public support of private schools. I have failed to discover any indication in the language of Proposal C that the people intended to allow primary support for private schools if the private schools were willing to subject themselves to the textbook censorship of the local public school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">C. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In my opinion, furnishing either textbooks or school supplies to private schools constitutes prohibited primary support under Proposal C. I would accordingly read the language of \u00a7 18(3) to apply only to public school students and thereby pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>serve its constitutionality. <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, supra, </em>384 Mich 390, 406.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-6\">T. G. Kavanagh, C. J., and M. S. Coleman and J. W. Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Swainson, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\"> \"As far as the voter was concerned, the result of all the preelection talk and action concerning Proposal C was simply this\u2014 Proposal C was an anti-parochiaid amendment \u2014 no public monies to run parochial schools \u2014 and beyond that all else was utter and complete confusion.\u201d 384 Mich 390, 410, fn 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> The Court carried over to the non-support for private school provisions found in Proposal C the construction advanced in <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of PA 1970, No 100, </em>384 Mich 82; 180 NW2d 265 (1970), for distinguishing between permissible and impermissible state assistance to parochial schools. Since Proposal C speaks broadly in terms of the support and maintenance of all private schools, I think it is a proper interpretation of the <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General </em>rule to state that Proposal C forbids aid that is a \"primary\u201d element of the support and maintenance of a private school but permits aid that is only \"incidental\u201d to the private school\u2019s support and maintenance. 384 Mich 390, 413.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\"> In <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, supra, </em>the Court adopted the description of auxiliary services set forth in MCLA 340.622; MSA 15.3622.

In <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441, 484; 208 NW2d 469 (1973), we said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\"When a court holds an act to be constitutional it does no more than deny a particular claim of unconstitutionality\u201d.

Accordingly, we reject the suggestion that we avoid the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>tutional question by construing \u00a7 18(3) as referring only to children attending public schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A second paragraph of Const 1963, art 8, \u00a7 2, commonly known as Proposal C, was added by vote of the people in 1970:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\"No public monies or property shall be appropriated or paid or any public credit utilized, by the legislature or any other political subdivision or agency of the .state directly or indirectly to aid or maintain any private, denominational or other nonpublic, pre-elementary, elementary, or secondary school.

Proposal C does not seek to bar benefits to nonpublic school children, their parents and persons employed by nonpublic schools as such but, rather, benefits to children, parents and persons so employed which would subvert the purpose of the first sentence barring the use of public monies or property to aid or maintain nonpublic schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The challenged act subsidizes part of the cost of nonpublic school general educational programs by requiring that public school districts offer materials \u2014 textbooks and supplies \u2014 essential to those programs to children residing in the district who attend nonpublic schools. Use of the textbooks and supplies would reduce the cost of general educational programs in those nonpublic schools which theretofore provided textbooks and supplies. In schools which did not furnish textbooks and supplies, students and parents would be relieved of that cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>While Proposal C clearly bars state support of a nonpublic school\u2019s general educational programs, it does not bar all state action which tends to support such programs.

The challenged act, by offering free textbooks, may encourage the adoption by nonpublic schools of textbooks approved by a school district of the state. To the extent nonpublic schools do adopt state or school district approved and provided textbooks, the state or school district may achieve a measure of guidance of nonpublic school instruction in the subjects for which such textbooks are adopted. The establishment and implementation of such guidance would be a substantial governmental purpose clearly distinguishable from support of general educational programs. Whether the dominant effect of providing textbooks to nonpublic school children is implementation of such a governmental purpose depends on a factual appraisal we cannot make because no factual record has been or \u2014 this being a request for an advisory opinion \u2014 could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Without such a record, we cannot further advise. We have previously adverted to the limitations inherent in an advisory opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Where resolution requires a factual presentation, our advice necessarily will often be qualified by the absence of a factual predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We appreciate that our construction of Proposal C in this opinion and in <em>Traverse </em>City, <em>supra, </em>requires the courts to make subtle determinations. \"The argument that making 'fine distinctions\u2019 between what is and what is not absolute under the Constitution is to render us a government of men, not laws, gives too little weight to the fact that it is an essential part of adjudication to draw distinctions, including fine ones, in the process of inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>preting the Constitution.\u201d <em>Walz v Tax Commission of the City of New York, </em>397 US 664, 679; 90 S Ct 1409; 25 L Ed 2d 697 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We advise that 1974 PA 242 is unconstitutional insofar as it requires school districts to furnish nonpublic school children ordinary consumable supplies.
