LEON, United States District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Defendants Dawayne Brown, Ira Adona, Breal Hicks, and Keith Matthews (collectively, the \u201cMoving Defendants\u201d) have moved to dismiss Counts 3, 9, 11, 13, and 15 of the indictment in this case. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Joint Mot. to Dismiss Counts 9, 11, 13, and 15 and Incorporated Mem. of P. <em>&amp; </em>A. (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Mot.\u201d) [Dkt. # 139]; Def. Matthews\u2019 Unopposed Mot. to Adopt and Join Co-Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Dismiss Counts 9, 11, 13, and 15 [Dkt. # 140]; Defs.\u2019 Reply to Gov\u2019t\u2019s Response to Defs.\u2019 Joint Mot. to Dismiss Counts 3, 9, 11, 13, and 15 (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Reply\u201d) at 1 n.l [Dkt. # 149] (adding Count 3 to list of counts for which defendants seek dismissal). \u2022 In those five counts, the Moving Defendants are charged with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which punishes anyone who \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which the person <em>may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, </em>uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (2012) (emphasis added). This pre-trial motion presents the question whether a D.C.Code offense can serve as the predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d underlying a charged violation of \u00a7 924(c), or instead whether a federal, U.S.Code offense is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">I conclude Congress intended for \u00a7 924(c) to reach only federal, U.S. Code crimes. And therefore, notwithstanding this District Court\u2019s unique jurisdictional mandate, the Government may <em>not </em>bring \u00a7 924(c) charges in the District of Columbia that it quite clearly could not bring elsewhere in any of the fifty states \u2014 i.e., charges predicated on local or state crimes \u2014 which would otherwise unfairly subject D.C. defendants to more severe penalties. Accordingly, after careful consideration of the Moving Defendants\u2019 motion, the Government\u2019s opposition thereto,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the arguments of counsel at the motions hearing held on May 29, 2014, the parties\u2019 supplemental pleadings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the relevant law, the Court GRANTS the Moving Defendants\u2019 motion and DISMISSES Counts 3, 9, 11,- 13, and 15 from the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The four Moving Defendants, along with two other defendants, were indicted by a federal grand jury in September 2013 for numerous charges, including Conspiracy to Distribute and Possess with Intent to Distribute One Kilogram or More of a Mixture or Substance Containing Phencycli-dine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. <em>See </em>Superseding Indictment [Dkt. # 25] (Count 1). The 39-count indictment also charges the Moving Defendants with additional crimes of violence, firearms offenses, and narcotics offenses, some of which are federal, U.S.Code offenses, and some of which are local, D.C.Code offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">As relevant here, the Moving Defendants are charged in Counts 9, 11, 13, and 15 with Using, Carrying, and Possessing a Firearm During a Crime of Violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Each of those four counts is tied to an underlying D.C.Code offense as the predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d supporting the \u00a7 924(c) charge: Count 9 relates to Count 8, which alleges Kidnapping While Armed, in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-2001, 22-4502; Count 11 relates to Count 10, which alleges Armed Robbery, in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-2801, 22-4502; Count 13 relates to Count 12, which alleges Extortion While Armed, in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-3251, 22-4502; and Count 15 relates to Count 14, which alleges First Degree Burglary While Armed, in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-801(a), 22-4502. In addition, one of the Moving Defendants, Keith Matthews, is alone charged in Count 3 with an additional violation of \u00a7 924(c) in relation to a crime of violence, relating to Count 2, which alleges Assault With a Dangerous Weapon, in violation of D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-402, 22-4502.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Section 924(c) provides for a five-year (or longer) mandatory minimum prison sentence for using, carrying, or possessing a firearm during a crime of violence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i \u2014 iii), (B)(i-ii) (setting forth minimum sentences of five years; seven years if firearm is brandished; ten years if firearm is discharged; and ten or thirty years if firearm has certain characteristics). But it also provides for an even longer mandatory minimum penalty \u2014 twenty-five years \u2014 for a second or subsequent \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And further, it mandates that such mandatory sentences for multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions shall not run concurrently with each other or with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(D).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>As a result of this \u201cstacking\u201d effect of consecutive sentences, defendants who are charged with multiple \u00a7 924(c) counts, such as the Moving Defendants here, face very long mandatory minimum sentences if convicted. In this case, the four Moving Defendants effectively face a mandatory life sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant Brown is charged in the indictment with five counts of violating \u00a7 924(c), four of which are challenged in the instant motion. If convicted of all five predicate crimes and the corresponding \u00a7 924(c) charges, the \u00a7 924(c) convictions, <em>alone, </em>would subject him to a mandatory minimum sentence of 105 years in prison. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Suppl. Brief at 3. Defendant Adona is charged with seven counts of violating \u00a7 924(c) in total, exposing him to a potential mandatory minimum sentence of 155 years in prison.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And defendants Hicks and Matthews ar\u00e9 each charged with six counts of violating \u00a7 924(c) in total, exposing them to potential mandatory minimum sentences of 130 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">This case presents a statutory construction question of first impression in our Circuit: what does the phrase \u201ccrime of violence ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) mean in the specific jurisdictional context of the District of Columbia?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Moving Defendants contend it means only federal crimes punishable under the U.S.Code. The Government, by contrast, reads the phrase more expansively to encompass not only federal offenses, but also D.C.Code offenses which, by operation of a jurisdictional statute unique to the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Columbia, can be brought in this federal district court (under certain conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The question is an important one. If the Moving Defendants\u2019 interpretation is correct, then the five challenged \u00a7 924(c) counts do not properly lie and must be dismissed, significantly reducing their penalty exposure. If the Government is correct, however, it would mean that the Moving Defendants face potential mandatory life sentences. But beyond the consequences for these particular defendants, it would also mean the Government can charge defendants in this District with \u00a7 924(c) counts that it could not bring anywhere else in the country, thereby exposing defendants here to harsher federal penalties for similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Because I conclude that the language of the statute is ambiguous as to the precise issue before this Court, I have had to look at the legislative history and utilize other tools of statutory construction to discern Congress\u2019 intent. Having done so, however, I find that these sources clearly indicate that Congress in fact intended \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s scope to reach only federal, U.S.Code predicates, <em>not </em>state felonies. And even if this intent were not clear, the ambiguity in the statute <em>alone </em>would be sufficient to invoke the rule of lenity in favor of the Moving Defendants here. Accordingly, for the following reasons I find that a D.C.Code offense cannot support a \u00a7 924(c) charge, and therefore the challenged counts must be dismissed..</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">I. Plain Text of the Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">As with all exercises in statutory interpretation, the language of the statute itself is the Court\u2019s starting point. <em>E.g., Ransom v. FIA Card Servs., N.A., </em>562 U.S. 61, 131 S.Ct. 716, 723-24, 178 L.Ed.2d 603 (2011). Indeed, the Supreme Court has said that \u201c[t]he first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning <em>with regard to the particular dispute in the case.\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., Inc., </em>534 U.S. 438, 450, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002) (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]f the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and con-sistente, the inquiry ceases].\u201d <em>Id. </em>If not, however, I must turn to other tools of statutory construction. <em>See Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, </em>261 U.S. 514, 519, 43 S.Ct. 428, 67 L.Ed. 778 (1923) (\u201cRules of statutory construction are to be invoked as aids to the ascertainment of the meaning or application of words otherwise obscure or doubtful. They have no place, as this court has many times held, except in the domain of ambiguity.\u201d) For the reasons discussed below, I find \u00a7 924(c) to be ambiguous with regard to the particular issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Section 924(c)(1) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">... any person who, during and in relation .to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime \u2014 [be sentenced to an additional, mandatory term of imprisonment].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (2012). Although the statute then defines the term \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d in a manner that makes clear it must be a federal, U.S.Code offense, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>not define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d with similar clarity. Instead, a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(c), is defined generally as a felony that either \u201c(A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The question presented by the instant motion, therefore, is what universe of predicate crimes is covered by the phrase \u201ccrime of violence ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\u201d The Moving Defendants argue that it means only federal crimes. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 2. The Government, by contrast, argues that the phrase is unambiguous and means just what it says \u2014 i.e., literally <em>any </em>crime of violence offense, regardless whether federal or state, that technically <em>may </em>be brought in a federal district court. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 2-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As an initial matter, this question would present little difficulty if raised in any other federal district court in the country because the distinction between the parties\u2019 two readings of the statute would be one without a difference. Put simply, outside of the District of Columbia, the phrase \u201ccrime of violence ... for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d is susceptible to only one meaning \u2014 a federal, U.S.Code offense. This is true for two reasons. First, a federal district court is \u201ca court of the United States,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and there is no dispute that in the context of criminal jurisdiction, the phrase \u201cmay be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d limits the application of \u00a7 924(c) to crimes of violence which can be charged in a federal district court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 2; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (\u201cThe district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\u201d). Second, it is axiomatic that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over state criminal offenses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See Beal v. Missouri Pac. R.R. Corp., </em>312 U.S. 45, 49-50, 61 S.Ct. 418, 85 L.Ed. 577 (1941) (\u201cThe federal courts are without jurisdiction to try alleged criminal violations of state statutes.\u201d); <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 104-05, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943) (\u201cSince there is no common law offense against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>United States, the administration of criminal justice under our federal system has rested with the states, except as criminal offenses have been explicitly prescribed by Congress.\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 32-34, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812) (holding that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to try criminal charges based on the common law, and all federal crimes must be based on a statute of Congress). Accordingly, the only criminal offenses that can be prosecuted in (almost all) federal district courts are federal, U.S.Code offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Not so in the District of Columbia, however, where this District Court has unique jurisdictional features. Until the enactment of the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 (\u201cCourt Reform Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 473 (1970), federal courts in D.C. exercised a combination of federal and local jurisdiction, including original jurisdiction over all felony cases. <em>See, e.g., Thompson v. United States, </em>548 F.2d 1031, 1033-34 (D.C.Cir.1976). Through the Court Reform Act, Congress provided for the Superior Court and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to assume responsibility for local jurisdiction, similar to that exercised by state courts, including over criminal matters. <em>See id. </em>But the act did not completely end this District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over local criminal offenses, as the Government rightly points out. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 3. Instead, as part of the same act, Congress provided that \u201cthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction of ... [a]ny offense under any law applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia which offense is joined in the same information or indictment with any Federal offense.\u201d Court Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 91-358, title I, \u00a7 111, 84 Stat. 473, 477-78 (codified at D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3)); <em>see also </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 23-101. In other words, this Court may still exercise jurisdiction over local D.C.Code criminal offenses, but only in a manner similar to pendent jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Kember, </em>648 F.2d 1354, 1359-60 (D.C.Cir.1980) (analogizing D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3) to civil law doctrine of pendent jurisdiction over state claims); <em>United States v. Shepard, </em>515 F.2d 1324, 1330-31 (D.C.Cir.1975) (same). Accordingly, the Government is technically correct \u2014 and the Moving Defendants do not dispute, as a jurisdictional matter\u2014 that the D.C.Code offenses underlying the challenged \u00a7 924(c) counts in this case <em>may </em>be prosecuted in this Court, provided they are properly joined to federal offenses in the same indictment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Based on this unique jurisdictional statute, the Government contends that the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d plain language of \u00a7 924(c) requires the conclusion that the Government is permitted to charge the way it did here. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 4. Unfortunately, the issue is not so simple. Indeed, it is ironic, to say the least, that the very statute that makes the Government\u2019s reading possible \u2014 D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3) \u2014 is also what makes \u00a7 924(c) ambiguous as applied to the case before me. For in the final analysis, there are two plausible ways to read the phrase \u201cmay be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>as regards a predicate crime of violence. Taken most literally (and broadly), the phrase could encompass any crime of violence that <em>may </em>\u2014i.e., can possibly \u2014 be prosecuted in a federal district court, which might include, as here, non-federal crimes that can be brought in federal court only by operation of some other statute. On the other hand, the language could be read more narrowly (and perhaps more naturally) as simply meaning federal offenses \u2014 i.e., only crimes of violence that <em>themselves </em>may be prosecuted in federal district court <em>directly </em>because such court has original jurisdiction over them, a universe limited to federal, U.S.Code offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Accordingly, my inquiry does not end with the plain text of \u00a7 924(c), and I must look at the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II. Statutory and Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Though the legislative history was, unfortunately, not briefed by the parties, \u201c[wjhere, as here, resolution of a question of federal law turns on a statute and the intention of Congress, we look first to the statutory language and then to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 896, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). Having done so, I conclude that Congress clearly intended to punish only using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in relation to the commission of a <em>federal </em>crime \u2014 i.e., a U.S.Code violation \u2014 and not state or local crimes. Thus, notwithstanding the District of Columbia\u2019s unique federal character, I find Congress did not intend to reach these acts and, moreover, it would be manifestly unfair to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">a. Original Enactment</p>\n<p id=\"AbO\">Congress enacted \u00a7 924(c) in October 1968 as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.L. No. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In its initial form, Section 924(c) read, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">Whoever \u2014 (1) uses a firearm to commit <em>any felony which may he prosecuted in a court of the United States, </em>or (2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of <em>any felony which may he prosecuted in a court of the United States, </em>shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Pub.L. No. 90-618, \u00a7 924(c), 82 Stat. 1213 (emphasis added). This provision was originally offered as an amendment on the House Floor by Representative Richard Poff of Virginia, <em>see </em>114 Cong. Rec. 22231 (July 19, 1968), and passed the same day, <em>see id. </em>at 22248. As a result, \u201cthe committee reports and congressional hearings to which [the court] normally turn[s] for aid in these situations simply do not exist, and [the court is] forced in consequence to search for clues to congressional intent in the sparse pages of floor debate that make up the relevant legislative history.\u201d <em>Busic v. United States, </em>446 U.S. 398, 405, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980) (specifically discussing \u00a7 924(c) and the Poff amendment), <em>superseded by statute, </em>Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 1005, 98 Stat. 1837, <em>as recognized in Abbott v. United States, </em>562 U.S. 8, 131 S.Ct. 18, 28, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010). In introducing the amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ment, Congressman Poff made it unmistakably clear that the provision applied only to <em>federal </em>predicate felonies, and his remarks, while \u201cnot dispositive of the issue of \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s reach, [] are certainly entitled to weight, coming as they do from the provision\u2019s sponsor.\u201d <em>Simpson v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 6, 13, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978) (discussing Poffs remarks), <em>superseded by statute, </em>Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 1005, 98 Stat. 1837, <em>as recognized in United States v. Gonzales, </em>520 U.S. 1, 10, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">First, Congressman Poff stated that his amendment \u201cmakes it a separate Federal crime to use a firearm in the commission of <em>another Federal crime,\u201d </em>114 Cong. Rec. 22231 (emphasis added), and he explained that the purpose of attaching a mandatory minimum sentence is \u201cto persuade the man who is tempted to commit a <em>Federal </em>felony to leave his gun at home,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added). Next, and more importantly, he explicitly contrasted his proposed amendment with one proposed earlier by Representative Bob Casey of Texas \u2014 which would have applied to both federal <em>and state </em>felonies- \u2014 and set forth his legal, practical, and policy reasons for why \u201c[m]y substitute is confined to Federal felonies.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 22231-32. In explaining one of those reasons for limiting the application of his amendment to federal felonies\u2014 avoiding the burden on the prosecutor of proving a given firearm moved in interstate commerce in order to establish federal jurisdiction \u2014 Congressman Poff noted that \u201c[ejvery Federal felony <em>defined in the code </em>already has its own jurisdictional base,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 22231, which further indicates he contemplated only U.S.Code offenses as predicates.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Ultimately, a Conference Committee adopted Congressman Poffs version of \u00a7 924(c) with only minor changes, and the Conference Report itself described the House bill as punishing \u201ca person [who] uses a firearm to commit, or carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of, a <em>Federal </em>felony.\u201d <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 90-1956, at 31 (1968) (Conf.Rep.) (emphasis added); <em>see also Simpson, </em>435 U.S. at 14, 98 S.Ct. 909 (detailing Congressional process of approving \u00a7 924(c)). Given the existence of such clear legislative history, I think it beyond question that Congress intended \u00a7 924(c) to apply only to federal predicate crimes when it first enacted the provision. <em>See United States v. Dorsey, </em>591 F.2d 922, 941 (D.C.Cir.1978) (noting that statement by Congressman Poff \u201cmade in the context of explaining why the drafters had <em>not </em>included <em>state </em>offenses among those felonies the commission of which is an element of section 924(c)(2) ... seems <em>relevant </em>only to <em>defining the \u2018commission of [a] felony\u2019 element </em>under section 924(c)(2)\u201d (emphasis added)), <em>superseded by statute as recognized in United States v.

But there is no basis to believe Congress intended to treat D.C. crimes any differently from state crimes for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u00a7 924(c). In fact, the additional context and legislative history available persuades me of just the opposite because the <em>very same Congress </em>that enacted \u00a7 924(c) in 1968 passed a similar measure for the District of Columbia just nine months earlier, amending a D.C.Code provision that punished possessing a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence by enhancing its penalties. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 90-226, \u00a7 605, 81 Stat. 734 (1967) (now codified at D.C.Code \u00a7 22-4504(b)).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, as Senator Peter Dominick of Colorado noted on the Senate floor when proposing an amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 that differed slightly from Congressman Poffs (in that it proposed to punish the defendant who used or carried a firearm while committing a \u201cFederal crime of violence\u201d as opposed to a \u201cFederal felony,\u201d <em>see </em>114 Cong. Rec. 22231), his amendment was \u201cbased on the same formula, insofar as practicable, as that approved by the Congress and signed by the President just 9 months ago as part of the omnibus crime law for the District of Columbia.\u201d 114 Cong. Rec. 27142 (Sept. 17, 1968) (statement of Senator Dominick). Like Congressman Poffs ultimately successful amendment, <em>see </em>114 Cong. Rec. 22231,-Senator Dominick stressed that his proposed amendment applied only to predicate federal crimes, not state crimes. <em>See </em>114 Cong. Rec. 27143. Acknowledging that any version of the amendment so cabined to federal crimes would necessarily be limited in effect because most crimes are state crimes, he nonetheless emphasized that \u201c[b]y its enactment, [Congress] can stress to State and local legislative bodies the desirability of their enacting similar measures. We recently took this step for residents of the District of Columbia. Let us now do it for the rest of the Nation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Congress ultimately adopted Congressman Poffs version of \u00a7 924(c) over Senator Dominick\u2019s, I nonetheless find this floor statement instructive for -two reasons: (1) Senator Dominick discussed D.C. much like a state for purposes of \u00a7 924(c), and (2) it highlights that the very Congress that enacted \u00a7 924(c) did so with knowledge that it had just months earlier amended a similar statute that applied to local, D.C.Code crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Considered together, these factors \u2014 the sponsor\u2019s statements, Congress\u2019 specific rejection of the alternative Casey amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ment, the use of the word \u201cfederal\u201d in the Committee Report, and the pre-existence of a parallel provision in the D.C.Code\u2014 leave one hard pressed to find <em>any </em>congressional intent whatsoever to capture D.C.Code offenses as predicate crimes triggering \u00a7 924(c), regardless of D.C\u2019s unique federal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">b. Subsequent Amendments</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Congress has subsequently amended \u00a7 924(c) multiple times, often to expand its reach or increase the severity of its penalties. <em>See, e.g., Abbott v. United States, </em>562 U.S. 8, 131 S.Ct. 18, 29, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010) (recounting statutory amendments to \u00a7 924(c)). Yet there is no indication that Congress\u2019 intent changed over time as to the scope of predicate crimes sufficient to support a \u00a7 924(c) charge. How so?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">As relevant here, Congress amended \u00a7 924(c) as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1837 (1984), in part by replacing the \u201cany felony\u201d language with the phrase \u201cany crime of violence.\u201d Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 1005.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In that same act, Congress added a definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to Title 18, which applied to all of the provisions in that title that used the phrase, including \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 98-225, at 307 (1983). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d meant \u201c(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 1001 (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16). Although this definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d does not, on its face, illuminate whether the crime must be federal or not, the legislative history for the amendment to \u00a7 924(c) itself makes clear, once again, that Congress had in mind only federal crimes of violence as predicates. The Senate Committee Report explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">The Committee has concluded that subsection 924(c) should be completely revised to ensure that all persons who commit <em>Federal </em>crimes of violence, including those crimes set forth in statutes which already provide for enhanced sentences for their commission with a dangerous weapon, receive a mandatory sentence, without the possibility of the sentence being made to run concurrently with that for the underlying offence or for any other crime without the possibility of a probationary sentence or parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 313 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Just two years later, in 1986, Congress again amended \u00a7 924(c) through the Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act of 1986. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 99-308, 100 Stat. 449 (1986). In that act, Congress clarified which predicate felonies qualified to trigger \u00a7 924(c) by bifurcating the statutory predicate, expanding the phrase \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include a \u201ccrime of violence or drug trafficking crime.\u201d Pub.L. No. 99-308, \u00a7 104. The act also added definitions for both \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to \u00a7 924(c) itself. And while Congress expressly defined \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as a federal offense,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Congress simply carried over the pre-existing statutory definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (while adding the requirement that the crime be a felony). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 99-308, \u00a7 104 (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)) (\u201cFor purposes of this subsection the term \u2018crime of violence\u2019 means an offense that is a felony and \u2014 (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Why Congress chose to make it expressly clear in the text of the statute itself that a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d is a \u201cfederal\u201d felony drug offense while not providing comparable clarity for the term \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d I cannot tell. But once again, the relevant legislative history demonstrates that Congress, when amending \u00a7 924(c), continued to conceive of that statute as applying to federal crimes of violence. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 99-495, at 27 (1986) (the amendment providing for a mandatory prison term for whoever uses or carries a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime \u201cexpands the coverage of the mandatory prison term for using or carrying [a] firearm during and in relation to a <em>Federal </em>crime of violence enacted in October 1984\u201d and \u201cis consistent with Recommendation 17 of The Attorney General\u2019s Task Force on Violent Crime that the mandatory prison term for the use of a firearm apply not only to the commission of crimes of violence but to the commission <em>of Federal </em>felonies generally\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In sum, nowhere in the history of the statute, its multiple amendments, or the accompanying legislative history can I discern any change in Congress\u2019 originally-expressed intent to target only federal felonies. Nor can I discern any intention to include D.C.Code offenses by the use of the term \u201cfederal\u201d in the legislative history. As such, the statutory and legislative history overwhelmingly supports the Moving Defendants\u2019 construction of the statute \u2014 not the Government\u2019s!</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">III. Prior Judicial Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Case law addressing \u00a7 924(c) further supports the Moving Defendants\u2019 position that the section only applies to federal felonies. Although I am not aware of any precedent squarely addressing the specific issue before this Court, the Moving Defendants accurately point out that many courts have interpreted the phrase \u201ccrime ... for which [the defendant] may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d to mean a federal crime. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">In particular, the Supreme Court has routinely treated the phrase as synonymous with a federal crime. In <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>520 U.S. 1, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997), for instance, the Supreme Court considered whether federal courts are required to run a term of imprisonment under \u00a7 924(c) consecutively with a state-imposed sentence. In reaching its holding that they are, the Court contrasted the phrase \u201cany crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d with the text of another sentence in \u00a7 924(c) (now codified at \u00a7 924(c)(i )(D)(ii)), which prohibited courts from running sentences imposed under the section concurrently with \u201cany other term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>520 U.S. at 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032. Unlike the unrestricted phrase \u201cany other term of imprisonment,\u201d the Court highlighted that \u201cCongress <em>explicitly </em>limited the scope of the phrase \u2018any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\u2019 to those \u2018for which [a defendant] may be prosecuted in a court of the United States,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032 (emphasis in original), and in the very next sentence of the opinion described this as meaning that \u201cCongress expressly limited the phrase \u2018any crime\u2019 to <em>only federal </em>crimes,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The Supreme Court has made similar observations \u2014 often drawing directly on Congressman PofPs statements and the legislative history \u2014 in other cases too. <em>See Busic, </em>446 U.S. at 399, 100 S.Ct. 1747 (stating \u00a7 924(c) \u201cauthorizes the imposition of enhanced penalties on a defendant who uses or carries a firearm while committing a <em>federal </em>felony\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Simpson, </em>435 U.S. at 10, 98 S.Ct. 909 (\u201cQuite clearly, \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2113(d) are addressed to the same concern and designed to combat the same problem: the use of dangerous weapons \u2014 most particularly firearms \u2014 to commit <em>federal </em>felonies.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno, </em>526 U.S. 275, 283, 119 S.Ct. 1239, 143 L.Ed.2d 388 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe provisions of the <em>United States Code defining the particular predicate offenses </em>already punish all of the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct except his use or carriage of a gun; \u00a7 924(c)(1) itself criminalizes and punishes such use or carriage \u2018during\u2019 the predicate crime, because that makes the crime more dangerous.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 132, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998) (discussing \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s broad purpose and noting \u201cthe provision\u2019s chief legislative sponsor has said that the provision seeks \u2018to persuade the man who is tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave his gun at home.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">While the Moving Defendants also cite to several decisions from other Circuits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>listing a \u201cfederal\u201d crime as an element of a \u00a7 924(c) violation,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> our own Circuit Court has been similarly straightforward in its even more specific assessment that the predicate must be a U.S.Code violation. In <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>59 F.3d 1323 (D.C.Cir.1995) (en banc), our Circuit Court held that one underlying predicate offense could not support multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions. <em>Anderson, </em>59 F.3d at 1328. In reaching this conclusion, the court\u2014 though not addressing the precise situation before this Court involving D.C.Code offense predicates \u2014 necessarily did focus in detail on the <em>predicate </em>offense underlying a \u00a7 924(c) charge, and in doing so interpreted the statute as meaning \u201c[t]he underlying drug offense or crime of violence is <em>already made a federal crime under another section of the federal code.\u201d Id. </em>at 1331 (emphasis added); <em>see also Dorsey, </em>591 F.2d at 942 (describing, under <em>Block-burger </em>test, the proof of a fact necessary for a \u00a7 924(c)(2) violation as \u201cunlicensed carrying during commission of a <em>federal </em>felony\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Thus, while the persuasiveness of this prior precedent is somewhat limited because it does not squarely address the issue before this Court, I nonetheless find it further supports the Moving Defendants\u2019 position. At a minimum, to the extent some federal courts have simply assumed, without any analysis, that the phrase \u201cmay be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d connotes a federal crime, it serves to highlight what an anomalous circumstance is presented by the Government\u2019s charging decision in this case. But it is also quite clear that when other federal courts \u2014 including our own Circuit Court in <em>Anderson </em>\u2014have engaged in deeper analysis, often citing the legislative history, they have reached the very same conclusion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, contrary to the Government\u2019s suggestion, some courts have indeed done much more than merely use the term \u201cfederal\u201d in the phrase \u201cfederal felony\u201d as \u201cshorthand\u201d for the proposition that \u00a7 924(c) charges are limited to predicate offenses that may be brought in federal court. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 2-3.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>IV. The Government\u2019s Remaining Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Government raises several other arguments opposing the Moving Defendants\u2019 reading of the statute. None of them, however, are persuasive, and they only merit a brief discussion. First, the Government suggests that where cases cited by the Moving Defendants use the word \u201cfederal\u201d to describe the predicate offense underlying a \u00a7 924(c) charge, this adjective should be read merely as \u201cshorthand\u201d for the \u201cunremarkable\u201d proposition that \u00a7 924(c) charges are limited to offenses that \u201cmay be prosecuted\u201d in federal court. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 2-3. Since the word \u201cfederal\u201d is not actually in the statute, the Government argues, this Court should obey the literal words of the statute \u2014 full stop. <em>See id. </em>But even after acknowledging that the case law discussed above is not directly on point (and setting aside our Circuit Court\u2019s more specific reference to the \u201cfederal code\u201d in Anderson), and even ignoring the overwhelming use of the word \u201cfederal\u201d in the legislative history to describe \u00a7 924(c) predicates, this argument is unconvincing by its own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">After all, the Government\u2019s argument that D.C.Code offenses \u201cmay be prosecuted\u201d in this Court rests on D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3), which grants this Court jurisdiction over \u201c[a]ny <em>offense under any law applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia </em>which offense is joined in the same information or indictment with any <em>Federal </em>offense.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3) (emphasis added). The text of this jurisdiction-granting statute thus draws a distinction between D.C.Code offenses and the \u201cfederal\u201d offenses to which they are joined. So if, as the Government contends, the word \u201cfederal\u201d as used in the case law simply means \u201ccan be brought in federal district court,\u201d to include D.C.Code offenses, then the term \u201cfederal\u201d as used in D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3) would be rendered meaningless or superfluous. That, of course, makes little sense, and in fact nothing about D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3) purports to treat D.C.Code offenses as themselves \u201cfederal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Second, for the same reason, the Government\u2019s emphasis on the District of Columbia\u2019s unique position in our federal system and its assertion that \u201cD.C.Code offenses have a distinctive federal character,\u201d <em>see </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 3-4, do not convince me that D.C.Code offenses fall within the ambit of \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s reach. To be sure, D.C. is different from the other fifty states, particularly in the realm of criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But this does not mean D.C.Code offenses are \u201cfederal\u201d in the same sense that U.S.Code offenses are. Again, the linchpin of the Government\u2019s argument, D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3), itself distinguishes between D.C.Code offenses and \u201cfederal\u201d offenses. And there is simply <em>no </em>indication whatsoever in the legislative history of \u00a7 924(c) that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>meant to capture D.C.Code offenses when it used the term \u201cfederal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Third, and finally, the Government draws an analogy to two statutes, the Assi-milative Crimes Act (ACA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, and the Major Crimes Act (MCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, and suggests that its analysis of the reach of \u00a7 924(c) regarding D.C.Code predicates is \u201cconsistent with\u201d decisions by other courts permitting \u00a7 924(c) charges to lie based on charges brought in federal court under these two statutes. <em>See </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 6-7. In the Government\u2019s description, the ACA and the MCA \u201cboth permit local crimes of violence to be prosecuted in federal court,\u201d Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 6, much as D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3) permits D.C.Code offenses to be brought in this District Court. And therefore it follows that if \u00a7 924(c) charges can attach to state crimes brought under the ACA and MCA, <em>see </em>Gov\u2019t\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 6-7 (citing cases), then \u00a7 924(c) charges can just as easily be predicated on D.C.Code offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The Government\u2019s analogy is flawed, however. The ACA and MCA do not \u201cpermit local crimes of violence to be prosecuted in federal courts\u201d directly; on the contrary, those two statutes expressly <em>transform, </em>conduct that is a crime under state law into a federal, U.S.Code offense. Thus, the Government\u2019s citation to the ACA and MCA actually <em>supports </em>the Moving Defendants\u2019 argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">As to the ACA, that statute authorizes the United States to <em>adopt </em>state law as federal law for any act or omission occurring on federal property which, \u201calthough not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in which such place is situated.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 7 (defining territorial jurisdiction of the United States). In other words, a federal indictment charging an assimilated state crime brings the count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, and thus the defendant is charged with a federal, U.S.Code offense. It is not surprising, therefore, that the <em>one </em>case the Government cites in support of its ACA argument itself states that \u201c[a]n assimilated crime <em>is a federal crime </em>for \u00a7 924(c) purposes and is a crime that can be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Terry, </em>131 F.3d 138, 1997 WL 759274, at *2 (4th Cir.1997) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Minger, </em>976 F.2d 185, 187 (4th Cir.1992) (\u201cWhen a state law is assimilated under the ACA, the ACA <em>transforms </em>the state law into a federal law for purposes of prosecution, and any violation of the state law becomes a crime against the United States.\u201d (emphasis added)). Indeed, the Department of Justice itself has acknowledged that prosecutions under the ACA \u201care not to enforce the laws of the state, but to enforce Federal law, the details of which, instead of being recited, are adopted by reference.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Justice, United States Attorneys\u2019 Manual, Title 9, Criminal Resource Manual 667 (Assimilative Crimes Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Next, as to the MCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 grants jurisdiction to federal courts, exclusive of the states, over \u201cIndians\u201d who commit any of certain listed offenses \u201cwithin Indian country.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153; \u00a7 1151 (defining \u201cIndian country\u201d); <em>see also United States v. John, </em>437 U.S. 634, 98 S.Ct. 2541, 57 L.Ed.2d 489 (1978).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Federal statutes define most of the listed offenses, and those that are not so \u201cdefined and punished by Federal law\u201d are to be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the state where the crime was committed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b). Thus, to the extent a listed offense is defined by federal law, it is <em>already </em>a federal, U.S.Code offense, and it is unremarkable that courts have found \u00a7 924(c) counts properly charged based on such an MCA predicate. <em>See, e.g., Standing Bear v. United States, </em>68 F.3d 271, 272 (8th Cir.1995) (affirming that federal district court had jurisdiction over \u00a7 924(c) charge where 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153 conferred federal court jurisdiction for the underlying felony of murder within Indian country, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111). To the extent an offense is not so defined and must instead be defined by state law, on the other hand, the Government has not pointed to any cases involving such a predicate supporting a \u00a7 924(c) charge. But even assuming a \u00a7 924(c) charge would properly lie in that circumstance, the MCA operates to grant federal jurisdiction over those offenses <em>directly </em>when they are charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153. Not so for the D.C.Code jurisdictional statute, which grants this Court jurisdiction over D.C.Code crimes in a manner similar to pendent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In short, a \u00a7 924(c) charge brought under the ACA or MCA is, in fact, predicated on a federal, U.S.Code offense. By contrast, the D.C.Code offenses underlying the \u00a7 924(c) counts at issue in the instant case come before this Court in a completely different posture. As D.C.Code \u00a7 11-502(3) makes clear, this Court has jurisdiction over D.C.Code offenses when they are properly <em>joined </em>to federal, U.S.Code offenses; nothing in that statute, however, converts or morphs those D.C.Code offenses into federal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">While it is true that criminal defendants in the District of Columbia are, at times, treated differently from defendants in other federal courts as a result of this District\u2019s unique joinder provision, our Circuit Court has found that being tried under two statutory schemes at the same time\u2014 and as a result receiving more severe punishment \u2014 does <em>not </em>violate the equal protection clause. <em>See United States v. Sumler, </em>136 F.3d 188, 190-91 (D.C.Cir.1998) (citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>527 F.2d 817, 822 (D.C.Cir.1975)). But while it is one thing for a defendant in this District to incidentally face stiffer sentences as a result of joinder rules, it is quite another for him to face a severe mandatory minimum sentence \u2014 up to and including life in prison \u2014 as a result of the Government electing to bring federal charges here that it could <em>not </em>bring in any of the fifty states.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>deed, to permit the Government to bring the challenged \u00a7 924(c) charges, predicated on D.C.Code offenses, would unfairly distinguish prosecutions of \u00a7 924(c) in this Court from those in all other federal district courts. My review of the legislative history convinces me that Congress did not intend such a sentencing oddity, but even if any ambiguity remained, it should be resolved in favor of the Moving Defendants under the rule of lenity. <em>See, e.g., Simpson, </em>435 U.S. at 14, 98 S.Ct. 909 (applying \u201cthe established rule of construction that \u2018ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971))). Accordingly, the challenged \u00a7 924(c) counts must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">As a result of my ruling today, these four Moving Defendants no longer face a potential sentence of <em>mandatory </em>life in prison, if convicted. With regard to defendant Dawayne Brown, one \u00a7 924(c) charge remains (Count 17). With regard to defendant Ira Adona, three \u00a7 924(c) charges remain (Counts 17, 28, and 29).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> With regard to defendant Breal Hicks, two \u00a7 924(c) charges remain (Counts 17 and 28).

The court further noted that applying \u00a7 924(c) charges to Virgin Islands Code offenses \"would unduly distinguish prosecutions of \u00a7 924(c) in [the District Court of the Virgin Islands] and those in the United States District Courts\u201d and relied on the rule of lenity. <em>Frett, </em>684 F.Supp. at 1328-29.
