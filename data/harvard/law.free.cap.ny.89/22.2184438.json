The order of General Term granted the motion. (Reported below, <em>25 </em>Hun, 475.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-8\"><em>Thomas Richardson </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXx\">No jurisdiction was obtained over Philo Remington, by the service of the summons herein upon him. <em>(Shaw </em>v. <em>Clock, </em>78 N. Y. 194.) Section452 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides simply for cases where one or more of the original parties had such an interest as would enable him to sustain the action, but where the controversy would not be completely settled without the presence of other parties. <em>(Davis v. The Mayor, etc., </em>14 N. Y. 527; <em>Warring </em>v. <em>Warring, 3 </em>Abb. 248; <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>12 How. 39-45; 1 Wait\u2019s Pr. <em>162; Shaw </em>v. <em>Clock, </em>19 Hun, 173; 78 N.

(Code, \u00a7 723 ; <em>McGarry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>v. <em>Bd. of Supvrs., </em>1 Sweeney, 223; Wait\u2019s Code, \u00a7 173; <em>Traver </em>v. <em>Eighth Ave. R. R. Co., </em>3 Keyes, 497; <em>McElwain </em>v. <em>Corning, </em>12 Abb. 116 ; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Milleville Manuf. Co., </em>17 id. 318, <em>n.; Fuller </em>v. <em>Webster F. Ins. Co., </em>12 How. 293.) The prosecution of a suit by an individual banker in a name importing a corporate character, under which he carried on business, is a merely formal error, amendable in the courts of original jurisdiction. <em>(Bk. of Havana </em>v. <em>McGee, </em>20 N. Y. 355 ; <em>Cazett </em>v. <em>Hubbell, </em>36 id. 681; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Washington Ins. Co., </em>33 id. 439; <em>Risley </em>v. <em>Wightman, </em>13 Hun, 164; <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>75 N. Y. 303; <em>Tighe </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>16 Hun, 181; <em>N. Y. Ice Co. </em>v. <em>North-western Ins. Co., </em>23 N. Y. 357; 20 id. 81; 30 id. 383 ; 31 id. 564; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>7 Rob. 506, 508 ; <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>22 Barb. 161; 26 id. 356; 44 id. 528; 21 How. 296; 27 id. 179 ; <em>Englis </em>v. <em>Furmis, </em>3 Abb. 82.) The only way in which the defendant could avail himself of the misnomer or misdescription herein was by answer. This he has failed to do. The objections now made to correct the mist\u00e1ke in defendant\u2019s name are dilatory and should not prevail. (M<em>iller </em>v. <em>Stettiner, </em>22 How. 521; 28 id. 400; <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>16 Wend. 613; 3 Keyes, 497.) Where a party uses all due diligence to discover the true name of a party and fails, he may designate the defendant by any name. (Code, \u00a7 451; <em>Crandall </em>v. <em>Beech et ad., </em>7 How. 271; <em>Pindar </em>v. <em>Block, </em>4 id. 95.) Where a defendant is known as well by one name as by another, he may be sued by either. <em>(Eagleston </em>v. <em>Son, </em>5 Robt. 640.) Plaintiff may sue by any name, and upon learning the true name of defendant, the pleading or proceeding may be amended accordingly. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Stettiner, </em>7 Bosw. 692; <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Sedgwick, </em>6 Cow. 456; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>26 Barb. 359.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b49-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Anv\">The order to amend in this case authorizes the striking out of the name of the defendant and the insertion of the names of three persons as defendants in lieu thereof. Its effect is to continue the action against other and different parties than the one named, thus substituting a caus\u00e9 of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>with, new and other defendants. Such an amendment is not we think, authorized by any provision of the Code or any of the adjudged eases. Section 723 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not cover any such case. While full authority is conferred for adding or striking out the name of a person or a party, or correcting a mistake in such name, it does not sanction an - entire change of name of the defendant by the substitution of another or entirely different defendants. The authorities relating to the question are fully considered in the opinions of the General Term, and it is not necessary to examine them upon this appeal. Although some cases are cited which are supposed to sanction such a rule, they are not weH founded and have not received the approval of this court. The cases of <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Fish </em>(75 N. Y. 304) and <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Cock </em>(78 id. 194), without citing other cases, are directly in point and settle the question adversely to the .claim of the respondent\u2019s counsel. Upon the authority of these decisions the General Term erred, and the order reversing the order of the Special Term should be reversed, and that of the Special Term affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
