Moak </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC\">The proof of service of the original summons upon the defendant Angel\u00ed was not sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court or the clerk of Tioga county to enter the original judgment, and that judgmetit, therefore, was void. <em>(Bloom </em>v. <em>Burdick, </em>1 Hill, 130, 141; Code, \u00a7 246 ; <em>McCombe v. Mayor of New York, </em>17 Abb. 32; <em>Thomas v. Tanner, </em>14 How. 246 ; Throop\u2019s Code, \u00a7 434; 5 How. 346; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>4 Porter [Ala.], 120 ; <em>Norwood v. Riddle, </em>9 id. 425.) The proof of service by the admission of the party does not, as required by section 138 of the Code, state the place of such service, which is necessary to give jurisdiction to the clerk to enter the judgment, and without this the clerk has no authority to enter the judgment, and if he does, it is a nullity. <em>(Torlan </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>48 How. 240 ; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>French, </em>28 N. Y. 295; <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Washhurne, </em>14 How. 380.) This pretended written admission does not state the time of the service, and is for that reason defective. (Code, \u00a7 138, snbd. 4.) A summons must be served by the delivery of a copy thereof. (Code, \u00a7 134; 4 How. 375.) The judgment entered in the Tioga county clerk\u2019s office being void, it cannot be the foundation upon which to predicate a proceeding, under section 375 of the Code of Procedure, to charge a liability upon the defendant Mackey. (2 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict. 645 ; <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Washhurne, </em>14 How. 381, 382; 17 Abb. 44-45 ; 23 Barb. 591; <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Righter, </em>13 How. 45 ; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>10 Weekly Rep. 541; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>12 id. 11; <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>15 Johns. 141; <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>19 id. 39.) Plaintiff\u2019s offer to prove by the defendant Angel\u00ed the genuineness of the signature to the alleged admission of service indorsed in the summons in the judgment-roll on the judgment entered in Tioga county should have been rejected. <em>(Bangs </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>23 Barb. 596, 598 ; <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>15 Johns. 121; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>19 id. 33 ; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Pussol, </em>1 Pet. 328.) A.11 records oi judgment must show upon their face that the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>jurisdiction of the person. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>12 Vt. 11; <em>Hallett v. Righter, </em>13 How. 46.) Upon the proof in this case the claim against this defendant Mackey is barred by the statute of limitations. (2 R. S. 337, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4; <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>4 N. <em>Y. </em>518-521; 30 How.

Ho act or omission of the defendant Angel\u00ed can affect Mackey after the dissolution of the partnership between them. <em>(Van Curen </em>v. <em>Parmerlee, </em>2 N.

If laws are not plainly repugnant to each other, the later will not be deemed a repeal of the former unless in the one last enacted some notice is taken of the other. <em>(Bowen </em>v. <em>Lease, </em>5 Hill, 221; <em>Van Rensselaer </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>5 B. R. 302; 13 N.

Pr. 292; <em>Fergusons. Crawford, </em>70 N. Y. 253; <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Rocheleau, </em>18 id. 92; <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>3 id. 341; <em>Catling </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>16 id. 622; <em>Shaettler </em>v. <em>Gardiner, </em>47 id. 404; <em>Alling </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>70 id. 571; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>67 id. 40; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>75 id. 186.) An error by the clerk or the attorney, in the performance of that duty, might make the judgment irregular, but would not render it void. <em>(Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>17 How. Pr. 477; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Shaver, </em>41 Barb. 157.) An irregular judgment can only be reviewed by a direct proceeding to vacate it. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>U. S. Slate Co., </em>16 How. 129 ; <em>Mitchel </em>v. <em>Van </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Buren, </em>27 N.

Pr. 349; <em>Nones </em>v. <em>The Hope Mutual Insurance Co., </em>8 Barb. 541; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>9 Hun, 567 ; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Vandercook, </em>57 Barb. 175; <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>24 N.

The judgment in suit is neither void nor voidable, and had a motion been made to set it aside as irregular, the court would have denied the motion, or at most ordered the judgment amended <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The admission of service was sufficient under the Code as it stood at that time. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>23 Barb. 304; <em>Wynehamer </em>v. <em>The People, </em>13 N. Y. 395 ; <em>Tallman </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>12 Wend. 227; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Couchman, </em>48 Barb. 74; <em>Van Alstyne </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>25 N. Y. 490 ; <em>White </em>v. <em>Bogart, </em>73 id. 256.) The plaintiff\u2019s right of action is not barred by the statute of limitations. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>72 N.

The defendant\u2019s answer, however, is expressly restricted (\u00a7 1939) to such defense as might have been made to the original action, had summons been served on the debtor so sought to be charged when it was served upon his joint debtors, to objections to the judgment and to defenses or counter-claims which have arisen since. \u2014Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-6\">Rapallo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADq\">Judgment was entered August 31, 1858, in favpr of the plaintiff against Angel\u00ed and Mackey upon a joint contract. The judgment was by default and recited that the summons, and a copy of the complaint had been personally served on Angel\u00ed, one of the defendants. This recital \u25a0 was sufficient to show that the court had acquired jurisdiction, and even if the\u2019proof of service filed with the judgment-roll was defective, that irregularity did not show want of jurisdiction or affect the validity of the judgment. It having been rendered by a court of general jurisdiction, all intendments are in favor of its validity until want of jurisdiction is. affirmatively shown. There was no attempt to disprove the recital, but on the contrary, its truth was affirmatively proved on the trial of this proceeding. If a motion had been made to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>judgment, the informality of the proof of service could have been cured by amendment. ( <em>White </em>v. <em>Bogart, </em>73 N. Y. 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">It stood, therefore, as a valid judgment against both defendants as joint debtors, and bound their joint property, and the separate property of the defendant served. The present proceeding is not a new action, but a proceeding at foot of the judgment, under section 375 of the Code of Procedure, to make .the judgment binding upon the defendant Mackey and his separate property as if he had been originally served. The action had been commenced against him in 1858 by the service of the summons on his co-defendant and joint' contractor Angel\u00ed (Code of Procedure, \u00a7 99), and the present proceeding is in the action which had been thus previously commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The statute of limitations is no defense to this proceeding, unless such defense existed at the time the action was commenced. There is no statute which limits the time within which such a proceeding must be instituted. Section 379 of the Code of Procedure, as it stood when this proceeding was instituted, authorized the defendant to deny the judgment, or set up any defense thereto which may have arisen subsequently, and in addition, to make any defense which he might originally have made to the action. He was under this section at liberty to show that the judgment had been paid or otherwise discharged, and if twenty years had elapsed probably the presumption of payment would have applied. But the action having been commenced in due time, by service on his co-defendant, he cannot sustain the defense of the statute of limitations. The statute places him with regard to his defense in as good a position as though judgment had not been entered, but in no better.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">All concur, except Miller and Tracy, JJ., absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
