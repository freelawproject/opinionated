It was received by defendant on the morning of March 26, and was on that morning presented to the drawees for payment. Said drawees gave their check on a Rew York bank for the amount, and the draft was delivered to them. Defendant did not present the check for payment on that day; it was sent through the clearing-house and presented for payment the next day, but payment was refused, as Culver, Penn &amp; Co. had failed on that day.

Bk. </em>v. <em>Lacombe, </em>84 R. Y. 367; <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Vendryes, </em>19 id. 436; <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>77 id. 573; <em>Scudder </em>v. <em>Union Nat. Bk., </em>1 Otto, 406.) The law of Pennsylvania, in the absence of any evidence, is presumed to be the same as the law. of this State. (1 Wharton on Evidence, \u00a7 34.) This presumption can be overthrown only by proof of the law of Pennsylvania, as a fact, by oral evidence or by the books of reports of cases adjudged in the courts of that State. (Greenleaf, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00a7488; Code of Civil Proc., \u00a7 942.) The judgment-roll, if competent evidence for any purpose, is evidence only of the fact that such an action was brought and such a judgment rendered. For all other purposes it is <em>res inter alios aeta. </em>(Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7 338.) A check received for the amount of a debt due is not payment unless subsequently honored. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>52 N. Y. 173.) _ The courts judicially recognize the existence of the custom in the city of New York for banks to collect, through the clearing-house, all checks received by them under an arrangement by which the actual payment of such checks is not completed until the day subsequent to the receipt thereof. <em>(Agawam Bk. </em>v. Strever, 18 N. Y. 502; <em>Eaton &amp; Co. </em>v. Avery, 83 id. 31; <em>Merch. Nat. Bk. of Whitehall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>id. 333; 3 Encyclopaedia Brittanica [9th ed.], 328; 1 Johnson\u2019s Cyclopaedia, 973; Homan\u2019s Bankers\u2019 Almanac, 1881, p. 284; 2 American Cyclopaedia, 282 ; Report Contr. of the Currency, 1881, p. 24; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Bk. of Fox Lake, </em>4 Abb.

The plaintiff\u2019s delay in asserting its claim against the defendant, and its omission to tender the draft to the defendant, are fatal to its claim. (77 N. Y. 330.) This being an action against the defendant for its alleged negligence, interest is to be allowed upon recovery, if allowed at \u2022 all, merely by way of additional damages. <em>(Brainerd </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>18 N. Y. 35 ; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Van Rensselaer, </em>43 id. 246; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>L. R., 7 H. L. 27; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Trust Co., </em>100 U.

As the draft was payable in New York, the drawer\u2019s liability, wherever it might be sued, was governed by the laws of New York. <em>(Hibernia Nat. Bk. v. Lacombe, </em>84 N. Y. 367 ; <em>Everett, </em>v. <em>Vendryes, </em>19 id. 436; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Meadville Bk. </em>v. <em>Fourth Nat. Bk., </em>77 id. 320.) When a party\u2019s loss has been measured by the amount of a recovery against it, that judgment is then evidence only of the quantum, of damage, and is not in itself evidence of the liability for such damage. <em>(Britton </em>v. <em>Nicholls, </em>3 Morrison\u2019s Transcript, U.

Y. 470.) The appellant having received the draft upon account of an indebtedness to it by the drawer, or in payment of such indebtedness, either <em>sub modo </em>or absolutely, and failing through the negligence of its agent to collect the draft when collection was easy and certain, cannot throw the loss, caused by its carelessness and occasioning the total loss of the fund upon which the draft was drawn through its fault, back upon the drawer. <em>(Bradford </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>38 N. Y. 291.) It was the duty of the defendant to charge the drawer of the draft. (Story on Prom. Notes, \u00a7 339; Daniels on Nego. Instru., \u00a7\u00a7 327, 328, 910, 1625 ; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>The Merch. Bank, </em>Court of Errors, 23 Wend. 238, 239; <em>Montgomery County Bk. </em>v. <em>Albany City Bk., </em>3 Seld. 459; <em>Com. Bk. of Penn. </em>v. <em>Union Bank of New York, </em>11 N. Y. 203.) The judgment record was properly received in evidence. It was competent for the purpose of establishing the measure of damages, and the efforts of appellant to escape the loss it sustained through the negligence of respondent and the futility of these efforts. <em>(Green v. N. R. Co., </em>4 T. R., 589; <em>Pritchard </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>6 M. &amp; G. 165.) The referee was right in computing the interest at seven per cent to January 1, 1880, and after that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>six per cent. <em>(Asso. for Relief of Females </em>v. <em>Eagleson, </em>Sup, Ct., Sp. T., Freedman, J., Daily Register, Nov. 13, 1880 ; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Coll, </em>31 N. J. Eq. 91; S. C., 9 Reporter, 123; Story on Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 311a, note 4, citing <em>Grant v. </em>Healey, 3 - Sumn. 523.) The record, having been offered to show the damages, was competent. (Wharton, \u00a7 823; <em>Farmers &amp; M. Bk. v. Erie R. R. Co., </em>72 N. Y. 188.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b442-5\">Andrews, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"APK\">This court held on the former appeal (77 N. Y. 320) that the whole duty of the defendant to the plaintiff, was not discharged by the presentment, demand and protest of the draft, within such time as is required by the general rule of law, in order to preserve the liability of the drawer, but that having on March 26, 1866, taken the check of the drawees for the draft, it was bound to make immediate presentment, and having delayed the presentment until the 27th, whereby the collection of the check was prevented, in consequence of the failure of Culver, Penn &amp; Co. on that day, the defendant was chargeable with negligence, and a right of action therefor accrued to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">But the court reversed the judgment rendered for the amount of the draft, on the ground that it did not appear that the plaintiff had sustained damages to that extent through the defendant\u2019s negligence. \u25a0 The complaint, in one aspect,- proceeds on the theory that the drawers had not been legally charged by due presentment and protest, and it averred that if legally charged the draft could have been collected from the drawer. This court held the presentment and demand on the 27th, and the service of notice of protest on the 28th, was sufficient within the law merchant to charge the drawer, and that as it appeared that the remedy of the plaintiff against the drawer of the draft was preserved, and that the drawer was solvent, the plaintiff was only entitled to recover the actual damages sustained. The cause -was, therefore, sent back for error in the rule of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">On the second trial, from the judgment on which, this appeal is taken, the plaintiff for the purpose of showing that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>sustained damages from the defendant\u2019s negligence to the full amount of the draft, produced in evidence the record of a judgment rendered in the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County, Pa., in an action by the present plaintiff against the National Bank of Crawford county, a Pennsylvania corporation, the drawer of the draft, whereby it was adjudged that the transaction of March 26,1866, constituted, as between the defendant, the drawer, and the plaintiff, the payee, a payment of the bill, and judgment passed on that ground for the defendant. This judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in an action presenting all the material facts conclusively established, as between the parties thereto, that the receipt of the check of Culver, Penn &amp; Co., and the omission to make due presentment thereof, discharged the drawer\u2019s liability on the draft. The record was, we think, competent evidence in this case upon the question of damages. It seems to us to be quite immaterial to inquire, whether the same judgment would have been rendered if the action had been brought in this State. The plaintiff was compelled to resort to the courts of Pennsylvania, to bring its action against the drawer. No fraud or collusion is shown. The defendant in this action, by its failure to discharge its duty as collecting agent of the plaintiff, made itself liable for the damages the plaintiff has sustained through such neglect of duty. The practical effect of the Pennsylvania judgment, is to deprive the plaintiff of any remedy against the Crawford County Bank. It does not lie with the defendant to say that if the question had been tested in another jurisdiction, the result would have been different. We think, therefore, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, under the proof on the second trial, the full amount of the draft as damages for the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">The referee found, upon sufficient evidence, that no uniform custom in regard to accepting checks from the drawees of sight bills in payment of drafts sent to collecting banks in the city of New York, was proved. The evidence shows that the practice varies with the credit of the drawee, the condition of the money market and other circumstances, and among different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>banks, and the plaintiff had no knowledge of any such custom or practice. So also as to the alleged custom of collecting cheeks through the clearing-house, by which they are not presented to the bank on which they are drawn until the next day after they are received. This practice prevailed only among banks making exchanges through the clearing-house. It did not prevail among other banks, or with savings banks, or trust companies, or with respect to checks on private bankers. The evidence failed to establish a certain, uniform or general custom, in respect either to accepting checks for drafts or collecting them through the clearing-house. It is unnecessary therefore to consider whether the alleged custom to receive uncertified checks in payment of bills, and to defer presentation until the next day after their receipt, if established, would regulate and define the rule of diligence, as between a collecting agent and his foreign principal. It was not, we think, incumbent upon the plaintiff to tender the draft to the defendant as a condition of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed with a modification in respect to the allowance of interest, which should be at the rate of six per cent for the whole period after the right of action accrued, according to the principle settled in <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Utica, etc., R. R. Co. </em>(86 N. Y. 401).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The judgment should be, therefore, affirmed as modified, but without costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
