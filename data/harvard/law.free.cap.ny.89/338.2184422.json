(Laws of 1848, chap. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 1011-24; <em>Aspinwall </em>v. <em>Sacchi, </em>57 N. <em>Y. </em>335; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>77 id. 7.) The court in Colorado acquired jurisdiction against the corporation, to render a personal judgment, by the due personal service of its process upon its general agent and superintendent there, who had contracted the debt in the course of its mining business there, of which he was in chief charge. <em>(Hill </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>61 N. Y. 274; <em>Lafayette Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>French, </em>18 How. [U. S.] 404, 407-408; <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Queens Ins. Co., </em>63 N. Y. 114; <em>Hiller </em>v. <em>Burlington &amp; M. R.

S. 368; <em>Moch </em>v. <em>Virginia Ins. Co., </em>10 Fed. Rep. 696.) Its judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of Flew York, under the Constitution and laws of the Hnited States. (Wharton on Confl. of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 804, 810; Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 221.) The requirement of the twenty-fourth section of the act of 1848 was satisfied, as to the remedy against a continuing stockholder, without the return of an execution on the Colorado judgment in whole or in part unsatisfied. <em>(Shellington </em>v. Howland, 67 Barb. 18; 53 N. Y. 371; <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>23 Hun, 256.) The special award of execution against the' attached property did not make the judgment less than a general personal judgment for the debt. <em>(Suydam </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>18 N.

The act of 1848 does not restrict the remedies of creditors against corporations and stockholders to- the courts of this State. (Constitution, art. 8, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3; <em>Chase v. Lord, 77 </em>N. Y. 24 ; 52 id. 207; 63 id. 425 ; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>National Bk. of New </em>Berne, 81 id. 389; <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Van Santvoord, </em>34 id. 208, 212, 220; <em>Christian Union </em>v. <em>Soinet, </em>9 Reporter, 607; <em>Wilson Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Hunter, 7 </em>id. 455; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Androscoggin Mills, </em>1 Fed.

Co., </em>11 Reporter, 505.) There is nothing in the act of 1848 which requires the stockholder to be sued in this State. Under the general law a debtor stockholder may be sued wherever he can be found. <em>(Lowry </em>v. <em>Inman, </em>46 N.

(Potter on Corporations, 913, 925, 927; <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>12 Allen [Mass.], 438; <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Simonds, </em>2 Abb. Pr. [N.

The provisions of the statute in question, imposing, as they do, personal liabilities upon the members of a business corporation, are penal in their character, should be construed strictly, and not extended by limitations. <em>(Bk. of Au</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>gusta </em>v. <em>Earl, </em>13 Peters, <em>587; Halsey </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>12 Allen [Mass.], 438; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>9 Cush. 192; <em>Dane </em>v. <em>Manufacturing Co., </em>14 Gray, 489; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Boylan, </em>16 Ind. 384; Cable v. <em>McCune, </em>26 Mo. 371; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>6 Reporter 212; <em>Esmond </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>16 Hun, 65; <em>Losee </em>v.

A judgment, without the debtor\u2019s appearance, is of no force against other property, or for other purposes. In other words, it is not a personal judgment, but is only good and valid for the purpose of subjecting to sale any estate of the debtor seized by attachment within the jurisdiction. <em>(Woodruff </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>20 Vt. 65; <em>Megee </em>v. <em>Beirne, </em>3 Wright [Penn.], 50; <em>Kilburn </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>5 Johns. 37; <em>Pawling </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>13 id. 192; <em>Dobson </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>12 N. Y. 164; <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Shipman, </em>6 Barb. 621; <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>The Michigan Central R. R. Co., </em>5 How. Pr. 187; <em>Starbuck </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>5 Wend. 148.) The judgment in Colorado was one <em>in rem, </em>and imposed no personal liability. <em>(Hulbert </em>v. <em>Hope Ins. Co., </em>4 How. Pr. 275; <em>Brewsters. </em>Mich. <em>R. R. Co., </em>5 id. 183; <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Van Santvoord, </em>34 N. Y. 208; <em>Howell </em>v. <em>C. &amp; N. W. R. R. Co., </em>51 Barb. 378.) Even if the judgment could be treated as a general judgment, it is not a performance of the condition precedent required by the statute, as it was not recovered in any court of the State of Hew York. <em>(Dean </em>v. <em>Mace, </em>19 Hun, 391; Daily Register, March 11, 1881; 2 R. S. 463, \u00a7 36 [Edm. ed. 483] ; id. 173, \u00a7 38, p. 180 ; <em>Child </em>v. <em>Brace, </em>4 Paige, 310; <em>Merchants' Bk. </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>10 id. 519; <em>Crippen </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>13 N.

Ch. 571, 579; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Merchants' Bk., </em>9 Paige, 215.) The so-called execution was insufficient because it was by its express terms a special execution issued only against a part of the property of the Ophir Gold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Mining Company, and was not even exhausted as to the part against which it was issued. <em>(Dix </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>9 Paige, 595; <em>Child </em>v. <em>Brace, </em>4 id. 310; <em>Merchants' Bk., </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>10 id. 519 ; <em>Crippen </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>13 N. Y. 161.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b368-4\">Sapallo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqOW\">The twenty-fourth section of the General Manufacturing Law of 1848 (Chap. 40) has been construed in the case of <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Draper</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decided at the present term, and it is there held that the return of an execution unsatisfied against the corporation is a condition precedent to the right of a creditor to bring an action against a stockholder, and that this condition applies to the case of a continuing stockholder as well as to that of one who has ceased to be such.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The proceeding against the company in Colorado was not a compliance with this condition. It was a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>which affected only the property there attached, and the execution issued was only against that specific property. <em>(Dix </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>9 Paige, 595 ; <em>Crippen </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>13 N. Y. 161; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Merchants' Bank, </em>9 Paige, 216.) But, in addition to that objection, we think that the statute requires the recovery of a judgment and the issue of an execution in this State. In requiring the creditor to exhaust his legal remedies against the corporation, before resorting to the personal liability of the stockholders, the statute could not have contemplated that the recovery of a judgment and issue of an execution against the company in any State of the Union should be a compliance with the condition. The legal remedies afforded by the courts of this State, where the corporation was created and is domiciled, are those which the legislature must be deemed to have intended. Such is the construction given to a similar provision in respect to creditors\u2019 bills, and although the cases are not precisely the -same, we think that they strongly confirm the view that when a statute of this State requires, as a condition precedent to further proceedings in its courts, that an execution against the property shall first have been issued, it means that such execution shall have been issued out of a court of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>State of general jurisdiction. <em>(Tarbell </em>v. <em>Griggs, </em>3 Paige, 207; <em>Dix </em>v. <em>Briggs, supra ; Crippen </em>v.
