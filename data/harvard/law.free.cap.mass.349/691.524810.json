See also <em>Doliner </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Millis, </em>343 Mass. 10. We restate certain facts then before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">On March 9, 1959, the town voted to adopt a proposed zoning by-law and to repeal the then existing 1956 by-law, \u201csuch repeal to be effective . . . when\u201d the new by-law should take effect after approval by the Attorney General. On April 1,1959, the town clerk transmitted the new by-law to the Attorney General, who approved it on June 9, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-13\">On April 8,1959, Doliner (as trustee) filed with the planning board for approval under the subdivision control law a definitive plan of a land subdivision. Under the old zoning by-law the lots shown on the plan were of adequate size. Under the new by-law, the lots shown on the plan would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>have been too small. The planning board on May 26,1959, notified Doliner that the plan had been disapproved. When Doliner\u2019s appeal reached this court, we (in the 1961 decision) directed that the planning board\u2019s decision be annulled (343 Mass. 1, 9) and that the plan be remanded to the board for further consideration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the course of which the board was to obtain the recommendations of the board of health and to hold a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In the 1961 decision (343 Mass. 1, 5-8), effort was made to reconcile conflicting statutory provisions. Largely upon the basis of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11 (as inserted by St. 1954, c. 368, \u00a7 2), we concluded (343 Mass. 1, 6-7, 8) that the new by-law was \u201capplicable\u201d (see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, as amended through St. 1957, c. 265) to the plan when filed, even though the new by-law had not been approved by the Attorney General and had not become effective. We also held (343 Mass. 1, 7-8) that the amendment of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7A, by St. 1959, c. 221, which became effective July 20, 1959, did not have application to the planning board\u2019s prior action.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Between the arguments and the decision in the earlier <em>Doliner </em>case, the Legislature further amended c. 40A, \u00a7 7A, by the enactment of St. 1961, c. 435, \u00a7 2, which became effective on August 3,1961, ninety days after its approval. We pointed out (343 Mass. 1, 8) that, in the event of planning board action after c. 435 became effective, \u201cquestions . . . [might] arise under \u00a7 7A, as thereby amended.\u201d Because \u201c [n]o issue with respect to this 1961 amendment ha[d] been argued and the pendency of the amendment . . . [had] not [been] brought to our attention\u201d by counsel in the earlier case, we expressed (343 Mass, 1, 9) \u201cno opinion with respect to it or its effect.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">After our 1961 decision, the plan was remanded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>planning board by a final decree of the Superior Court after rescript, entered March 12, 1962. On April 17, 1962, the planning board received the recommendation of the town board of health, which declined to \u201capprove any septic tank installations\u201d until certain data relating to proposed sewerage disposal were furnished and invited attention to certain other matters. The record does not convince us that these health matters have been dealt with at all by Doliner in presenting his plan or that they have been passed upon by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\u201cOn April 24, 1962, the planning board held a public hearing on the original definitive . . . plan,\u201d which it disapproved on May 7,1962. The letter of disapproval shows that the board\u2019s action was \u201c [b]ecause the lots on . . . [the] plan are inconsistent with the requirement of the . . ; [new] zoning by-law.\u201d No reliance was placed upon the recommendations of the board of health in the letter of disapproval.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">On May 25,1962, Doliner appealed to the Superior Court from the planning board\u2019s second disapproval of his plan. The case was heard on a statement of agreed facts, in effect a case stated, upon the basis of which we have set forth the facts already outlined so far as they do hot appear in the 1961 decision. The trial judge on January 27, 1965, without making any decisi\u00f3n, reported the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Prior to the enactment of St. 1961, c. 435, \u00a7 2, the provisions of c. 40A, \u00a7 7A, as appearing in St. 1959, c. 221, as amended by St. 1960, c. 291,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not deal at all with a situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ation where, as in the present case, no preliminary plan was filed (see fn. 3 at point [A]). If the applicant for approval then had proceeded in the first instance to file only what purported to be a definitive plan, nothing in \u00a7 7A would have affected either the applicant\u2019s procedural or substantive rights until and unless a definitive plan had been approved (see fn. 3, at points [B], [C], and [F]). Also, to obtain the benefits of the later sentences of \u00a7 7A, as it then stood, the plan must comply with the by-law \u201cexisting\u201d at the time of approval (see fn. 3 at point [D]), or endorsement that approval was not necessary (see fn. 3 at point [F]).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Section 7A thus had no direct application to the facts considered in the 1961 decision. Because, however, following our 1961 decision, the planning board took no further action until after c. 435 had become effective, it has become necessary for us to decide questions expressly left undecided in the 1961 decision concerning the effect of the enactment of c. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Statute 1961, c. 435, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> amended G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7A, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>striking out \u00a7 7A as it had previously read (see fn. 3). Section 3 of the 1961 act purported to continue in effect certain existing rights with respect to land shown on any plan theretofore submitted or approved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">One important change made in \u00a7 7A by c. 435, \u00a7 2, is the provision (see fn. 4 at point [A]) that (where there is no preliminary plan) the land shown on a definitive plan shall be governed by the \u201capplicable provisions\u201d (see fn. 4 at point [B]) of the zoning by-law \u201cin effect\u201d (see fn. 4 at point [C]) when the definitive plan was submitted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is a direct and specific legislative statement, for the first time, that a definitive plan is to be governed by the by-law in effect when the plan is filed while the plan is being \u201cprocessed\u201d under the subdivision control law (see fn. 4 at point [D]). It is buttressed by the later provision (fn. 4 at point [E]) that, if the definitive plan is later approved, that by-law is to govern the land for five years (now seven years, see St. 1965, c. 366, \u00a7 1, the most recent amendment of \u00a7 7A). This later provision is to be effective (see fn. 4 at point [F]) \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d subject to a proviso not here relevant. It is also significant that c. 435 carefully omitted the requirements found in \u00a7 7A, as it read after the 1960 amendment, that the lot comply with the zoning by-law existing at the time of the approval or endorsement of the plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>(see fn. 3, at points [C], [D], [E], and [F]). Accordingly, there can be no doubt that approval of a plan filed after the effective date of St. 1961, c. 435, was to be controlled (to the extent indicated in the 1961 amendment) by the zoning by-law in effect at the time of the filing of the definitive plan (or of the filing of the preliminary plan upon which the definitive plan was based, where there was a preliminary plan). See <em>Ward &amp; Johnson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Whitman, </em>343 Mass. 466, 467. It remains for us to determine how c. 435, \u00a7 2, affected definitive plans which had been filed prior to the effective date of c. 435, and which were still on that effective date \u201cbeing processed under . . . [the] subdivision control law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Chapter 435 operates prospectively in that it directs planning boards thereafter to approve or disapprove subdivision plans in the light of the zoning by-law in effect at the time of filing the plan rather than the by-law in effect when the planning board makes its decision. No express distinction is made in c. 435 between the application of the chapter (a) to plans thereafter filed and (b) to those theretofore filed. These factors tend to support construing c. 435 as applying equally to both types of plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">On the other hand, to hold e. 435 applicable to plans theretofore filed and still pending, where there has been a zoning by-law change made before the statute\u2019s effective date, would mean that the planning board would be obliged to apply a zoning by-law which had ceased to exist before the planning board acted and before the statute itself became operative. Such a construction would permit one in Doliner\u2019s position to avoid the zoning by-law applicable to his plan (under \u00a7 7A as it then stood) when he filed his plan and would defeat the purpose of the amended by-law. To hold c. 435 applicable to this plan thus would have retroactive substantive effect upon the positions of Doliner, the town, and Doliner\u2019s neighbors as they respectively stood at the time Doliner filed his plan and especially upon the town\u2019s interest in enforcing the new by-law, adopted before the plan was filed, and not effective then merely be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>cause it was awaiting the Attorney Q-eneral\u2019s approval and publication.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On balance, we think that c. 435 should not be construed as having this retroactive effect in the absence of explicit language showing that this unusual type of retroactive operation was intended. We recognize, of course, that, until final approval or disapproval of the plan, the Legislature had power reasonably to regulate the exercise of the power of future disapproval. We conclude that it has not purported to do so with respect to plans filed before the effective date of c. 435. See <em>Building Inspector of Acton </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Acton, </em>348 Mass. 453, 456-457, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">It remains for us to consider whether the situation is altered in any respect by St. 1965, c. 366. The only change (apart from irrelevant changes of punctuation) effected by c. 366, \u00a7 1, in \u00a7 7A, as it existed prior to this 1965 statute (see St. 1965, c. 65), was to alter, from five years to seven years, the period during which, with respect to previously approved plans, the zoning by-law in effect when a plan was filed would govern the land shown in the plan. We do not interpret c. 366, \u00a7 2 (which directed that the \u201cprovisions of this act shall apply to plans submitted to planning boards prior to its effective date\u201d), as meaning more than that the particular change effected by c. 366, \u00a7 1, should so apply. \u00d1o language in c. 366 is sufficiently explicit to lead us to interpret the statute as intended to apply retroactively in any way the statutory changes in \u00a7 7A effected nearly four years earlier by St. 1961, c. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">A final decree is to be entered in the Superior Court dismissing the bill as is provided by stipulation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\"> In this we followed the disposition made in somewhat similar earlier cases.
