That decision purported to grant a variance and other relief. The case is here on reservation and report. See G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 31. The issues are presented on the pleadings and on a statement of agreed facts that incorporates exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">1. The plea in abatement (treated as a demurrer to raise a question of jurisdiction under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21, as amended by St. 1960, c. 365, <em>Maltzman </em>v. Herts, 336 Mass. 704, 705) must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>We pass without intimation the unargued issue whether St. 1960, c. 365, enacted May 3, 1960, relates to the powers of courts so that it took effect on the thirtieth day after enactment. See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 1; art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution, The Referendum, I, III, \u00a7 2; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sacco, </em>255 Mass. 369, 410-411. Compare <em>Coyle </em>v. <em>Swanson, </em>345 Mass. 126,127. The issue raised by the plea has been fully argued on the assumption, which we accept for this case, that the amending statute was in effect when the bill of complaint was filed on July 11, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 21, as amended by St. 1960, c. 365, provides, inter alla, that an appeal from a decision of a board of appeals is to be taken by a bill in equity filed \u201cwithin twenty days after the decision has been filed in the office of the . . . town clerk . . . [and that there] shall be attached to the bill a copy of the decision appealed from, bearing the date of the filing thereof, certified by the . . . town clerk with whom the decision was filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">There was attached to the bill of complaint as filed a copy of the decision entitled \u2018 \u2018 copy as filed in office of the Town Clerk\u201d and attested by the town clerk as \u201cA true copy.\u201d The date of filing was not stated. The decision, however, recites that the board voted on June 21, 1960, to grant the application, and, above the signatures of the board, contains these words: \u201cDate of decision June 21, 1960.\u201d Hence the certification of the town clerk attached to a bill filed on July 11, told of the filing of the decision with her on or before that date. It thus informed all concerned that the filing of the bill was timely, it having been on the twentieth day after June 21, the date of decision, and thus before the expiration of twenty days after the intervening event, the filing with the town clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The omission of the date from the clerk\u2019s certificate did not deprive the Superior Court of jurisdiction. That depended upon the timely filing of the bill of complaint within the twenty day period and the giving of notice to the town clerk of that filing so as to be received within the twenty day period. <em>Del Grosso </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Revere, </em>330 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Mass. 29, 32. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Framingham, </em>346 Mass. 418. There is no contention that notice to the clerk of the filing of the bill of complaint in the Superior Court was not timely. The provision for the certification of the date of the filing of the decision with the town clerk appears designed to show of record that the appeal was within the statutory period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The failure to file with the bill the addresses of the defendants was, likewise, not a jurisdictional defect. This is part of the statutory scheme, for giving prompt notice by delivery or certified mail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That the notice was sent to the correct addresses was shown of record by the inclusion of the addresses in the affidavit, duly filed within the prescribed twenty-one days. The critical date is the expiration of that period, for the statute expressly provides for dismissal if \u201cno such affidavit is filed within such time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">2. The defendant Edward F. McNulty is the president, treasurer and principal stockholder of the defendant Nut-tings Lake Cafe, Inc. (Nuttings). For some time prior to 1959 Nuttings had owned a parcel of land of about 3,990 square feet, with a main building and an accessory building thereon, lying between Nuttings Lake and Middlesex Turnpike near its intersection with Lake Street, in a neighborhood business zone. Nuttings operated a caf\u00e9 in the main building under a license for the sale of all alcoholic beverages. The structure was nonconforming to the zoning bylaw both as to use and yard and area requirements. On January 24,1959, a fire substantially damaged the building. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Nuttings thereafter, in several separate proceedings, sought permission from the hoard of appeals to rebuild.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board on May 19, 1959, rendered a decision granting such permission. Seven residents appealed to the Superior Court as aggrieved persons. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21. Five of those appellants are plaintiffs in the appeal now before us. On August 18, 1959, findings of fact and an order for decree were entered in that case. The judge found that an earlier application for a special permit had been denied by the board on February 26, 1959. He ruled that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had been duly accepted by the town and was in full force and effect when the February, 1959, application was made. He found that Nuttings\u2019 proposed plans were the same in each application and ruled that the decision of May 19, 1959, was invalid and should be annulled. He found that the cafe was damaged by fire to more than sixty-five per cent of its reproduction cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">On November 24, 1959, a final decree was entered annulling the decision of the board of May 19, 1959. This decree includes, over the assenting signature of the attorney for McNulty and Nuttings, the recital that \u201cthe defendants, Edward F. McNulty and Nuttings Lake Cafe, Inc., stipulate that they will neither rebuild nor remodel a caf\u00e9 building on land of the respondent corporation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVbA\">At some time, apparently on or before November 19,1959, Nuttings petitioned for an amendment to the zoning by-law to place a parcel containing approximately 15,536 square feet inclusive of the locus in a general business district. The planning board\u2019s notice on the petition was apparently published on November 19 and December 3. The hearing was advertised for December 17, 1959. The board on March 12,1960, recommended to the impending town meeting that the amendment be adopted. The board\u2019s report recited that \u201cThe petitioner says all he wants to do is rebuild his business that was burned down. . . . The Board feels it should be zoned to General Business to permit the continuance of a long established business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The town meeting adopted the proposed amendment at an adjourned session on April 5, 1960. Nuttings, in April, 1960, applied for a permit to build on the locus. The building inspector on April 20, 1960, denied the application because the lot was too small and the proposed building did not allow for yards as specified for a general business district and covered an area greater than permitted by the by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Nuttings appealed to the board of appeals from the refusal of a permit and also sought a variance and a permit \u201cfor a specific use\u201d that was subject to the board\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The board\u2019s decision of June 21, 1960 granted the relief requested and the plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court in the proceeding now before us. Following the board\u2019s decision \u201cthe respondents [McNulty and Nuttings] had the building which now contains the caf\u00e9 constructed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The amendment of the zoning by-law, adopted April 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>1960, was valid. The article in the warrant specified \u201cthe whole or any part of land owned by Nuttings . . . located on Middlesex Turnpike Road and Lake Street, bounded and described as follows: Beginning on the southerly side of Lake Street, at its intersection with Middlesex Turnpike Road, thence running southerly by the easterly side of said road to Nuttings Lake, thence running easterly by said lake, 66 feet, thence turning and running northerly by Lot 203 on Nuttings Lake Park Plan, Plan B, 129 feet to Lake Street, thence turning and running westerly by the southerly side of said Lake Street, 149 feet to the point of beginning. Containing approximately 15,536 square feet.\u201d The area described by metes, bounds and square footage included the land of another owner. We think the failure to name the other owner did not make the proposal invalid for uncertainty. The metes and bounds accurately described the parcel and plainly indicated the parcel bounded by Lake Street, Middlesex Turnpike Road, the Lake and another lot. See <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>318 Mass. 216, 219, cert. den. sub nom. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>326 U. S. 739. The vote was to rezone as a general business district \u201cthe whole or any part of land bounded and described in Article 107 of the Warrant.\u201d This is to be construed as rezoning the whole and <em>all </em>parts of the parcel described. <em>Caires </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Hingham, </em>323 Mass. 589, 597-598.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The record does not show that this was spot zoning. The triangle rezoned lay between two public ways. The opposite triangle, formed by the intersection of Middlesex Turnpike and Water Street (a continuation of Lake Street), was zoned for general business. Furthermore, the same warrant contained a proposal to rezone as a general business area the parcel bounded by Middlesex Turnpike, Nuttings Lake and Water Street, just across the Turnpike to the west of the locus. This rezoning was voted at an adjourned session on April 2, 1960. All things considered, the change appears to have been within the broad power of the municipality. <em>Lanner </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Tewks-bury, </em>348 Mass. 220. That the proposal for the change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>was motivated by Nuttings \u2019 desire to continue its cafe business at the site does not establish invalidity in the adopting vote. <em>Caires </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Hingham, </em>323 Mass. 589, 595-596. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Works of Lowell, </em>333 Mass. 410, 412. <em>Elmer </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Adjustment of Boston, </em>343 Mass. 24, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The reclassification of Nuttings \u2019 land as general business permitted the use of a building thereon for \u201cRestaurant, dining room or lunch room\u201d (\u00a7 3.5). Thereafter nothing in \u00a7 12 (3) expressly barred the rebuilding of a nonconforming building for caf\u00e9 use or required the consent of the board of appeals for reconstruction of a nonconforming structure. But by the stipulation recorded in the decree of November 24, 1959, the defendants agreed with five of the present plaintiffs not to \" rebuild nor remodel a caf\u00e9 building\u201d on the site. This undertaking, although unrestricted in express terms, may be limited by the nature of the proceeding, and the intent of the decree that records it. It may also be affected by attendant circumstances not disclosed in this record. In any event it was effective as an agreement by Nuttings that the destroyed structure no longer could be rebuilt for caf\u00e9 purposes as a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Nuttings \u2019 lot is so small that the only recourse under the by-law, there being no right to restore for caf\u00e9 use the nonconforming structure as such, was an application for a variance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8 With a valid variance the structure would be conforming.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The appeal to the board of appeals of April 20, 1960, included a request for a variance. In this aspect it was not subject to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 20. As stated, had Nuttings been free to reconstruct the nonconforming building, it did not need a special permit. The application which the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>had denied on February 26, 1959, was an application for a special permit. The denial of that application did not bar application in 1960 for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">There has been no finding in the Superior Court whether the requirements for a variance have been met. <em>Barnhart </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Scituate, </em>343 Mass. 455, 457-458. This issue must be heard and determined in the Superior Court in the light of this opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For purposes of that hearing the parties are not to he limited to the agreed facts which relate in substantial part to the issue whether the nonconforming structure could he rebuilt. In particular, on rehearing, the stipulation must be construed and its effect determined. Whether the applicants have shown statutory hardship may depend upon the construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">3. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for a further hearing and determination in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> Failure to comply with this threshold requirement may in the appropriate case give ground for dismissal or the imposition of terms.

To avoid delay in the proceedings, instead of the usual service of process on a bill in equity, the plaintiff shall within fourteen days after the filing of the bill in equity give written notice thereof, with a copy of the bill by delivery or certified mail to all respondents, including the members of the board of appeals, and shall, within twenty-one days after the entry of the bill file with the clerk of the court an affidavit that such notice has been given.

The decision .of the Board of Appeals of the Town of Billerica, dated May 19, 1959, granting a special permit to Nuttings Lake Cafe, Inc. to remodel and rebuild a non-conforming building on Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, be and hereby is annulled. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> The zoning by-law provides in \u00a7 10 (5): \u201cIn General Business Districts and.in Neighborhood Business Districts, twenty-five thousand . . . square feet minimum area per lot . . . shall be required.\u201d Obviously, the entire rezoned area even including the land of the other owner (a total of 15,536 square feet) is such that except for a variance, not even the entire parcel may be used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b517-13\"> Nuttings of course acquired no right by building after the variance was granted and before the appeal was disposed of.
