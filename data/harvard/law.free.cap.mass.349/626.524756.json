The information furnished in the application for one warrant to search for gaming implements (G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 23, as amended through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>St. 1953, c. 319, \u00a7 30)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the facts stated in the application for the other warrant (G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2B, inserted by St. 1964, c. 557, \u00a7 3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are set out in the margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">After obtaining these warrants, the captain and other officers \u201cwent to ... 37-41 Rutland Street. These premises consisted of the offices of a newspaper . . . company . . . owned and operated by . . . Shibley [a defendant in the companion case]. Two officers went to . . . [No.] 41. The remaining officers, including [the] [c]aptain . . ., went to . . . [No.] 37. As the two officers approached the door numbered 41, they observed through an open window a man sitting at a table with a telephone in his hand. . . . Without announcing their authority or purpose the two officers, using a [blattering [r]am, forced the door and entered the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The defendant Rossetti, \u201cwho was sitting at the table, turned and faced the police officers. . . . [0]n the table at which he was sitting, were seven telephones and numerous sheets of paper.\u201d Writings on the papers indicated racing results, wagers on horse races, and lottery bets. \u201cRossetti was ordered away from the table; and the telephones . . . were monitored for in-coming phone calls,\u201d which revealed inquiries concerning racing results.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\u201cShibley . . . identified himself as the owner and operator of the . . . [c] ompany, and indicated that he was in control of the premises. The police officers seized . . . various articles and papers,\u201d which are \u201cthe subject matters of . . . [m]otion[s] to [s]uppress,\u201d mentioned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>In the Municipal Court, Bossetti was convicted of transmitting racing information during the running of a race, knowing that it was to be used for unlawful gaming. He appealed to the Superior Court. On October 9, 1964, Bossetti and Shibley were indicted for conspiracy to transmit such information in furtherance of unlawful gaming. Bossetti and Shibley then each filed in each case a motion to suppress the evidence seized and for its return on the ground that it was taken \u201cwithout a valid search warrant.\u201d The captain testified, at the hearing on the motions to suppress that, prior to entering the premises, he knew that Bossetti had a criminal record as a bookmaker and for violations of the Federal tax stamp wagering law; that he \u201chad been under rendition proceedings from . . . Florida in connection with a racing wire service\u201d; and that he \u201chad been named in a Crime Commission [r]eport . . . [as important] in race wire dissemination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><em>A </em>\u201cpolice officer . . . [who] forced the door . . . testified . . . that his decision [not] to . . . announce his presence, purpose, or authority was based upon his desire to prevent any attempt to destroy evidence. In fact, there were no circumstances to indicate that an attempt was made to destroy evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Each motion was denied. The trial judge then, under G-. L. c. 278, \u00a7 30A, made an interlocutory report of two questions of law, viz. (1) \u201c [w]hether . . . the search and seizure . . . was legal,\u201d and (2) whether G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 31A (inserted by St. 1964, c. 330) is<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c [constitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">1. The defendants contend that the applications did not set forth facts adequate to show reasonable grounds for a search and that consequently the warrants were improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>issued. They also assert that, because of the invalidity of the warrants, the evidence obtained by their use was illegally seized, and thus must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In only a few Massachusetts cases decided since <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 655-660, has this court considered whether a warrant was improperly issued and whether evidence procured by its use was illegally obtained. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lepore, ante, </em>121, 122-123, it was held that adequate grounds for issuing a search warrant had been presented to the judge who issued it. There had been a more complete statement to the judge than appears in the present cases. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lillis, ante, </em>422, 423-424, we held adequate very full recitals of underlying facts, concerning (a) identifications of the suspects, (b) three bullets recovered near places where identified suspects had been, and (c) ballistic tests of these bullets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have recently held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, ante, </em>583, 584, following decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States mentioned below, that an application is inadequate if based merely upon the affiant\u2019s belief, without statement of the facts supporting that belief. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laudate, </em>345 Mass. 169, 171. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>346 Mass. 300, 303, 307-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cproscriptions [against unreasonable searches and seizures] are enforced against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d and that \u201cthe standard of reasonableness is the same under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d See <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U. S. 23, 33. Although the <em>Ker </em>case did not involve a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>search under a warrant, the decision has made it necessary for the State courts, in the adjudication of criminal cases, to apply the \u201cfundamental criteria\u201d of the Fourth Amendment in determining whether particular searches and seizures are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">In <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, the Supreme Court reviewed a State search warrant issued upon an application stating merely that the applicants \u201chave received reliable information from a credible person and do believe that . . . narcotics . . . are being kept at the . . . described premises for the purpose of sale and use contrary to . . . law.\u201d The court held (at pp. 115-116) \u201cthat the search warrant should not have been issued because the affidavit did not provide a sufficient basis for a finding of probable cause and that the evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant was inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In reaching this conclusion, the opinion said (at pp. 113-114), \u201cHere the \u2018mere conclusion\u2019 that [the] petitioner possessed narcotics was not even that of the affiant himself; it was that of an unidentified informant. The affidavit . . . not only \u2018 contains no affirmative allegation that the affiant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained therein,\u2019 it does not even contain an \u2018affirmative allegation\u2019 that the affiant\u2019s unidentified source \u2018spoke with personal knowledge. \u2019 For all that appears, the source here merely suspected, believed or concluded that there were narcotics in [the] petitioner\u2019s possession. The magistrate here certainly could not \u2018judge for himself the persuasiveness of the facts relied on ... to show probable cause.\u2019 He necessarily accepted \u2018without question\u2019 the informant\u2019s \u2018suspicion, \u2019 \u2018belief,\u2019 or \u2018mere conclusion.\u2019 Although an affidavit may be based on hearsay . . . and need not reflect . . . direct personal observations of the affiant . . . the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were, and . . . from which the officer concluded that the informant, whose identity need not be disclosed . . . was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Abg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>On the other hand, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 109-112, the court sustained<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the propriety of a warrant issued upon a careful application and affidavit set out in full (at pp. 112-116). The affidavit described surveillance of various persons and the premises searched over a period of nine or more days and various incidents observed suggesting criminal conduct. The affidavit was stated to be based on observation of the affiant and reports made to him by other Internal Revenue Service investigators. See <em>Giordenello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U. S. 480, 486. Of. <em>Chin Kay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>311 F. 2d 317, 320-322 (9th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The foregoing decisions establish the necessity of including in the application for a warrant the underlying facts which show probable cause, and not simply general conclusions inferred from those facts. Each of the applications before us (fns. 1, 2) reveals that it is based in major part upon a hearsay report from an F.B.I. agent. Even if the reference to that agency might be sufficient to establish the reliability of the informant, the applications contain no indication of the basis (a) of the F.B.I. agent\u2019s knowledge of the facts reported by him, or (b) of his conclusion that racing information was being transmitted, or (c) of the applicant\u2019s knowledge of the then current activities of Rossetti and his employee. There is no description of any surveillance of Rossetti or his associates by the applicant or others. The applications do not place before the issuing magistrate basic facts sufficient to permit him to determine for himself whether probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">A majority of the court are of opinion that the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>cations, although somewhat more informative than those in the <em>Aguilar </em>case, do not meet the standards laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is so even if (as reviewing courts should do where there has been police effort, in good faith, to comply with procedural requirements) we disregard insubstantial errors and make every reasonable allowance for the difficulties and pressures under which law enforcement officers must work. See the <em>Ker </em>case, 374 U. S. 23, 33-34, and the <em>Ventresca </em>case, 380 U. S. 102,109 (fn. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">2. The Commonwealth contends that the search and seizure were incidental to an arrest (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56, 60; <em>Abel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 217, 234-238) for a felony,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for which arrest without a warrant was authorized if the arresting officer had reasonable cause to believe that the person arrested had committed a felony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>344 Mass. 524, 525. In considering whether probable cause existed, we may take into account the facts shown by the record to have been known to the arresting captain when the search warrants were served in addition to those stated in the applications for the warrants. These additional facts amount to little more than knowledge that Rossetti had a criminal record and a reputation of being involved in gaming activities. These facts may be significant in connection with other basic facts but, standing alone, are of slight importance in establishing probable cause. As to the officers<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> observations of Rossetti before they entered to search the prem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>ises, the record shows merely that the police observed a man sitting at a table holding a telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In the aggregate, all the circumstances set out in the report do not amount to probable cause for arrest, nor do they show that the officers knew basic facts sufficient to permit them reasonably to conclude that Bossetti was or had been violating G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 31A, on some specific occasion or occasions. Indeed, the record suggests, not that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, but rather that the arrest was incident to a search under invalid warrants. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U. S. 10, 15-17. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>321 F. 2d 739, 741-742 (6th Cir.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">3. There is no occasion for us to consider whether there was an illegal search for the additional reason, urged by the defendants, that entrance to the searched premises was made by force without prior announcement of the existence of the warrants and of the purpose of the search. See <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U. S. 23, 37-41, 44-46, 47.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U. S. 301, <em>306-310; Masiello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>304 F. 2d 399, 401 (Ct. App. D. C.). As to the significance of the fear of destruction of evidence as justifying omission of any warning before a forcible entry, see <em>People </em>v. <em>Maddox, </em>46 Cal. 2d 301, 304-307; Blakey, The Buie of Announcement and Unlawful Entry, 112 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">4. Bossetti has been indicted for conspiracy with Shib-ley to transmit racing information unlawfully. The record warrants the conclusion that Shibley owned the searched premises. There is no suggestion that Bossetti was a tres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>passer on the premises when the search was made. On the contrary, the most reasonable inference is that he was there as Shibley\u2019s agent or as a joint venturer with Shibley. Accordingly, he had sufficient standing, at least because claiming through Shibley and in Shibley\u2019s interest, to invoke the protection of the Fourth Amendment against an unlawful search of Shibley\u2019s premises. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 261-267. See <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U. S. 23, 34. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>45 Cal. 2d 755, 760-761.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">5. At the arguments, counsel for the defendants in effect waived any contention that G. L. c. 271, \u00a7 31A (fn. 3), is invalid because of the exemption from its penal provisions of newspapers and other news media. The concession by counsel was proper. The exemption of the ordinary transmission of news for general public consumption from these penal provisions is a reasonable legislative classification of substantially differing types of communication and conduct. If applied in this case, \u00a7 31A would not deny to defendants the equal protection of the law. <em>Lindsley </em>v. <em>Natural Carbonic Gas Co. </em>220 U. S. 61, 78-79. <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Skrupa, </em>372 U. S. 726, 732-733. See <em>Telephone News Sys. Inc. </em>v. <em>Illinois Bell Tel. Co. </em>220 F. Supp. 621, 638\u2014640 (N. D. Ill.), affd. 376 U. S. 782; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Borgese, </em>235 F. Supp. 286, 295-296 (S.D. N.Y.). See also <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Illinois Bell Tel. Co. </em>325 F. 2d 148, 151-153 (7th Cir.); <em>Parkes </em>v. <em>Judge of Recorder\u2019s Court, </em>236 Mich. 460, 467-469, where a somewhat similar statute containing no exemption of news media was held invalid largely because of the absence of such an exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">6. The questions raised by the report are to be answered : <em>First, </em>upon the reported facts the search in these cases was based upon improperly issued warrants and was illegal. <em>Second, </em>General Laws c. 271, \u00a7 31A, if applied to communications of the type indicated by the present record as having been made by the defendants, would not deny to persons in the defendants\u2019 position the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\"> In the application for this warrant, the captain wrote, \u201cAn FBI agent has informed me that one Munge Rossetti (Angelo M.) is receiving unauthorized race result information at 37-41 Rutland Street, Boston, said information being obtained by an electronic device at Wonderland Dog Track and thence transmitted to bookmakers in Greater Boston. Further, that a former employee of Rossetti\u2019s who was engaged in the transmission of race results is again actively, engaged in the transmission of race results with Rossetti. Further, Rossetti has been convicted of federal and state gaming offenses and bookmaking and it is believed that he, with others unknown at this time, are engaged in the activity of accepting bets on horse and dog races.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\"> The captain said in applying for the second warrant, &lt;fI have information, based upon the following: That an FBI agent has informed me . . .

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>347 Mass. 246, 249.
