L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from judgments of guilty of armed robbery and related offences. Of the twenty-six assignments of error filed by the defendant eight assignments (Nos. 1, 2, 12, 15, 16, 24, 25 and 26) have not been argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">I. Numerous assignments of error (Nos. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14,17, 20 and 21) have been consolidated by the defendant in his brief. His principal contention is that prejudicial evidence was admitted and that his. Constitutional rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>were thereby violated. These assignments relate primarily to events which took place at the Worcester police station to which the defendant was taken subsequent to his apprehension by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">On February 12, 1963, at approximately 11:35 a.m., two men, armed and masked, entered the People\u2019s Savings Bank at Webster Square Plaza in Worcester and robbed it of $12,569. A short time later, about 11:50 a.m., Officer Thy-den of the Worcester police department saw an automobile reportedly used in the holdup \u201cturn into Jacques Street.\u201d He proceeded on his motorcycle to Jacques Street, stopped, and saw the defendant walking towards him. The officer drew his revolver and ordered the defendant to stop; he \u201cpatted him down\u201d to ascertain whether the defendant was armed. A second officer arrived at the scene, followed shortly by a third, who was accompanied by a teller employed at the bank. The teller informed the officers that the defendant was \u201cabout the same size\u201d as one of the holdup men. The defendant said, \u201cYou\u2019re sending an innocent man to jail.\u201d The teller then said that he \u201cthought this was the same voice\u201d that he had heard at the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The defendant was taken from Jacques Street to the detective bureau, arriving \u201cin the vicinity of noontime.\u201d He was under arrest. He was taken to a room and told to remove his clothes, which were returned to him a few minutes later. For approximately five hours the defendant was questioned by police officers. At all times at least one officer was with the defendant. The defendant, as early as 12:15 p.m., requested permission \u201cto call my lawyer.\u201d A police officer testified that Guerro asked \u201ctwo or three times\u201d for \u201can opportunity to use the telephone to call his lawyer.\u201d It is uncontroverted that he was not permitted to make a telephone call; and the record does not reveal that he was informed of his right to remain silent. He first met with counsel at 6:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">During the questioning of the defendant he was asked by a police officer to \u201clevel with us\u201d and \u201ctell us about the bank holdup.\u201d He was told that'witnesses had identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>him. Sergeant O\u2019Brien, one of the officers who interrogated him, testified that Guerro replied, \u201c [T]hose witnesses will all change their stories before we go to trial on this one, the same as your other witnesses did before.\u201d O\u2019Brien testified that Guerro said that the officer who stopped him on Jacques Street \u2018 \u2018 only saw me walking away from the car, or, I mean to say, he only saw me walking by the car.\u201d When asked by O\u2019Brien whether he had worn a particular hat during the holdup, the defendant replied, \u201cYes, all morning.\u2019\u2019 Wfiien Guerro was asked to reveal his address he replied, \u201c [L] et me think about whether or not I left anything incriminating in there.\u201d Guerro also said, according to O\u2019Brien, \u201cI won\u2019t level with you. Book me now and let\u2019s get this over with. ... I could keep -telling you lies all afternoon and have you running around in circles . . ..\u201d O\u2019Brien asked the defendant what he would say if told his fingerprints were on the holdup car, to which the defendant answered, \u201c [I]f they were there, I would say I was ruining my professional standing.\u201d Guerro was wearing two coats when apprehended, and O\u2019Brien commented that the second holdup man \u201cmust be running around without anything on.\u201d Guerro said, \u201cThe other guy\u2019s probably running around with a bagful of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The defendant argues that the admission in evidence of the police officers\u2019 testimony violates his constitutional rights. In support of this contention he relies on <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478, decided subsequent to the trial of the defendant. The Commonwealth argues that the defendant cannot, on appeal, for the first time raise a constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The defendant\u2019s assignments of error stem from objections made and exceptions taken either on grounds of materiality or for no stated reason at all. If the <em>Escobedo </em>case had been decided prior to the trial, counsel would have had to state the constitutional grounds for his objection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>346 Mass. 373, 383. We have recently decided, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fancy, ante, </em>196, 205-206, that an issue based on the <em>Escobedo </em>decision cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>raised where the record does not contain a sufficient factual basis for the court to consider the asserted constitutional objections. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Farrara, </em>46 Cal. 2d 265, 268-269. The situation here differs and is analogous to <em>People </em>v. <em>Kitchens, </em>46 Cal. 2d 260, a case in which the trial was conducted prior to the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cahan, </em>44 Cal. 2d 434 (a holding similar to that in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643), and in which an appeal was taken after that decision. The court\u2019s opinion states that \u201cthe rule that ordinarily the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a proper objection in the trial court ... is not applicable to appeals based on the admission of illegally obtained evidence in cases that were tried before the <em>Gahan </em>decision.\u201d We agree with the rationale of the <em>Kitchens </em>decision and hold that in the present circumstances <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>is not controlling. Where, as here, the record contains an adequate factual basis upon which contentions relative to the <em>Escobedo </em>decision may be considered, counsel\u2019s failure at trial to specify a constitutional basis for the exclusion of evidence does not preclude our consideration of the constitutional issue. As in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>343 Mass. 703, 707, \u201c[w]e are here concerned with retroactive operation only in a limited sense, as the appeal is before us in regular course for decision on the law as it presently stands. \u2019 \u2019 We turn now to the merits of the defendant\u2019s constitutional argument. When the judge ruled that the testimony of the police officers relating to the interrogation was admissible, the ruling was proper on the law as it then stood. <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478, 490-491, held, however, that \u201cwhere . . . the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>silent, the accused has be\u00e9n denied \u2018the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as \u2018made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U. S., at 342, and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial.\u201d We have examined with care the circumstances of the arrest and interrogation of the defendant and conclude that he was unconstitutionally deprived of his right to \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel\u201d as this right is formulated in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra. </em>We cannot conclude that when the defendant\u2019s statements were uttered the investigation was \u201cinvestigatory\u201d and had not \u201cbegun to focus on a particular suspect.\u201d Nor can we say that the evidence admitted was not prejudicial. The issue is not whether there was sufficient other evidence upon which the defendant could have been convicted; rather it is whether a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d exists \u201cthat the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U. S. 85, 86-87. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>348 Mass. 7, 13. The jury could have chosen to believe the police officers and not the defendant, who contradicted the officers\u2019 testimony. The police testimony could have carried significant weight in the jury\u2019s determination of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">2. Since there must be a new trial we shall discuss briefly other questions raised by the defendant. Two police officers positioned themselves near his cell during the evening of February 12,1963, and overheard conversations between him and his family. He assigns as error the admission in evidence of what the officers heard. <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U. S. 201, on which the defendant relies, is not applicable for here there was no \u201carrangement\u201d between the police and a third party for purposes of eliciting incriminating statements. Under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>343 Mass. 299, 303-305, which we consider controlling, the evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">3. It is contended that it was error, as a matter of law, to permit a bank teller to identify the defendant as one. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the holdup men when the teller admitted that he was nervous and in fear at the time of the robbery and saw no portion of the man\u2019s flesh. We reject this contention. The teller heard the voice of the holdup man at the bank and of the defendant at the police station. This was a basis for identification and the evidence was properly submitted to the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>138 Mass. 185, 186. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>242 Mass. 427, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">4. We need not discuss other contentions of the defendant. We have examined them and need only say that no other error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b327-6\">Kirk, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8E\">(concurring) I agree with the result. The opinion, in my judgment, however, should rest solely on the undisputed fact that the defendant, having become the prime suspect, was denied, after his request, the opportunity to consult counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
