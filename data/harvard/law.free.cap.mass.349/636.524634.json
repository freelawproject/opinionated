L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, under two indictments charging each with unarmed robbery. Both defendants were found guilty. The cases come here on their appeals with one assignment of error. The error assigned is the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial, which occurred in these circumstances. One Denommee, a police officer of the city of Lowell who had investigated the case, was called as a witness by the Commonwealth and testified with respect to the arrest of the defendants. On cross-examination by counsel representing both defendants the officer was asked whether a photograph had been taken of Fuller when he was brought to the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>station, and the officer stated that he was not there at that time. Counsel then asked brm whether it was customary \u201cto photograph people arrested and charged with a crime in the Lowell Police station.\u201d The officer replied, \u201cThe defendant has a prior record and he had this picture.\u201d Thereupon defence counsel moved for a mistrial. The motion was denied, subject to the defendants\u2019 exception. The judge then said,1 <em>\u2018 </em>I will ask the jury to disregard it. \u201d Following a bench conference, the judge said further, \u201cI am going to ask the jury to please disregard the last statement that the officer made in regard to the defendant that he was speaking about.\u201d The officer\u2019s answer was not responsive and contained incompetent evidence. The proper practice in such a case is for the objecting party to move to have the answer struck, and to save an exception if the motion is denied. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>323 Mass. 435, 439. This course was not pursued. But the judge in effect did all that such a motion, if made and granted, could have accomplished. He was not obliged to go further and declare a mistrial. That was a matter within his discretion. <em>Curley </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. </em>314 Mass. 31. No abuse of discretion appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
