On November 20, 1961, twenty-two welders employed by the company in the same building with the claimants, who are not welders, went on strike. As a result, there was no work for nine sheet metal workers, who are among the claimants. \u201c [Approximately twenty additional employees [at least some of whom are also claimants] . . . were laid off at various times as the work dried up.\u201d The work of the welders and the claimants was in various respects closely interdependent. The welders and the claimants belong to the bargaining unit of production and maintenance employees represented by the same union local.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Three hundred and fifty additional employees were notified not to report to work on Monday, December 4, 1961. Over the weekend of December 2-3,1961, however, the company used laboratory and management personnel to do some welding work, and on December 4, 1961, it \u201cfarmed out\u201d certain welding work needed in the assembly of company products. This was done \u201cto get parts welded and to make them available to the people in the shop and to meet customers\u2019 schedules.\u201d As a consequence, some employees who had been laid off, or notified not to report for work, were recalled. The welders remained on strike until January 8,1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The director, on January 3, 1962, approved the claims filed by the claimants because of the company\u2019s \u201cdecision to have work which ordinarily would be performed by the claimants done by an outside organization.\u201d The company requested a hearing before the board of review \u201con the ground that the employees involved . . . [were] not entitled to benefits as they were out of work due to a labor dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The board of review found essentially the facts stated above. It pointed out that \u201c [a]s a result of the strike . . . work for employees who worked hand-in-hand with the welders or who worked on parts either before or after they would have been welded, dwindled\u201d and that \u201cto continue production and . . . save the jobs of about three hundred and fifty people, the [c]ompany decided to \u2018farm out\u2019 . . . the welding operation.\u201d The board also found that \u201ctwenty-seven claimants were not recalled during the . . . dispute,\u201d that \u201cthere certainly was a labor dispute,\u201d that \u201cthere was no work stoppage of any consequence and that production continued at the same rate at which it existed prior to the strike.\u201d The board, ignoring the undisputed evidence that the disruption of usual production was a direct consequence of the welders\u2019 strike, concluded that the \u201cclaimants\u2019 unemployment was directly brought about by the . . . [company\u2019s] decision to farm the work out,\u201d and \u201cthat whatever took place was not such a stoppage of work . . . [as] the statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires.\u201d The board affirmed the director\u2019s determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The company then filed a petition for review in the District Court, which on August 6, 1964, affirmed the board\u2019s decision. The company appealed. The district judge filed a report, which includes a transcript of the evidence before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The question for decision is whether, within G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (b), see fn. 1, there was <em>\u201ca </em>stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory ... or other premises\u201d where the claimants were employed in November, 1961. There appears to be no dispute concerning the basic facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Two Massachusetts cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have dealt with \u00a7 25 (b) in respects here relevant. In <em>Adomaitis </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>334 Mass. 520, this court dealt with \u201ca general reduction of work in the plant, and . . . [did] not reach the question . . . whether individual or group refusals to work <em>which do not diminish the work done in the plant </em>can ... be work stoppages\u201d (emphasis supplied). It was held (pp. 523-524), \u201c [T]he words \u2018stoppage of work\u2019 have a wider meaning than \u2018strike\u2019 or \u2018lockout\u2019 \u201d and that the \u201cboard was right in holding in effect that where a labor dispute blocks a substantial amount of work which would otherwise be done it has stopped that much of the work and there is therefore a \u2018 stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute.\u2019 \u2019 \u2019 The court declined (p. 525) to limit the exclusions from unemployment benefits \u201cto cases where all work had stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In <em>Worcester Telegram Publishing Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>347 Mass. 505, this court held that, upon the termination of a stoppage of work because of a labor dispute, strikers permanently displaced could then receive unemployment benefits for periods after fully normal operations in the employers\u2019 plant had been resumed (in the absence of circumstances like, or analogous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>to, those which appeared in <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Employment Security, </em>333 Mass. 244; see note, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 1273).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In the case before us normal operations of the company\u2019s plant were materially obstructed by the welders\u2019 labor dispute from shortly after November 20,1961, until January 8, 1962. Plant production would have been seriously curtailed except for the company\u2019s efforts to prevent the welders\u2019 strike from putting a great number of other employees out of work. The labor dispute directly caused those company efforts. Unfortunately, the company seems to have been unable to avoid laying off some employees who worked either closely with the welders or in processes very directly dependent upon the welders \u2019 work. The welders \u2019 work and the claimants\u2019 work was not carried on in the company\u2019s plant during most, if not all, of the period of dispute. There was a work stoppage- in the sense that an important segment of the production process was forced out of the company\u2019s plant by the labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">If the company\u2019s management had been less efficient and had not quickly transferred the welders\u2019 work elsewhere, substantially more employees would have been laid off, and the delivery of end products from the plant would probably have soon been substantially reduced. Plainly, such a reduction in ultimate deliveries would have been regarded as a substantial stoppage of work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Hughes, </em>9300 Mass. Bd. Rev. p. 5. See also <em>Magner </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>141 Neb. 122; 129-131 (30% decrease in total business); <em>Mortensen </em>v. <em>Board of Review, </em>21 N. J. 242, 244-245 (\u201cdiminution of the volume of work . . . otherwise . . . available\u201d). Cf. <em>Cumberland &amp; Allegheny Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Hatcher, </em>147 W. Va. 630, 643. Although in the present case, there is no evidence that end product deliveries were materially curtailed by the labor dispute, the question remains whether such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>curtailment is essential to a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d under \u00a725 (b). The work stoppage relied on by the company is that caused by the welders\u2019 failure to produce component parts of end products which put fifty employees, including the welders, out of work by December 1, 1961, and threatened to put 350 more persons out of work by December 4. We are thus faced with the novel question \u2014 whether such a stoppage of work in the company\u2019s plant itself, and the consequent transfer of work from the plant, created a disqualification of the claimants under \u00a7 25 (b), in the absence of a substantial and continuing disruption of end product deliveries.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The cases elsewhere indicate that the term \u201cstoppage of work,\u201d in the disqualification clause of statutes much like \u00a7 25 (b), \u201crefers to the effect upon the employer\u2019s operations produced by the labor dispute or, in other words, to resulting unemployment. ... [I]t declares disqualification of a class . . . whose unemployment is the result of the curtailment or stoppage of the employer\u2019s operations. It does not refer to the cessation of work by the individual employee or employees.\u201d See <em>Magner </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>141 Neb. 122, 129-131.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also <em>Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Sakrison, </em>71 Ariz. 219, 225 (very substantial curtailment); <em>Inter-Island Resorts, Ltd,, </em>v. <em>Akahane, </em>46 Hawaii, 140,146-151; <em>Abbott Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Annunzio, </em>414 Ill. 559, 568-571; <em>Lawrence Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commn. </em>308 Mich. 198, 209; <em>Cumberland &amp; Allegheny Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Hatcher, </em>147 W. Va. 630, 643. We recognize that some of the cases (e.g. the <em>Cumberland &amp; Allegheny Gas Co. </em>case) have tended to require a showing of a very sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>stantial interruption of an employer\u2019s plant operations by a labor dispute as the basis of a finding of a \u201cstoppage of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The <em>Adomaitis </em>case, 334 Mass. 520, 523-524, pointed out that \u201cwhere a labor dispute blocks a substantial amount of work which would otherwise be done it has stopped that much of the work.\u201d The case treated such an obstruction as a \u201cstoppage of work.\u201d Here, certainly, the welders\u2019 dispute blocked the work of the nearly thirty claimants, in addition to the welders\u2019 own work, and caused its removal from the plant. This on its face was not an insubstantial obstruction, and was in character so closely connected with a labor dispute as to be within what appears to be the policy of the disqualification of \u00a7 25 (b). That policy denies unemployment benefits to those participating in a labor dispute while a stoppage of work continues<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and also to certain classes of persons closely connected with, or interested in (see the <em>Martineau </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>fn. 2), such a dispute. Whatever the underlying reasons for the policy may be (see the articles cited in fn. 3), the policy goes at least to the extent just indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The pressure exerted by the strike upon the production process has prevented the company from having a substantial amount of work performed in its own plant. We think that the statutory language and its apparent policy require us to treat this prevention of work as a \u201cstoppage of work\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 25 (b). The subsidiary findings and the undisputed evidence before the board do not permit the board\u2019s conclusion that the farming out of work caused the claimants \u2019 unemployment. The record establishes that both the claimants\u2019 unemployment and the stoppage of work in the plant were caused by the labor dispute. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>findings and the evidence also do not permit the conclusion that there was no substantial stoppage of work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The decision of the District Court affirming the decision of the board of review is reversed. The case is to be remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\"> General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (as amended through St. 1959, e. 554), reads in part, \u201cNo . . . benefits shall be paid to an individual . . . for . . .

Rev. 338, 340-341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The Nebraska court went on to say: \u201cA labor dispute may produce a stoppage or curtailment of work in an employing establishment in three ways: (1) The cessation of work by all or part of the employees; (2) the cessation of work by a part of the employees may disable the employer from utilizing the services of other employees; (3) it may diminish patronage by customers or the public of the employing establishment and thereby produce a compensating unemployment of workers. In either event the resulting unemployment is due to a stoppage of work because of the labor dispute. Obviously, if those leaving work are immediately replaced, or if the dispute does not _ otherwise interfere with production or operation and these are not diminished, there is no stoppage of work and hence no disqualification. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\"> The stoppage, of course, continued until the plant resumed normal production.

See the <em>Martineau </em>case, 329 Mass. 44, 51. No findings indicate whether these exceptions have relevance here, or whether significance is to be attached to the circumstances that the welders were all members of, or eligible for membership in, the same local organisation of the same union. The board made no findings on these issues, presumably because it erroneously dealt with the case on the theory that there was no stoppage of work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
