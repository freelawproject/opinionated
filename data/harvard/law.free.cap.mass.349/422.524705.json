The next day a hole was found in a window in the office of one Dr. Thompson, 634 Massachusetts Avenue, and a bullet was recovered in the office. A filling station attendant named Pratt had identified Lillis as the man who, on September 14, 1964, had shot at and wounded him on the premises at 701 Somerville Avenue, Somerville. The bullet that wounded Pratt had been recovered. On September 14,1964, prior to the hold up in Somerville, a shot was fired in the course of a hold up in Watertown and the bullet had been recovered. The three bullets had been examined and tested by a State police ballistic expert. In his opinion they were fired from the same gun. Lillis was arrested on September 16, 1964, at the home of Nikas. Based upon these facts and \u201cmy person[al] knowledge there is probable cause to believe that the pistol used in the shooting at Clarence Anderson is being concealed in the apartment of Louis Nikas at 106 Pleasant St. Cambridge, Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The gun and clip were found in the course of a search of the first floor apartment occupied by Nikas.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">1. The affidavit supported the issuance of the warrant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>While a warrant may issue only upon a finding of \u201cprohable cause\u201d this of course means less evidence than would justify a finding of guilt and the finding may rest upon evidence, such as hearsay, not legally competent in a criminal trial, but there must be some support for the affiant\u2019s belief in the credibility of the informant and the reliability of the information. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102, 107-108, and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lepore, ante, </em>121, 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">These requirements were met. It was reasonable to conclude that, probably, the bullet found in Dr.. Thompson\u2019s office came from a gun fired by Nikas, the bullet that wounded Pratt was fired by Lillis, and the' bullets were fired from the same gun; also that it was likely that the gun was in the apartment of Nikas where Lillis had been found and arrested. That the date of the attack on Anderson was not stated in the affidavit does not weaken the force of the facts alleged. The judge might infer that it had been a recent occurrence but, whenever it happened, the immediate association of Nikas and Lillis in the apartment, the identity of the gun used in the respective hold ups and the fact that the hold up of Pratt had occurred on September 14, are enough. Police officers would be derelict in their duty if they did not seek a warrant on such disclosures. The reliability of the information is patent. It is plainly inferable that the identification by Anderson and Pratt was made to the police. Victims may be mistaken in identifying those who attack them, but such identification in the course of police investigation may not be disregarded and justifies search and arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It is unnecessary to determine how far information had by the judge who granted the warrant, as shown at the hearing on the motion to suppress, but not shown by the warrant, the application and the affidavit, may be considered in determining the validity of the warrant. See <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 109, fn. 1; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laudate, </em>345 Mass. 169, 170,172-173; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lepore, ante, </em>121,123<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>2. The warrant described the place of search with sufficient accuracy. The evidence showed that Nikas occupied the -first floor apartment and used the basement to store personal property. The place to be searched was \u201cthe apartment numbered 106 Pleasant St. Cambridge (occupied by) Louis Nikas.\u201d This was described as having \u201c1st 2nd floors and the basement.\u201d As, in fact, the apartment did not include the second floor the warrant did not authorize the search of the second floor. The holding of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>219 P. 2d 324, 326 (7th Cir.) (a warrant that describes an entire apartment building when cause is shown for searching only one apartment is invalid) is inapplicable. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ratushny, </em>82 N. J. Super. 499, 504-507 (App. Div.). That, as the evidence showed, the police officer knew that Mrs. Nikas occasionally visited the family living on the second floor, was irrelevant. Even if that were the basis for including the second floor in the description, it did not change the meaning of the warrant. It purported only to authorize a search of the premises of Nikas. That search was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">3. We do not reach the issue whether Lillis, not being an occupant of the premises at the time of the search had no right of privacy in respect thereof and hence has no standing to object thereto. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 265-267; <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 471, 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">4. The motions to suppress are to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\n<em>So ordered..</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-16\"> The indictments were as follows: Lillis, armed robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon and armed assault with intent to murder; Nikas, accessory before the fact to these crimes; Bulger, accessory after the fact to the same crimes and unlawfully carrying a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
