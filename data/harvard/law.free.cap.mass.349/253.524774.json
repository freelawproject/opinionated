The trial was subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. The sole issue presented is whether there was error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress certain evidence which the defendant contends was obtained by the Commonwealth by an illegal search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">We summarize the evidence bearing on this issue. About 3 p.m. on June 9, 1964, Sergeant Matthew F. King, a Boston police officer with twenty-four years of experience, proceeded, in response to a radio call, to a hotel on Atlantic Avenue, Boston. He there learned from a maid, the housekeeper and the hotel manager that two guns and loose bullets were in a drawer in a room on the second floor of the hotel and that a man had registered alone for the room about 6 a.m. on June 9 under the name of Welch. He also learned that later on the same day the same man under a different name had registered for a room on the third floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>of the hotel. In the officer\u2019s experience it was unusual for one person to be licensed to carry more than one gun. It therefore could be found, as the judge implicitly did find, that Sergeant King had probable cause to believe that the person who registered for and occupied the room on the second floor had committed a felony in violation of GL L. c. 269, \u00a7 10. The officer went to the third floor accompanied by others. As the defendant emerged from the room the maid said,\u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>That\u2019s him.\u2019\u2019 The defendant was immediately arrested by the officer and searched. On his person were some bills, a key to the room on the third floor, and, in his back pocket, a key to the room on the second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">At the time of his arrest the defendant said that he had \u201cfound\u201d the key to the second floor room. He denied that he had registered for that room. He denied that he was in that room. Thereafter Sergeant King, without a warrant, and accompanied by the manager, searched the second floor room and found in a chest of drawers two fully loaded revolvers, extra bullets, and a coat with coins and bills in one of the pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">There was no error in denying the motion to suppress. The arrest, being based on probable cause, was lawful. <em>Muniz </em>v. <em>Mehlman, </em>327 Mass. 353, 356, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>344 Mass. 524, 525. The search of the defendant\u2019s person, being incidental to the arrest, was likewise lawful. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>344 Mass. 524, 525, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">The judge could find that the defendant\u2019s statements to the police amounted to a total disclaimer or disavowal of any right to or interest in or connection with the room on the second floor. The police and the hotel manager could take him at his word. The defendant cannot now be heard to complain that his constitutional rights were violated. See <em>Abel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 217, 241. Cf. <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>California, </em>376 U. S. 483, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">Since it is conceded that the seized evidence, together with other evidence produced at the trial, was sufficient to warrant the findings of guilty, the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
