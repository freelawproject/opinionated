L. c. 152, \u00a7 37,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought by The Travelers Insurance Company (insurer) before the Industrial Accident Board (board). The case is here on appeal by the Commonwealth from a final decree of the Superior Court ordering the State Treasurer to reimburse the insurer the amount of $7,154.32 out of the special fund established under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65, in accordance with the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">The evidence at the hearing most favorable to the insurer is herewith summarized. The employee has worked in shoe factories all of his adult life. In 1919, he suffered complete amputations of the second, third, fourth and fifth fingers of his right hand rendering it \u201c100% disabled.\u201d On May 4,1962, while working, his left hand \u201cgot caught\u201d in one of the cutters. \u25a0 \u201cIt took the ring finger off and part of the middle finger, and injured the little finger. The little and index fingers were jammed so the knuckles are cracked and useless.\u201d Consequently, he is unable to tie his shoes or button his shirt. A physician testified that the employee \u201chas 100% disability in that hand,\u201d in terms of the work he had done all his life, and \u201cfor all practical purposes\u201d with respect to loss of function for everyday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>living as well. The insurer paid the employee $14,308.64 including a lump sum settlement of $12,000, certain medical benefits and weekly payments made prior to the settlement. In addition the insurer paid $2,500 in benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, for which it cannot receive reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The Commonwealth contends that \u201cthe evidence presented at the hearing on the insurer\u2019s petition was insufficient as matter of law to warrant the finding that the injury to the employee\u2019s left hand in 1962 resulted in the permanent incapacity of said hand.\u201d We are satisfied from our examination of the entire record that the evidence warranted the board\u2019s finding of \u201cpermanent incapacity of the left hand.\u201d <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136, 138. <em>Floccher\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 54, 56. See <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The Commonwealth also contends \u201cthat the lump-sum settlement payment made by the insurer to the employee [under \u00a7 48] is not subject to reimbursement under section 37,\u201d because \u201c [n]o mention is made of section 48 nor of lump-sum settlements\u201d in \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">A lump sum settlement under \u00a7 48 is \u201cas near as possible to the present value of all the compensation payments which the employee would be entitled to receive in the future.\u201d <em>Paltsios\u2019s Case, </em>329 Mass. 526, 529. In that sense it is \u201cthe compensation provided by\u201d those sections of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which establish liability. (See \u00a7 37.) Further, \u00a7 48 permits settlement \u201cwhenever the division deems it to be for the best interests of the employee.\u201d It is reasonable to assume, if no reimbursement is made for settlements, insurers will refuse to settle. Such a result would not be in the \u201cbest interests of the employee\u201d and frustrate the purpose of \u00a7 48 in allowing settlements. We are of opinion that \u00a7 37 requires the Commonwealth to reimburse the insurer for a settlement of the insurer\u2019s liability for compensation under \u00a7\u00a7 31, 32, 34, 34A, 35 and 35A.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Another contention of the Commonwealth is that \u201ca lump-sum settlement includes redemption of liability re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>garding specific injuries under section 36,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is \u201cspecifically excluded from reimbursement\u201d under the statute. The insurer paid $2,500 in \u00a7 36 benefits in addition to the settlement, but the Commonwealth argues that \u201c [t]he record does not specify under what subdivision of section 36 this award was made,\u201d and therefore the insurer had a further potential liability under \u00a7 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The insurer requested reimbursement for \u201ccompensation which it has paid the employee under the Act, excluding any Section 36 benefits.\u201d It then listed the compensation paid for which it requested reimbursement, including the settlement and specifically excluding $2,500 in \u00a7 36 benefits. This amounts to an allegation that the settlement did not include any \u00a7 36 benefits. The Commonwealth had an opportunity to dispute this before the board and in the Superior Court, but we find nothing in the record to indicate that it did. The board was warranted in finding \u201cthat the insurer has paid . . . (partially by way of a lump sum settlement approved by the . . . [board] on January 22, 1963), the amount of $14,308.64, exclusive of the amounts paid under section 36 of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 37, provides in material part: \"Whenever an employee who has previously suffered a physical- impairment resulting in the loss by severance,' or the permanent incapacity, of one hand at or above the wrist . . . incurs further disability by the loss or permanent incapacity of a hand ... by reason of a personal injury for which compensation is required by this chapter, he . . . shall be paid the compensation provided for by sections thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-four, thirty-four A, thirty-five or thirty-five A, in the following manner: Such compensation shall be paid by the insurer . . . who shall be reimbursed for fifty per cent thereof by the state treasurer from the fund established by section sixty-five; but, the additional compensation required by section thirty-six shall be paid by the insurer.

(h) For bodily disfigurement the number of weeks which, according to the determination of the industrial accident board, reviewing board or single member, is a proper and equitable compensation, not to exceed one hundred and twenty-five weeks, which sum shall be payable in addition to all other sums under this section wherever the same shall be applicable. . . . (m) For loss by severance of the left or minor hand at the wrist, a period of one hundred weeks. . . . (q) If the member, whether leg, foot, arm or hand, is not lost by severance, but is so injured as to be permanently incapable of use, for the same number of weeks as though it were severed; provided, however, that if the loss of use is less than total, then for such period of weeks in proportion to the period applicable in the event of total loss of use of said leg, foot, arm or hand as the functional loss bears to the total loss of use of such leg, foot, arm or hand.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
