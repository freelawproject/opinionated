One Styron and his wife were permitted to intervene. The plaintiff appealed from a final decree dismissing the bill. The evidence is reported. The facts are stated, except as otherwise indicated, on the basis of a very complete report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Mrs. Bells listed her residential shore front property on Vineyard Harbor with a broker named Cronig and \u201cwith at least one other broker .... No special authority was given . . . [to] Cronig other than the usual listing contract to produce a purchaser, willing and able to buy ... on the seller\u2019s terms. No written authorization was given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>After preliminary negotiations with Gronig, Espy, from Washington, told Gronig\u2019s associate and secretary in Vineyard Haven by telephone on Friday, September 13, 1963, \u201cthat . . . [Espy] and his wife . . . would pay Mrs. Bells \u2019 price of\u201d $75,000. Espy emphasized that he wanted the property and said, \u201c [P]lease latch it down for me.\u201d Espy then \u201cdid not know \u2018what the financial details would be.\u2019 \u201d At noon that day, Gronig called Espy, then still in Washington, and reported that he had seen Mrs. Bells who had said that Espy\u2019s \u201cacceptance of her offer was agreeable to her.\u201d She also was reported as saying, \u201cI feel sorry for the Styrons [other people who had been bidding for the property] \u2014 but this is a business matter and . . . Espy has met my price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Gronig then told Espy he must put down a deposit of ten per cent and that \u201c [settlement . . . will be within sixty days.\u201d Espy promised that he would \u201ccome up just as soon as possible to settle the matter,\u201d that he \u201cwould sign whatever documents, whatever had to be done,\u201d and that he would send a check. Espy testified that he understood that then \u201cthe contract was completed\u201d and that only \u201cformalities\u201d remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Later that afternoon, apparently before 2:15 p.m., Gronig called Mrs. Espy and said, \u201c [Everything was a mess .... Mrs. Styron had come ... [to Mrs. Bells] and said that she would pay $75,000 ... or meet any bid that . . . [Espy] might make.\u201d Espy, then away from the house, upon his return failed to reach Gronig by telephone. Thereupon he sent Gronig a telegram insisting \u201con fulfillment of contract I made today through you with Mrs. Bells\u201d and stating that he would \u201cbring legal action.\u201d He transmitted to Gronig by air mail a letter, mailed at 2:25 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. that day, which said, \u201cIn conformity with our telephone call, my contract with Mrs. Bells, I am enclosing a deposit of $7,500.\u201d The evidence shows that the deposit check bore the notation, \u201cFor ten per cent deposit on purchase of Bells\u2019 property off Main Street, Vineyard Haven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>That evening, after a further telephone conference with Cronig, Espy arrived by airplane at Vineyard Haven. There he learned from Cronig that Mrs. Eells in the afternoon had signed a written contract for the sale of the property to the Styrons at some time between 2:15 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. despite her earlier acceptance of Espy\u2019s offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">On September 19, 1963, Cronig returned Espy\u2019s check with a letter, \u201cIt is with regret that I return the enclosed check in the amount of $7500.00 to you. Under the circumstances, I have no alternative.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The trial judge in effect ruled (1) that, despite the telephone talk between Cronig and Espy accepting the latter\u2019s offer, the parties had intended to enter into a later formal written contract of purchase and sale; and (2) that neither Cronig\u2019s letter of September 19 nor the exchange of correspondence marked for identification constituted an adequate memorandum to satisfy the statute of frauds (G. L. c. 259, \u00a7 1, Fourth<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), which was pleaded. The judge concluded that \u201cMrs. Eells gave no authorization, written or oral, to . . . Cronig, to execute in her behalf any written promise, contract or agreement \u2014 and he did not do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Even if it be assumed (1) that the parties intended to make an immediate oral contract when Cronig communicated to Espy Mrs. Eells\u2019 acceptance of Espy\u2019s $75,000 offer, and (2) that Mrs. Eells shortly thereafter was induced by the Styrons to repudiate a firm oral commitment to Espy, the statute of frauds was pleaded. This made it necessary for Espy to prove (see <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Slovin, </em>270 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Mass. 392, 394; <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Raytheon Mfg. Co. </em>299 Mass. 218, 219; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>320 Mass. 739, 741) the existence of an adequate memorandum of the commitment, signed by Mrs. Eells or by some person \u201clawfully authorized\u201d (fn. 2) by her. No memorandum was signed by Mrs. Eells. Any satisfaction of the requirements of the statute of frauds must rest on Cronig\u2019s letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We need not consider whether the correspondence between Cronig and Espy would have constituted an adequate memorandum,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> if Mrs. Eells had in fact authorized Cronig to sign a memorandum for her. The trial judge was justified in concluding that Cronig had no authority from Mrs. Eells to sign for her any memorandum. See <em>Harrigan </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>216 Mass. 461,1463-464; <em>Record </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>218 Mass. 483, 485-486. See also <em>Vallis </em>v. <em>Rimer, </em>335 Mass. 528, 532. The evidence, almost entirely oral, did not require (if, indeed, it permitted) the judge to find that Cronig had more authority from Mrs. Eells than to produce a customer. See Be statement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 53, comment b. The judge could reasonably have concluded, also, that any authority which Cronig may have had to act for Mrs. Eells terminated when (because of the contract with the Styrons) her land ceased to be available for sale, several days before Cronig\u2019s first letter, that of September 19, 1963. See <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>144 Mass. 256, 257; <em>Giolitto </em>v. <em>Dingolo, </em>251 Mass. 38, 40; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 525, esp. at p. 780. See also Williston, Contracts (3d ed.) \u00a7 588.
