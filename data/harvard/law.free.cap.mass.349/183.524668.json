(Crown). The cases were consolidated for trial and referred to an auditor (findings not final). There were verdicts (a) on the statutory death claim counts, based on negligence and nuisance, for the administrator of Louis\u2019 estate against Crown and against Dora; (b) for Brick Bar Cafe, Inc., and others against Crown; and (c) for Lawrence Di Boceo and Bichard Di Boceo against Crown.

Baldassare presents exceptions to the judge\u2019s action in directing verdicts for Crown and Dora on the conscious suffering counts. The evidence is stated in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Facts Applicable to all Four Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">A four story brick building at 228 Meridian Street, East Boston, was owned by Dora on February 20,1958, the date of the accident. In an answer to an interrogatory she admitted that she then controlled the building. She, in her name as owner, carried fire and liability insurance on the building. The building was assessed to her for taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The \u201cpremises were, in their entirety, leased to Crown . . . under an oral lease, whereby the tenant was responsible for all building repairs.\u201d The tenancy began prior to September, 1956, and continued to the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Crown used the building as a retail furniture store. Crown\u2019s officers were Sidney Fagelman, president; Herbert Starr, treasurer, who managed the furniture business; and Barney Fagelman (Barney), Dora\u2019s husband, clerk. Sid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ney was Barney\u2019s son. Herbert Starr was Barney\u2019s son-in-law. The three men were Crown\u2019s only stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Above the basement were three floors. \u201cAbove the third floor there was space which may be referred to as a loft but which was not intended for usual occupancy purposes.\u201d In this area, two trusses extended from the east \u201cwall to the west wall which were intended to support the weight of the roof. . . . The north truss was parallel to the north wall and was about 17 feet from\u201d it. A \u201csubstantial part of the weight of the roof rested upon the trusses which through the ends of the trusses transferred the weight to the east and west walls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">During September, 1956, a roof leak developed. It was found that a \u201cmember\u201d of the north truss was missing and \u201cthat . . . damage to the brick work of the east wall . . . supporting the truss was caused by effervescence and loosening of the cement joints and a settling of the roof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Barney engaged one Archibald, a licensed builder, to make the necessary repairs. \u201cArchibald applied for a permit as the duly authorized representative of the owner . . . to do the work.\u201d The Boston building code \u201crequires that all applications for repair be signed by an authorized agent of the owner.\u201d The city building department approved Archibald\u2019s plans. He proceeded to replace the missing member but \u201cfailed to complete the repairs to the loose . . . mortar between the bricks, leaving it in an effervescent condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u201cOn January 8,1958, the police received notice of a dangerous condition\u201d of the building. The street was blocked off and Starr summoned Archibald, who \u201cstarted to shore up the fractured truss . . . which had failed pushing out a bulge in the brick front\u201d of the Meridian Street side of the building. Under the direction of representatives of the building department, \u201cvarious jacks were used to shore up the building and remove the immediate danger of collapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">On January 8, 1958, also, \u201cBarney . . . received and Dora . . . was informed of a notice from the [bjuilding [department that the building . . . was unsafe \u00a3. . . so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>as to endanger li[\u00a3]e and . . . [was] a common nuisance . . ..\u2019 Thereafter an application, in the name of the owner as required by the [Boston] [b]uilding [c] ode . . . for a permit was . . . filed by representatives of\u201d a wrecking company. On January 10, a permit to \u201c [dismantle fractured area of building and make safe \u2019 \u2019 was granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Barney engaged one Rugo, a licensed engineer, to draw plans for permanent repairs. \u201cRugo, as the authorized representative of the owner, conferred with Inspector Gleason and\u201d the building commissioner regarding the repairs to the front wall and truss. \u201c [B] ecause of the dangerous nature of the job and because of his expressed distrust of . . . [Archibald\u2019s] qualifications,\u201d Gleason insisted that Rugo sign an affidavit required by the building code (that the plans complied with the code) \u201cas a condition to the issuance of the permit.\u201d Rugo \u201cunder his contract with\u201d Crown supervised the repairs. Archibald was low bidder. \u201cAn application for a permit for Crown\u201d was filed by Rugo to \u201crepair wood roof, trusses and replace front wall and exterior walls as shown on plan.\u201d A permit was issued on February 5,1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">On February 10 and 12, \u201cGleason complained to both Archibald and Rugo about the conduct of the work and on February 13, 1958, he stated to Starr and Archibald that unless conditions improved he was going to obtain a stop order.\u201d Starr, who had advertised for February 22 an \u201copening sale\u201d for Crown, was pressing \u201cRugo and Archibald to speed up the work and asked them both when the jacks could be removed.\u201d On February 19, Gleason, apparently in Starr\u2019s presence, told Rugo by telephone \u201cthat he, Gleason, would never personally order the jacks removed\u201d and that this was Rugo\u2019s \u201cresponsibility but that even when . . . [Rugo] gave the order to remove the jacks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>he, Gleason, forbade the removal . . . until . . . [Gleason] had examined the completed work. Gleason left the premises at about 1:45 p.m. on\u201d February 19, when \u201cabout 70 jacks were in place.\u201d The next day \u201cGleason . . . [again] ordered . . . [Bugo] not to permit the removal of the jacks until after he, Gleason, had inspected the completed work.\u201d Gleason did not visit the building again until after its collapse on February 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u201cOn the afternoon of February 19th, Bugo authorized the removal of all pipe jacks in the basement, first [floor] and second floor and some of the pipe jacks on the third floor which Archibald demonstrated were . . . bearing no weight.\u201d One McDonald, an employee of Crown, with a truck and helper, \u201cremoved 35 or 40 jacks from the basement, first and second floor of the building. On February 20th, he and his helper removed more jacks from the third floor.\u201d There was effort \u201cto get the job finished.\u201d He \u201cused a ten pound sledge hammer to knock out some of the jacks causing loose timbers over the jacks to fall to the floor.\u2019\u2019Archibald helped \u201cwith one stubborn jack.\u201d The big screw jacks under the trusses were never removed. He took \u201cabout 100 jacks to\u201d the supplier of the jacks. When he left the building about 4:30 p.m. \u201cabout 15 pipe jacks were still in place on the third floor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">At about 4:40 p.m on February 20, 1958, the entire roof collapsed after failure of the trusses. Pressures against the walls caused the upper portions to be knocked outward. \u201c [A]n avalanche of brick fell onto Meridian Street\u201d and on neighboring property.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">A consulting engineer testified (1) that in his opinion the cause of the collapse was the faulty design of the truss, the repairs made, and poor workmanship, (2) that if all the jacks had been left in place, the building would not have collapsed, and (3) that the wall would have collapsed whenever the jacks were removed. Gleason testified that there were three causes, including removal of the jacks. The auditor found that, among other causes of the collapse, Crown\u2019s employees, \u201cin their haste to . . . [resume] com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>mercial use, removed . . . jacks without affording adequate opportunity for inspection,\u201d and that they \u201cacted contrary to the advice of the\u201d building department inspector. He concluded (1) \u201cthat there were contributing causes for which Crown, Archibald, and Rugo are answerable,\u201d (2) that Dora \u201chad no part in the construction,\u201d and (3) that he could not find \u201cthat any other party was acting as her agent. \u201d He found generally for Dora in the actions against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Louis\u2019 Alleged Conscious Suffeeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Louis, eight years old, was proceeding along Meridian Street with his friends, Richard and Lawrence Di Rocco. The auditor found that \u201c [b] ricks from the east wall of the [b]uilding . . . knocked . . . [Louis] to the sidewalk.\u201d Although the auditor found that Louis \u201cshowed no signs of consciousness . . . after the accident,\u201d the following additional testimony was introduced at the trial. Richard Di Rocco testified that he heard Lawrence yell, \u201cThe sky is falling.\u201d The witness then proceeded, \u201c[W]e see everything fall \u2014 we started to run to get away from it \u2014 then I got hit ... I saw Louis fall down against the wall . . . I saw Louis getting up by putting his hands on the window sill, then first getting on to his knees and then his legs, facing the window \u2014 He turned around and started to yell, making a motion to run out toward the street, starting to yell: \u2018Dickie, Dickie\u2019 and then \u2018Ma, Ma,\u2019 and then he ran out toward the street. Bricks were falling before he got there. He kept on falling and falling until he was buried and then I didn\u2019t see anything after that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">When the police reached Louis he \u201cwas bleeding profusely from the head and mouth. He was gurgling and breathing but was unconscious.\u201d He was taken to the relief station and was dead shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Exceptions Relating to the Auditob\u2019s Rbpobt.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">1. Crown and Dora contend that their constitutional rights to a jury trial were violated by submitting the audi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tor\u2019s report to the jury. In Massachusetts, the use of auditors, whose findings are not to be final, to hear evidence in advance of a civil trial by jury in an effort to clarify the issues, has been authorized by statute since St. 1817, c. 142. The constitutional validity of the practice is established. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>122 Mass. 505, 516-521. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The reference of issues of fact for preliminary hearing before an auditor involves no deprivation of the right to a trial by jury. At the trial before the jury, the auditor\u2019s report becomes prima facie evidence \u2018 \u2018 entitled to be weighed like any other evidence upon any question of fact to which it is relevant\u201d and otherwise has effect as more fully stated in <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Farm Serv. Stores, Inc. </em>301 Mass. 564, 565-569.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not prevent the appointment of an auditor in the Federal courts. <em>Ex parte Peterson, </em>253 U. S. 300, 306-314. Such appointments are authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 16 (5) and 53 (e) (III), 28 U. S. <em>C. (1958) </em>Appendix, pp. 5144, 5172. See Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 16.5, 53.01-53.10, 53.14. Rule 53 (a) provides that \u201cthe court in which any action is pending may appoint a special master therein\u201d and that \u201cthe word\u2018master\u2019includes . . . an auditor.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent a State from adopting methods and policies of pretrial, of the use of auditors and masters, and of the conduct of civil jury trials, different from those usual in the Federal practice. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, in a civil case, it has been said that even \u201cdeprivation of a right of trial by jury in a [S]tote court does not deny the parties due process of law under the Federal Constitution.\u201d See <em>Wagner Elec. Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Lyndon, </em>262 U. S. 226, 232.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no merit to the defendants\u2019 exceptions (a) to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to strike the auditor\u2019s report in its entirety, and (b) to the reading of that report to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">2. Crown and Dora sought to strike par. 35 from the auditor\u2019s report,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and assert that this paragraph is unsupported by subsidiary findings and is in conflict with other findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The auditor\u2019s conclusion that Crown was negligent was warranted by his finding that Starr participated (in the face of G-leason\u2019s unwillingness to agree that the jacks could be removed) in removing pipe jacks before final inspection, especially from the third floor where Rugo had authorized such action only with respect to jacks bearing no weight. The auditor in effect concluded that the work had inherent, attendant dangers, which required Crown to guard against accidents. This conclusion was warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>by the auditor\u2019s findings (a) concerning the character of the work (see <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 149-153; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 409; Restatement 2d: Torts [Tent, drafts Nos. 6 and 7, April 7, 1961, April 16, 1962], \u00a7\u00a7 416, 422, 427, 427A), (b) that a wall bordering upon a street had to be rebuilt, (c) that there had been widespread installation of pipe jacks about which Starr certainly knew, and (d) that the building \u201cwas closed to the public during . . . repairs.\u201d There was no occasion for striking par. 35 from the report. Dora, of course, had no basis for complaint about the use of the auditor\u2019s report because the auditor\u2019s findings were wholly favorable to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Cases against Doea Fagelman.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">3. Dora admitted in her answer to an interrogatory that she controlled the building. She owned the building and carried insurance and paid taxes with respect to it. Nothing in the record, however, suggests that the small loft above the third floor, \u201cnot intended for usual occupancy,\u201d was not leased to Crown along with the remainder of the building under the oral lease by which Crown became responsible for all repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Dora also admitted in answers to interrogatories that the city had requested repairs and that she or her agents had conferred with city representatives about the building. Some, at least, of the applications for permits were made in her name as owner. The officers of Crown were her husband, her son, and her son-in-law. She knew of the building department\u2019s notice on January 8, 1958, that the building was unsafe \u201cand ... a common nuisance.\u201d In the circumstances, we cannot say that there was no evidence at all upon which the jury could find that she was in control of at least the portion of the premises in which the building failure occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Permit applications, signed by Rugo and Archibald as representatives of the owner, were admitted in evidence, so far as the record shows, without objection by Dora. Rugo and Archibald had been hired by the officers of Crown, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>were closely related to Dora. The jury might reasonably infer that the applications for permits were filed by persons authorized to act for her in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We assume that, in doing the work, Rugo and Archibald were independent contractors. The evidence warranted the jury in finding that the work undertaken was inherently dangerous (see <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 150-151) and of a type likely to cause injury to persons using the sidewalk unless special precautions were taken. The dangerous situation had been described as constituting a \u201ccommon nuisance\u201d in the building department\u2019s notice of January 8, 1958. Under the principles stated in <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 153-154, Dora could be found to be liable for any condition of the building constituting a nuisance and a source of danger to persons using the sidewalk below (a) which existed at the time of the letting to Crown under the oral lease, and (b) of which she knew or ought to have known. Her responsibility would not end with the lease. See Prosser, Torts (3d ed.) \u00a7 63 at pp. 414-415, \u00a7 70 at pp. 482-486.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The tenancy had \u201ccommenced at an undetermined time prior to September, 1956,\u201d when trouble with the roof and truss was first discovered. There is no evidence that the danger was knowm or should have been known to Dora before that discovery. The \u201coral lease,\u201d not shown to have been for any stated term, created at most a tenancy at will (see G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 3) terminable by notice in accordance with G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 12 (as amended through St. 1946, c. 202).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In determining whether a verdict for Dora could be directed, we must take into account, among other matters, the admissions of Dora that she controlled the premises, the rapidly terminable tenancy, the circumstance that the jury might reasonably infer the officers of Crown, Rugo, and Archibald (or some of them) to have been to some extent Dora\u2019s agents, the dangerous character of the work, and Dora\u2019s knowledge that the building had been described by the city department as a common nuisance. In the light of all these considerations, we think that Dora was not neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>sarily relieved, as matter of law, by the oral lease (which preceded the discovery of the defects), or by the employment of independent contractors, from a duty to take precautions against injury to members of the public. Upon the evidence the jury could conclude that Dora at least shared in the control of the building and in the obligation to take precautions. See <em>Grasselli Dyestuff Corp. </em>v. <em>John Campbell &amp; Co. </em>259 Mass. 103, 108-109; <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Shivek, </em>326 Mass. 142, 153-160; <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>345 Mass. 678, 680-681.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Although no specifically relevant exception has been claimed, one further question has been argued as bearing upon the propriety of the denial of a directed verdict for Dora. General Laws c. 229, \u00a7 2C, as amended through St. 1951, c. 250 (see later amendments, effective only after the date of the building collapse, by St. 1958, c. 238, \u00a7 3; see also c. 238, \u00a7 1, and St. 1962, c. 306, \u00a7 1), governs the recoveries for wrongful death against Crown and Dora. Where separate and independent, but concurring, acts of negligence have taken place, there may be recovery against each of two independent wrongdoers and collection by the plaintiff of amounts in the aggregate in excess of the statutory maximum. No more than that maximum, however, may be collected from any one defendant. See <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Sorell, </em>280 Mass. 457, 459-465; <em>Arnold, </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>316 Mass. 81, 84. The situation, however, is different where the liability of one defendant is based upon acts or omissions of other defendants imputed to the first defendant on agency principles. See <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>298 Mass. 393, 394-396. Although the evidence here permits a recovery against Dora for failure to take adequate precautions to protect the public, nothing suggests that she acted or omitted to act otherwise with respect to this building than through the same persons (i.e. her husband, other close relatives, and their contractors) who acted more immediately for Crown. Crown as such does not appear to have been her agent. She, however, plainly relied on the same persons who acted for Crown, and the same acts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>omissions imputed to Crown and to her, without independent activity or participation by her, are the basis of the recovery against Crown and against her. The situation seems to us to be covered by the reasoning in the <em>Leonard </em>case, so that no more than $18,000 (plus interest and costs) may be collected from Crown and no more than $16,000 (plus interest and costs) may be collected from Dora, and amounts collected from one (other than for costs) must be credited against the liability of the other, in accordance with the principles stated in the <em>Leonard </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The Counts fob Louis\u2019 Conscious Suffebing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">4. Although Richard Di Rocco \u201cgot hit\u201d before Louis fell, the evidence at the trial before the jury does not establish whether Louis was hit by a brick prior to his falling to the ground \u201cagainst the wall,\u201d or whether he merely stumbled. There is in that evidence no direct statement that bricks struck him before \u201che ran out toward the street,\u201d although it is said that \u201c [b]ricks were falling before he got there. \u2019 \u2019 There is no evidence which would warrant a finding of conscious suffering after that moment. The auditor found that bricks knocked Louis to the sidewalk and that he showed no signs of consciousness after the accident. On either the evidence at the trial or on the auditor\u2019s report, whether there was any conscious suffering at any time is a matter of sheer speculation. <em>Ghiz </em>v. <em>Wantman, </em>337 Mass. 415, 419-420, and cases cited. See <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Pittsfield Elec. Co. </em>293 Mass. 4, 8-9; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>348 Mass. 469, 474-478.
