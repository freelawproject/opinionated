The plaintiff entered into a subcontract with the defendant to perform the heating and ventilating work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>for the sum of $56,000. This work was to he in accordance with the architect\u2019s plans and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Section Y-1 incorporates into \u00a7 Y of the prime contract, which governs the work subcontracted to the plaintiff, certain provisions referred to at p. SG-1 of the prime contract. These include \u00a7\u00a7 5 (f) and 15 (a) of the \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d and \u00a7 SG-11 (c). Section 5 (f) provides that \u201c [n]othing contained in the [c] ontract [d] ocuments shall create any contractual relation between any subcontractor and the [gjovernment.\u201d Section 15 (a) provides, \u201cSpecific reference in the [sjpecifications to any article, device, product, material ... or type of construction, etc., by name . . . shall be interpreted as establishing a standard of quality and shall not be construed as limiting competition, and the [c] ontractor, in such cases, may at his option use any article . . . product, or material . . . which in the judgment of the [c] ontraeting [ojfficer expressed in writing is equal to that named.\u201d Section SG-11 (c) is similar to \u00a715 (a), adding that the contracting officer \u201cshall be the sole judge as to the \u2018recognized equal\u2019 and his decision shall be final. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Section Y provides for furnishing and installing, in classrooms and elsewhere, \u201cunit ventilators for series hot water heating.\u201d Section Y-17.05 (a) states that \u201c [tjhe heating system as showm [by the drawings] is based upon unit ventilators as manufactured by J. J. Nesbitt Inc., and all ratings and performances required are based upon such units.\u201d Finally, \u00a7 Y-17.05 (e) 1 states: \u201cUnit ventilator equipment as manufactured by Trane, Herman Nelson, or equal, may be used, provided however that approved auxiliary radiation as required herein . . . shall be arranged to meet the performance and operation specified.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The plaintiff requested approval of unit ventilators manufactured by the Schemenauer Company as the equal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>equipment designated in the specifications. The architect rejected the proposed substitute, whereupon the plaintiff, through the defendant, sought a hearing before the contracting officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, at the defendant\u2019s request, submitted its position to the contracting officer in writing. Prior to the hearing the plaintiff received a copy of a letter from the contracting officer. Equipment manufactured by Schemenauer was determined by him not to be the equal to that of Nesbitt. The plaintiff, both in this letter and at the hearing which was held later, was told that only Nesbitt equipment would be satisfactory, as the government insisted on standardization of equipment and Nesbitt equipment was used in the existing school.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The decision of the contracting officer was appealed by the plaintiff and the defendant. Before a hearing was held before the deputy commissioner of the government agency, the plaintiff and the defendant orally requested the architect to allow the use of Trane equipment. This request was denied. A hearing then took place, subsequent to which, on November 20, 1959, the deputy commissioner informed the defendant by letter that the decision of the contracting officer relative to Schemenauer equipment was affirmed, concluding that \u201cthe substitute unit ventilators you proposed to furnish are not the equal of the specified unit ventilators.\u201d Referring to the Trane equipment, the deputy commissioner wrote, \u201c [Ijnasmuch as the [c] ontracting [ojfficer as far back as August 10 last instructed you that the Nesbitt unit ventilators should be installed on the project, your request dated November 6,1959, for approval of the Trane unit ventilators is rejected. Consequently, you will be expected to comply with the instruction, namely the installation of the Nesbitt unit ventilators without further delay.\u201d Copies of this letter were forwarded by the defendant to the plaintiff, and on November 27, 1959, the plaintiff informed the defendant that it was proceeding to complete the subcontract under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In this action of contract the plaintiff seeks to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the extra cost of furnishing the Neshitt equipment. The .court directed a verdict for the defendant to which the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The plaintiff contends that the insistence of the contracting officer that the defendant \u2014 and through it the plaintiff \u2014 furnish Neshitt unit ventilators involved a change in the contract entitling the plaintiff to an equitable adjustment in price. There is a close similarity between this case and <em>Jack Stone Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>344 F. 2d 370 (Ct. CL), which held that a contracting officer misinterpreted a government contract containing an \u201cor equal\u201d clause (see \u00a7\u00a7 15 (a) and SG-11 (c) referred to above) by ruling that only the specified \u201cstandard of quality\u201d materials could be used.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Viewing the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff <em>(Howes </em>v. <em>Kelman, </em>326 Mass. 696, 697; <em>DeLeo </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>331 Mass. 317, 318), we conclude that the judge properly directed a verdict for the defendant. Three individuals \u2014 the architect, contracting officer, and deputy commissioner \u2014 concluded that Schemenauer equipment would not be satisfactory. The record indicates that the latter two authorities insisted on Nesbitt unit ventilators. But this, even if improper, does not establish that Schemenauer equipment is \u201cequal\u201d to that of Nesbitt. Indeed there is no evidence that Schemenauer does meet the specified standard of quality. This is a vital distinction between this case and the <em>Jack Stone Co. </em>decision, where the administrative board made \u201cthe equivalent of a finding of equality and adequacy.\u201d 344 F. 2d at 376. Section SG-11 (c) lends finality to the decision of the contracting officer. We cannot say that his decision was capricious, arbitrary, or unsupported by the evidence before him.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to the Trane equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ment, which the plaintiff belatedly attempted to substitute, \u00a7 Y-17.05 (e) 1 permits it to be used \u201cprovided . . . that approved auxiliary radiation as required herein . . . shall be arranged . . ..\u201d There is no evidence that the plaintiff complied with this proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> Section Y-l7.05 (e) 2 provides: \u201cUnit ventilators shall match storage cabinets provided by others, and all piping enclosures shall be as manufactured by the unit ventilator manufacturer.\u201d We note an apparent inconsistency in that \u00a7 X-9 (c) provides that \u201c [m]etal storage cabinets shall be . . . made by the same manufacturer that makes the classroom ventilating units that will be furnished by the heating subcontractor under Section T. \u2019 <em>\u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> For a discussion of the relationship between the contracting officer and the subcontractor, see Paul, United States Government Contracts <em>&amp; </em>Subcontracts, 229-231 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\"> This ruling was apparently based on the contracting officer\u2019s belief that standardization of fire alarm systems was necessary. The court\u2019s opinion notes that if this were so, the appropriate course would have been to delete the \u2018 \u2018standard of quality\u201d sections from the contract. 344 F. 2d at 374.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-12\"> At best the record is somewhat cloudy as to what evidence was before the administrative officials. The plaintiff did furnish \u201ccertain information on seventeen different items concerning the Schemenauer equipment. \u2019 \u2019 Presumably this information was the basis for the architect\u2019s decision and was considered by the contracting officer and the deputy commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
