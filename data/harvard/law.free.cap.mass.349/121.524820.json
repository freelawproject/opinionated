L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, as amended, from sentences imposed in the Superior Court after findings of guilty under six indictments, three charging breaking and entering and larceny and three charging larceny in a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">1. The defendants contend that there was error in the denial of their motions to suppress evidence. The motions were addressed to items of personal property seized under a search warrant. We discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">(a) Adequate basis for the issuance of a warrant was shown to the judge. The application, set out in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> disclosed that \u201canother defendant\u201d had given infor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>motion, and had pointed out the house named in the warrant and \u201cthat two other men were involved in the theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">An officer testified that it was as a result of being presented with this application that the judge issued the warrant. By this application the judge was in effect told that larceny by three men had occurred; and that one of the three men had been apprehended<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had given the police information as to the location of the stolen goods, that is, the apartment building named. We may assume the officer stated as much when he presented the application to the judge. Apart from such assumption, however, the recital of information obtained from \u201canother defendant\u201d was adequate to show probable cause within the principles stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U. S. 102. Incriminating admissions by one who asserts participation tend to show the reliability of his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">(b) The warrant described the property with sufficient particularity. It speaks for itself on this point. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>346 Mass. 300, 307-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>2. There was no error in the admission of statements of the defendants to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">At the apartment, the searching officers were admitted by the defendant Tai, to whom Officer Brooks exhibited the warrant. After the search Tai was asked what he knew about the items discovered, that is, jewelry, radio, cigarettes and \u201cchange\u201d (coins). Tai said he had \u201cbought them downtown from a guy he didn\u2019t know for twenty-five or thirty dollars.\u201d Q. \u201cAll the jewelry and cigarettes and so forth?\u201d A. \u201cYes.\u201d The officer asked if Tai was the only occupant of the apartment and Tai answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and that Joseph Lepore occupied it with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Three or four minutes later Lepore walked in. One of the officers explained the presence of the police, showed him the warrant, and asked him if he was an occupant. Lepore answered that he was, and that he and Tai had been living there for about four days. The officer told him what they had found and asked \u2018 \u2018what he knew about it. \u2019 \u2019 Lepore answered that Tai had \u201cbought them from a guy downtown Boston.\u201d Asked if he knew what Tai paid, Lepore answered that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The officers completed the search and told the defendants they were under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Plainly , these inquiries were threshold in character and were investigatory rather than accusatory. The questions gave Tai and Lepore the opportunity to explain the compromising circumstances and helped the officers to appraise whether the two men were probably concerned. The police investigation had not then focused on these defendants for purposes of the holding in <em>Escobedo </em>v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The day after the arrest the officer asked Tai about a blue suitcase found in the apartment. Tai answered that a man had brought it up and asked Tai to hold it. The officer asked Tai about some rings reported as stolen that had not been found at the apartment the day before, and Tai answered that a girl friend of his had some of them. Tai said, as to the suitcase, \u201cthat the man . . . brought it up\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>on June 7, 1964, and asked him to hold it for him and that it contained these rings, cigarettes and jewelry. The officer asked the name of the man, and Tai said he did not know it. Asked for a description, Tai gave it. The officer said, \u2018\u2018 That fits your description. Did this man look like you? \u2019\u2019 Tai answered that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The officer on the same day asked Lepore if he knew anything about a man bringing a suitcase to the apartment. When Lepore said that he did, the officer asked, \u201cWTiat was in the suitcase ? \u2019 \u2019 The answer was, <em>\u20181 </em>Cigarettes, jewelry, \u2019 \u2019 and the other items seized. When asked if he knew the man, Lepore answered, \u201cNo, he is a friend of Mr. Tai\u2019s.\u201d Lepore gave the same description of the man that Tai had given and said that he did not know anything more about him.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">These questions also were definitely of an investigatory nature and not accusatory. The answers of course tended to suggest that the defendants did not have a good explanation, other than theft, for the presence of the stolen goods in their apartment, and to confirm that they were prime suspects. These preliminary inquiries, however, do not suggest that the police were \u201c carry[ing] out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements\u201d or that they had a \u201cpurpose\u201d to \u201celicit a confession\u201d within the rule of the <em>Escobedo </em>case. 378 U. S. 478, 491, 492. The rule of that case would, therefore, be inapplicable, even if there were present other circumstances required for its application which we do not suggest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tracy, ante, </em>87, 98-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">3. All the assignments of error are disposed of by the foregoing rulings.
