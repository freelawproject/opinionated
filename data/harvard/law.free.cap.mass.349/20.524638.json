Levin (the testator) seek declaratory relief against the commissioner. Upon a case stated, the executors appeal from a Prohate Court decree declaring that the commissioner\u2019s claim against the testator\u2019s estate for an income tax assessed upon income received by the testator in 1957 is not barred by G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 (as amended through St. 1954, c. 552, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The testator filed a Massachusetts income tax return reporting income received in 1957. This return was due on April 15, 1958 (see G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 24, as amended through St. 1954, c. 70, \u00a7 1). He died on August 14, 1960. The executors gave bond on October 13,1960. Following a notice (received by one of the executors) of a proposed assessment, given on March 27, 1961 (see G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 1956, c. 310, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), the commissioner on April 14, 1961, assessed an additional tax of $6,206.37 (including interest) on \u201cIsrael M. Levin (dec.) \u201d in care of one of the executors with respect to income received by the testator in 1957. In behalf of the executors on March 14, 1962, an application for abatement was filed with the State tax commission. This application is still pending. The commissioner has not commenced any action against the executors in respect of the additional tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Declaratory relief is sought only to determine whether, in assessing the additional tax under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 25, and 37, as amended, the commissioner \u201cis barred from any recovery of such taxes by\u201d the so called short statute of limitations. See G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9, as amended, which reads, in part, \u201cExcept as provided in this chapter, an executor . . . shall not be held to answer to an action by a creditor of the deceased which is not commenced within one year from the time of his giving bond for the performance of his trust . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">General Laws c. 62, \u00a7 9 (as amended by St. 1957, c. 644, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u00a72), reads, in part, \u201cEstates of deceased persons, <em>if assessed within the time limited by section </em>thirty-seven, shall be subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter upon all income received by such persons during their lifetime . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 37 afforded the commissioner as to 1957 income (fn. 1) three years from the date (April 15, 1958) when the testator\u2019s return of 1957 income was due, in which to assess additional taxes upon that income.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 41 (as amended through St. 1933, c. 350, \u00a7 4; see later amendment by St. 1964, c. 460, \u00a7 2) gives the commissioner \u201cfor the collection of taxes assessed under . . . [c. 62] all the remedies provided by . . . [c. 60] for the collection of taxes on personal estate by [town] collectors of taxes\u201d with an exception not here pertinent. Section 41 also provides that \u201c [a]ny action . . . brought to recover any such [income] tax shall be brought in the name of the commonwealth. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In connection with c. 62, \u00a7 41, there must be considered G. L. c. 60, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 36, dealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>with the recovery of local property taxes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those sections are applicable also to the collection of income taxes (which, of course, are also property taxes; see <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. Wheatland, 343 Mass. 650, 652-653).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">In <em>Stow </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>336 Mass. 337, 341-342, this court, upon an inadequate record and because the issue had not been fully argued, refrained from deciding the question now presented. We said (p. 341) that \u201cthere is a substantial question . . . whether the provisions of the short statute of limitations . . . c. 197, \u00a7 9, and the related \u00a7\u00a7 10-18, 28-31 (as amended), do not control the present case rather than the limitation provisions of ... c. 62, in view of the very strong public policy in favor of \u2018limiting the time within which creditors of an estate may bring actions to enforce their claims\u2019 which will, of course, tend \u2018to expedite the settlement of estates.\u2019 \u201d We pointed out (p. 342) that determination of the question might involve consideration of various provisions of G. L. c. 62 and c. 197, and especially of c. 60, \u00a7 36 (fn. 5). The <em>Stow </em>case, however, does establish that declaratory relief in the Probate Court is available to executors as an appropriate method of bringing about final resolution of State income tax matters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Several cases discuss the relation of the short statute of limitations to the collection of local property taxes affecting a decedent\u2019s estate. These cases distinguish between (a) taxes which became a liability of the decedent before his death (see <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>121 Mass. 222; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>241 Mass. 96) and (b) taxes assessed upon the decedent\u2019s executor or administrator by virtue of ownership of the property on a date after the decedent\u2019s death. See <em>Dallinger </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>149 Mass. 62; <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Casamassa, </em>339 Mass. 702, 704-707. Some of these cases were referred to in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>342 Mass. 586, 590. See also Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 175-176, 179-196, esp. \u00a7 190; Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) 383-384.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">These cases in effect hold that taxes assessed upon property, based upon its being owned by the decedent on a date prior to his death, are barred by the short statute of limitations (c. 197, \u00a7 9). They also hold that the short statute does not bar an action to recover taxes which have been assessed upon the property of an estate because it was owned by the estate\u2019s representative on a date after the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>241 Mass. 96, heard on a case stated, dealt briefly with what is now G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 36 (then St. 1909, c. 490, Part II, \u00a7 34). In that case (see p. 97) the defendant, sued individually, was an executrix whose testator had died on May 15,1916. The testator had made no return of his personal property on which a local property tax should have been assessed on April 1,1916. A poll tax and a real estate tax were seasonably assessed to him and paid by the executrix. When the inventory of the estate was filed, the assessors (acting under what is now G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 75, as amended through St. 1946, c. 339) made on December 20, 1916, a so called \u201comitted assessment\u201d on certain personal property subject to tax. On April 4, 1919, the collector of taxes brought an action against the executrix \u201cindividually\u201d to collect the tax due under the \u201comitted\u201d assessment, and obtained a judgment in the Superior Court for $477.90. It appeared (p. 99) that the executrix had re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ceived over $16,000 as part of the estate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Concerning this amount, the opinion, in an obvious reference to what is now c. 60, \u00a7 36 (fn. 5), said, \u201cIn the absence of any statement that this [amount] had been expended before the demand, she was in receipt of money applicable to, and sufficient for the payment of the tax.\u201d Nevertheless, this court (pp. 99-100) held that the short statute of limitations (now c. 197, \u00a7 9) barred the action against the executrix because it was not \u201cbegun within one year after the bond had been given.\u201d The court regarded the town collector of taxes as having only \u201cthe remedial rights of a creditor\u201d and treated the limitation of the short statute as being \u201cas applicable to him as to other creditors of . . . [that] testator.\u201d The judgment for the tax collector was reversed and judgment for the executrix was ordered. The court thus in effect construed c. 60, \u00a7 36, as malting the executrix personally liable in an action at law to pay a property tax for which the decedent himself had been liable only if an action to recover the tax had been brought by the collector prior to expiration of the period set by the short statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Reliance upon the analogy of the property tax cases just cited would lead to the conclusion that the short statute (c. 197, \u00a7 9) would bar an action to recover income taxes for which a decedent had become liable prior to his death, but would not bar an action to recover taxes upon income received by a decedent\u2019s executor or administrator after the decedent\u2019s death. In determining, however, whether this analogy is applicable to the collection of a decedent\u2019s income taxes, attention must be given to the effect of the portions of G. L. c. 62, already mentioned, especially c. 62, \u00a7 9 (already quoted in part), which subjects the estate of a decedent, \u201cif assessed within the\u201d three years provided by \u00a7 37 (fn. 3), to liability for taxes upon income received by the decedent during his life, \u00a7 25 (fn. 2), and \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The several relevant provisions of c. 62 do not define at all clearly how additional assessments on income received by a decedent during his life shall be made after his death and collected. Sections 9 and 25 (fn. 2 and accompanying text) subject decedents\u2019 estates to the taxes imposed by c. 62. Section 25 specifies not only that an executor is liable for the taxes payable on taxable income received by him but also that the estate is to be subject to the taxes imposed by c. 62. The section explicitly requires an executor to \u201cfile a return ... if his decedent received . . . income not returned by the decedent as to which a tax under this chapter may still be assessed within the time limited by\u201d \u00a7 37. Under \u00a7 37, with respect to unreported income, the commissioner may assess an additional tax after notice to the person to be assessed. Under \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 25, the estate apparently is to be assessed for such an additional tax. This is doubtless because the tax obligation was incurred by the decedent and not by the executor and because the executor should be liable only to the extent that the estate includes funds available to make the tax payment. Of course, notice of any such assessment can only be given to the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">No provision of c. 62 expressly makes an executor personally liable in contract for either an original or additional tax upon income received by his decedent, although by \u00a7 42 (fn. 4) such liability is in explicit terms imposed upon executors with respect to taxable income received by them. The failure to include in &lt;\u00a7. 42 any provision with respect to the liability of an executor for income taxes formerly owed by his decedent may be of significance. Otherwise c. 62 seems merely, by \u00a7 41 (quoted above in part), to incorporate in c. 62 by reference \u201call the remedies provided\u201d for the collection of certain local taxes by c. 60. Those here relevant are 35 and 36, which, as already noted, have already been interpreted by this court in respect of the collection of local property taxes from decedents\u2019 estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We recognize that there is no express statutory provision making G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9 (and related statutes) inapplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>to an action against the executors, as such or individually, in circumstances such as are now presented. Nevertheless, we must give effect, if possible, to the general statutory purpose (shown by c. 62 as a whole) to collect income taxes for which decedents became liable while living. In determining whether c. 197, \u00a7 9, bars an action to recover such taxes, we have reexamined what was said in <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>241 Mass. 96, <em>supra. </em>We conclude that, upon making the proof required by c. 60, \u00a7 36 (viz. that after demand upon the personal representative, he has received or possessed funds of the estate \u201capplicable to the payment of the tax\u201d and sufficient to pay the same, and has not paid it), the commissioner may recover from a decedent\u2019s personal representative, individually, an additional tax assessed under c. 62 upon income received by the decedent during his life, even if the action is commenced after the short statute of limitations has run. Chapter 62, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 25, and 37, in the aggregate, indicate a legislative intention that there shall be some form of liability for such additional income taxes, if assessed within three years after the return is due.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That an assessment is expressly allowed to be made within the three year period is some indication that the Legislature intended that the taxes so assessed should be collectible.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The effect of c. 60, \u00a7 36, as we read it, is to impose no liability upon an executor for any tax of a decedent because of the decedent\u2019s ownership of property (or receipt of taxable income) during his lifetime, except to the extent that, after a demand for the tax, the executor received, or has in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Ms possession, \u201cmoney applicable to the payment of the tax.\u201d The executor, after such a demand, is placed by \u00a7 36 under a duty to use such \u201capplicable\u201d funds to pay the tax. If and to the extent that he does not do so, he becomes \u201cpersonally liable ... as for Ms own tax.\u201d The liability is similar to the liability imposed upon the executor by c. 62, \u00a7 42 (fn. 4) for income taxes upon taxable income received by the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The result in the <em>Bartlett </em>case may have been correct upon the record (see fn. 7) before the court. We think, however, that the propriety of applying G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9, to the executrix\u2019s individual liability is so questionable that the principle should not be extended to the different statutory provisions of c. 62 (which, of course, were not considered in the <em>Bartlett </em>case). The <em>Bartlett </em>case must be taken as now overruled by what is said in this opinion in so far as hitherto it may have been thought to apply to assessments under c. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">This result wMch we reach need not bring about undue delay in closing estates. If the commissioner unreasonably postpones making an assessment, the estate\u2019s tax liability may be finally established in declaratory proceedings. Whether some form of bar order procedure (in connection with proceedings under G. L. c. 206, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 22, or otherwise) in the Probate Court may be available in certain instances (see fn. 6), and whether other statutes of limitation may be available to the executor, we need not now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The decree of the Probate Court is to be modified to provide \u201cthat the claim of the commissioner against the estate of Israel M. Levin for an additional tax under Gr. L. c. 62 upon income received by him in 1957 is now barred by G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9, but that an action may be maintained (without regard to the limitation imposed by G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9, but prior to the expiration of any otherwise applicable period of limitation) against the executors, as individuals, if and to the extent that, at or after the time of the demand upon them for such additional income tax, they have had in their possession funds of the estate \u2018 applicable to the payment of the [additional] tax\u2019 within the meaning of G. L. c. 60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u00a7 36, as amended, which they have not used for payment of such tax,\u201d and to declare further \u201cthat the executors may be allowed in their accounts for any payments which they are thus required to make individually.\u201d As so modified, the decree of the Probate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\"> See later amendments by St. 1958, c. 509, \u00a7 2, and St. 1961, c. 555, \u00a7 2, which by St. 1958, c. 509, \u00a7 3, and St. 1961, c. 555, \u00a7 5, respectively, are not applicable to returns of 1957 income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-5\"> With c. 62, \u00a7 9, must be read c. 62, \u00a7 25 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 592, \u00a7 4), which reads, in part, \u201cEvery individual who while an inhabitant of the commonwealth, and every executor . . . who while such an inhabitant or while acting under ...
