The first request sought a ruling that, \u201c [o]n all the evidence and the law, a finding for the defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>warranted.\u201d The judge denied the request \u201cin view of the facts found and the application of\u201d GL L. c. 175, \u00a7 186.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second request, also denied, was for a ruling that the evidence and the law required \u00e1 finding for the defendant. Our consideration of the disposition of these requests is decisive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The statement of agreed facts, which was submitted to the judge, recited that the plaintiff, a Boston jewelry firm, on October 6, 1960, made a written proposal to the defendant for a \u201cJewelers\u2019 Block Policy\u201d insuring against theft from the plaintiff\u2019s display windows. Question 14B of the proposal form asked the plaintiff to indicate the maximum value of jewelry to be displayed in the windows. The plaintiff answered that, during business hours, the value of jewelry displayed in \u201c. . . windows . . . outside show cases . . . [or] any one window\u201d would not exceed $14,500 where the window or case was protected by swinging shatterproof glass, and $500 where the window or case was not so protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The policy issued by the defendant on November 16,1960, stated that the proposal form was made part of the policy. The policy also carried a \u201cJewelers\u2019 Block Combination Endorsement.\u201d Section 1A of the combination endorsement provided that the insurer\u2019s maximum liability for theft of displayed jewels during business hours was $14,500 where the jewels were protected by the swinging shatterproof glass, and $500 where unprotected. Section IB stated: \u201cIt is a condition of this insurance precedent to any recovery hereunder that the values of property displayed will not exceed the amount represented in answer to Question 14B of the Proposal form attached to this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">On the morning of March 24,1961, while the plaintiff was open for business, a rock was thrown through one of the store\u2019s display windows and jewelry worth $13,620 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>stolen. At the time of the theft the jewelry on display in the protected area of the window was worth $18,512, and in the unprotected area was worth $1,118.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The single question presented is whether the provision in \u00a7 IB of the policy, referring to the plaintiff\u2019s representation in answer to question 14B that the displayed jewelry would not exceed certain amounts in value was, on the one hand, a condition precedent which, if not complied with, would bar recovery, or was, on the other hand, a representation or warranty which, if not fulfilled, would bar recovery only if the proof required by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 186, was forthcoming. The judge treated the provision as a representation or warranty. He found that the insurer\u2019s risk had not been materially increased by the display of the more valuable jewelry and, since the parties had stipulated that there was no intent to deceive the insurer, made a finding for the plaintiff in the sum of $13,620.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We think that the judge was in error. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 186, applies only to representations and warranties and does not apply to conditions precedent included expressly within the terms of a policy. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>188 Mass. 542, 545. <em>Giannelli </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>307 Mass. 18, 22. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>342 Mass. 649, 653. The state-, ment made by the plaintiff in the proposal was, at first, a representation. The statement, however, was expressly made a condition precedent to recovery in the combination endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Whether a warranty or representation made in an application for a policy may be converted into a condition of a policy was briefly discussed but not decided in <em>Everson </em>v. <em>General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp. Ltd. </em>202 Mass. 169, 172, where representations respecting income were in a rider pasted to a page of an insurance contract under the heading, \u201cSchedule of warranties.\u201d The court there held that, since there was no clear expression in the policy whereby these negotiatory warranties were to be made conditions precedent, the mere attachment of them to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>policy did not change their legal significance, and accordingly they were to be regarded as subject to the predecessor of Gr. L. c. 175, \u00a7 186. The question, however, was decided in <em>Kravit </em>v. <em>United States Cas. Co. </em>278 Mass. 178, and <em>Faris </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co. </em>278 Mass. 204, where statements by the prospective insured, essential to an intelligent decision by the insurer to incur liability, were expressly made conditions precedent to recovery under the policy, and so were not subject to GK L. c. 175, \u00a7 186. Although the statements in the <em>Kravit </em>and <em>Faris </em>cases referred to existing facts, representations concerning future events have also been held conditions precedent where the policies have so provided as in <em>Elder </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>213 Mass. 389 (where the insured\u2019s statement that his insured vehicle would not be used for hire was made a condition precedent to recovery), and <em>Krause </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Ins. Co. </em>333 Mass. 200, 203, 204 (where the insured agreed that his life insurance policy would not be effective if he consulted or was treated by a physician in the interval between the time of his examination by the company\u2019s doctor and the time of his receipt of the policy and payment of the premium). The result of the foregoing is that a statement made in an application for a policy of insurance may become a condition of the policy rather than remain a warranty or representation if: (1) the statement made by the insured relates essentially to the insurer\u2019s intelligent decision to issue the policy; and (2) the statement is made a condition precedent to recovery under the policy, either by using the precise words \u201ccondition precedent\u201d or their equivalent. See <em>Lopardi </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>289 Mass. 492, 495. Both tests are met in the instant case. First, it is clear that the value of the jewelry to be displayed was a fundamental fact which the insurer considered in deciding to issue the policy. Second, the representations made in question 14B were expressly made conditions precedent to recovery in \u00a7 IB of the combination endorsement. Since the words of a contract for insurance are as \u201cbinding upon both parties as that of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>contract,\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Prudential Life Ins. Co. </em>203 Mass. 299, 301, the language of the endorsement must be read as constituting an agreement to treat the representations as a condition precedent to recovery. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 186, therefore was not applicable to the policy. The defendant\u2019s first two requests should have been granted. The plaintiff relies heavily on <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Royal Indem. Co. </em>297 Mass. 55. We have considered that case and do not think it applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">A finding for the defendant was required. It is not necessary to discuss the remaining exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\"> \u201cHo oral or written misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive, or unless the matter misrepresented or made a warranty increased the risk of loss.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
