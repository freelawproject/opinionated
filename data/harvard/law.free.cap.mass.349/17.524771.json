L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21. From a final decree upholding the decision of the board the plaintiffs have appealed. The trial judge filed a report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The zoning by-laws divide the town into nine districts, four of which are residential. Part 1, \u00a7 IV\", provides that in Besidence \u201cA\u201d districts \u201cthe erection or use of any principal building except as a single family detached house is specifically prohibited\u201d and that \u201c [i]n all residence districts the erection of any building . . . for the rendering of services is specifically prohibited.\u201d Also prohibited are \u201call business and industrial enterprises.\u201d Part 1, \u00a7 III, paragraph 5, provides that <em>\u2018' </em>[h] ospitals, convalescent or rest homes, nursing homes, boarding homes for the aged, and private kindergartens are prohibited unless a permit therefor is granted by the Board of Appeal after a public hearing.\u201d Paragraph 7 of that section forbids permission for any use which is offensive because of a variety of objectionable features or which is a hazard \u201con account of fire or explosion or any other cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">On January 2,1964, Meline filed with the board an \u201cApplication for Variation of Zoning \u2014 Building Laws\u201d to construct and operate a modern and attractive nursing home on two lots on John Street in Beading. This application was treated by all parties as seeking a special permit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>an exception under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 15, rather than a variance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The judge ruled that paragraph 5 is valid as a provision designed to \u201cimplement the exercise of the power given to the hoard by virtue of C. 40A, \u00a7 4, to grant an exception and to issue a special permit concerning otherwise <em>proscribed </em>uses of land\u201d and that the action of the board \u201cin approving the Meline petition was in compliance with all of the applicable procedural provisions required\u201d by the zoning statute and the zoning by-laws of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The issue presented is whether, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4, the by-laws (\u00a7 III, paragraph 5) empower the board to grant permits for the uses therein specified in any district, as the board and Meline contend, or whether the paragraph is rather directed to the additional requirement of a permit for such uses in districts where they are otherwise permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Section III of the by-laws is largely prohibitory in character and does not expand the powers of the board. We cannot believe that it was ever intended that \u201ccommercial ball parks, commercial amusement parks and other enterprises of a similar character,\u201d prohibited by paragraph 4 of \u00a7 III unless approved by the board of selectmen, might be located in Residence \u201cA\u201d districts on the granting of permits on petitions similar to the one filed here relating to a nursing home. Sound principles of statutory construction dictate that interpretation of provisions having identical language be uniform. See <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany R.R. </em>172 Mass. 180, 182; <em>Randall\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 383, 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">We agree with the plaintiffs that this matter is similar to <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Gloucester, </em>330 Mass. 344, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>345, where it was held that a city ordinance requiring council approval for various uses \u201cwas designed to provide the additional safeguard of council approval for certain undesirable uses in districts where they were otherwise permitted and not to break down the plan of the ordinance by allowing the council to introduce such uses into otherwise forbidden districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In the light of the foregoing we need not discuss whether, if the use were permissible, the by-laws would be held to contain adequate standards to guide the board. See <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>333 Mass. 114, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\"> General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 4, states that a \u201czoning . . . by-law may provide that exceptions may be allowed to the regulations and restrictions contained therein, which shall be applicable to all of the districts of a particular class and of a character set forth in such . . . by-law. Such exceptions shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the . . . by-law and may be subject to general or specific rules therein contained.\u201d Under \u00a7 15 the board is authorized \u201cto hear and decide applications for special permits for exceptions. <em>\u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
