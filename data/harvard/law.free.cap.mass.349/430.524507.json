L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, following the conviction of the defendant on three indictments respectively charging him with larceny of capital stock, larceny of a promissory note, and larceny of money proceeds from the sale of stock, all being the property of one Charles L. Furcolo, and all of the value of more than $100. For the purposes of this opinion a lengthy review of the evidence is unnecessary, and we set out the facts only in summary form.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">In 1960 Dr. Charles L. Furcolo of Springfield joined with Bernard Francis, an attorney, and Harris Osman, both of Connecticut, in the purchase of a race track in Hancock, Massachusetts, known as Hancock Raceway, Inc. (the corporation). Thereafter Furcolo asked the defendant Charles R. Carson, his tax consultant, to hold nominal title to Furcolo\u2019s stock (fifty class A voting shares and fifty class B nonvoting shares), as well as a promissory note for $25,000 issued by the corporation, as Furcolo did not wish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>his involvement to be known publicly. The evidence as to what was promised Carson for his services by Furcolo is conflicting. Furcolo testified that he promised Carson only his expenses, a directorship, and $5,000 a year \u201cif the track warrants it.\u201d There was evidence that Furcolo promised Carson five shares of nonvoting stock and $5,000 a year as comptroller. Carson testified that Furcolo initially promised him ten shares of each- class of stock in addition to other perquisites and that Furcolo later, in appreciation of Carson\u2019s efforts, increased Carson\u2019s interest to twenty-five shares of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The corporation\u2019s activities in 1960 were marked by stress occasioned both by its need for money and by increasing disagreement among the principal parties interested in its affairs. In September, one Dario Bacciochi of Providence, Rhode Island agreed to obtain financing in exchange for a substantial stock interest and legal title to all class A stock by way of a voting trust. Hostility between Furcolo and Carson appears to have begun when Carson, with other participants in the corporation, decided to do business with Bacciochi, although Furcolo \u201cwent along\u201d with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Further hostilities followed, and on February 15, 1961, Furcolo, through an attorney, demanded that Carson return the stock and the note. Carson\u2019s attorney replied on behalf of Carson, denying that Furcolo had any right to the stock or note. During the summer of 1961 Carson, with legal counsel, negotiated to sell his \u201cinterest\u201d in the stock, all of which stood in his name. A buyer was ultimately found. On December 5, 1961, a closing was held in New York City and Carson sold to one Rizzo for $150,000 his \u201cinterest\u201d in the fifty shares of class A voting stock and the fifty shares of class B nonvoting stock, the former represented by voting trust certificates. A dispute took place involving the note, which Rizzo claimed was to be included in the sale. One of Carson\u2019s attorneys, Henry A. Moran, Jr., testified that en route to New York Carson told him that the note belonged to Furcolo and that at the clos-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>mg Carson was \u201cvehement\u201d with respect to the note, protesting that it was not part of the sale. What took place at this stage of the closing is unclear. Carson testified that his other attorney, James A. Reed, advised him to turn over the note and assured him that Furcolo had been \u201ctaken care of.\u201d Mr. Reed\u2019s testimony is directly opposite. He testified that he had \u201ca very casual knowledge of that note,\u201d that he was in no way engaged to negotiate its sale, and at no time did he assure Carson that Furcolo had been paid in full. The dispute between Carson and Rizzo was finally resolved by Carson\u2019s agreement not to negotiate the note and \u201cnot to make any demand for payment of any principal or interest of said note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">1. We are principally concerned with the indictment charging the defendant with stealing a promissory note worth more than $100. The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s refusal to allow inquiry as to the value of the note, on cross-examination of Furcolo, was erroneous and that this error was not cured by the judge\u2019s reversal of his ruling in his charge since the reversal did not enable the defendant to obtain Furcolo\u2019s opinion as to whether the note was worthless. This argument overlooks the fact that, in correcting his ruling, the judge told the jury to consider \u201cthat Dr. Furcolo would answer the question asked that the stock [note?]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was worthless at the time he was talking about.\u201d This instruction fully protected the defendant. Moreover, while Furcolo did not testify to the worth of the note, he did respond in the affirmative to the question, \u201cThey [the corporation] couldn\u2019t have paid your note if they wanted to?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The defendant argues that the Commonwealth has failed to prove that the note was a valid and authorized obligation of the corporation. The short answer to this argument is that the defendant offered no evidence to show that the note was unauthorized. Regularity of internal corporate proceedings in such a case is presumed. <em>Stauffer </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>Koch, </em>225 Mass. 525, 530-531. <em>Federal Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Shool-man, </em>276 Mass. 191, 192-193. Fletcher, Private Corporations (1954 ed.) \u00a7 486, p. 508. See <em>Moroni </em>v. <em>Brawders, </em>317 Mass. 48, 52-53, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We think the question of value was properly submitted to the jury, who were told that to constitute larceny the property taken must be of some value and that if the value was in excess of $100 the offence would be a felony. G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30. The jury could have found from the testimony of Mr. Francis, president of the corporation, that the note was worth more than $100. Mr. Francis testified to the solvency of the corporation and stated that Furcolo \u201cput in $25,000 into the corporation when we first started . . . and this was evidence of his payment . . ..\u201d Also pertinent to this question is the testimony of Mr. Francis that he received (and later sold to Rizzo) a note of the corporation for $23,000 at the same time the note alleged to have been stolen was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">2. The defendant has argued at some length that the convictions on the two other indictments should be reversed or set aside. The jury were instructed by the judge to consider each indictment separately. They were told that it was \u201cperfectly possible . . . for you to find that the Defendant was not guilty of stealing the stock and guilty of stealing the money \u2014 or not guilty of stealing the money and guilty of stealing the stock \u2014 <em>or guilty of stealing the stock and also guilty of stealing the money proceeds from the sale of the stock\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The judge further informed the jury that if they found the defendant guilty of stealing the stock and also the money, \u201cthe disposition of those cases will be a matter for the Court . . . to decide. . . . [T]he Court will have in mind the difficulties arising from a situation where a jury might consider that they might be convicting a Defendant twice for larceny of the <em>same property </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The defendant complains that this instruction permitted him to be found guilty, under the \u201cproceeds\u201d indictment, of essentially the same offence charged in the \u201cstock\u201d in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>dictment. The Commonwealth appears to agree that one cannot be found guilty both of stealing shares of stock and of stealing the proceeds from the sale of those shares but urges that the jury could have found the defendant guilty of stealing fifty shares (fifty class A, fifty class B, or twenty-five of each) and of stealing at a later time the proceeds from the other fifty shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We agree that it would have been possible for the jury, in view of the conflicting evidence, to find the defendant guilty according to the theories advanced by the Commonwealth. The judge\u2019s instructions, however, could have led the jury to believe that the defendant could be convicted of stealing both shares of stock and the proceeds from the same shares. We cannot say whether the jury did so interpret the charge. \u201cIt is not sufficient that an instruction be so drawn that a jury may reach the right conclusion, but it is required that it be so framed that a jury may not draw the wrong conclusion therefrom.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>120 F. 2d 968, 972 (10th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">If the jury found the defendant embezzled some or all of the shares (including the trust certificates representing the class A stock), as they must have found, we think a finding of guilty on the \u201cproceeds\u201d indictment, since it may have related to some or all of the shares within the \u201cstock\u201d indictment, is inconsistent and results in two convictions for a single crime. It is well settled that \u201ca prosecution for embezzlement may follow money embezzled through a dozen reinvestments, so long as it is in the embezzler\u2019s hands.\u201d Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (12th ed. 1932) \u00a7 1265. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>10 Gray, 173, 196. But we know of no cases holding that a defendant may be twice convicted in such circumstances, and where the question has arisen this result has been rejected. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Epstein, </em>245 N. Y. 234, 243; <em>Giannetto </em>v. <em>General Exch. Ins. Corp. </em>10 App. Div. 2d (N. Y.) 442, 446-447. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>79 Cal. App. 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The jury should have been instructed that, as to any given share of stock, they could find the defendant guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of stealing either the share or the proceeds from its sale. The imposition of concurrent sentences by the judge does not cure the erroneous charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In the leading case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kaskins, </em>128 Mass. 60, the defendant appealed from convictions of larceny of a cow and of receiving the same cow knowing it to have been stolen. The court held that the attempt of the Commonwealth to enter a nolie prosequi on one of the counts after the convictions was of no avail and that \u201calthough, as a legal effect of a conviction upon each count it cannot be said strictly that it is an acquittal upon the other, yet the finding of guilty upon both is inconsistent in law, and is conclusive of a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. See <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>7 Cox C. C. 151, 157. In <em>Milanovich </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U. S. 551, reversing in part 275 F. 2d 716 (4th Cir.), the Supreme Court of the United States considered the disposition of a case involving convictions of larceny and receiving. While the sentencing in the <em>Milanovich </em>case raised questions not now before us, the decision states, significantly, that \u201cthere is no way of knowing whether a properly instructed jury would have found . . . [the defendant] guilty of larceny or of receiving (or, conceivably, of neither).\u201d 365 U. S. at 555. We conclude, therefore, that the judgments on the indictments for larceny of stock and larceny of money proceeds from the sale of stock must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">3. There is no merit in the defendant\u2019s contentions that the judge erred in refusing to grant certain requests for instructions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *4*6The jury were informed, in substance, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>requested in Nos. 2, 4 and 6. The judge stated that \u201ctheft by embezzlement must be an intentional and fraudulent appropriation\u201d and that for conviction \u201cit must be beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant had a criminal intent to defraud.\u201d The jury were instructed also (request No. 3) that \u201c [i]f . . . the Defendant honestly thought that he had a legal right to sell the stock and make uncollectible the note, then . . . you should find . . . [him] not guilty.\u201d With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that a debt was owed him by Dr. Furcolo, the jury were correctly told that such a belief would justify withholding only the amount claimed. See Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure (12th ed. 1957) \u00a7\u00a7 520, 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">4. As to the exclusion of evidence, assignments of error Nos. 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 require no discussion. In each instance the judge\u2019s ruling may be sustained on the grounds that the evidence offered was irrelevant, hearsay, or self-serving, or that the judge\u2019s determination was an appropriate exercise of discretion. Finally, whether Mr. Moran \u201csaw . . . Charles Carson . . . turn over\u201d the note to any person was properly excluded. The judge said, \u201cA person can steal a thing and retain it for himself without turning it over to somebody else.\u201d This was a correct statement of the law applicable to the present facts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Este, </em>140 Mass. 279, 284. Moreover, even if relevant, whether Mr. Moran saw such an act take place would not be material.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">5. It follows that as to indictment 13,355 the judgment is affirmed, and that as to indictments 13,354 and 13,356 the judgments are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">A reading of the judge\u2019s charge makes it clear that he intended to use the word \u201cnote,\u201d and he later so informed the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\"> 2. \u201cIf the jury find that, regardless of who actually owned the property the defendant reasonably believed he owned what he was selling, the defendant must be found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">4. \" The Commonwealth has the burden of proof that the defendant did not act under an honest claim of right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">6. \u201cIf Carson believed he owned an interest in the shares of stock and believed he was selling only his own interest, regardless of the legal effect of the contract, he does not have the requisite intent to commit larceny. \u2019 <em>\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">3. \u201cIf the defendant withheld the note or stock or trust certificate from Furcolo as security for a debt claimed by him in good faith to be due from Furcolo, or as security for an interest in such property claimed by him in good faith, then he does not have the intent to defraud essential to the crime charged, and must be found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
