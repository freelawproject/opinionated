L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, as appearing in St. 1958, c. 238, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ease was heard in the District Court on a statement of agreed facts submitted to the court as evidence. We treat it not as a case stated but as a case with an agreement as to evidence. <em>Duff </em>v. <em>Southbridge, </em>325 Mass. 224, 226. The judge found for the plaintiff in the amount of $8,000. The defendant being aggrieved by the denial of certain requests for rulings claimed a report. The defendant\u2019s appeal from the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report brings the case to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s decedent Leo J, Noon (Noon) was a guest occupant in an automobile driven by the defendant\u2019s intestate Elder J. Beford (Beford) which left the road and struck a tree on May 15,1959. Both Noon and Beford died at the time of the accident or immediately thereafter as a result of injuries received in the accident. Noon left heirs at law on whose behalf this action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The plaintiff is the duly appointed executrix of the estate of Noon. Her bond was approved on April 11, 1960. The defendant is the duly appointed administrator of the estate of Beford and his bond was approved on April 18, 1961. The date of the writ in this action is November 6,1961, and service in hand was made on the administrator on November 10,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The first issue presented is whether the action has been seasonably commenced. The governing statute, G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, provides that \u201c [a]n action to recover damages under this section shall be commenced within one year from the date of death or within such time thereafter as is provided by sections four, four B, nine or ten of chapter two hundred and sixty. \u2019 \u2019 This action was not commenced within one year from the date of death and therefore is timely only if it is within one of the named exceptions appearing in G. L. c. 260. Since it is not argued that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 4B or 9 apply, we direct our attention to \u00a7 10, which consists of two sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The instant case is not within the provisions of the first sentence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, in so far as they relate to the death of a person \u201centitled to bring\u201d an action. \u201cThe cause of action [for wrongful death] does not arise until death occurs, when it springs into existence by force of the statute. It is a different cause of action from any which the deceased ever had in his lifetime.\u201d <em>Oliveria </em>v. <em>Oliveria, </em>305 Mass. 297, 301, and cases cited. The executor or administrator is the one entitled by statute to bring the proceeding. G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. Therefore the person for whose decease the death action is brought cannot be \u201ca person entitled to bring\u201d the action, nor is there any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201cwithin which the deceased might have brought the action. ...\u201d That the Legislature did not intend the decease of the person whose death gives rise to the action to bring into operation the above discussed part of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, is confirmed by the fact that such an interpretation would make the one year limitation provision found in G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, inapplicable in every wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The first sentence of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, also provides that upon the death of a person liable to any action \u201cbefore the expiration of the time hereinbefore limited, or within thirty days after the expiration of said time\u201d the action may be brought against the executor or administrator in accordance with the limitations provided by <em>G. </em>L. c. 197. General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 9, provides that an action must be brought within one year of the time the administrator furnishes his bond and G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 1, bars an action within six months from the time of his furnishing the bond. If the above provision of c. 260 is effective to extend beyond the one year provided in G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, the time within which the executor or administrator may bring a wrongful death action, then the case before us is timely under the provisions of c. 197. We conclude that the one year limitation is so extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">It was held in <em>Bickford </em>v. Furber, 271 Mass. 94, that the provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, which at the time contained only the first sentence of the present section, did not apply to an action of wrongful death. The wrongful death statute involved in the <em>Bickford </em>case (G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 5, as appearing in St. 1925, c. 346, \u00a7 9) had no reference to \u00a7 10, and provided for a limitation of two years from the date of the injury causing death \u201cexcept as provided by section four of chapter two hundred and sixty.\u201d The court stated that \u201c [t]he plaintiff takes no benefit from G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, which extends the time for commencing an action in ease of the death of \u2018a person entitled to bring or liable\u2019 thereto. This section is a part of the general statute of limitations and does not apply where \u2018a special provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is otherwise made relative to the limitation of any action.\u2019 G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 19. . . . The limitation imposed by G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 5, as amended, incorporating a part of Gr. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4, as amended, is special, since, in form, it is included in the statute creating the right and, in substance, is a limitation of the right as well as of the remedy.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 99. The court concluded that the death action in the <em>Bickford </em>case, brought over one year after the death of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, was not timely under the limitation provided in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4 (applicable to actions \u201cthe payment of judgments in which is required to be secured by chapter ninety\u201d). The death of the person liable to the action within the one year did not affect the running of the limitation period because, the court stated, the plaintiff as a creditor could, if necessary, petition for the appointment of an executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Subsequent to the decision in the <em>Bickford </em>case, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, by adding the second sentence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thereof (St. 1937, c. 406, \u00a7 2) and amended the wrongful death act (G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 5) to make G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, an exception to the limitation set out in the wrongful death section (St. 1937, c. 406, \u00a7 3). We think that in so doing the Legislature made G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, applicable to wrongful death actions generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">If the Legislature had intended only the second sentence of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, to be applicable to wrongful death actions, then there would have been no reason to refer to \u00a7 10 in the wrongful death act itself. The second sentence of \u00a7 10, applicable only to actions to which G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4, applies, is sufficiently incorporated into the wrongful death act by the reference in the death act to \u00a7 4. The second sentence of \u00a7 10 is, by its terms, a specific extension of the limitation of \u00a7 4 in wrongful death actions wherein the person liable to the action dies within the specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>period. Therefore, the Legislature, in inserting specific reference to \u00a7 10 in the wrongful death act, must have intended to make \u00a7 10 applicable to wrongful death actions generally, and not just those to which \u00a7 4 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The defendant has argued, however, that Gr. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, cannot apply to the present action because, by its terms, it applies only to \u201cany action before mentioned\u201d and the case before us is not within any preceding section of c. 260. We think that the specific reference in G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, to \u00a7 10, makes the wrongful death action one \u201cbefore mentioned\u201d and the limitation within it a \u201ctime hereinbefore limited.\u201d We conclude, for the reasons stated, that the first sentence of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, applies to wrongful death actions, and the present action is timely. The conclusion we have reached makes it unnecessary to discuss the denial of certain requests by the defendant for rulings and certain findings of the judge relating to the application of G. L. c. 90 and the provisions of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, which deal with the death of a person entitled to bring an action. The errors, if any, were harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The defendant also asserts that the court\u2019s finding of negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s decedent was not warranted by the evidence. The following facts appear from the report: The accident occurred at approximately 4:20 p.m. as the Beford car was going south on Route 27. The day was fair and no other cars were involved. An eyewitness who followed the Beford ear for two miles stated that the car was traveling at a moderate rate of speed, between thirty-five and forty miles an hour. There was no erratic movement or operation of the Beford car during that time according to the witness. Nothing on the road interfered with the operation of the Beford car, yet it left the road and struck a tree. It did not veer sharply nor did the brake lights flash. Another eyewitness confirmed in almost every detail the above description of the accident, stating in addition that he heard neither the sound of a blowout nor tire skids. It did not appear to him that the ear slowed by braking before striking the tree. The Maynard police report states, \u201cBeford for some unknown rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>son left the roadway and left a tire mark 72 feet long on the shoulder before striking a tree on the right side of the road which was 9' 6\" from the road\u2019s edge.\u201d A fire developed under the hood of the car and another underneath the car after it struck the tree. There were no brake marks or marks of any Idnd on the paved part of the road. There were no defects in the road surface which was dry. The view was not obstructed where the Beford car left the road but there was a sharp curve and upgrade at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The defendant asserts that on the above facts a finding of negligence would be speculative. We disagree. It is true that the mere occurrence of a motor vehicle collision is not in itself evidence of negligence. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>247 Mass. 124, 126-127. <em>Hendler </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>278 Mass. 339, 340. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>298 Mass. 146, 148, <em>Sutherland </em>v. <em>McGee, </em>329 Mass. 530, 531. The reason for the rule is set out in <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry. </em>247 Mass. 124, 126-127, quoting from <em>Wing </em>v. <em>London Gen. Omnibus Co. </em>[1909] 2 K. B. 652, 663, 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In the instant case, however, the eyewitness testimony shows that nothing outside of the Beford car influenced its course. Thus, while the precise cause of the accident is unexplained, Beford had sole control and management of the automobile which, uninfluenced by any outside agency, left the road and struck the tree. An inference of negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s decedent is warranted on the basis of the described circumstances. See <em>Bryne </em>v. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. </em>269 Mass. 130, 131; <em>Hendler </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>278 Mass. 339, 340-341; <em>Gangi </em>v. <em>Adley Exp. Co. Inc. </em>318 Mass. 762, 764; <em>Macharic </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>317 F. 2d 151, 154 (Ct. App. D. C.); <em>Druzanich </em>v. <em>Criley, </em>19 Cal. 2d 439, 444; <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Simmerman, </em>301 Pa. 1, 4. The plaintiff is not required to show that a specific negligent act or omission of the defendant\u2019s decedent caused the collision. It is enough that the evidence in the instant case made it more likely that the accident was due to the negligence of the defendant\u2019s decedent rather than to some other cause. See <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Schroeder, </em>269 Mass. 337; <em>Gangi </em>v. <em>Adley Exp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>Co. Inc. </em>318 Mass. 762; <em>Pelland </em>v. <em>D\u2019Allesandro, </em>321 Mass. 387, 389; <em>Poulin </em>v. <em>H. A. Tobey Lumber Corp. </em>337 Mass. 146, 148-149, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">What we have said above is also applicable to the defendant\u2019s argument that the damages awarded are speculative. The death act in effect at the time of the accident provided that the wrongdoer \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>shall be liable in damages in the sum of not less than two thousand nor more than twenty thousand dollars, to be assessed with reference to the degree of his culpability. ...\u201d G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. Thus the quantum of the defendant\u2019s negligence is the sole factor in assessing damages. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Sorell, </em>280 Mass. 457, 459. We think that just as the negligence of the defendant\u2019s decedent may be inferred from the facts in the case, the degree of his culpability can also be inferred. It is not argued that the finding for the plaintiff of $8,000 was excessive. There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s requests on the issues of negligence or culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-12\"> Hereafter citations to G.
