One is against the Universal Shoe Corporation (Universal) ; the other is against Hyman Snider individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The evidence most favorable to the plaintiff is as follows. In April, 1945, Snider \u201cnegotiated with the plaintiff . . . to come to work in Sanford, Maine . . . [for Universal] at . . . ($125.00) per week, plus board and room valued at . . . ($30.00) per week.\u201d At this time the plaintiff was employed as a stitching room foreman in a shoe factory in Haverhill at $100 per week. The plaintiff had been in the shoe business since 1905 and was \u201cinterested in his future security.\u201d Snider told the plaintiff \u201che would have a permanent job with [Universal] \u2018as long as it was in business\u2019 and if the . . . [plaintiff] \u2018wouldn\u2019t be able to work . . . [Snider] would take care of . . . [him] \u2019 . . .. \u2018You got security as long as the factory exists, you will work with me.\u2019 \u201d Relying on this arrangement, the plaintiff gave up his job in Haverhill and worked with Universal in Sanford, Maine, for thirteen years. Snider was general manager of Universal at the time of the hiring \u201cwith authority to hire and fire.\u201d He had been general manager for over twenty years and continued as such throughout the period of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. In 1957 the plaintiff had a stroke but came back to work after seven weeks. In 1958 Snider offered the plaintiff $600 if he would resign from his job but the plaintiff refused. On the following day \u201cSnider fired him.\u201d Motions for directed verdicts presented by the defendants were allowed by the judge subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">1. Apart from the question of Snider\u2019s authority, we assume that a contract of this sort would be enforceable to the extent indicated in <em>Carnig </em>v. Carr, 167 Mass. 544. However, no evidence was offered which could support a finding of either express or implied authority in Snider to bind the corporation by this type of contract. The mere fact that he was general manager of Universal, with authority to hire and fire, cannot be said to clothe him with ostensible authority to make a contract for permanent employment. <em>Braden </em>v. <em>Trustees of Phillips </em>Academy, 321 Mass. 53. <em>Simonelli </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy, </em>334 Mass. 438. Nor was there any evidence which would warrant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>finding of ratification by Universal. The direction of the verdict, therefore, in favor of Universal on the first count reveals no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">2. The direction of the verdict in favor of Snider on the second count was likewise proper. It is plain that he was attempting to contract on behalf of Universal. \u201cUnless otherwise agreed, a person making or purporting to make a contract for a disclosed principal does not become a party to the contract.\u201d Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 320 and comment a.
