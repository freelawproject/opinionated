The contract also provided that, upon a breach of it by the defendant, which occurred, the defendant, \u201cin addition to returning and paying to the\u201d plaintiff \u201call amounts due to him under the\u201d contract, should \u201cforfeit and pay to him an amount equal to the amount which \u201d had, \u201c to the date of the breach, accrued to\u201d him under certain terms of the contract relating to a division of profits. A judge, who heard the case without a jury, found that there were no profits and found for the plaintiff in the amount of the payments which had been made from his wages to the defendant according to the contract. He also ruled that the provision of the contract as to a forfeiture of profits provided \u201cfor a penalty . . . as distinguished from liquidated damages.\u201d The defendant alleged exceptions. <em>Held, </em>that the judge properly interpreted the contract with regard to what was due to the plaintiff, and that his ruling as to liquidated damages was sufficiently favorable to the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b78-9\">Where one party to a contract under seal has received from the other party sums of money under the terms of the contract and, by reason of his having broken the contract, he no longer is entitled to retain the money, the other party can recover it in an action for money had and received.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b78-10\">Where, at the close of the evidence at a trial before a judge without a jury, the defendant asks the judge to rule that, upon all the evidence, the plaintiff cannot recover on a certain item in the declaration and the judge refuses so to rule and finds for the plaintiff on that item, giving in a memorandum an erroneous reason for his finding to which the defendant takes no exception, an exception by the defendant to the refusal to rule as requested will not be sustained if, upon the evidence and for a reason other than that given by the judge, a finding for the plaintiff would have been warranted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">Contract, against Jean and Bertha S.

Should such breach occur after the expiration of one year from the date, hereof, then the parties of the first part shall in addition to returning and paying to the party of the second part all amounts due to him under the terms of this contract, forfeit and pay to him an amount equal to the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>which has to the date of the breach, accrued to the party of the second part from or under the terms of this agreement or the aforementioned agreement of the party of the second part with the Foreign Language <em>Press </em>Company relative to the paying to the party of the second part of one-third <em>Qz\u00a3) </em>of the net profits of the said Foreign Language Press Company and upon such breach by either the parties of the first part herein or the said Foreign Language Press Company the party of the second part shall be released from any further obligation <em>to </em>purchase stock under the terms of this agreement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">The material facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">At the close of the evidence, the defendants in a series of requests asked the judge to rule that on all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover <em>on </em>the first, the second, or on any item of the third count, and also to give the following rulings among others:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\"><em>\u201c8. </em>The plaintiff can recover nothing under his third count on items two, three and four of the account annexed thereto, if it appears that he relies in support thereof upon a breach of contract under seal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">\u201c10.

I construe this latter clause of the paragraph as providing for a penalty upon breach of the contract, as distinguished from liquidated damages, and I find that the amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover is $1,250 with interest as above, in full of all damages sustained by him, and that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover any additional amount under the forfeiture clause of the contract above referred to.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">He accordingly found \u201cthat under the ninth paragraph of said contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants, . . . the amount of wages earned by the plaintiff and paid to the defendants, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\">\"Amount paid to defendants between July 14,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">1905, and Oct. 1, 1905 ............. $180.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\">Amount paid to defendants between Oct. 1,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-9\">1905, and Oct. 1,1906,52 weeks at $15 per week . . 780.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-10\">Amount paid to defendants from Oct. 1, 1906, to Apr. 24,1907,29 weeks at $10.00 per week . . . 290.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-11\">Total................. $1250.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-12\">With interest from the date of the writ..... 300.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-13\">Total................. $1550.00\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-14\">He accordingly found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,550; and the defendants alleged exc\u00e9ptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-15\"><em>R.

As to the question, of liability. At the trial it appeared that the plaintiff had been discharged from the employment of the Foreign Language Press Company, hereinafter called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the press company; and the question of liability finally turned upon whether the discharge was for good cause. Upon this issue the judge before whom without a jury the case was tried found in favor of the plaintiff. Against this finding the defendants strongly contend. But the evidence was conflicting and would have warranted a finding either way, and hence that made by the trial judge must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">2. As to the damages. It appeared that the defendant Jean was the president and sole manager of the press company, and that he and his wife owned the stock, and that he represented her in the business and in the negotiations with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The plaintiff testified that he first worked for the press company about April, 1905; that he was hired by the defendant Jean, that he was offered $25 a week with the agreement that if he proved satisfactory he would be given an opportunity to acquire an interest in the business, and to that end would be given an increase \u201clater,\u201d that he worked for the press company at that price for two or three weeks, at the end of which time the defendants agreed to give him $35 a week, of which the sum of $25 was to be received by him as before, and the remaining sum of $10 was to be \u201cleft with the defendants toward an interest in the business under an agreement which was to come later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The plaintiff further testified, \u201cWhen my pay was raised, I thought that I could spare that amount toward purchasing an interest in the business. It was not raised with that intention. The raise came and the wages would have been paid to me unless of my own initiative I wished to acquire an interest in the business. The business looked good to me and I had been there some little time and I talked the matter over with Mr. De Peiffer about acquiring an interest in the business;\u201d that on the day of his engagement he had \u201clooked over the plant and sized up the situation;\u201d and that he thought that the proposition would be all right; \u201cthat the increase was not for the purchase of stock, but was to acquire an interest, and it was not until the contract was made out that the final arrangement was made. He had an interview with the other defendant, who informed him that Mr. De Peiffer represented her in the business, and he was authorized to act for her in all matters relating to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Under this arrangement the plaintiff was at work when the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tracts of October 1, 1905, were executed, the first, being between the plaintiff and the defendants, prescribing the terms under which the defendants were to convey to the plaintiff shares of the stock, and the second being between the plaintiff and the press company, prescribing the terms under which the plaintiff should continue in the employ of the press company. Briefly summarized, these contracts construed together as parts of one general scheme provided that the plaintiff should remain with the press company for four years from October 1, 1905, and should receive a weekly compensation of $40, of which the sum of $25 should be paid by the press company to him and the sum of $15 to the defendants for him, and in addition the press company was to pay on his account one third of the net annual profits, not exceeding a certain sum, to the defendants; that the defendants should from time to time convey to the plaintiff shares of stock in the press company as and when thus paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Under this arrangement the parties went on until October 1, 1906, when, by supplemental contracts, some changes were' made, the only one material to this inquiry being that the sum to be paid weekly to the defendants was changed from $15 to $10. With this change in the contracts, the parties continued until April 22, 1907, when there was a breach by the unjustifiable discharge of the plaintiff by the press company, and the plaintiff became entitled to damages therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The rules of damages in case of a breach of the contract are set out respectively in the eighth and ninth sections. If the breach be within the first year, then the plaintiff, if he be the delinquent, \u201cwaives and forfeits all rights\u201d accrued to him by the payment of the weekly sum of $15. If either of the other parties is the delinquent, then the defendants must return to the plaintiff the $15 per week which has been'paid by the press company to them on his account, and in addition an equal amount, that is to say, the one who is to be held answerable for the breach is to lose the $15 per week up to the time of the breach, the plaintiff because he gets nothing for it, the defendants because they must not only return to the plaintiff that sum, but an additional equal amount. In this respect the contract is equal. Nothing is said about the profits, because if the breach occurred within the first year none would have been paid to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>But the breach occurred after the first year. The contract (eighth section) provides that in that case, if the breach shall be by the plaintiff, then he loses all rights to the profits which shall have been paid on his account to the defendants, but he shall not forfeit the weekly pay. That is to be \u201crefunded to him by the . . . [defendants] . . . without interest.\u201d If either of the other parties is the delinquent, then (section 9) the defendants \u201cshall in addition to returning and paying to . . . [the plaintiff] ... all amounts due to him under the terms of this contract, forfeit and pay to him an amount equal to the anount which has to the date of the breach, accrued to the\u201d plaintiff under the terms of the agreement relative to the payment of net profits to the defendants on his account by the press company. That is, if the plaintiff be the delinquent he shall lose his net profits. If either of the other parties is the delinquent, then the defendants shall not only pay over the net profits theretofore received by them, but in addition thereto a sum equal td such profits and also the weekly amount received by them. If therefore the breach occur after the year, then the one answerable shall lose only the amount equal to the amount of profits paid by the press company to the defendants on account of the plaintiff. As thus construed the contract seems even. The contract in this respect was rightly interpreted by the trial judge; and his ruling that the sums to be forfeited were not liquidated damages was sufficiently favorable to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Under the terms of the contract the defendants became answerable to the plaintiff for the money paid to them on the plaintiff\u2019s account. The purpose for which it had been paid to them had ceased. They held it without right, and the common count for money had and received well lies to recover the money received. And that is so even if it comes into the hands of the defendants under a written or sealed contract. There was nothing to be done except the payment of the money. See <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Sanborn, </em>9 Cush. 58; <em>Glidden </em>v. <em>Child, </em>122 Mass. 433; <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>21 Pick. 1, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The only doubt is as to the sum paid before the written contract of October 1, 1905. No part of that money is alluded to in the writing; and if the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover rested upon the writing alone it would be difficult to find any satisfactory ground of recovery. The defendants however asked the judge to rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>upon the evidence and pleadings the sum could not be recovered. That ruling could not have been given. The judge might well have found that even although this sum was not covered by the contract yet that it was held by the defendants under conditions precisely the same, or in other words that when the contract of October 1 was executed, the terms under which the defendants held this money were settled by virtue not of the written contract but of the understanding between the parties at the time of the agreement that the payment should be made. The defendants took no exception to the ground upon which the trial judge based his finding. The only exception was to the refusal of the judge to give the ruling that upon all the evidence there could be no recovery for this item. The defendants were not harmed by this refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is unnecessary to go over the other exceptions in detail. It is sufficient to say that after examination we see no error in the manner in which the court dealt with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
