The declaration as amended contained six counts, of which only the sixth is material. That count alleged that the defendant failed to give the plaintiff instructions how to perform his duties properly and failed to give him sufficient notice of the dangers and perils incident to the plaintiff\u2019s duties as an employee, that the defendant had reason to know of such perils and dangers, and that the defendant failed to give the plaintiff such instructions and such notice. Writ dated February 24, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hitchcock, </em>J. ' The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to order a verdict for the defendant on all the counts of the declaration. Thereupon the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant on the first five counts of the declaration and submitted the case to the jury on the sixth count, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on the sixth count in the sum of $5,215; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-4\"><em>C.

Much of the evidence is set forth by question and answer, when it readily might have been put in narrative form.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">The jury were warranted in finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and had not made a contractual assumption of the risk of what happened. Doubtless the risk of one\u2019s hand being drawn into the revolving rollers of a machine is ordinarily obvious, but the special risk of this result following from the hands being caught in an adhesive substance not known to be 1 such is not necessarily so. There are open only the issues raised by the sixth count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, upon which the verdict in his favor was found; and we must now take it that adequate and correct instructions were given to the jury upon this count, if it was properly submitted to them at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s injury, as has been found, was due to his hand being drawn by the hot and sticky rubber upon which he was at work between the rolls of a machine called a \u201c cracker.\u201d That condition of the rubber was caused by the heating of the rolls; but for this alone he cannot recover, because it was caused by the act of a fellow workman. But there was evidence that both white, red and black rubber were intended to be run through the \u201ccracker,\u201d and that different degrees of heat were required to be applied to the rollers for these different kinds of rubber, the white rubber requiring the highest temperature and the black the lowest, but that the plaintiff did not know this and was ignorant of the greater danger involved by the greater heat required when some kinds of rubber were used, and the increased risk of the rubber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>becoming so hot and sticky that he could not extricate his hands therefrom before they reached the rolls. The heat was applied to the rollers by means of steam, and this was done by another workman; and the plaintiff, as he testified, knew nothing about this, and never knew or feared that the rolls might get so hot as to create the danger spoken of.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In our opinion, the jury had a right to find that it was necessary in the operation of this machine to raise the rollers to various temperatures, sometimes so high as to create a special danger in using the hands to push the rubber toward the rollers from the risk of their adhering so firmly to the heated and sticky rubber that they could not be withdrawn in time to save them from being carried between the rollers with the rubber in which they were held. As it could be found that the plaintiff was new to this kind of work, was ignorant of the danger, and received no warning or instruction about it, it remains only to determine whether there was evidence that the defendant ought to have foreseen this danger and to have given instruction and warning to him, so that he might have kept his hands out of the rubber when it was in this condition. But manifestly, if a temperature was needed for white or red rubber which might too greatly heat and make adhesive black rubber, it might be found even without direct evidence that this would be known to those who were familiar with the machine and its operation. If so, the jury could infer that it ought to be known to the defendant; and in the opinion of the majority of the court due care on its part would require it to give proper instruction and necessary warning to one who was new to such work. The case would come within the principle of <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Hazen Confectionery Co. </em>211 Mass. 99, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">It is said that no such accident ever had happened before; and <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Slater Woolen Co. </em>147 Mass. 315, is relied on by the defendant. But that is not decisive here. No such accident as this is claimed to have been would be likely to happen to an experienced workman, or to one who had been properly instructed and warned; it could not have happened without either a failure of duty on the part of the defendant or carelessness on the part of the workman.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>We find nothing inconsistent with what we have said in any of the cases cited by the defendant; and we have nothing to do with the weight of the evidence, to which much of the defendant\u2019s argument really has been directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">The plaintiff rightly was allowed to testify that he did not know of any danger in using the \u201ccracker\u201d in the condition in which it was, or of any danger in the roll getting heated so that the rubber would stick to his hand. <em>Malcolm </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>152 Mass. 160, 167, 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b95-7\"> It was necessary to have the rubber pass twice between the rollers. The accident happened when the plaintiff was trying to put black rubber through the rollers for the second time after it had become very hot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
