The mere fact that a dispute may arise between the parties as to some of the data does not make the contract unenforceable if the data intended to be referred to in the contract can be determined by a court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b520-10\">In a memorandum as to a contract for the sale of the capital stock of a corporation, the price to be paid was not stated in terms but a definite method of computation was agreed upon, and there was a stipulation as to a reference to arbitration of disputes which might arise as to the contract. The purchaser died and the administrator of his estate repudiated the contract. The seller thereupon, without a computation of the price, a formal transfer of the stock or a demand of the price having been made, brought an action upon the contract against the administrator. <em>Held, </em>that the administrator because of his repudiation of the contract could not rely in defense on the lack of a computation of the price, a transfer of the stock and a demand for the price, nor upon the stipulation in the contract as to settlement by arbitration.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-11\">Contract upon an agreement by the defendants\u2019 intestate, William F.

At that interview the defendants\u2019 intestate said that he was willing to buy the business conducted by the Walpole Card Clothing Company and would prefer to keep the organization as it stood and to buy the stock of the company. The parties went over in detail the balance sheet of the company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>a copy of which formed a part of the memorandum above described, and they agreed to determine the price of the stock by a reinventory, a reassessment or readjustment and reappraisal of the assets shown on the balance sheet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">It further was agreed, in this conversation, that the accounts receivable should be collected by the company and should be guaranteed by the plaintiff at their face value, and that any points of dispute relating to the agreement should be determined by arbitrators, one to represent the buyer, one to represent the seller, and a third to be appointed by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">A draft of the memorandum then was drawn up by a stenographer, some changes were made by the parties, and it was signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">It appeared that the Walpole Card Clothing Company was capitalized at $15,000, with its capital stock divided into one hundred and fifty shares, of which the plaintiff owned eighty-five shares, one Samuel E. Bentley fifty shares, and one Nathan O. Gay fifteen shares. The plaintiff testified without contradiction that he was authorized by Bentley and Gay to sell their shares of stock and that he had agreed with them to take their stock at par.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-8\">The defendants\u2019 intestate was taken sick with pneumonia on May 8 and died on May 15, 1905. The defendants repudiated the agreement and refused to be bound by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-9\">At the close of the evidence the judge found for the plaintiff \u25a0 and ordered the case referred to an assessor to assess the damages, \u201cthe parties having agreed that this might be done in case the judge should be of the opinion that there was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendants\u2019 intestate;\u201d and, being of the opinion that the correctness of such interlocutory finding and order ought to be determined by tjiis court before any further proceeding in the Superior Court, the judge by agreement of the parties reported the case for determination by this court. If the finding and order were warranted by the admissible evidence they were to stand; otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-10\"><em>H.

C. C.\u201d Standing merely by themselves, it would be difficult to construe these provisions. But the situation of the parties to an agreement and the circumstances under which they made it, so far as these were present to their minds, may be proved by paroi evidence, for the purpose of fixing the subject matter of the agreement and showing the meaning which they put upon their words. This often has been declared, both at common law and in cases arising under the statute of frauds. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>New England, Worsted Co. 2 </em>Cush. 271, 283. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>115 Mass. 413. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>150 Mass. 143, 146. <em>Whittier Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Graffam, </em>156 Mass. 415, 417. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>158 Mass. 361. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>162 Mass. 47, 51. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>167 Mass. 426, 428. <em>New England Dressed Meat &amp; Wool Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Worsted Co. </em>165 Mass. 328, 332. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Vose &amp; Sons Piano Co. </em>194 Mass. 193. <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Puffer, </em>203 Mass. 534, 538. Upon such evidence it appears that the plaintiff owned a large part of the shares of the capital stock of the Walpole Card Clothing Company, and was authorized by their owners to sell the other shares thereof. There was no evidence that he had any right to sell the stock in trade, machinery or other assets of the corporation. This fact, with the rest of the evidence, all of which was competent for the purpose that has been stated, makes it plain that the subject matter of the agreement was the capital stock of the corporation; that this was what was to be sold by the plaintiff and bought by the defendants\u2019 intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">This manifestly was intended to be a valid and complete agreement when signed. Nothing remained to be done but to transfer the stock, compute the price, and make a payment in cash; and the time for these things was fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The price was not stated in terms, but was left to be computed by ascertaining the value of the different items of the assets and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>adding the amount of the indebtedness to the plaintiff. But the method of computation was stated. It was not left to the subsequent agreement of the parties. It was like the sale of property for its value or some stated proportion thereof. This sufficiently fixes the price, on the often quoted principle, <em>id cerium est quad cerium reddi potest. </em>Agreements for sales at prices to be so fixed were sustained in <em>Lent </em>v. <em>Hodgman, </em>15 Barb. 274; <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>29 Wis. 537; <em>Sergeant </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>44 Minn. 309; and <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Silverthorne, </em>11 U. C. (Q. B.) 545. All these cases are directly in point. The language of this court in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bellows, </em>4 Pick. 178,189, is to the same effect. And see the cases collected in 35 Cyc. 48, and in 24 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, (2d ed.) 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">It is true that in such cases disputes may arise between the parties as to the amount of the price to be so fixed; but the courts afford a ready means of settling such disputes, as was pointed out in some of the cases referred to. In the case at bar, it was provided that any points of dispute should be settled by arbitration. If this stipulation was invalid, the parties were merely left to their legal remedies; if it was valid, there would be no difficulty in enforcing it. In either case, the defendants having repudiated the whole agreement, it affords no defense to the present action. <em>Lamson Consolidated Store Service Co. </em>v. <em>Prudential Fire Ins. Co. </em>171 Mass. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">For the same reason, because the defendants have wholly refused to carry out the agreement, the action can be maintained without an actual computation of the price, a formal offer to transfer the shares of stock, and a demand of the price. <em>Scanlan </em>v. <em>Geddes, </em>112 Mass. 15, 17. <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Moors, </em>168 Mass. 354. <em>Foternick </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>184 Mass. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">There was a sufficient memorandum of the agreement to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds. R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 5. This necessarily follows from what has been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The finding and order of the Superior Court must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
