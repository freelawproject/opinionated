The plaintiff testified that she was thrown against the car and against the railing and down to the edge of the car platform, and that she suffered injuries to her abdomen and spine. The testimony was controverted. The judge filed a memorandum stating that the defendant was negligent, that there was no unusual violence in the starting of the train, that he was-satisfied that the plaintiff \u201cdid not fall at all,\u201d that it was \u201c possible that, by taking some of her testimony, some of the defendant\u2019s testimony, and by finding against some of her contentions and in favor of others, a case might be made for her,\u201d but that \u201cneither from her account of what occurred at the train nor from her subsequent experience\u201d was he \u201cable to say\u201d that she had satisfied him that she received any substantial injury; and he found for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that it did not appear from the memorandum that the judge had believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and therefore that, on an exception by the plaintiff to the finding as not justified by the evidence, it was not necessary to consider an argument of the plaintiff based on the assumption that the judge had believed her testimony.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-10\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the plaintiff, a woman eighty years of age, being thrown from a train of the defendant as she was in the act of alighting. 'Writ dated May 15, 1911.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-11\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Lawton, </em>J., without a jury. The memorandum filed by the judge and referred to in the opinion was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-12\">\u201cI find that the defendant was negligent. I am satisfied that there was no unusual violence in the starting of the train. I have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>considered that the result of throwing a person backwards against anything is sometimes a blow, sometimes a wrench and sometimes both, and that it is seldom easy to tell the exact cause of the injury. But the violence of the blow and wrench must depend on the distance and the way the body moved. In this case the distance was substantially certain. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">\u201cMrs. Connery\u2019s testimony places Mrs. Baxter at the instant the train started at the edge of the platform, one foot on it and the other lifted ready to descend backwards. The train, so far as appears, was on a straight track, slightly down grade. When it started its force would tend to throw her to one side. That it would cause her to fall forward on her stomach and face is, to say the least, highly improbable. If she had been in the place and position described and had fallen at all, it seems certain that she would have fallen backwards down the steps. I am satisfied that she did not fall at all. I am satisfied that her original story was that she was thrown against the ironwork or some other part of the car. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel has suggested in his argument that inasmuch as the platform is a part of the car, the statement fairly means: \u2018I was thrown to one side and then thrown down.\u2019 The suggestion is sufficiently cynical to make other comment unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201cIt is possible that by taking some of her testimony, some of the defendant\u2019s testimony, and by finding against some of her contentions and in favor of others, a case might be made for her. It is quite possible she was thrown to one side and that she received a sufficiently hard blow or wrench to be called a substantial injury, sufficient to support and to have tacked on to it the accompanying fright and nervous shock which might well come to a woman of eighty years, tired out after a long day of travel. How much of her subsequent condition was due to this shock and how much was due to the injudicious sympathy, to say no more of it, of the family and the doctors, the lack of encouragement and perhaps of kindly firmness, or to old age pure and simple, it would not be easy perhaps to say. It is certain that all the symptoms of whose existence I am satisfied are entirely consistent with her having received no blow or wrench at all, and can be accounted for by other causes, some of which I have indicated. Neither from her account of what occurred at the train nor from her subsequent experience am I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>able to say she has satisfied me that she received any substantial injury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-3\">The other material facts are referred to in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\">The judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged an exception \u201cupon the ground that as a matter of law the evidence in the case is not sufficient to support the finding that the plaintiff received no substantial injury, and the finding in favor of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-5\"><em>T. H. Russell, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-6\"><em>J. L.

The exception is \"upon the ground that as a matter of law the evidence in the case is not sufficient to support the finding that the plaintiff received no substantial injury, and the finding in favor of the defendant.\u201d This exception was taken after the finding was made and no rulings were asked for by the plaintiff at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The plaintiff, a passenger on one of the defendant\u2019s trains, was in the act of stepping from the platform to the top step to alight at her destination, when through the defendant\u2019s negligence the train started prematurely. Her evidence tended to show that she was thrown on to the edge of the platform, first back against the \u2022car and then forward against the railing, and was injured in her abdomen and spine. The evidence introduced by the defendant was to the effect that \u201cshe did not fall\u201d at all and received no injuries at the time. In the conflict of evidence it was for the judge to decide which of the two was the true version of the accident. We have no jurisdiction to review findings of fact. As matter of law the evidence authorized the finding which was made in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">In his finding the judge dealt with the case in detail. His finding ends with these words: \u201cNeither from her account of what occurred at the train nor from her subsequent experience am I able to say she has satisfied me that she received any substantial injury.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s principal argument is based upon the theory that the judge believed the plaintiff, and believing the plaintiff was wrong as matter of law in this finding. But that is not the true construction of his finding. Earlier in his finding the judge says: \u201cI am satisfied that she did not fall at all,\u201d while the plaintiff testified that she did. Manifestly what the judge meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>was that the plaintiff\u2019s \"account of what occurred at the train\u201d and her account of \u201cher subsequent experience\u201d taken in connection with the other evidence in the case had not satisfied him that she received any substantial injury. Under these circumstances it is not necessary to consider whether this argument is open to the plaintiff under the exception which was taken by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
