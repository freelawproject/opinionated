The action was brought in the name of the plaintiff, a social club incorporated under R. L. c. 125, by Oscar A.

Writ dated May 4,1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-14\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Lawton, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-15\">It appeared that on December 26, 1906, the defendant made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>application for membership in the plaintiff upon a blank furnished by the clerk, such application stating that he was \u201cProposed by Fred C. Gilpatric\u201d and \u201cSeconded by Albion F. Bemis.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">The by-law of the club relating to proposals for membership in force at the time of the making of such application, Article IV \u00a7 3, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">\u201cThe form for proposing a person for membership shall be as follows \u2014 namely, a written application must be made out by the applicant; on blanks furnished by Club, indorsed by two members other than the member proposing him, giving the full name, place of residence, occupation and place of business of the person proposed, and the date of the proposal; and immediately the Secretary shall post a true copy of the application on the bulletin board of the Club House, and forward said applications to the Membership Committee, which shall remain posted at least a fortnight before being voted upon by the Executive Committee. Provided that fifteen members do not object in writing to said candidates or candidate by sending to said committee a negative ballot. A candidate who has been rejected cannot be proposed again for six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201cNo candidate will be accepted who is under twenty-one years of age.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">Section 4 of the same article provided that each resident member, when elected, should pay an entrance fee of $25 and an annual assessment of $50. Section 5, among other provisions, contained the following: \u201cEvery member shall within thirty days after his election pay to the Treasurer his entrance fee, and his membership shall commence from the date he complies with the above requirement, and will be equivalent to signing the constitution and by-laws.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-9\">The bill of exceptions stated that the plaintiff\u2019s by-laws \u201cprovided for an executive committee of fifteen with the powers of directors, and that this executive committee should have the entire government and management of the business of the club, including the election of members; that it should appoint from itself a membership committee of five who should investigate the character, etc., of the applicants, and report their recommendations to the executive committee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-10\">It further appeared that, at a meeting of the plaintiff\u2019s execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tive committee on December 31,1906, the defendant\u2019s application, made five days before, was acted upon favorably and he was elected to membership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">The defendant never paid an entrance fee.

The evidence having shown these essential facts the defendant is bound, if when the dues accrued he was a member. <em>McManus </em>v. <em>Thing, </em>208 Mass. 55, 60. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>211 Mass. 226, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">\u25a0 The plaintiff is a corporation chartered without capital under the R. L. c. 125. Its purpose was not commercial, but it was organized to provide certain comforts and privileges for the benefit and enjoyment of its members. Under \u00a7 6 of the statute authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>was given to enact by-laws which should prescribe the manner in which, and the officers or agents by whom the purposes of its incorporation could be effectually accomplished. By article four, section three, of the by-laws a form for admission to membership is prescribed, with the duties of the secretary and of the membership committee. It is expressly provided, that the applicant\u2019s name shall be posted for at least a fortnight before being voted upon by the executive committee, and this requirement doubtless was intended for the information of members, fifteen of whom could prevent an election by sending a negative ballot to the executive committee which was authorized to admit or reject the person proposed for membership. The defendant\u2019s application or proposal appears to have been in proper form, but not having been posted in accordance with the by-law he contends that his election by the executive committee was void and that he never became a member. If the committee had no broader powers they could not lawfully proceed to an election until compliance with the precedent condition of posting. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Christian Society, </em>137 Mass. 329. <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Boston Police Relief Association, </em>144 Mass. 434,437. <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Mutual Ins. Co. </em>152 Mass. 272. <em>Timberlake </em>v. <em>United Order of the Golden Cross, </em>208 Mass. 411, 423. But the exceptions state that this body by another by-law, the details of which are not stated, had been vested with the entire government and management of the business of the corporation, including the election of members. It had been empowered to appoint a committee on membership, consisting of five of its own members, who were to investigate the character of applicants, and report their recommendations to the full committee. The necessity or the expediency of such a provision is not before us. It is enough that the plaintiff did not exceed its corporate powers. The largest discretionary authority having been conferred, the executive committee could exercise the powers of the corporation itself, and proceed to an election even if the name of the defendant had not been previously posted. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Canada, Atlantic &amp; Plant Steamship Co. </em>211 Mass. 453, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The defendant\u2019s election having been valid, and his acceptance amply shown by the payment of dues, and the enjoyment after his election and until the club was closed of the accommodations of the club house, and of all the privileges appurtenant to member<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ship, it is immaterial that he never complied with article five by the payment of an entrance fee, which is declared to be equivalent to signing the constitution and by-laws. <em>United Hebrew Benevolent Association </em>v. <em>Benshimol, </em>130 Mass. 325, 328. <em>Detroit Driving Club </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>109 Mich. 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The defendant having been a member when the annual assessment fell due, the action can be maintained, and the verdict for the plaintiff was rightly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
