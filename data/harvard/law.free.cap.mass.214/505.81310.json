There was evidence that the plaintiff was sitting at the extreme left end of the second seat facing forward; that the wagon, which had been in front of the car and had been proceeding in the same direction along the right hand side of the street, in order to pass another wagon that was standing at the side of the street, was turned to the left and crossed the track diagonally in front of the car; that the car kept moving forward; and that a pole or mast, which projected about fifteen feet from the rear of the wagon, struck the plaintiff and caused the injuries complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the judge to rule that upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the motorman and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The judge refused to make these rulings, and submitted the case to the jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,500. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-6\"><em>Asa P.

But the judge could not have ruled as requested by the defendant. There was evidence that the motorman was negligent in allowing his car, while moving with some rapidity, to get so near to the team in front of him as to involve the danger that any slight movement of the team out of a straight line would cause just such an accident as happened. With the weight of the evidence we have of course nothing to do. The case comes under the principle of <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>203 Mass. 569, and <em>Eldredge </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>203 Mass. 582. There was a duty on the motorman to observe this team and consider its probable movements. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>191 Mass. 144, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">If the driver of the team was also negligent, this affords no defense to the present action. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>212 Mass. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The exceptions raise no other question than that of the motorman\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
