The conveyance in form was an absolute one, but in fact it was made to secure $1,740 lent by Chase to Nickerson. Thereafter, on November 23, 1908 (more than a year and a half after Nickerson was adjudicated a bankrupt), Chase died, leaving to Nickerson a legacy of $10,000. At the date of Chase\u2019s death Nickerson owed him (including the $1,740) more than $10,000. In August, 1909, an adjustment was made between Nickerson and the executors of Chase\u2019s will, by which the $10,000 legacy was applied in payment of the debt due Chase from Nickerson, and there was paid by or in behalf of Nickerson to the executors an additional sum whereby the entire debt due from Nickerson to Chase\u2019s estate (including the $1,740 secured by the conveyance of the \u201cHomestead\u201d) was discharged. A month later and before any conveyance of the \u201cHomestead\u201d had been made pursuant to this adjustment, the trustee in bankruptcy of Nickerson\u2019s estate brought a bill to secure a conveyance of the \u201cHomestead.\u201d By a decree made in that suit and dated August 3,1910, the executors of Chase\u2019s will were directed to convey the \u201cHomestead\u201d to Nickerson\u2019s trustee inbankruptcy subject to a charge thereon in favor of Nickerson for the $1,740 paid in clearing off the incumbrance on the \u201cHomestead\u201d out of Chase\u2019s legacy to Nickerson, which was property of Nickerson acquired subsequently to the date of Nickerson\u2019s bankruptcy. The present bill was brought on June 24,1911, by a judgment creditor of Nickerson, to reach and apply Nickerson\u2019s equitable interest in the \u201cHomestead\u201d in payment of the debt due from Nickerson to the judgment creditor. A final decree in favor of the plaintiff was entered in this suit <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> on July 10,1912, from which the appeal now before us was taken. This appeal was taken by one Ellis who intervened in this suit to claim Nickerson\u2019s equitable charge on the \u201cHomestead\u201d as a prior assignee of it. Ellis\u2019s claim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>disallowed in the Superior Court, and the only question before us is the correctness of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Ellis\u2019s claim arises out of an agreement dated July 21, 1909, which it is to be observed is in the month next before the adjustmentwasmade between Nickerson and the executors under Chase\u2019s will. The agreement, so far as material here, begins by reciting that whereas Nickerson is, \u201cupon making certain payments to the executors under the will of Caleb Chase, entitled to receive from the said executors certain valuable property rights among which is a certain right to . . . the Nickerson Homestead, so called,\u201d etc., and whereas Nickerson has asked Ellis to lend him $1,500. \u201cNow therefore it is agreed by me, the said George Nickerson, Jr., that in consideration of the said sum of $1,500 loaned me by'the said Elisha W. Ellis that as soon as I secure . . . my interest in the said Nickerson Homestead in Dennis from the said \u00e9xecutors ... I shall forthwith make a deed of mortgage to the said Ellis conveying in mortgage to him, the said Ellis, the interests hereinbefore referred to, said mortgage deed to be correct in form and to contain stipulations heretofore verbally agreed upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">It is to be borne in mind that when this agreement was made, (1) the equity of redemption in the \u201cHomestead\u201d which was left in Nickerson when he caused the \u201cHomestead\u201d to be conveyed to Chase as security for the $1,740 loan made to him by Chase, had passed to Nickerson\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy, and (2) Chase had died after Nickerson was adjudicated a bankrupt, leaving a legacy to Nickerson of $10,000, but at Chase\u2019s death Nickerson owed bim more than $10,000. It was in this state of aifairs that the agreement was made which Ellis now contends was an assignment of Nickerson\u2019s equitable charge on the \u201cHomestead.\u201d That agreement is not a present assignment of a present interest in the \u201cHomestead.\u201d On the contrary it is an executory agreement that \u201cas soon as I secure . . . my interest in the said Nickerson Homestead\u201d I will mortgage to Ellis that interest. At the time when the agreement was made, not only is it true that Nickerson had no interest in the \u201cHomestead,\u201d but it was not certain that he ever would have an interest in it. The equity of redeeming the mortgage on the \u201cHomestead\u201d had passed to Nickerson\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy. If the trustee in bankruptcy had redeemed the mortgage of $1,740, Nickerson never would have obtained an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>est in the \u201c Homestead \u201d growing out of facts existing at the date of his agreement with Ellis. It is only because the subsequent legacy was set off against this debt of $1,740 that an equitable charge on the \"Homestead\u201d in favor of Nickerson came into existence. In this case, as in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>4 Mass. 308, 312, \u201cthe parties themselves, at the time of the agreement, contemplated an assignment which was never made.\u201d Ellis can sue Nickerson for not making a mortgage to him (Ellis) of his interest in the \u201cHomestead\u201d as soon as he secured it, and that is the only remedy he has. Nickerson\u2019s agreement to make a mortgage of his interest in the \u201cHomestead\u201d as soon as he secured it did not of itself operate as a mortgage of it on an interest in the \u201cHomestead\u201d subsequently being secured by him. Such an agreement is like a promise to pay out of a specified fund when it is recovered, as to which see <em>Christmas </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>14 Wall. 69; <em>Delval </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>213 Mass. 203, 206. See also in this connection <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Quincy Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>124 Mass. 61; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>6 Cush. 282; <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>7 Cush. 46; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Hosack\u2019s Executors, </em>18 Wend. 319, 334. In the case of <em>Pinch </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>8 Allen, 536, relied on by Ellis, there was a special agreement that there should be a lien on property then owned by the parties making the agreement.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b303-4\"><em>J.
