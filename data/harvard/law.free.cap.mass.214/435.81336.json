There was evidence which warranted the jury in finding that the defendant was negligent, that the plaintiff Regan was in the exercise of due care, that the plaintiff Fitzgerald exercised no control over Regan, and that she exercised all the care that she was bound to exercise as a passenger in the automobile if she was an invited guest. Other material facts regarding liability of the defendant are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">In the course of his charge the judge made a statement as to what one of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses had said. The defendant's counsel questioned the accuracy of the statement and asked the judge to have the precise testimony of the witness read to the jury from the stenographer\u2019s notes. It appeared that the testimony in question had been given on a previous day and that the stenographer who then was in attendance was not present or accessible with the notes of the testimony. The request of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>fendant accordingly was denied, but the judge, with an especial allusion to the testimony in question, further charged the jury as follows: \u201cIf your recollection of the evidence given by any witness in the case differs from mine, then you must disregard what I have stated to you as the evidence, and accept your own recollection of it. That is true as to what I have said to you in regard to the testimony of witnesses produced by the plaintiff and in regard to what I have said to you as to testimony given by witnesses produced by the defendant.\u201d It also appeared that early in the charge the judge had instructed the jury as follows: \u201cI may say to you at this point what I have said to you when instructing you in other cases; that if your recollection of the evidence differs from mine, you must accept yours and reject mine because you are the judges of the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-3\">The jury found for the plaintiff Fitzgerald in the sum of $1,100, for the plaintiff Regan in the sum of $200, and for the plaintiff city in the sum of $350; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-4\"><em>J.

One of the grounds set up in defense was that at the time of the accident the machine was not being used for the purpose for which it was bought, but in violation of St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7 22, forbidding the use of an automobile without authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">There was evidence that in obedience to orders given by John Cashman, the superintendent of streets, through his son Daniel, the plaintiff Regan, the regular chauffeur employed by the city in its street department to operate the automobile under the control and direction of the superintendent of streets, drove it, with Daniel, the plaintiff Fitzgerald and one Bryant as passengers, from the office of an express company situated on Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Street in the city, in which company both the superintendent of streets and his son were stockholders, to the superintendent\u2019s house, situated on Hilldale Avenue in the city; that Bryant was the agent of a company engaged in \u201cmanufacturing and selling steam road rollers, scarifiers and road machines;\u201d that a scarifier is used for the purpose of breaking up the surface of a road before it is relaid; that Bryant desired to sell to the city a scarifier for use upon the streets; that the superintendent previously had had business dealings on behalf of the city, but never otherwise, with Bryant representing the manufacturing company; that one of the purposes for which the automobile was driven from the express office to his house was to bring Bryant where the superintendent could talk on this business, and that after Bryant arrived at the superintendent\u2019s house he stayed there twenty or thirty minutes, spending the time in trying to sell a scarifier to the city represented by the superintendent. Upon this evidence the jury certainly could find that in going from the office of the express company to the superintendent\u2019s house the automobile was under the direction of the superintendent for one of the purposes for which it was bought.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\">There was evidence also that the superintendent\u2019s house was situated about.three hundred and fifty feet westerly of Hilldale Avenue, and was connected therewith by a driveway; that Bryant and Daniel Cashman were left at the house shortly after six o\u2019clock, p. m. ; that the chauffeur then started for the garage in which the automobile was kept by the city when not in use, as it was his duty to do, taking with him Miss Fitzgerald, who had no relation to the street department but was a clerk in the express company\u2019s office, with the intention of leaving her at her house on his way to the garage; that the accident occurred just outside the driveway as the automobile turned into Hilldale Avenue; that the way from the superintendent\u2019s house to the garage and the way from the house to the home of Miss Fitzgerald were identical to a point more than half a mile beyond the place of the accident. Certainly on this evidence the jury properly could find that at the time of the accident the automobile was still being used in the street department and under the direction of the superintendent. It was the duty of the chauffeur at the close of the day to take the automobile to the garage. That duty he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>performing, and the place of the accident was on the direct route. The unexecuted intention to deviate from the direct route for the accommodation of Miss Fitzgerald half a mile farther on, had not yet become in any way operative so far as respected the route and position of the automobile. So far as respected this ground the cases properly were left to the jury. And notwithstanding some criticisms by the defendant upon the language of the charge, we see no just ground of complaint as to that, or to the manner in which the trial judge generally dealt with the exceptions in the cases of Regan and the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The only additional ground of defense set out in the Fitzgerald case is that she was not invited to ride by any one having authority. But that is untenable. The evidence is ample to show that she was invited by the authority of the superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">It was within the discretion of the presiding judge whether or not he would wait to procure the minutes of the absent stenographer and have them read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In each case the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
