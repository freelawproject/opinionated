F. Letteney Company, a corporation, seeking to set aside a certain mortgage purporting to have been given by that corporation to the defendant to secure a debt of $3,900, which was alleged to have been procured by the defendant for the purpose of obtaining a preference over other creditors of the corporation and also to be void because executed without authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-12\">The case was heard by <em>Hardy, </em>J., who made a memorandum of findings, including the finding which is quoted in the opinion. He ordered that the plaintiff should be granted the relief prayed for in the bill and should receive his costs. From a final decree entered in accordance with this order the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-13\"><em>L.

At the meeting of the directors who, under the by-laws and constitution, were the ones who managed the business affairs of the company, I do not find upon the evidence that more than one director took part in the execution of such mortgage, either by granting authority or by passing a vote whereby such mortgage was given. Inasmuch as there was not a sufficient number of directors present to confer such authority to execute the mortgage, such mortgage did not bind the corporation and is invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">This finding, unless clearly wrong, must stand. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Howes, </em>202 Mass. 54. Upon a careful examination, the finding, especially that part relating to the number of directors present at the meeting, appears to be abundantly supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
