Martin guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. 1, 518), conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7\u00a7 245, subd. (a), 182, subd. 1), murder (\u00a7 187), and simple assault (\u00a7 240). The jury also found Martin was armed with a firearm during the commission of the conspiracies and murder (\u00a7 12022, subd. (a)). The jury found the murder to be second degree. Martin was sentenced to 15 years to life for murder plus a 1-year enhancement. Sentencing for the conspiracies was stayed (\u00a7 654). Martin was sentenced to a concurrent six-month custody in county jail for assault with a deadly weapon. The issues on appeal concern jury instructions, the trial court\u2019s discretion in permitting testimony and examination of witnesses, sufficiency of the evidence, a pretrial motion to dismiss, and prosecutorial misconduct. The appeal is accompanied by and has been consolidated with a petition for habeas corpus based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose inducements for witness\u2019 testimony and the prosecution\u2019s suppression of evidence by intimidating witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">La Jolla attorney Richard Crake was murdered by Andrew James Powell on May 12, 1981. The death was probably the result of a severe blow to the head. Briefly, in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence shows Martin and Crake were embroiled in civil litigation arising from a dispute over a real estate transaction at the Sports Arena Square shopping center. During the course of discovery Martin became dissatisfied with the posture of the litigation. During a deposition Martin had threatened Crake with violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Michelle Goff worked for Martin\u2019s insurance company. Powell was Goff\u2019s boyfriend and she introduced him to Martin. Martin hired Powell on March 23, 1981. Martin knew Powell could not make his child support payments. Martin also knew Powell was afraid he would be jailed for failure to pay. Martin used this as leverage and told Powell he wanted Powell to collect money Crake owed Martin. Martin told Powell to collect $100,000 from Crake and to beat him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Martin gave Powell Crake\u2019s picture and business address. When Powell would not go to Crake\u2019s business, Martin supplied Crake\u2019s home address. Powell and a friend went to this address but discovered Crake no longer lived there. Powell called Martin long distance to tell him this address was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Martin obtained Crake\u2019s new address by contacting United States Marshal James Murphy telling Murphy he needed the address to serve papers in conjunction with his civil suit. Murphy provided Martin with Crake\u2019s address. Martin gave this address to Powell along with the keys to Martin\u2019s car and a bag containing a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Powell and a friend drove to Crake\u2019s house on May 12, 1981. They arrived at the guard station at approximately 9 p.m. Powell gave the guard a false name. The Crake family had returned from dinner approximately 9 p.m. Powell and his friend rang the doorbell and Crake answered. Powell sent the friend to the car and then told Crake he was there to collect $100,000 for Martin. Powell and Crake got into a fight. Powell shot Crake in the arm with Martin\u2019s gun. Powell hit Crake in the head with the gun between six and sixteen times. The blows eventually caused Crake\u2019s death. Crake\u2019s wife attempted to stop Powell but he pushed her away and fired the gun at her. Crake\u2019s daughter threw shoes and books at Powell.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Powell covered with blood returned to the friend\u2019s car. They drove to Powell\u2019s house where he made a toll call to Martin, telling him the dirty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>work was done. When Goff returned at 10 p.m. she found blood on the carpet, shoes in the bathtub, and blood on Powell\u2019s jacket. Powell disposed of the jacket and the gun in a nearby dumpster scheduled to be picked up the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Martin raises two challenges to the jury instructions: The first question is whether Martin was entitled to the instruction announced in <em>People </em>v. <em>Yarber </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 895 [153 Cal.Rptr. 875], rather than the standard CALJIC instruction No. 3.01. The California Supreme Court has granted hearing in several cases presenting this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">This court follows the general rule following a long line of cases finding CALJIC No. 3.01 sufficient. \u201cAs is said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ott </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 118, at page 130 . . . , \u2018aiding in the commission of the crime with knowledge of the wrongful purpose of the perpetrator <em>eo ipso </em>establishes the criminal intent . . . <em>\u201cthe criminal intent of the aider and abettor is presumed from his actions with knowledge of the actor\u2019s wrongful purpose\u201d </em>(italics added)\u2019 [citation]. We might add to these truths the observation that since our system of justice entrusts to the jurors the vast power of drawing any inference that can reasonably be drawn from substantial evidence and we foreover bind ourselves to those inferences properly drawn, it would be demeaning of jurors\u2019 intelligence to instruct them, in addition, on the clear implication of intent that flows logically and necessarily from the words of the CALJIC No. 3.01 standard instruction. The standard CALJIC No. 3.01 is all that is required.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 512, 525 [180 Cal.Rptr. 368].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\"><em>Yarber, </em>by its own holding, provides an instruction for exceptions to this general rule: \u201cThe <em>Ellhamer/Ott [People </em>v. <em>Ellhamer </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 777, 782 (18 Cal.Rptr. 905); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ott </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 118, 130 (148 Cal.Rptr. 479)] synthesis that intent is inferred from the knowledge of the aider and abettor of the perpetrator\u2019s purpose is sound, generally, as a matter of human experience, but we cannot extrapolate therefrom, <em>as a matter of law </em>[emphasis added], that the inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>must </em>be drawn. Intent is what must be proved; from a person\u2019s action with knowledge of the purpose of the perpetrator of a crime, his intent to aid the perpetrator can be <em>inferred. </em>In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the intent may be regarded as established. But where a contrary inference is reasonable\u2014where there is room for doubt that a person intended to aid a perpetrator\u2014his knowledge of the perpetrator\u2019s purpose will not suffice.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yarber, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 895, 916; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The <em>Yarber </em>instruction is appropriate where there are facts to support an inference although defendant actually aided in the commission of the crime the defendant did not by this action intend to do so. Martin produces \u201cno hinge or loop to hang a doubt on.\u201d CALJIC No. 3.01 was properly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Martin next argues the trial court\u2019s instructions on homicide created \u201chopeless confusion\u201d in the minds of the jury by offering alternative theories: felony murder based on the felony of conspiracy and second degree murder as the result of Martin\u2019s responsibility for all the criminal conduct of his coconspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">It is a fundamental rule the jury instructions must be read together and understood in context as presented to the jury. Whether a jury has been correctly instructed depends upon the entire charge of the court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mardian </em>(1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 16, 46 [121 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 67, 83 [171 Cal.Rptr. 365].) We assume jurors are intelligent persons capable of understanding and correlating jury instructions. (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Yoder </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 333, 338 [161 Cal.Rptr. 35]; <em>Flores, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.3d at p. 525.)  On review even if an erroneous instruction is included reversal is required only when it appears the error was likely to have misled the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mardian, supra, </em>47 Cal.App.3d at p. 46; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 143, 159 [125 Cal.Rptr. 745, 542 P.2d 1337]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 460, 470 [110 Cal.Rptr. 906, 516 P.2d 298].)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Here, the entire case was presented on the theory Martin was responsible for Powell\u2019s conduct because Martin coerced Powell to find Crake, collect the $100,000, and beat him up. Approximately nine pages of jury instructions carefully define conspiracy, principals, aiding and abetting, the extent of responsibility for accomplices, etc. The single instruction causing Martin\u2019s complaint is: \u201cIf a person while committing a felony inherently dangerous to human life causes another\u2019s death, malice is implied, and the crime is murder.\u201d  This single instruction would not have misled the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The trial court specifically instructed: \u201cThe defendant is charged in Count III of the Information with the commission of the crime of murder, a violation of Section 187 of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, as has been argued here, and I will instruct you, that that has to be on the conspiracy theory if at all. And that it has to be a foreseeable part of that conspiracy, as I have defined it for you.\u201d  This comment clarifies for the jury Martin\u2019s responsibility is based on the acts committed in furtherance of and during the course of the crimes contemplated and not purely for the existence of the conspiracy itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court did not improperly instruct on a felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Rulings on the Testimony of Defense Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Martin complains he was denied his right to confrontation by the trial court\u2019s limitation of the cross-examination of Andrew Powell and James Murphy. He also argues the court abused its discretion when it failed to grant immunity to proposed defense witnesses. Finally, he challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling under Evidence Code section 352 admitting the statement of a former Assistant United States Attorney to the effect Martin could commit perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Martin claims he should have been allowed to impeach Powell using specific instances in which Powell had lied in the past. The trial court properly ruled impeachment may not be based on past acts of misconduct nor on collateral matters. The court specifically found the examination would be too time consuming under Evidence Code section 352 and Martin could introduce evidence, as he did, to show Powell\u2019s reputation, thus achieving the same result properly. Testimony from Powell\u2019s girlfriend, his former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>commanding officer, a former employer and his former wife showed Powell had a reputation as a liar. Testimony of specific instances in which Powell made untruthful statements was unnecessary and could not be used to prove he acted in conformity with this character trait in this trial. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a).) Prior specific acts may not be introduced as proof of a witness\u2019 character for honesty and veracity to support or attack the witness\u2019 credibility. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 787; <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 97 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 467, 475 [159 Cal.Rptr. 615]; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 44, 48 [95 Cal.Rptr. 576].)  The admissibility of evidence is the duty of the trial court and we will not disturb the court\u2019s rulings absent clear error or an abuse of discretion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alfaro </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 414, 423 [132 Cal.Rptr. 356].) No such abuse or error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Deputy Marshal James Murphy testified Martin obtained Crake\u2019s address from Murphy and talked to Murphy the day after the murder. On cross-examination defense counsel attempted to show Martin had once asked Murphy to locate a litigant in one of Martin\u2019s lawsuits. The court ruled this testimony beyond the scope of direct examination and irrelevant unless the testimony related to Powell\u2019s contact with Crake. Martin asserts this testimony would explain Powell\u2019s presence at Crake\u2019s for a lawful purpose, i.e., to locate the other litigant. Admittedly the testimony was marginally relevant to contradict Powell\u2019s explanation for his visit.  However the cross-examination was of Murphy and this testimony would not elicit \u201c <em>\u2018any matter which may tend to overcome, qualify or explain the testimony given by a witness on his direct </em>examination. \u2019 (Italics added; [citations].)\u201d (Gal<em>laher </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 666, 671 [162 Cal.Rptr. 389]) nor would it affect facts or denials necessarily implied from the testimony in chief or contradict any facts stated in direct examination. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 672; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Zerillo </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 222, 229 [223 P.2d 223]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 380, 387 [231 P.2d 881], cert. den. 342 U.S. 910 [96 L.Ed. 681, 72 S.Ct. 301].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Finally, the offer of proof shows the testimony was hearsay; the out-of-court statement\u2014Martin told Murphy he would send someone else to locate the litigant\u2014was offered to prove Powell was sent to locate the litigant. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200, subd. (b).) In any event, there is no likelihood the jury\u2019s verdict would have been more favorable if Murphy had testified to this conversation. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 354; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Martin claims the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant immunity to three defense witnesses. Riley, Gross, and Wallace re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>fused to testify under their Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination. It is offered Riley would have corroborated testimony showing Martin did not supply the gun used by Powell. Gross would have testified Powell said Martin was not involved. Wallace would have testified Powell told him Martin was not involved and it was Powell\u2019s plan to extort money from Crake.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Penal Code section 1324 permits immunity on the request of the district attorney. <em>(Daly </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 132, 146 [137 Cal.Rptr. 14, 560 P.2d 1193].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Sutter </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 806 [184 Cal.Rptr. 829], the defendant argued the court has jurisdiction to grant judicial immunity in addition to that provided in the statute. Defendant Sutter and codefendant Mayhew committed a robbery. Sutter drove the car; Mayhew entered and robbed a liquor store. Mayhew pled guilty while Sutter proceeded to trial. Sutter offered Mayhew\u2019s testimony would show Sutter did not know Mayhew was going to rob the store when he went in to buy beer because Sutter remained in the car. Mayhew asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege to shield evidence of a similar robbery in another prosecution. The People would not request immunity because the second robbery file was still open. The Court of Appeal affirmed because the immunity issue had not been properly preserved on appeal. However, in response to a dissent the court went on to state the decision to grant immunity is discretionary. The decision rests first with the district attorney and in limited circumstances with the court. The <em>Sutter </em>dissenting judge also noted immunity is discretionary and must be clearly limited. An important factor is whether the defense witness is available to testify. In addition, the testimony must be clearly exculpatory, the testimony must be essential and there must be no strong contrary governmental interests. Here, although all three witnesses were available, their testimony is not clearly exculpatory in that it only contradicts Powell\u2019s assertion he received the gun from Martin and Martin coerced him into performing the crime. This testimony was offered by another defense witness, Aguiar, and therefore the cumulative statements of three additional witnesses were not essential. Finally, the trial court expressly ruled immunity would not be proper due to the grave and serious circumstances of this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>In re Marshall K. </em>(1970) 14 Cal.App.3d 94 [92 Cal.Rptr. 39], the court said; \u201cThe cases hold that the state is under no obligation to make a witness available to testify for a defendant, or on behalf of the People for that matter, by granting him immunity from prosecution.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Although there is federal and California precedent for limited judicially declared use immunity, no case has been cited which would permit a trial court to require a witness to testify after his assertion of a Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Amendment privilege. In view of this scant authority and the Legislature\u2019s express delegation of the authority to grant immunity to the prosecution, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Alternatively, Martin insists statements made by these witnesses to a police investigator are admissible exceptions to the hearsay rule as declarations against penal interest under Evidence Code section 1230. \u201cEvidence of a statement by a declarant having sufficient knowledge of the subject is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness and the statement, when made, was so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far subjected him to the risk of civil or criminal liability ... a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true.\u201d Here, although the witnesses\u2019 statements were clearly against their penal interest, it is not certain a reasonable person in their position would not have made the statement unless they were true. The trial court was faced with allegations Martin had bought and paid for this testimony and that these witnesses had nothing to lose by virtue of the fact they were currently incarcerated on other charges. The trial court\u2019s ruling to exclude this hearsay evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Martin next argues the trial court\u2019s ruling under Evidence Code section 352 admitting the testimony of former Assistant United States Attorney Robert Knoll to the effect Martin was willing to commit perjury was an abuse of discretion. The statement showed Martin was willing to go to extraordinary lengths to assert his interests. The evidence tended to prove Martin\u2019s motive to take the law into his own hands based on his frustration with the civil litigation. Evidence Code section 352 requires a balancing of probative value and prejudicial effect. The evidence did not show Martin had committed perjury at any time, Martin did not testify so there was no inference he currently was committing perjury and the statement only showed a possibility he was capable of criminal behavior. It was not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Even without this evidence, there is other more powerful evidence showing Martin\u2019s motive and plan to harm Crake. It is not reasonably probable a different result would have been reached if the trial court\u2019s ruling were error.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Motion for Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">During the trial a prosecution witness had an emotional outburst in which she told Martin he was guilty. The court questioned each juror in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>dividually to determine whether this unsolicited remark would affect their ability to unemotionally and independently evaluate the case. The court was satisfied each juror could ignore the remark and admonished the jury against using the remark for any purpose. Absent any evidence to the contrary, we assume the jury was able to follow the trial court\u2019s admonition and disregard the statement. Juries often hear unsolicited and inadmissible comments and in order for trials to proceed without constant mistrial, it is axiomatic the prejudicial effect of these comments may be corrected by judicial admonishment; absent evidence to the contrary the error is deemed cured. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ryan </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 168, 184 [171 Cal.Rptr. 854]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Seiterle </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 703, 710 [31 Cal.Rptr. 67, 381 P.2d 947], cert. den. 375 U.S. 887 [11 L.Ed.2d 116, 84 S.Ct. 163]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sandoval </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 885, 888 [88 Cal.Rptr. 625].)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Substantial Evidence Supports the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Martin urges there is insufficient evidence to support each count. We review the elements of each conviction and recite the evidence supporting that element.  A conspiracy is an agreement to commit an unlawful object and in furtherance of the agreement the commission of an overt act toward the achievement of that objective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fujita </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 454, 471 [117 Cal.Rptr. 757], cert. den. 421 U.S. 964 [44 L.Ed.2d 451, 95 S.Ct. 1952].) The agreement may be shown by circumstantial evidence and the defendant\u2019s conduct carrying out their mutual purpose is sufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lipinski </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 566, 575 [135 Cal.Rptr. 451]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardeman </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 1, 41 [53 Cal.Rptr. 168], cert. den. 387 U.S. 912 [18 L.Ed.2d 634, 87 S.Ct. 1700].)  Powell testified Martin solicited him to collect money and beat up Crake. Martin threatened Powell with jail and the loss of his job if he refused to participate. Martin obtained Crake\u2019s current address and gave it to Powell. Powell then went to Crake\u2019s house, demanded the money, assaulted Crake and killed him. Powell\u2019s testimony is corroborated by the testimony of his girlfriend and Martin\u2019s other employees. This evidence is sufficient to support conviction for conspiracy to commit extortion and conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Martin attempts to argue the murder and assault were not in furtherance of the conspiracy because Powell had withdrawn from the conspiracy. This argument is directly contradicted by Powell\u2019s testimony of the conversation and his activities the night of the murder. Even though at times Powell refused to comply with Martin\u2019s instructions there is no question but that Powell went to Crake\u2019s house the night of the murder, demanded the mon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ey, assaulted Crake and killed him. Even if Powell was reluctant at various times during the course of the planning stages of the crime, it is apparent he participated exactly as agreed, he so testified, and his testimony is corroborated by circumstantial evidence of other witnesses and the record of telephone calls between Powell and Martin the day and night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">A coconspirator is guilty of any crime committed by his confederate which is a natural or probable act committed in furtherance of the conspiracy or any crime which is one of natural and probable consequence of the object of the conspiracy. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brawley, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 277 [82 Cal.Rptr. 161, 461 P.2d 361].) The question of what constitutes a natural and probable consequence is one of fact for the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Drolet </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 207, 217 [105 Cal.Rptr. 824].)  A reasonable jury could find the assault and murder were a natural and probable consequence of Martin\u2019s instructions to collect the money and beat up Crake, his giving Powell Crake\u2019s address and his providing a gun.  Substantial evidence supports this jury\u2019s conclusions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Martin declares numerous incidents of prosecutorial misconduct compel reversal of the convictions. Martin first complains the prosecutor\u2019s argument was a direct comment on his failure to testify and thus requires reversal under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065], as a violation of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229].  <em>Griffin </em>holds the prosecutor may not comment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand and testify in his behalf. <em>(Griffin, supra, People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 470 [108 Cal.Rptr. 15, 509 P.2d 959].) Whether <em>Griffin </em>error is prejudicial depends upon whether the comment fills a gap in the prosecution\u2019s case or touches a live nerve in the defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 438, 462 [116 Cal.Rptr. 133]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 711, 730 [76 Cal.Rptr. 391, 452 P.2d 607], cert. den. 397 U.S. 944 [25 L.Ed.2d 124, 90 S.Ct. 959].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In this case the prosecution merely stated the obvious; he simply noted the difficulty proving a conspiracy is that it must often be proved by circumstantial evidence because the conspirators frequently do not testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">It is hard to see the argument focused attention on Martin\u2019s failure to testify by asserting that even without Powell\u2019s testimony, sufficient evidence supported a finding of conspiracy. The trial court\u2019s instructions telling the jury Martin\u2019s failure to testify could not be used to infer his guilt would have cured any potential harm from this limited comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The record shows several references and innuendos by the district attorney to Martin\u2019s alleged connection with the Mafia. Martin directs our attention to three instances. The first instance occurred during examination of Deputy District Attorney Charles Hayes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u201cQ: Did that deal with things in his background?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">\u201cA: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">\u201cQ: What was Martin\u2019s response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">\u201cA: Well, I specifically asked him whether he had any connection with Department of Justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201cQ: Did he tell you the answer to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">\u201cA: He said, yes, he did. He was connected with the Department of Justice. I asked him whether he was acquainted with the Mafia activities in New Jersey and he said\u2014\u201d On defense objection the question and answer were stricken, the district attorney was admonished and the defense motion for mistrial was denied. Although it is true one cannot unring a bell, the trial court instructed the jury they were not to consider answers which had been stricken from the record. We assume the jury understood and applied this instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">During closing argument the district attorney attempted to discredit defense testimony by an illustration \u201cinspired\u201d by the cover of the book The Godfather:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cOkay. Well, I want to talk about the credibility of some witnesses for a little while, and I am reminded of a popular book that came out a few years ago, and it was also a successful movie; a book called \u2018The Godfather\u2019. I am reminded of that book, at least, the cover, the cover of that book. I don\u2019t know if any of you read it, but the cover of that book has the name on it, and I can\u2019t remember exactly what it is. It is either a hand or some figure, and there is strings going down to the words and the name, I think, like a puppet; like a person pulling the strings on a puppet. A vision of the cover of that book came to my mind when some defense witnesses testified in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cFor example, Marcia Sharpe. She is the daughter of the defendant. Okay. She got on the stand as a defense witness, and the defense pulled a string for April 6. Her testimony was, April 6 my father was on a couch about 9:30 in his office and had to be taken to the doctor. That is the response the April 6 string got.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201cOkay. I cross-examined her, tried to cross-examine her about that. I pulled an April 7th string, or April 6th string. \u2018Who else was there?\u2019 T don\u2019t remember.\u2019 \u2018Was Powell around?\u2019 T don\u2019t remember.\u2019 \u2018When did your father come back to work?\u2019 T don\u2019t remember.\u2019 This is just because the wrong person was pulling the strings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Even though this illustration was unnecessary and may have been offered in bad faith, it does not amount to a dishonest act or an intent to persuade the jury by deceptive, reprehensible means. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Strickland </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 946, 955 [114 Cal.Rptr. 632, 523 P.2d 672].)  Furthermore, in order to preserve this argument on appeal an objection must be made when the comment is made in order to give the trial judge an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to cure any harm caused by the comment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27, 34 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].)  No such objection was made here and an admonishment could have cured any potential prejudicial effect of the illustration.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Martin last complains of the prosecution\u2019s analogy of Powell\u2019s testimony to the testimony of Jimmy Fratianno: \u201cSo, you know it is not hard in a case like this, in any conspiracy case, to run down the credibility of, or the character of, one of the coconspirators. People who conspire together to commit crimes are not decent, good, law-abiding, upstanding people. When one of them gets on the stand and testifies, it is easy to run down their credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u201cLet me give you an example of a guy who has been in the press recently. Jimmy Fratianno. The guy has been a crook all his life. He has been a hit man. Okay? He has testified. [At this point in response to defense objection a bench conference was held and the prosecutor instructed to forego this illustration.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">This incomplete analogy was abandoned after a bench conference and this limited comment could not in any way have affected the verdict following this month-long trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Martin asserts prosecutorial misconduct because the prosecutor wilfully suppressed material evidence. This assertion is based on Martin\u2019s assumption the three defense witnesses who asserted their Fifth Amendment privileges did so because another defense witness was arrested. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruthford </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 399, 406 [121 Cal.Rptr. 261, 534 P.2d 1341], the court stated: \u201c[W]hen the evidence which is suppressed or otherwise made unavailable to the defense by conduct attributable to the state bears directly on the question of guilt our initial inquiry is whether such conduct resulted in denial of a fair trial.\u201d In this case there is no offer of proof nor evidence the witnesses\u2019 decision to not testify was based on any conduct attributable to the state. In fact when the court was advised of the defense witnesses\u2019 arrest, the court stated the arrest had \u201cnothing to do with this Court\u201d although tactically it might have been \u201cbest left undone.\u201d Without conduct attributable to the prosecution there cannot be any wilfull suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Martin raises a few more insignificant complaints. First, during closing argument the prosecutor remarked \u201cthose black guys upstairs in the jail didn\u2019t come in and testify that Powell tried to get a gun from them. His efforts in this regard,, apparently, were not fruitful.\u201d The defense objection to this comment was sustained. Martin complains the prosecutor misstated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>the law on conspiracy. It is the duty of the trial court, not the prosecutor, to instruct the jury on the law and the court instructed the jury correctly. The prosecution, defense and the court all told the jury that they would receive legal instruction from the court. The prosecutor\u2019s comment had no effect on these instructions. Finally, Martin argues the prosecutor questioned a witness on privileged information. The defense objections were sustained and the jury was instructed questions are not evidence. No harm accrued from these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Martin\u2019s motion to consolidate his petition for writ of habeas corpus with the related appeal is granted. The petition presents four arguments: prosecutorial misconduct, deprivation of a fair trial based on witness intimidation, the prosecutor failed to disclose inducements had been offered to key prosecution witnesses in exchange for their testimony and newly discovered credible evidence undermines the entire case. The allegations in the petition for writ of habeas corpus concerning prosecutorial misconduct and witness intimidation have been dispensed with on the merits in the opinion on appeal. (See part V, above.) A potential witness\u2019 assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not conduct attributable to the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Martin next argues the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose inducements made to key prosecution witnesses in exchange for their testimony deprived him of a fair trial. This allegation concerns the testimony of Powell and Steven Jarrett. Martin offers exhibits to show the district attorney offered to intercede on Powell\u2019s behalf to allow him to obtain more favorable treatment in the Department of Corrections. Similarly he offers exhibits to show Jarrett was promised more favorable treatment at judgment and sentencing in another case. Martin concedes such inducements are common prosecutorial tools and that these particular promises were not necessarily improper. His argument, however, is based on the failure to disclose the fact inducements were made. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruthford, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 399, 406, 408; <em>In re Ferguson </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 525, 531 [96 Cal.Rptr. 594, 487 P.2d 1234].)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">A prosecutor must disclose substantial material evidence favorable to the accused even without a request. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruthford, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 406; <em>In re Ferguson, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 533; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83, 87 [10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218-219, 83 S.Ct. 1194]; <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 150, 155 [31 L.Ed.2d 104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>109, 92 S.Ct. 763]; <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1959) 360 U.S. 264, 269 [3 L.Ed.2d 1217, 1221, 79 S.Ct. 1173].) Where the undisclosed evidence is that of an inducement for testimony, both the failure to disclose this interest to the jury or to the defense and the failure to correct a misleading statement that no inducement was offered denies the defendant a fair trial where \u201cthe evidence thus suppressed by the prosecution related to the credibility of a key witness whose testimony may have been determinative of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruthford, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at p. 406; citing <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>405 U.S. at p. 154 [31 L.Ed.2d at pp. 108-109].)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Although Jarrett\u2019s testimony was important, Powell\u2019s testimony as the coconspirator was pivotal. Both witnesses denied promises of lenient treatment had been made to them in exchange for their testimony. The district attorney sat by as this misleading testimony entered the record and in the case of Powell argued: \u201cThere is no evidence that he was given any kind of deal for his testimony.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Varona </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 566, 570 [192 Cal.Rptr. 44].) Aside from the exhibits accompanying the petition for habeas corpus, it appears in the record this conduct was more than an oversight and beyond benign neglect.  \u201cThe duty of the district attorney is not merely that of an advocate. His duty is not to obtain convictions, but to fully and fairly present to the court the evidence material to the charge upon which the defendant stands trial, and it is the solemn duty of the trial judge to see that the facts material to the charge are fairly presented. [Citations.] In the light of the great resources at the command of the district attorney and our commitment that justice be done to the individual, restraints are placed on him to assure that the power committed to his care is used to further the administration of justice in our courts and not to subvert their procedures in criminal trials designed to ascertain the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u201c. . . Although our system of administering criminal justice is adversary in nature, a trial is not a game. . . .\u201d <em>(In re Ferguson, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 525, 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In this case the prosecutor had a duty to disclose to the court the misleading testimony of the prosecution witnesses. The prosecution\u2019s failure resulted in the suppression of substantial material evidence concerning the credibility of chief witnesses. Nonetheless we must evaluate whether this affected the outcome of the trial. We are satisfied that had the jury known the witnesses had been promised more lenient treatment in exchange for their cooperation, it would not have affected the verdict. Both witnesses faced severe penal sanctions and the district attorney\u2019s offer to intercede would only have changed the character of the sanctions. Both witnesses had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>other motives to testify. Both witnesses\u2019 testimony was corroborated by other direct testimony and circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Martin\u2019s final argument is new evidence has become available which undermines the entire case of the prosecution and could not have been discovered by diligent pretrial investigation. <em>(In re Hall </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 408, 417 [179 Cal.Rptr. 223, 637 P.2d 690].) The proposed testimony is that of Wallace Jackson. Jackson was Powell\u2019s cellmate in county jail before trial. Martin asserts Jackson would testify Powell and Wallace concocted a scheme to frame him. None of the information supplied by Jackson\u2019s declaration constitutes evidence undiscoverable before trial. Both Jackson\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s declarations state they were cellmates along with Richard Tiebout and Powell during the defense investigation. The defense investigator interviewed Wallace and Tiebout and could just have easily interviewed Jackson. No new evidence which would have undermined the prosecutor\u2019s case is presented and the potential witness was discoverable before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The judgment on appeal is affirmed.

In <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 675, 693 [88 Cal.Rptr. 500], the appeal court (Kaus) cited: \u201cThe stark fact of vicarious criminal liability for acts of coconspirators \u2018within the reasonable and probable consequences of the common unlawful design.\u2019 [Citations.] <em>These may be acts, which, as such, may never have been contemplated by a particular member of the conspiracy. </em>\u201d (Italics added; fn. omitted.)

Martin admits Powell\u2019s testimony at the preliminary examination so far as it related to Powell\u2019s contacts and relationship with Martin paralleled his testimony at trial. The trial court\u2019s ruling on a 995 motion requires a much lesser showing than that necessary for conviction. The determination is based on whether there is probable cause. Probable cause is established if a reasonable person would be led to believe and conscientiously entertain strong suspicion of the accused\u2019s guilt. <em>(Somers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 961 [108 Cal.Rptr. 630].) The trial judge is required only to weigh the evidence as a reasonable person for an inference, not for an absolute conviction, and if there is some evidence to support the information, the court does not examine its sufficiency. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Velasquez </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 547 [126 Cal.Rptr. 11].) All legitimate inferences are drawn in favor of the information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Markin </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 58 [109 Cal.Rptr. 609].) Since we have found there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt and a dismissal under section 995 only requires a showing of probable cause, it follows the 995 motion was properly denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b159-13\">The text of the comment is: \u201cLet me read an instruction. \u2018It is not necessary in proving a conspiracy to show a meeting of the alleged conspirators or the making of an express or formal agreement. The formation and existence of a conspiracy may be inferred from all the circumstances tending to show the common intent, and may be proved in the same way as any other fact may be proved, either by direct testimony of the fact or by circumstantial evidence or by both direct and circumstantial evidence.\u2019 Let me suggest that conspiracy, prosecution cases oftentimes include both conspirators as defendants and none of the conspirators testify. Let me suggest to you that you consider this case in that light for a while. Consider your job as finding whether or not Andrew Powell and Herman G. Martin are guilty of Count I, conspiracy to commit extortion and Count II and Count HI and Count IV, both of them are sitting over here on trial. Neither one of them testified. No testimony from either of the coconspirators. You hear the evidence that you heard in this case without Andrew Powell\u2019s testimony?

However, I believe instructional error requires reversal of Martin\u2019s conviction of second degree murder. Martin was neither charged with nor tried for conspiracy to commit murder, reflecting the district attorney\u2019s assessment before trial that there was insufficient evidence to establish an agreement between Martin and Powell that Powell was to murder Crake. The deputy district attorney who tried the case did so consistently, but incorrectly, with these pleadings on the theory that the unintended killing was the objectively foreseeable result of the charged conspiracies, neither of which can legally support a finding of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">Jury instructions may not be considered in the abstract. They must be evaluated in the context of the actual trial, considering the theories advanced and the evidence presented. In the case before us the jury was directed to limit its consideration of Martin\u2019s guilt on the murder count to \u201cthe <em>con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>spiracy </em>theory if at all.\u201d (See <em>ante, </em>p. 158, italics supplied.) In effect, the jury was told to disregard the instructions on aiding and abetting. My assessment of the record is shared by the Attorney General who asserts: \u201cThe plain language of the above instruction indicates the jury was not to consider an aiding and abetting theory when they evaluated the murder count.\u201d \u201c[They were told to] evaluate the murder count using a conspiracy theory <em>exclusively. </em>\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Excising the aiding and abetting instructions, it appears the jury convicted Martin on the following instructions. The jury first determined Martin was guilty of the conspiracies to commit extortion and to commit assault with a deadly weapon. As a coconspirator, the jury was then told, Martin had the same culpability as Powell: \u201cEach member of a criminal conspiracy is liable for each act and bound by each declaration of every other member of the conspiracy if said act or said declaration is in furtherance of the object of the conspiracy. [\u00b6] The act of one conspirator pursuant to or in furtherance of the common design of the conspiracy is the act of all conspirators. Every conspirator is legally responsible for the act of a coconspirator that follows as one of the probable and natural consequences of the object of the conspiracy even though it was not intended as a part of the original plan and even though he was not present at the time of the commission of such act.\u201d (CALJIC No. 6.11.) Finally, in determining whether second degree murder was a \u201cprobable and natural consequence of the object of the conspiracy,\u201d the jury was permitted to apply part of CALJIC No. 8.30 and all of CALJIC No. 8.31 (1981 rev.): \u201cMurder of the second degree is [also] the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought when there is manifested an intention unlawfully to kill a human being . . . .[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] [\u00b6] Murder of the second degree is [also] the unlawful killing of a human being as the direct causal result of an intentional act involving a high degree of probability that it will result in death, which act is done for a base, antisocial purpose and with wanton disregard for human life. [\u00b6] When the killing is the direct result of such an intentional act, it is not necessary to establish that the defendant intended that his act would result in the death of a human being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">None of these instructions informed the jury they were to focus on Martin\u2019s state of mind in determining whether he harbored the malice necessary for conviction of second degree murder. To complicate matters further, the case was tried and argued in a manner which allowed the jury to substitute Powell\u2019s state of mind for that of Martin\u2019s in finding Martin guilty of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The deputy district attorney argued that if the jury decided Powell acted for a base, antisocial purpose and with wanton disregard for human life, then Martin was guilty as a coconspirator since murder was a natural and probable consequence of the conspiracy. After saying he wanted to talk about \u201chomicide law,\u201d the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">\u201cWith respect to Count III [murder], this jury must decide the case of the People of the State of California versus Andrew Powell. You have to decide without regard to Herman Martin or any\u2014just take him out of the picture for a minute. You have seen the evidence about Andrew Powell killing Richard Crake. You have to decide what kind of a killing that was, because the only thing that is important with respect to this conspiracy theory is, Andrew Powell, his state of mind and what kind of a homicide did he commit when he killed Crake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">\u201cFirst of all, the only instructions you are going to hear, the only choices you are going to get are between second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter or not guilty. The evidence is going to show this is a second degree murder. Homicide is the unlawful killing of someone. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cWell, the first two of those you don\u2019t have any problem with. Mr. Crake was killed, and it was clearly an unlawful killing. The question is, did Andrew Powell have a state of mind that we described as malice aforethought? Because the difference between murder and manslaughter is the presence or absence of malice aforethought. If it is an unlawful killing and there is malice aforethought, it is murder. If there is no malice aforethought, it is manslaughter. That is it simply.\u201d The deputy district attorney proceeded to focus on Powell\u2019s state of mind, arguing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\u201cYou tell us what he [Andrew Powell] intended to do. Don\u2019t let Andrew Powell tell you what his state of mind was. You tell him. . . . The jury can tell Herman Martin what Andrew Powell\u2019s state of mind was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">\u201cI suggest to you Andrew Powell was full of malice, and the killing that resulted in this case clearly shows that. This is a second degree murder. Murder of a second degree is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought when there is manifested an intention to unlawfully kill a human being.

I mean, he beat him. He shot him. That manifested an intent to kill. Powell did second degree murder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The court\u2019s instructions to the jury, consistent with the prosecutor\u2019s argument, failed to inform the jury that in order to convict Martin of second degree murder it was Martin who had to act with either express or implied malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The court\u2019s error in permitting Powell\u2019s malice to be attributed to Martin was exacerbated by the court\u2019s error in partially instructing on felony murder. The court inexplicably gave part of CALJIC No. 8.51. The giving of that instruction seems \u201cinexplicable\u201d because the court rejected CALJIC Nos. 8.32 and 8.33. Those instructions present the basic second degree felony-murder rule and further provide that if a killing is done to further the common purpose of a conspiracy to commit a felony inherently dangerous to human life, all of the coconspirators are deemed to be equally guilty of murder of the second degree whether the killing is intentional, unintentional or accidental. The court\u2019s rejection of those instructions and the fact the prosecutor was prevented from arguing a felony-murder theory suggests the giving of part of CALJIC No. 8.51 was due to an oversight. Nonetheless, the jury was instructed; \u201cIf a person while committing a felony inherently dangerous to human life causes another\u2019s death, <em>malice is implied, and the crime is murder. </em>If while committing a misdemeanor inherently dangerous to human life he causes another\u2019s death, there is no malice, and he is guilty of manslaughter.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Italics supplied.) The instruction was not supplemented, nor could it have been, by instructions defining the underlying dangerous felony or misdemeanor. Pursuant to the rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522, 538-540 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 40 A.L.R.3d 1323], the felony of assault with a deadly weapon cannot be used to support a second degree murder conviction on a felony-murder theory. Extortion also is unavailable as the underlying felony because it is not inherently dangerous to human life.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the above instructions the jury could have erroneously found Powell guilty of felony murder. Combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>with the preceding conspiracy and second degree murder instructions and the prosecutor\u2019s argument focusing on Powell\u2019s rather than Martin\u2019s state of mind, the jury then could have erroneously concluded Martin, as Powell\u2019s coconspirator, was guilty of implied malice second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Courts and commentators continue to question the mechanical application of artificial formulae to establish criminal liability. For example, the California Supreme Court \u201c. . . has repeatedly criticized the felony-murder rule as a \u2018highly artificial\u2019 and \u2018barbaric\u2019 concept which \u2018. . . \u201cerodes the relation between criminal liability and moral culpability\u201d. . .' <em>\" (People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 494 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697] (conc. opn. of Bird, C. J.).) Courts have historically equated the degree of criminal liability with the actor\u2019s state of mind. Mens rea has always been stressed to insure that punishment which society prescribes for a specific crime is directly related to the criminal purpose of the perpetrator. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 20; 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963, and 1978 supp.) Elements of Crime, \u00a7 52.) Only recently, for example, this court held the objective standard of CALJIC No. 8.31 for implied malice second degree murder was inadequate because the instruction failed to require a finding the defendant acted with a <em>subjective </em>awareness that his conduct endangered the life of another. <em>(People </em>v. Smith<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (Cal.App.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Paradoxically, the majority here affirms Martin\u2019s conviction of second degree murder on a conspiracy theory which allowed the jury to disregard Martin\u2019s state of mind. Instead, guilt was based on a simple but incorrect formula: conspiracy (of any felony) plus death equals second degree murder provided the death (1) was an objectively foreseeable event and (2) was caused by the coconspirator\u2019s death-resulting act.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In this case, there was ample evidence to convict Martin of aiding and abetting Powell\u2019s commission of second degree murder. The fact that Martin used a mercenary as an intermediary rather than acting himself does not immunize him from culpability. Accordingly, had the jury been asked to decide whether Martin, under all of the circumstances, acted with implied malice<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in intentionally instigating a chain of events which directly resulted in Crake\u2019s death, it may well have answered affirmatively. Unfortunately, the jury was never given that opportunity. Accordingly, I conclude Martin\u2019s second degree murder conviction must be reversed. Regardless of Martin\u2019s apparent guilt of second degree murder, he is nonetheless entitled to a fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>tual determination of each of the elements of that crime. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kent </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 207, 213, 214, fn. 7 [178 Cal.Rptr. 28].)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 13, 1984, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied April 19, 1984.
