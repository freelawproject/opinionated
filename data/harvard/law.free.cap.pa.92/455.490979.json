Henry Bawle, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHD0\">By the Act of March 14th 1865, Pamph. L. 1030, Purd. Dig. 1376, a registry bureau was established, and the city divided into sections for the registry of every lot; and, under penalty, every buyer or seller was required to present his deed for registration. By the Act of March 29th 1867, Pamph. L. 600, Purd. Dig. 1378, pi. 137, it is made the duty of the purchaser to register <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>his deed, and after such registration the act declares, no sale for taxes or other municipal claims shall be made, except after recovery by suit and service of the writ upon the registered owner, as in the case of a summons. While it is true that a sheriff\u2019s vendee is not affected by mere defects or irregularities in the process, it is equally well settled, that no title passes by a sale made without authority or under illegal process, or where the objections touch the foundation of the proceedings, by impeaching the authority of the officer who makes the sale. A sale expressly prohibited by statute, does not constitute, as against the owner, amere irregularity; it is made without authority and is clearly a nullity: Shields <em>v. </em>Miltenberger, 2 Harris 78; Wistar <em>v. </em>City, 5 Norris 215; Mortimer <em>v. </em>Piggott, 2 Dowling Prac. 616; Porter <em>v. </em>Neelan, 4 Yeates 108; Glancey <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 Id. 212; Allison <em>v. </em>Rheam, 3 S. &amp; R. 139; Kintz <em>v. </em>Long, 6 Casey 501. Sheetz <em>v. </em>Wynkoop, 24 P. F. Smith 198, and Soullier <em>v. </em>Kern, 19 P. F. Smith 16, rule this case. The first case arose under the Act of April 18th 1861, Pamph. L. 409, Purd. Dig. 1061, pl. 183, which provides that: \u201c No civil process shall issue or be enforced against any person mustered into the service of this state, or of the United States, during the term for which he shall be engaged in such service, nor until thirty days after he shall have been discharged therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-6\">The second, under the Act of 16th April 1840, section 10, Pamph. L. 413, Purd. Dig. 1088, pl. 23, which provides, \u201cno property owned by minors, shall be sold under the provisions of mis act, until the expiration of two years' from the time the said minor shall have become of age.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">The effect of these statutes is, that under the first act, no title passes if the owner is actually in military service \u2014 under the second act, no title passes if the owner is a minor; and under the act of 1867, no title passes if the owner is registered. In fact, both Sheetz <em>v. </em>Wynkoop and Soullier <em>v. </em>Kern, are much less strong than this case. In those cases the purchaser could not possibly protect himself, while here he had but to examine the records of the registry department.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-8\"><em>Hood Gilpin </em>and <em>Charles Gilpin, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdR\">The form of return in City <em>v. </em>Simons, is identical with that used from the time of Delaney <em>v. </em>Gault, 6 Casey 63, in 1858, down to that of Wistar <em>v. </em>The City, 5 Norris 215, in 1878. It has always been the law, in this state, that an irregularity or defect in the record of a suit was cured by judgment therein, and the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed to a bona fide purchaser for value, and that such purchaser took a good and valid title to such property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-9\">The most that may be said of the judgment in the suit of City <em>v. </em>Simons, is that it is voidable only, and not void absolutely; and being so, may only be taken advantage of by proceedings in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>original suit, and is good to pass a title to a bona fide purchaser for Value, if not so impeached and avoided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-6\">Such a construction as is demanded would prevent the collection of the city taxes, should the owner of vacant and unoccupied premises leave the county and remain away; and throw such obstacles in the way of their collection, by the municipal authorities, as would render the expense of the collection of the duty, greater than the duty was worth. It would be at variance with the settled doctrine of this court, regarding the collection of taxes and duties, by placing the right of the community beneath that of the individual, and making the person and not the land itself liable to the burden.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-7\">In Wistar <em>v. </em>The City, <em>supra, </em>we have a recognition by this court, of the old mode of procedure practiced under and sanctioned by the laws of this state, and decisions thereunder for the last twenty years. Hundreds of titles have become vested thereunder, and this court is asked here to upset the entire law and practice, because the defendant neglected for six months, after he was notified, to attend to the suit of the city, until his title was divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-8\">Mr. Justice Sterrett</author>\n<p id=\"A8dA\">delivered the opinion of the court, January 26th 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The question in this case is, whether the sheriff\u2019s sale, on which the defendant in error bases his claim to the lot in controversy, was valid or void. The plaintiff in error contends that it was void, for want of authority, and consequently his title was not divested thereby. If this be so, there was error in entering judgment against him on the question of law reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">It appears that in June 1870, immediately after he acquired title to the lot, his deed was duly registered in the registry bureau of the survey department of the city, and, on the following day, recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds. He had thus complied strictly with the requirements of the law, and had a right to rely on such statutory provisions as were intended for the benefit and protection of property owners who were not in default, in returning their property for registration. The supplement to the registry law, approved March 26th 1867, Pamph. L. 600, makes it the duty of purchasers, devisees and persons to whom allotments in partition are made, to present their deeds or title papers at the registry bureau, so that they may be endorsed in accordance with the act, and imposes a penalty for neglect to do so. It then provides that \u201cno property so returned shall be subject to sale for taxes or other municipal claims thereafter to accrue as a lien of record thereon, except in the name of the owner as returned, and after recovery by suit and service of the writ on him as in the case of a summons.\u201d The lien was filed and proceedings thereon conducted in the name of the plaintiff in error as owner of the lot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>and in this particular the provisions of the act were complied with ; but neither the writ of scire facias nor any other writ vm served \u201con him as in the case of a summons,\u201d or in any other form. The sheriff's return to the writ of scire facias was \u201cmade known by posting a true and attested copy of the within writ on the premises within described, September 11th 1875, and by advertising twice a week, for two weeks, in the \u2018 Evening Bulletin,\u2019 a daily paper published in this city, agreeably to the Act of Assembly in such case made and provided. <em>Nihil habet </em>as to Samuel Simons.\u201d Even if the plaintiff in error had not brought himself within the provisions of the registry act, above quoted, this return would have been defective, as was shown in Wistar <em>v. </em>The City of Philadelphia, 5 Norris 215. The Act of March 23d 1866, Pamph. L. 303, was intended to remedy the then existing grievances, fully recited in its preamble, among which were the oppressive costs and expenses to which property owners were subjected, and especially the sale of their property without notice to them; but the provisions of this act were deemed an inadequate remedy, and the following year the supplement above cited was passed. It provides, as we have seen, that no registered real estate shall be subject to sale except after service of the writ on the owner as in the case of a summons. The obvious purpose of this and previous legislation on the subject was to secure a complete record of real estate in the registry bureau of the city, so that it might be more readily subjected to taxes and other municipal burdens, and at the same time to render registered owners more secure in their titles by prohibiting sales for taxes or other municipal claims without the prescribed form of notice. It cannot be doubted that a sale made in direct violation of this statutory prohibition is void. It is not a mere irregularity that would be cured by the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed. The omission to do something that is necessary for the due and orderly conducting of a suit, or doing it in an unseasonable time or improper manner, and the like, may properly be regarded as irregularities which do not strike at the foundation of authority for the proceedings in which they occur, and will, therefore, be cured by subsequent judicial approval. As is said in Shields <em>v. </em>Miltenberger, 2 Harris 76, all the cases \u201c distinguish between those objections that touch the foundation of the proceeding, by impeaching the authority of the officer or establishing the existence of fraud, and those which simply suggest irregularities in the process or sale. The absence of authority or the presence of fraud utterly frustrates the operation of the sale as a means of transmission of title, and avoids it from the beginning. Either may be insisted on, even after the formal acknowledgment of the conveyance; but mere irregularities, whether of omission or commission, which do not render the officer powerless, or taint the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>transaction with turpitude, may be cured by the tacit acquiescence of those who ought to speak in time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Prior legislation as to the mode of service on registered owners, so far as it is inconsistent with the supplement of 1867, was in effect repealed thereby, and where it appears of record, as it does in this case, that the writ was not served \u201cas in the case of a summons,\u201d there is clearly a want of authority either to issue or execute the writ. The purchaser at such unauthorized sale cannot claim protection. The maxim, <em>caveat emptor, </em>is applicable to him. It is his duty to see that authority to sell exists. In this case an examination of the registry bureau would have informed the purchaser that the plaintiff in error had registered his lot, and the record of the proceeding, on which he bases his title, admonished him that there was n'o such service of the writ as the law required, and without which the sale was expressly forbidden. He was, therefore, visited with notice that the sale was unauthorized and void, and has no reason to complain that he took nothing by his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In Soullier <em>v. </em>Kern, 19 P. F. Smith 16, construction was given to the tenth section of the Act of April 16th 1840, Pamph. L. 314, which enacts, inter alia, that \u201cno property owned by minors shall be sold under the provisions of this act, until the expiration of two years from the time said minors shall come of age.\u201d A municipal claim for paving was filed against a lot owned by tenants in common, one of whom was a minor. After service of the scire facias, by posting and publication, judgment was obtained, and at a sale thereunder, the premises were purchased by the defendant, Kern, against whom an action of ejectment was brought by the owners. It was held, that while the sheriff\u2019s sale transferred the title of the adult owners, who were not within the protection of the statute, it did not divest the interest of the minor. Mr. Justice Williams, delivering the opinion of the court, said, \u201c The object of the legislature in passing the act was to protect the estates of minors and prevent their sacrifice at judicial sales. * * * There was evidence tending to show that one of the plaintiffs was a minor; and if so, under the provisions of the act, his interest was not divested by the sale; and the court should have submitted the ease to the jury with instructions that if they found he was a minor, at the time of the sale, then the sale, as respects his interest, was void, and he was entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In Sheetz et al. <em>v. </em>Wynkoop et al., 24 P. F. Smith 198; Kuntz <em>v. </em>Long, 6 Casey 501; Burd <em>v. </em>Dansdale, 2 Binn. 80; Allison <em>v. </em>Rheam, 3 S. &amp;. R. 139, and Berry <em>v. </em>Hamill, 12 Id. 211, principles somewhat analogous to that involved in the present case were recognised. It has been repeatedly held also, that a sheriff\u2019s sale, under a writ of fieri facias, without inquisition or waiver thereof, is simply void and passes no title to the purchaser: Baird <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>v. </em>Lent, 8 Watts 422; McLaughlin <em>v. </em>Shields, 2 Jones 283; Shoemaker <em>v. </em>Ballard, 3 Harris 92; Wolf et al. <em>v. </em>Payne, 11 Casey 97 ; Gardner <em>v. </em>Sisk, 4 P. F. Smith 506, and St. Bartholomew\u2019s Church <em>v. </em>Wood, 11 Id. 96. The main ground of these decisions is, that the law requiring an inquisition to be held was intended for the benefit of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">It has been suggested that great inconvenience and loss must result from inability to obtain service of the writ on non-resident owners, if it is required to be served as a summons. This may be so; but, if a remedy be needed, the power to provide it belongs to the legislature and not to the courts. Arguments from inconvenience should not be permitted to prevail against the positive prohibition of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment on the question of law reserved, is now entered here in favor of the defendant below, <em>non obstante veredicto.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
