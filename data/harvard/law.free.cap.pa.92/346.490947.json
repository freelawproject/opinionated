This was done with the consent of Ellis, as shown by a memorandum of agreement, dated April 29th 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-11\">A pluries fi. fa. was issued upon the same judgment to No. 114, June Term 1868, and levy made upon a lot in the city of Mead-ville, and also on the mill property in dispute, as the property of Edward Ellis and F. A. Howe. The first-mentioned property was sold for $4000, and the mill property was sold for $2110 to William Thorp, and the proceeds of the sale, except the costs, were paid to Thorp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-12\">At this sale, Thorp, by his attorney, gave notice, that the title being sold was the undivided one-half of the property known as the Red Mill property, and that Robert Hannah owned the other half, which is the property in dispute. This notice was repeated by the sheriff, and the bidders proceeded on the supposition that the notice was true; and it was alleged, Thorp thereby got the property at one-half the value of the whole property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-13\">At the trial, plaintiffs offered \u201cto prove by the testimony of A.

This, offered for the purpose of estopping Thorp from claiming that he obtained by virtue of that sheriff\u2019s sale, more than the undivided one-half of the property; and also for the purpose of showing, that he has no equities derived by or under that sale, available in this case as a defence to the payment of purchase-money in this suit. We propose to follow this by evidence, that the judgment was in fact paid by the sheriff\u2019s sale of the property of Dr. Ellis, made in January 1868, and by other sales made prior to this sale of the Red Mill property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Offer overruled as to all, excepting the offer to prove the judgment was satisfied.\u201d (Second assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-7\">The following were among the points of defendants, both of which the court affirmed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-8\">1. That under and by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s sale of June 8th 1868, under the judgment of Duffield, administrator of Crane <em>v. </em>Howe and Ellis, and the sheriff\u2019s deed made in pursuance\u00bb thereof, William Thorp acquired the legal title to the whole of . the premises in dispute, subject to the right of Robert Hannah or his heirs, to the undivided one-half thereof, upon the payment to said Thorp of the balance of the purchase-money due under the articles of agreement between Edward Ellis, and Howe, and Wilson, on the 21st day of February 1866, the date of the entry of the judgment on which said land was sold. (Tenth assignment.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-9\">4. That under all the evidence in this case, the verdict should be for the defendant. (Eleventh assignment.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-10\">In the general charge the court, inter alia, said :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-11\">\u201c Under that judgment the land was sold and purchased by William Thorp, who, so far as the legal effect is concerned, was an innocent purchaser without notice. There is no equitable defence against that judgment. That sale vested in Thorp a good title to the land. Thorp under that sale went into possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-12\">\u201c As to transfers afterwards, we think they have little to do with the case. We think that the holder of a legal or equitable interest by virtue of an outstanding agreement, whatever his equities may be upon that contract, or however much he might enforce them at law in an action upon this contract, cannot maintain an action of ejectment against the holder of a legal title in possession of the land.\u201d (Thirteenth assignment.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"At2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Verdict for defendants, and after judgment plaintiffs took this writ and alleged, inter alia, that the court erred as set forth in the above assignments of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-6\"><em>A.

The sale was void because the judgment had been previously fully paid by the sale of Edward Ellis\u2019s property in January 1868, and by the sale of the house and lot on Water street on the same day, but before the sale of the mill property, and William Thorp knew of its payment and had himself received the money from the sales by which its lien on the land was divested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-7\">A purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale with knowledge that the judgment has been satisfied acquires no title: Vide Hoffman <em>v. </em>Stroheckler, 7 Watts 86; also Gibbs <em>v. </em>Neely, Id. 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-8\">The plaintiffs further contend that if the sale was valid Thorp only bought an undivided one-half interest in the property, because, as the plaintiffs offered to prove, he attended the sale, with his attorney, and gave notice that they were selling only an undivided one-half interest, and that Robert Hannah owned the other undivided half interest, which notice was repeated by the sheriff, and the land was sold and stricken off to him with that understanding, for less than <em>the </em>value of the whole, and that he is thereby estopped from claiming more than the undivided one-half interest: Shultze <em>v. </em>Diehl, 2 P. &amp; W. 273; Eshbach <em>v. </em>Zimmerman, 2 Barr 315; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Moltz, 10 Id. 530.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-9\"><em>J.

The sale did not affect his rights. That sale could not prevent his heirs bringing suit to enforce the contract between Ellis and Wilson assigned to him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-7\">Mr. Justice Gordon</author>\n<p id=\"AtM\">delivered the opinion of the court, January 5th 1880. .</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">On the 21st of February 1866, when the Crane judgment was entered, it became a lien on the legal estate of Ellis which he held by virtue of his articles with Howe and Wilson, and upon the equity of Howe. When, therefore, Hannah bought Wilson\u2019s interest in the property he took subject to the Crane judgment to the extent of the purchase-money due from Wilson to Ellis \u2014 some $3000. Hannah paid this money to Ellis, and entitled himself to a deed from Ellis, which, however, was never executed, probably because of the encumbrance above mentioned. Then, at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale, matters stood thus: Ellis, having extinguished Howe\u2019s interest, owned one-half of the property and Hannah owned the other half; both shares being subject to the lien, as above stated. The1 utmost, therefore, that the purchaser could take by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s sale was the fee in one-half of the premises and the legal estate in the other half. By virtue of this legal title he could enforce the payment, or rather repayment of the purchase-money from Hannah, but his right of possession extended only to one-half of the property. Wilson bought Hannah\u2019s interest by articles of agreement dated March 17th 1870, agreeing to pay him, therefore, the sum of $2500 in five payments. Thus, Hannah, in turn, stood as vendor of Wilson and could have enforced payment by ejectment. I suppose it will not be doubted but that had any one but Thorp, in whom was the legal title, bought Wilson\u2019s interest, he would have been liable for the purchase-money due Hannah, and that payment might have been enforced as above stated. But why was Thorp, after his purchase of Wilson\u2019s interest, in a better position ? As owner of the legal title, he was not entitled to the possession of Hannah\u2019s half that he obtained through Wilson, and in order to hold it against Hannah he must pay as Wilson had agreed to pay. The only difficulty in the way of thus enforcing this agreement against Thorp is, if he, by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s sale, was entitled to that interest in the property which was bound by the lien of the Crane judgment, then he had some $3000 of the original agreement between Ellis and Wilson which he might recover against the amount due on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the Hannah articles, and as he could thus more than cover that amount, an action against him would be fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">After all then, the main and perhaps the only question of the case is, what did Thorp acquire by the sheriff\u2019s sale ? The answer to this is, if we take the plaintiff\u2019s offer, as we are bound to do, as proved, nothing more than Ellis\u2019s interest, the fee in one-half of the property and the bare legal title at most in the other half. He caused notice to be given at the sheriff\u2019s sale that what was to be sold was the one undivided half part of the Red Mill property, that the other half belonged to Robert Hannah. Under this notice'\u2019 the sale was made, for it was repeated by the sheriff, and under and subject to that notice he bought. By it of course Hannah was thrown out; it left him no interest to protect, and hence he would give no further attention to the sale. Moreover, in this manner Thorp got the property for less than the value of the Hannah equity, and if he holds that equity he gets the other half for nothing. But to permit him now to enjoy the benefit of that equity, would be to permit him to commit a gross fraud upon the rights of Hannah. It is indeed not controverted that the sheriff\u2019s sale would, of itself, have vested in Thorp whatever was covered by the Crane judgment, the limitation or restriction of the effect of that sale arises from Thorp\u2019s own act, and by that act he is bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">It would not do to allow a purchaser to control an official sale, make what representations he pleased, in order to cheapen the property, and then, after he has obtained the property, on his own terms and at his own price, permit him to shelter himself from his own fraud under the technical rules applicable to such sale. Legal rules and precepts were not intended to furnish skulking places for fraud, and he who buys property, at an official sale, through a trick or misrepresentation, must not expect to hold it through the help of the courts: Buchanan <em>v. </em>Moore, 13 S. &amp; R. 304; Miller <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 P. F. Smith 16; McCaskey v. Graff, 11 Harris 321; Walter <em>v. </em>Gernant, 1 Id. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">It is more than probable that Thorp intended nothing wrong when he made, or caused to be made, the representations at the sheriff\u2019s sale; no doubt he thought the levy included only the one-half of the property, and that the sale should be limited to that. But none the less did those representations cheapen the property; none the less was he benefited thereby, and none the less was Hannah thrown off his guard. If then we regard him as innocent of any evil intention,'nevertheless as the question will then be one of a loss between two innocent persons, that loss must fall upon him who occasioned it. Furthermore, Thorp loses nothing, since he got all he bargained for, and however innocent he may have been, when he caused the representations to be made, his effort now to turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>them to his own profit, to the detriment of Hannah\u2019s estate is fraudulent: Kelly <em>v. </em>Abers, 16 S. &amp; R. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The foregoing sustains the plaintiff\u2019s second, tenth, eleventh and thirteenth assignments of error. We observe nothing else requiring correction. Of course, if the Crane judgment was satisfied at the time Thorp bought, and he knew of that fact, the sale was worthless and he took nothing thereby; but as we understand the oourt\u2019s ruling, the plaintiffs were permitted to show this if they could; if so, they have nothing of which to complain in this particular. We may further remark that, as this was an ejectment for the purpose of enforcing the payment of purchase-moitey, it was well brought by the administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The judgment is reversed and a new venire ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
