Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316664\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/438/\">\n    773 F.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2014). Martoma asserts that, under\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   , evidence that the tipper made a gift of inside information to a trading relative or friend establishes a \"personal benefit\" only if tipper and tippee share a \"meaningfully close personal relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316664\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/438/\">\n    773 F.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Martoma contends that the jury instructions were flawed because they did not qualify that evidence of a gift to a trading relative or friend establishes a personal benefit only where there is a \"meaningfully close personal relationship.\" Second, Martoma argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain a conviction under any theory of personal benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We agree that the jury instructions are inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   , though not for the reasons Martoma advances.\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   held that a personal benefit in the form of \"a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , requires proof that the tipper and tippee shared what the decision called a \"meaningfully close personal relationship,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316664\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/438/\">\n    773 F.3d at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained that this standard \"requires evidence of 'a relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   from the latter, or an intention to benefit the [latter].' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316664\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/438/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, Martoma's jury instructions were erroneous, not because they omitted the term \"meaningfully close personal relationship,\" but because they allowed the jury to find a personal benefit in the form of a \"gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend\" without requiring the jury to find either that tipper and tippee shared a relationship suggesting a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   or that the tipper gifted confidential information with the intention to benefit the tippee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We nonetheless conclude that this instructional error did not affect Martoma's substantial rights. At trial, the government presented compelling evidence that at least one tipper received a different type of personal benefit from disclosing inside information: $70,000 in \"consulting fees.\" This evidence establishes the existence of a relationship suggesting a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   between the tipper and tippee. For this reason, Martoma's challenge to the sufficiency of the personal-benefit evidence fails. Moreover, the government presented sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that at least one tipper received a personal benefit by disclosing inside information with the intention to benefit Martoma. Accordingly, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Martoma's convictions stem from an insider trading scheme involving securities of two pharmaceutical companies, Elan Corporation, plc (\"Elan\") and Wyeth, that were jointly developing an experimental drug called bapineuzumab to treat Alzheimer's disease. Martoma worked as a\n   portfolio manager at S.A.C. Capital Advisors (\"SAC\"), a hedge fund owned and managed by Steven A. Cohen. In that capacity, Martoma managed an investment portfolio with buying power of between $400 and $500 million that was focused on pharmaceutical and healthcare companies. He also recommended investments to Cohen, who managed SAC's largest portfolio. While at SAC, Martoma began to acquire shares in Elan and Wyeth in his portfolio and recommended that Cohen acquire shares in the companies as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In order to obtain information about bapineuzumab, Martoma contacted expert networking firms and arranged paid consultations with doctors knowledgeable about Alzheimer's disease, including two who were working on the bapineuzumab clinical trial. Dr. Sidney Gilman, chair of the safety monitoring committee for the bapineuzumab clinical trial, participated in approximately 43 consultations with Martoma at the rate of around $1,000 per hour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a member of the safety monitoring committee, Dr. Gilman had an obligation to keep the results of the clinical trial confidential. His consulting contract reiterated that he was not to disclose any confidential information in a consultation. He nevertheless provided Martoma, whom he knew to be an investment manager seeking information to help make securities trading decisions, with confidential updates on the drug's safety that he received during meetings of the safety monitoring committee. Dr. Gilman also shared with Martoma the dates of upcoming safety monitoring committee meetings, which allowed Martoma to schedule consultations with Dr. Gilman shortly after each one. Another consultant, Dr. Joel Ross, one of the principal investigators on the clinical trial, met with Martoma on many occasions between 2006 and July 2008 and charged approximately $1,500 per hour. Like Dr. Gilman, Dr. Ross had an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information about the bapineuzumab clinical trial. Nevertheless, during their consultations, Dr. Ross provided Martoma with information about the clinical trial, including information about his patients' responses to the drug and the total number of participants in the study, that Dr. Ross recognized was not public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 17, 2008, Elan and Wyeth issued a press release regarding the results of \"Phase II\" of the bapineuzumab clinical trial. The press release described the preliminary results as \"encouraging,\" with \"clinically meaningful benefits in important subgroups\" of Alzheimer's patients with certain genetic characteristics, but indicated that the drug had not proven effective in the general population of Alzheimer's patients. J.A. 547. The press release further stated that the results of the trials would be presented in greater detail at the International Conference on Alzehimer's Disease to be held on July 29, 2008. Elan's share price increased following the press release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In mid-July of 2008, the sponsors of the bapineuzumab trial selected Dr. Gilman to present the results at the July 29 conference. It was only at this point that Dr. Gilman was unblinded as to the final efficacy results of the trial. Dr. Gilman was \"initially euphoric\" about the results, but identified \"two major weaknesses in the data\" that called into question the efficacy of the drug as compared to the placebo. Tr. 1419-20. On July 17, 2008, the day after being unblinded to the results, Dr. Gilman spoke with Martoma for about 90\n   minutes by telephone about what he had learned. That same day, Martoma purchased a plane ticket to see Dr. Gilman in person at his office in Ann Arbor, Michigan. That meeting occurred two days later, on July 19, 2008. At that meeting, Dr. Gilman showed Martoma a PowerPoint presentation containing the efficacy results and discussed the data with him in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The next morning, Sunday, July 20, Martoma sent Cohen, the owner of SAC, an email with \"It's important\" in the subject line and asked to speak with him by telephone. The two had a telephone conversation lasting about twenty minutes, after which Martoma emailed Cohen a summary of SAC's Elan and Wyeth holdings. The day after Martoma spoke to Cohen, on July 21, 2008, SAC began to reduce its position in Elan and Wyeth securities and entered into short-sale and options trades that would be profitable if Elan's and Wyeth's stock fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Gilman publicly presented the final results from the bapineuzumab trial at the International Conference on Alzehimer's Disease in the afternoon of July 29, 2008. Elan's share price began to decline during Dr. Gilman's presentation and at the close of trading the next day, the share prices of Elan's and Wyeth had declined by about 42% and 12%, respectively. The trades that Martoma and Cohen made in advance of the announcement resulted in approximately $80.3 million in gains and $194.6 million in averted losses for SAC. Martoma personally received a $9 million bonus based in large part on his trading activity in Elan and Wyeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At Martoma's trial, the district court instructed the jury on the personal benefit element of insider trading law as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   If you find that Dr. Gilman or Dr. Ross disclosed material, non-public information to Mr. Martoma, you must then determine whether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr. Gilman and Dr. Ross received or anticipated receiving some personal benefit, direct or indirect, from disclosing the material, non-public information at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The benefit may, but need not be, financial or tangible in nature; it could include obtaining some future advantage, developing or maintaining a business contact or a friendship, or enhancing the tipper's reputation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A finding as to benefit should be based on all the objective facts and inferences presented in the case. You may find that Dr. Gilman or Dr. Ross received a direct or indirect personal benefit from providing inside information to Mr. Martoma if you find that Dr. Gilman or Dr. Ross gave the information to Mr. Martoma with the intention of benefiting themselves in some manner, or with the intention of conferring a benefit on Mr. Martoma, or as a gift with the goal of maintaining or developing a personal friendship or a useful networking contact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Tr. 3191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Martoma was convicted and while his appeal was pending, this Court decided\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The defendant, relying on\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   , urged the Supreme Court to hold that a \" 'gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend' \" is insufficient to establish insider trading liability \"unless the tipper's goal in disclosing inside information [wa]s to obtain money, property, or something of tangible value.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607883\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/420/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607883\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/420/\">\n    at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

For example, suppose a tipper discloses inside information to a perfect stranger and says, in effect, you can make a lot of money by trading on this.

The dissent would evidently have there be proof of something more concrete. However, as we have explained, it is settled law that personal benefits may be indirect and intangible and need not be pecuniary at all. The tipper's intention to benefit the tippee proves a breach of fiduciary duty because it demonstrates that the tipper improperly used inside information for personal ends and thus lacked a legitimate corporate purpose. That is precisely what, under\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   , the personal benefit element is designed to test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dissent, op. at 86. We disagree. That rationale would justify a personal benefit in the form of a relationship suggesting an intention to benefit both tipper and tippee, from which it is straightforward to infer that the tipper personally benefited from the tip. But what\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   in fact refers to is an intention to benefit the tippee alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whichever way\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   is read, it recognizes that purposely benefitting the tippee with inside information proves that the tipper has received a personal\n   benefit in breach of a fiduciary duty. The question is whether\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   requires that to be proved with evidence of a relationship or not. We think it clear that the answer is no. And although few reported decisions have relied on the intent to benefit theory, its legitimacy has until today been uncontroversial. To take an example close to home, it featured in the jury instructions in this very case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 3191, and no objection was raised, nor was any challenge to this language pressed on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, we are warned that this approach creates a \"subjective\" test and allows for convictions based on sheer speculation into the tipper's motives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dissent, op. at 83-84, 88. These fears are unwarranted. Intent elements are everywhere in our law and are generally proved with circumstantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Heras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3690928\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/101/#p106\">\n    609 F.3d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 (2d Cir. 2010) (\"The law has long recognized that criminal intent may be proved by circumstantial evidence alone.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Insider trading is no different. A factfinder may infer the tipper intended to benefit the tippee from the sort of objective evidence that is commonly offered in insider trading cases. To return to the example above, the statement \"you can make a lot of money by trading on this\" is strong circumstantial evidence of the tipper's intention to benefit the tippee. And the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt remains a formidable barrier to convictions resting on speculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And as is clear from the purpose of the personal benefit element, the \"broad definition of personal benefit set forth in\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   ,\" and the variety of benefits we have upheld, the evidentiary \"bar is not a high one.\"\n   <em>\n    Obus\n   </em>\n   , 693 F.3d at 292.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The central question in\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   was an issue of scienter on which our district courts had been split: whether a tippee must be aware, not only that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing inside information, but also that the tipper received a personal benefit.\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316664\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/438/\">\n    773 F.3d at 447-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The instructions allowed the jury to find a personal benefit based solely on the conclusion that Dr. Gilman tipped Martoma in order to \"develop[ ] or maintain[ ] ... a friendship.\" Under\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   , this articulation of the gift theory is incomplete. A properly instructed jury would have been informed that it could find a personal benefit based on a \"gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend\" only if it also found that Dr. Gilman and Martoma shared a relationship suggesting a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   or that Dr. Gilman intended to benefit Martoma with the inside information.

Dr. Gilman, over the course of approximately 18 months and 43 paid consultation sessions for which he billed $1,000 an hour, regularly and intentionally provided Martoma with confidential information from the bapineuzumab clinical trial. Martoma kept coming back, specifically scheduling consultation sessions so that they would occur shortly after the safety monitoring committee meetings, when Dr. Gilman would have new information to pass along. Starting at least in August 2007, Dr. Gilman would reschedule his conversations with Martoma if he had no new information to reveal at the time they were scheduled to meet.

And because Martoma continued to see Dr. Gilman to receive confidential information, Dr. Gilman continued to receive consulting fees. The fact that Dr. Gilman did not specifically bill for his July 17 and 19, 2008 conversations with Martoma in which Dr. Gilman divulged the final drug efficacy data is also of no moment because, as he admitted at trial, doing so \"would [have been] tantamount to confessing that [he] was ... giving [Martoma] inside information.\" Tr. 1918.

Last year, my colleagues filed an opinion in this matter in which they abrogated our prior decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Newman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316664\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/438/\">\n    773 F.3d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452 (2d Cir. 2014). They declared that a non-insider could be convicted of insider trading on a gift theory even if she did not have a meaningfully close personal relationship with the insider from whom she received the confidential information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Applying this reasoning to the case at hand, they held that the jury instructions permissibly allowed for conviction based on speculation about Dr. Gilman's desire to be friends with Martoma. I dissented from that opinion because it improperly abrogated a prior panel decision without en banc review or an intervening Supreme Court precedent, undermined the personal benefit rule central to holding corporate outsiders liable for insider trading, and approved of a conviction based on erroneous jury instructions that affected Martoma's substantial rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   My colleagues now issue a modified opinion. In it, they purport to agree that our precedent prevents a jury from being charged with inferring that a tip was given as a gift unless it finds that there was a meaningfully close personal relationship between the tipper and the tippee. They no longer disclaim\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   . They even agree that the jury instructions were in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   But these apparent concessions are semantic rather than substantial. My colleagues also attempt to redefine \"meaningfully close personal relationship\" in subjective rather than objective terms, rendering\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   a relic. To provide support for this move, they improperly construe binding authority. They then hold that the erroneous jury instructions were harmless since the jury could have convicted based on a different theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The majority's attempt to undercut the meaningfully close personal relationship requirement is in derogation of circuit precedent and unnecessary to arrive at their disposition. Only by abrogating\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   could my colleagues announce a new rule that a jury can infer a personal benefit based on a freestanding \"intention to benefit\" and that this \"intention to benefit\" is at the core of the meaningfully close\n   personal relationship standard. Op. at 74-76, 77. Today's opinion must be interpreted consistently with the rule that, as a three-judge panel, we are unable to abrogate prior circuit decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zarnel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775616,3778998\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/619/156/\">\n    619 F.3d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 168 (2d Cir. 2010) (\"This panel is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court or by the Supreme Court.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   and a consistent line of cases preceding it make clear that a meaningfully close personal relationship cannot be proven without objective evidence about the nature of the tipper-tippee relationship.

Absent objective evidence, a slip of the tongue might be presented to a jury as a purposeful tip with a good cover story, an off-the-record comment to a trusted reporter might be portrayed as a means of bribing a journalist for favorable coverage. The difference between guilty and innocent conduct would be a matter of speculation into what a tippee knew or should have known about the tipper's intent. A trader, journalist, or analyst attempting to avoid running afoul of criminal law would have little to guide her behavior. The conservative thing to do would be to avoid seeking inside information too aggressively, even if the whole\n   market could benefit from such investigation. Those who decided to cultivate insider sources would risk prosecution in any case, so they might have fewer scruples about compensating their sources and trading on the information they purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   What does objective evidence of a personal benefit consist of? In the easiest case, a tippee has paid the insider for the coveted tidbit. If the government can adduce evidence indicating that money changed hands, it has established all of the objective facts needed to infer that an insider personally benefitted by tipping. In the presence of an obvious quid pro quo, no further facts about the nature of the tipper-tippee relationship will be needed.

Now they hold that an uncompensated tip can be found to personally benefit the tipper so long as the jury were to concludes that the tipper intended to benefit the tippee. Op. at 74-76, 77. All that\n   \"meaningfully close personal relationship\" means, they inform us, is a tipper-tippee pairing in which the tipper has such an intention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263778\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/58/#p69\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263778\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/58/#p69\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This interpretation would eliminate the rule that has been with us since\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   that the government must prove objective facts indicating that the tipper benefitted from her relationship with the tippee. On the majority's proposal, the prosecution could pile up insinuations about the tipper's subjective understanding of the purpose of the tip, and the jury would be charged with resting their inferences about her benefit on those wobbly foundations. The only objective facts the government would have to prove would be the communication of material non-public information. All of the protections of the personal benefit rule-a clear guide for conduct, preventing liability for slip ups and other innocent disclosures-would erode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is good news, then, that binding precedent stands for the opposite principle. The only time\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   refers to an \"intention to benefit\" is when it discusses the need to prove \"a\n   <em>\n    relationship\n   </em>\n   between the insider and the recipient\n   <em>\n    that suggests\n   </em>\n   ...an intention to benefit the particular recipient.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Thus, we did not find that a freestanding \"intention to benefit\" would have been sufficient to prove Downe's personal benefit. Instead, we followed the principle that an intention to benefit can only be inferred from objective facts about the nature of the relationship between tipper and tippee. Again, the majority extracts the phrase \"intention to benefit\" from its context, suggesting that the relationship between tipper and tippee did not matter when it was the central focus of our inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The majority offers an alternative interpretation in which the sentence at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   \"effectively reads, 'there may be a relationship between the insider and the\n   recipient that suggests a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   from the latter, or there may be an intention to benefit the particular recipient.' \" Op. at 74. Perhaps one could read the sentence in that way in isolation, but doing so would certainly not be \"more consonant with\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   as a whole\" or with the subsequent case law relying on\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709200\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/42/#p48\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   court included that sentence to provide examples of \"objective facts and circumstances that often justify...an inference\" that \"the insider receive[d] a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is difficult to understand why the Court would have mentioned an intention to benefit, which is a subjective fact, as an example of a personal benefit, which is an objective fact. Nearly as difficult to understand is why the\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   court would have provided an intention to benefit a\n   <em>\n    tippee\n   </em>\n   as an example of a benefit to the\n   <em>\n    tipper\n   </em>\n   . Intending to benefit somebody is not in itself a benefit. That is, not unless one has reason to believe that the person with the intention to benefit benefits from the beneficiary's benefit or one adopts the trivializing view of human psychology wherein everything any individual does is to benefit herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Perhaps the majority's theory is that an intention to benefit a tippee is circumstantial evidence that a tipper is receiving some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   benefit by providing the information. On this theory, so long as objective evidence would allow a jury to infer that a tipper intended to benefit the tippee, the jury should be allowed to infer from that inference that the tipper somehow benefitted by benefitting the tippee without actually having to determine what that benefit might be. This theory fails to deal with the fact that an intention to benefit is not itself an \"objective fact or circumstance,\" as\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   requires, but rather an\n   <em>\n    inference drawn from\n   </em>\n   objective facts or circumstances. Additionally, this theory makes it difficult to understand why the\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   court would have adopted the personal benefit test in the first place. If a jury can conclude that a tipper breached his duty so long as it concludes that she intended to benefit the tippee, why should it have to go through the tortuous process of concluding that the tipper received a personal benefit based on its conclusion that the tipper intended to benefit the tippee? Why should we care about the tipper's benefit at all?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   At times the majority seems to suggest that\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   does not really require proof of a personal benefit. Rather, the personal benefit test is mentioned merely as a guide to prosecutors regarding the sort of evidence that will help them establish the tipper's intention to benefit the tippee. Thus, when\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   says that \"a breach of duty...depends in large part on the purpose of the disclosure,\" it is announcing the\n   <em>\n    real\n   </em>\n   test for a breach of the duty to shareholders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Identifying personal benefits is...simply how courts and juries analyze breaches of\" this duty.

Unlike a standalone intention to benefit, a relationship suggesting an intention to benefit provides reason to believe that the tipper benefits by benefitting, since the tipper is understood as contributing to a relationship from which both tipper and tippee benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 83. And the focus on relationships rather than bare intentions fits neatly with\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   's cabining of the gift theory to disclosures to \"trading relative[s] or friend[s].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   This cannot be so, my colleagues protest.

Wouldn't it be absurd if this perfect stranger could not be held liable for insider trading if he went ahead and traded on this information? No, it would not be. At least, not if one takes the personal benefit rule seriously. Ex hypothesi, the fictional tipper in their scenario receives absolutely nothing in return for his disclosure, except, I suppose, the warmth that comes with knowing that somebody else might have made some money because of his actions (or perhaps the schadenfreude that comes with knowing that shareholders were defrauded). But if those sorts of \"benefits\" were enough, then every disclosure of inside information without affirmative indication of a pure heart would be presumptively beneficial to the tipper.\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   rejected that possibility, and every appellate court to have considered the issue, including us, has consistently done the same.

A properly instructed jury would have instead been asked whether Dr. Gilman and Martoma shared a relationship suggesting a quid pro quo or were close enough friends that it would be reasonable to understand Dr. Gilman's provision of information to Martoma as a gift. The jury could not conclude that their relationship was meaningfully close based on the mere possibility of a future friendship. Nor could it make a relationship-independent inference about Dr. Gilman's intentions, contrary to the majority's dicta. That is because\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of the gift theory\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   \"require[ ] proof that Dr. Gilman and Martoma share[d] any type of personal relationship.\" Op. at 78 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Moreover, I disagree that the error in the jury instructions was harmless.

Recording of Oral Argument at 34:18-34:27,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Martoma\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-3599 (2d Cir. Oct. 28, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   A reasonable jury could also have doubted whether the relationship between Dr. Gilman and Martoma suggested a quid pro quo. Dr. Gilman took no payment for the consulting sessions in which he provided the inside information at issue here, and there is no evidence in the record that his compensation before or after that session was higher than usual. He was in high demand as an expert and a researcher, so\n   there is reason to doubt that he would have risked prosecution just to keep up his consulting relationship with SAC and Martoma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1552-60. A reasonable jury\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   found a relationship suggesting a quid pro quo, but it was not\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to. Ruling otherwise would lead to the holding that whenever inside information is revealed within a paid consulting relationship where other, legitimate services are rendered, a fact-finder must infer that the insider was paid to breach his duties. That rule would allow convictions for erroneously revealed information or for information revealed based on a misunderstanding about its materiality or its confidentiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Because the jury instructions amount to reversible error, I would not reach the sufficiency of the evidence question. But even were the majority correct that there was sufficient evidence here, it is incorrect and ill-advised to go on to speculate that the jury could have inferred an intention to benefit merely because \"a corporate insider...deliberately disclos[ed] valuable, confidential information without a corporate purpose and with the expectation that the tippee will trade on it.\" Op. at 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In addition to undermining\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   in the manner already discussed, this musing flirts with the possibility that the personal benefit test that goes back to\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   may no longer be good law. The very reason the government must establish a personal benefit is to allow for the possible conclusion that the insider provided information without a \"corporate purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655 n.14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the government can put forward evidence that an insider did not have a corporate purpose in order to establish that the insider personally benefitted from providing the information, it can convict based on circular reasoning. \"Personal benefit\" would then no longer have any independent meaning. The government would need only convince the jury to \"read [the tipper's] mind[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    463 U.S. at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p660\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The tipper would need not have benefitted in any objective sense so long as the prosecution could convince a jury that she was not thinking of the corporation's interest.\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   stands for the opposite proposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Setting our disagreement about the harmfulness of the district court's error to one side, my colleagues could have reached the conclusion they did by following the path our precedent provides. They need only have held that the jury instructions were erroneous because they allowed for conviction absent objective evidence of a meaningfully close personal relationship but harmless because there was objective evidence of a relationship suggesting a quid pro quo. Instead, they have taken a detour to declare that subjective evidence could have worked as well.
