Brazilian politicians and corporate executives also saw an opportunity and set up a scheme to make illegal use-including payment of bribes and kickbacks-of investors' money. The eventual revelation of the corruption produced the largest political scandal in modern Brazilian history. In light of the scandal, banks were no longer willing to make loans for the oil-extraction project, which collapsed, taking the American fund's money with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Behind the project-and at least some of the corruption-was Petroleo Brasileiro, S.A. (Petrobras), Brazil's state-owned oil company. The jurisdiction of U.S. courts\n   over claims against foreign states and their \"instrumentalities,\" like Petrobras, is limited by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1604 - 1606, so we must determine whether Petrobras's alleged fraud \"caused a direct effect in the United States,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201330\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1605(a)(2).

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2006 Petrobras discovered an estimated 50 billion barrels of undersea oil off the coast of Brazil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although costly to extract, the sheer size of the deposit was tantalizing not only to the Brazilian state-which had a direct economic interest in the find through Petrobras, the state-owned oil company-but to investors around the world. Petrobras soon formed a foreign-investment venture to build 28 specialized \"drill ships\" at a cost of more than $700 million apiece. The business plan for the venture, named Sete Brasil Participa\u00e7\u00f5es, S.A. (Sete), called for equity investment of around 7.9 billion Brazilian Reais ($2.19 billion at today's exchange rates), with approximately 4.6 per cent of that coming from Petrobras itself. The remainder of the ships' cost was to be debt-financed through third-party lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To attract foreign investment, Brazilian law provides tax incentives through special partnerships known as Fundos de Investimento em Participa\u00e7\u00f5es, or FIPs. Petrobras created FIP Sondas to facilitate foreign investment in the Sete project. Petrobras specifically targeted U.S. investors for Sete, Joint Appendix (JA) 25, including EIG Management Company, LLC (EIG), a Washington, D.C.-based private equity fund. Petrobras disseminated in the United States, including to EIG, a presentation called \"The Drilling Rigs Project: Petrobras'[s] Strategy for its Successful Implementation.\" JA26. The presentation contained a \"Cautionary Statement for US Investors,\" referencing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules governing oil and gas investment. JA26-27. Another document disseminated by Petrobras in the United States, titled \"Pre-Salt Oil Rigs Project,\" \"discussed the Sete investment premise and touted that Sete would have 'management with extensive experience in the market.' \" JA27-28. A third document \"promoting investment in Sete\" was sent to EIG by a putative Petrobras agent nearly a year after the first two documents circulated. JA28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petrobras and Sete executives also met with EIG executives in the United States at least twice. At one meeting, in Houston, Texas, Sete CEO Jo\u00e3o Carlos de Medeiro Ferraz (Ferraz) \"offered rosy descriptions of Sete and its business prospects.\" JA29. At another, in Washington, D.C., Ferraz addressed a conference of EIG employees and investors and \"informed [them] that Sete expected drillship charter revenue 'of almost $90 billion [in] the next 20 years.' \" JA30 (second alteration in original). EIG employees twice traveled to Brazil to meet with Petrobras representatives, and Petrobras or Sete corresponded extensively with EIG leading up to EIG's investment, through written memoranda, presentations, telephone calls and emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   EIG ultimately invested $221 million in FIP Sondas between August 2012 and May 2013, on behalf of eight funds under\n   its management. Six of the eight EIG funds were based in Delaware but the other two were based in the Cayman Islands, which Brazil has designated as a tax haven. Because investors from designated tax havens are ineligible for the tax incentives provided FIP investments, EIG formed EIG Sete Parent SARL (EIG Sete Parent), a Luxembourg corporation, which in turn formed EIG Sete Holdings SARL (EIG Sete Holdings), also a Luxembourg corporation. EIG's investment in Sete therefore flowed from the eight funds to EIG Sete Parent, to EIG Sete Holdings, to FIP Sondas and, ultimately, to Sete itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Brazilian prosecutors' \"Operation Car Wash\" became public in 2014. The multi-year investigation uncovered extensive corruption in the Brazilian government, including Petrobras, and in the private-sector oil industry, including Sete. To date, prosecutors have obtained 93 convictions against officials engaged in a bribery and kickback scheme going back to at least 1997. Among the guilty were senior executives at Sete, including Ferraz, EIG's primary contact at Petrobras and Sete. A 30-year employee of Petrobras, Ferraz became the chief executive of Sete sometime before the spring of 2013, when he met with EIG in Houston. Ferraz was EIG's primary contact regarding its Sete investment, first, while he was at Petrobras and, later, when he was Sete CEO. In testimony given to an investigative panel of the Brazilian Congress in 2015, Ferraz explained that \"[t]he capital market in the United States, in particular, loves [Sete's] type of business. They very much like the prospects of financing drilling rigs, despite the risks involved.\" JA233. And so, Ferraz testified, \"[t]here was great market interest [in Sete], particularly among US private equity groups\" such as EIG. JA218. Another Sete executive, chief operating officer Pedro Jos\u00e9 Barusco, testified to the Brazilian Congress that he and Ferraz had taken \"the initiative to create Sete Brasil\" and that \"the establishment of bribe amounts ... was a continuity [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] of what happened in Petrobras.\" JA23, JA31 (compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As the scandal of Operation Car Wash enveloped Sete and Petrobras, skittish lenders withdrew their support from the drill ships project. Because the project was highly leveraged by design, the loss of debt financing made it impossible to proceed with construction. Facing insolvency, Sete declared bankruptcy. Investors, including EIG, were left with nothing but worthless shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   EIG sued Petrobras and the other defendants in district court, alleging counts of fraud, aiding and abetting fraud and civil conspiracy to commit fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petrobras moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petrobras asserted that, as an instrumentality of the Brazilian state, it is immune from suit on EIG's claims under the FSIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court denied Petrobras's motion to dismiss, concluding that EIG's claims fall within the FSIA's commercial activity exception to foreign-state immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    EIG Energy Fund XIV, L.P. v.

Although EIG argued that each of the three clauses of the commercial-activity exception applied, the district court relied on the third clause only, which clause grants jurisdiction over claims \"based upon ... an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The district court reasoned that EIG's injury \"occurred at the time Petrobras successfully induced [it] to invest in the Petrobras-Sete project,\" which injury \"occurred, at least in part, in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274550\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/52/#p72\">\n    246 F.Supp.3d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the court concluded that EIG's injury occurred in the United States, it rejected Petrobras's argument that EIG's structuring its investment through its Luxembourg subsidiaries-that is, EIG Sete Parent and EIG Sete Holding-constituted an \"intervening event[ ]\" that made EIG's U.S. injuries \"indirect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274550\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/52/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, the district court found that \"Petrobras did not merely establish Sete\" but \" 'installed its own former employees'-including the architects of Sete and the bribe scheme, Ferraz and Barusco-for the purpose of continuing the corrupt enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274550\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/52/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Pl.'s am. compl. 12). Therefore, it was irrelevant to the court's analysis that Sete, not Petrobras, made the misrepresentations that immediately preceded EIG's decision to invest: \"Sete's deceptive conduct, occurring only after it grabbed the baton from Petrobras, is not the kind of 'independent' third-party action that breaks the causal chain between Petrobras'[s] own misrepresentations and [EIG's] injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274550\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/52/#p72\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petrobras timely appealed the denial of its motion under Rule 12(b)(1), invoking our interlocutory appellate jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jungquist v.

It may well be-although we need not decide today-that a U.S. locus is sufficient (but not necessary) to establish jurisdiction under the FSIA. The inverse, however, is not true: a foreign locus does not always mean that a tort causes no \"direct effect\" in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To our knowledge no court has held otherwise.

There is no basis to treat EIG's investment loss differently from the failure to deposit scheduled interest payments in New York bank accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Petrobras's commercial activity in Brazil caused a direct effect in the United States, including a direct effect on EIG. Accordingly, Petrobras is not immune from EIG's suit and the district court's order denying dismissal is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sentelle, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While I respect my colleagues' careful and well-constructed opinion, I nonetheless remain unconvinced that the courts of the United States have jurisdiction over this matter under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\n   Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1604 - 1606. While I agree with my colleagues that plaintiffs-appellees have established that the acts of the Brazilian agency may have \"effects\" in the United States, the controlling issue in the case is whether they have shown\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   effects. As that is the sole controlling issue in the case, I will not belabor or contest the majority's statement of the facts, but will deal only with that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As the majority correctly reasons, Petrobras, an instrumentality of the government of Brazil, \" 'is presumptively immune from the jurisdiction of United States courts; unless a specified exception applies, a federal court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim against a foreign state.' \" Maj. Op. at 344 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Saudi Arabia v. Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229496\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/349/#p355\">\n    507 U.S. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229496\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/349/#p355\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6229496\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/349/#p355\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) ). The statutory exception relied upon by appellee and the majority arises from a provision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). In relevant part, that statute provides jurisdiction to the courts of the United States over a case involving a commercial activity that \"causes a\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   effect in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). While the court sets forth an impressive analysis of the causation of the effects, that is not sufficient. The statute requires a\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   effect. It is \"one of the most basic\" canons of statutory interpretation that \"a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Corley v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653414\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/303/#p314\">\n    556 U.S. 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653414\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/303/#p314\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653414\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/303/#p314\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). The adjective \"direct\" is as much a provision of the statute as the noun \"effects.\" We must assume that Congress intended each word to carry its plain and usual meaning. The failure of Sete as described in the majority opinion obviously had effects. Were those effects direct ones in the United States? It is not apparent that they were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As the majority notes, the EIG Funds formed EIG Sete Parent SARL as a Luxembourg corporation. The Luxembourg corporation formed EIG Sete Holdings SARL, also a Luxembourg corporation. EIG Sete Holdings invested $221 million in FIP Sondas, a Brazilian partnership, which ultimately invested the funds in Petrobras. Thus, the investments, the loss of which constituted the harmful effects of the failure of Sete, flowed from the EIG Funds to EIG Sete Parent, to EIG Sete Holdings, to FIP Sondas, and only ultimately to Sete itself. The effects in the United States of the alleged tortious conduct in Brazil, therefore, were at least three steps removed. This does not seem to comport with normal understandings of \"direct,\" which is defined as \"stemming immediately from a source.\"\n   <em>\n    Direct\n   </em>\n   , MERRIAM-WEBSTERDICTIONARY , http://www.MerriamWebster.com/dictionary/direct (last visited June 19, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   None of the cases cited by appellee or relied upon by the majority provide a basis for concluding that those effects were \"direct\" in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Odhiambo v. Republic of Kenya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183378,4111111\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/31/\">\n    764 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2014), as the majority discusses, concerned a rejection of FSIA jurisdiction on the lack of a place of performance clause in a contract. Maj. Op. at 347-48. While the majority is correct that this does not mandate the rejection of jurisdiction in the present case, it certainly does nothing to establish the directness of effects warranting the assumption of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1605(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Similarly, as the majority again notes, the Second Circuit's assertion that \"some financial loss from a foreign tort cannot, standing alone, suffice to trigger the exception,\"\n   <em>\n    Antares Aircraft, L.P. v. Fed. Rep. of Nigeria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11950933\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/33/#p36\">\n    999 F.2d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36 (2d Cir. 1993), may not mandate rejection of jurisdiction\n   on the present facts. Nonetheless, it is certainly consistent with a conclusion that the exception does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Neither the cases discussed above, nor any of the other cases relied upon by the majority, mandate a conclusion that a loss suffered by a Luxembourg entity, owned by another Luxembourg entity, in turn owned by United States entities, constitutes a direct effect in the United States. Implications of a holding to that effect seem to me to be inconsistent with Congress's express language in the relevant exception. Where do we cut off the chain between an effect and a direct effect to give meaning to the congressional expression? If the plaintiff in this case were not EIG but a shareholder of EIG, would that shareholder's loss be direct? I think not. It seems unlikely that Congress would have included as plain a word as \"direct\" in the creation of an exception to foreign sovereign immunity unless it had more apparent content than the majority's interpretation would allow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the end, for the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The factual background is derived from the allegations of the plaintiffs' first amended complaint, which we accept as true in reviewing the denial of a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Price v.
