Several years later, Guzman pleaded guilty in North Carolina state court to misdemeanor possession of a small amount of marijuana. The state court withheld adjudication of guilt, instead entering a verdict of prayer for judgment continued and assessing Guzman $100 in court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The question presented for our review is purely legal: does the imposition of $100 in court costs, assessed attendant to a prayer for judgment continued under North Carolina law, qualify as a \"conviction\" within the meaning of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (the \"Act\")?\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A).

In August 2002, Guzman received a North Carolina citation for misdemeanor possession of up to one-half of an ounce of marijuana, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2090-95\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 90-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4). Three months later, Guzman pleaded guilty to the offense in the state district court, sitting\n   in Wake County, North Carolina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, the state court entered a verdict of \"prayer for judgment continued\" and assessed $100 in court costs. The court did not impose restitution or order Guzman to pay a fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thirteen years later-in 2015-the Department of Homeland Security (\"Homeland Security\") charged Guzman with removability from the United States, a charge that Guzman conceded. However, Guzman applied for cancellation of removal as a non-permanent resident under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). Homeland Security orally moved to pretermit the application, arguing that Guzman's prior offense for misdemeanor marijuana possession barred cancellation because it satisfied the relevant federal statutory definition of \"conviction\" for a controlled substance offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C), 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 1101(48)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Immigration Judge presiding over Guzman's removal proceedings granted Homeland Security's oral motion. In particular, the Immigration Judge determined that the state-court resolution of Guzman's misdemeanor possession charge satisfied the Act's statutory definition of \"conviction\" because Guzman had both pleaded guilty to the underlying offense and \"paid $100 in costs\" attendant to his plea. A.R. 41. As the sole support for this determination, the Immigration Judge cited a 2008 opinion issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals concluding that costs and surcharges imposed in the criminal sentencing context satisfy the Act's relevant definitions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2090-95\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Cabrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20459\">\n    24 I. &amp; N.

The parties agree that Guzman did not have a formal judgment entered against him and that he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor possession offense. Accordingly, only the second prong of the Act's definition of a \"conviction\" when adjudication of guilt has been withheld is at issue-i.e., whether the $100 in costs assessed attendant to Guzman's guilty plea constitute a \"punishment\" or \"penalty\" within the meaning of the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Act does not define the terms \"punishment\" or \"penalty,\" and this Court has not yet addressed whether the imposition\n   of \"costs\" under North Carolina law constitutes a \"punishment\" or \"penalty\" for purposes of the Act. Conceding that this issue is one \"of first impression for the Fourth Circuit,\" the government argues that the \"costs\" assessed in Guzman's case are analogous to \"fine[s] or restitution,\" which courts have held, at least in the criminal sentencing context, \"constitute[ ] a form of 'punishment' or 'penalty' \" under the Act. Resp't's Br. at 16-17. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To resolve Guzman's petition, we must address three issues: (1) the definitions of \"punishment\" and \"penalty,\" as those terms are used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(48)(A) ; (2) the import under North Carolina law of a verdict requiring payment of \"costs\" in conjunction with a prayer for judgment continued; and, (3) in view of those substantive definitions, whether the imposition of costs assessed attendant to a North Carolina disposition of prayer for judgment continued constitutes a \"punishment\" or \"penalty\" for purposes of the Act. We examine each issue in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Turning first to the Act's definition of \"punishment\" and \"penalty,\" we analyze these terms \"start[ing] with the plain language.\"\n   <em>\n    Crespo v.

Applying this well-established interpretive approach, we conclude that a monetary assessment amounts to a \"punishment\" or \"penalty\" for purposes of Section 1101(a)(48)(A) if it is principally intended to serve a punitive purpose-that is, if a judge orders the monetary assessment to advance a punitive goal tethered to the defendant's degree of culpability in light of her specific actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Black's Law Dictionary and Merriam-Webster define \"penalty\" and \"punishment\" in similar terms, often using one term to help give meaning to the other. A punishment is \"[a] sanction-such as a fine, penalty, confinement, or loss of property, right, or privilege-assessed against a person who has violated the law,\"\n   <em>\n    Punishment\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014), or \"a penalty inflicted by a court of justice on a convicted offender,\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1843 (Philip Babcock Gove et al. eds., 2002) [hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Webster's\n   </em>\n   ]. Similarly, a penalty is \"[p]unishment imposed on a wrongdoer, usu[ally] in the form of imprisonment or fine,\"\n   <em>\n    Penalty\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014), or \"the suffering in person, rights, or property which is annexed by law or judicial decision to the commission of a crime or public offense,\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1668.

To begin,\n   <em>\n    Cabrera\n   </em>\n   dealt with whether \"costs and surcharges\" imposed under\n   <em>\n    Florida\n   </em>\n   law pursuant to a plea of nolo contendere constituted a penalty or punishment for purposes of the Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20459\">\n    24 I. &amp; N.

The difference in governing law is significant. Unlike the North Carolina costs taxed against Guzman, all of which were mandatory, some of the Florida costs and surcharges assessed against the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Cabrera\n   </em>\n   were not mandatory, but\n   imposed as a matter of judicial discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20459\">\n    at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, whereas North Carolina costs are not punitive in character, the discretionary costs and surcharges at issue in\n   <em>\n    Cabrera\n   </em>\n   were punitive in character.
