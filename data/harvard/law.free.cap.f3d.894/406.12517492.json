National Transportation Safety Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055960,6891221\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/918/\">\n    776 F.3d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Roberts filed his application with this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 2412 requires a party seeking fees and expenses to file an application \"within thirty days of final judgment in the action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Roberts v. National Transportation Safety Board\n   </em>\n   became final on April 23, 2015. The limitations period in \u00a7 2412 runs from the time of final judgment in \"\n   <em>\n    the court before which the civil action is pending\n   </em>\n   ,\" not from the final decision of an administrative agency.\n   <em>\n    Melkonyan v.

Because Roberts submitted his \u00a7 2412 application on May 4, 2018, more than three years after this court's final judgment, his application was untimely. We therefore deny it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    The subject of Roberts' petition for judicial review was the National Transportation Safety Board's denial of his request, which he filed pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , for legal fees and expenses incurred in administrative proceedings. This court ruled in Roberts' favor and remanded the case to the Board. On April 4, 2018, the Board granted Roberts' application for fees and expenses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
