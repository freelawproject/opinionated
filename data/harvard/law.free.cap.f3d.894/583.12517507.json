BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February 2016, Walsh, a New Jersey citizen, filed an amended putative class action complaint against defendants in the New Jersey Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Walsh alleged that starting in December 2009 he and the class members purchased home security equipment and monitoring service from defendants and signed contracts that defendants prepared which contained illegal provisions relating to fees due on cancellation of the contracts. JA 92 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 18). Walsh advances two claims based on the allegedly illegal provisions relating to fees due on cancellation of the contracts, one under New Jersey's Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act (\"TCCWNA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2056%3A12-14\">\n    N.J.

Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 56:12-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the other under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (\"NJCFA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2056%3A8-1\">\n    N.J.

In his motion he claimed that ADT SSI-Tyco's\n   presence in the case triggered CAFA's local controversy exception under which a district court must decline to exercise jurisdiction if the controversy is uniquely connected to the state in which the plaintiff originally filed the state court action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vodenichar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715393\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/497/#p502\">\n    733 F.3d at 506-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Walsh argued that the exception applied, inter alia, because (1) ADT SSI-Tyco is a local defendant as it is a citizen of New Jersey, the state in which Walsh filed the case; (2) ADT SSI-Tyco's conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted; and (3) Walsh seeks significant relief from ADT SSI-Tyco. Walsh had to prevail on each argument to trigger the exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The District Court originally denied Walsh's motion to remand,\n   <em>\n    Walsh v. Defenders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206775634\">\n    2016 WL 6775634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Nov. 15, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   I\"), adopting in part a report and recommendation of a magistrate judge,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walsh v. Defenders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206775706\">\n    2016 WL 6775706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. July 15, 2016), recommending that it do so. Nevertheless, the Court agreed that ADT SSI-Tyco, though a Delaware LLC had New Jersey citizenship and was a local defendant in this New Jersey case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, ADT SSI-Tyco has been a New Jersey citizen since 2012, when it converted from a Delaware corporation called ADT SSI, which was a citizen of Delaware and Florida, and consequently ADT SSI-Tyco was a local defendant when Walsh initiated this action. But the Court denied the motion to remand for reasons that we will explain below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In considering the matter, the District Court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation observing that after ADT SSI-Tyco changed its corporate form and citizenship in 2012, it made another important change with respect to its business organization. It assigned its assets and liabilities under its residential contracts, including the contracts at issue in this case, to ADT LLC, a citizen of Delaware. But ADT SSI-Tyco remained a viable entity after the assignment as it retained its commercial contracts and continued its operations. The Court found that ADT SSI-Tyco continued to be a local defendant despite the partial transfer of its assets and liabilities because \"an assignment does not let an assignor off the hook.\"\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   I,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206775634\">\n    2016 WL 6775634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the Court suggested that the transfer could lead to a remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In reliance on\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068134\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/337/#p358\">\n    724 F.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 358 (3d Cir. 2013), where we said that \"a federal court must disregard nominal or formal parties, and can base its jurisdiction only upon the citizenship of parties with a real interest in the litigation,\" the Court stated that \"ADTSSI-Tyco appears to have no actual interest in the outcome of this litigation\" because \"ADTSSI-Tyco has transferred its liabilities to ADT LLC.\"\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   I,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206775634\">\n    2016 WL 6775634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 n.5. It is understandable that the Court took this view as Walsh\n   based his case on claims arising from contracts that ADT SSI-Tyco transferred to ADT LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The District Court saw other problems with the motion to remand because it ruled that Walsh did not show that ADT SSI-Tyco's conduct formed a significant basis for the claims of the proposed class, a requirement of the local controversy exception. The Court stated that Walsh failed to analyze any of the several factors we set out in\n   <em>\n    Kaufman v. Allstate New Jersey Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480983\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/144/\">\n    561 F.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157 n.13 (3d Cir. 2009), to guide evaluation of the significant-basis prong of the local controversy exception. Consequently, the Court denied Walsh's motion to remand, and did not reach the final disputed issue of whether Walsh sought significant relief from ADT SSI-Tyco, another element of the local controversy exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   But the District Court did not settle the remand issue with its first order for Walsh moved for reconsideration and, in its consideration of this motion, the Court reversed its course.\n   <em>\n    Walsh v. Defenders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20555690\">\n    2018 WL 555690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Jan. 25, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   II\"). The Court found that Walsh satisfied the significant-basis element of the local controversy exception because of \"new evidence [Walsh] obtained during class discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The new evidence showed that ADT SSI-Tyco entered into the allegedly unlawful contracts with 35.3% of the putative class, and created the standardized contract provisions that form the basis of the entire class's claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court found that the evidence satisfied several of the factors that we set forth in\n   <em>\n    Kaufman\n   </em>\n   and concluded that ADT SSI-Tyco's conduct formed a significant basis for the claims asserted on behalf of the putative class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The District Court in\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   II then reached Walsh's final argument that he sought significant relief from ADT SSI-Tyco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Court agreed with Walsh that he had done so, finding that the relief Walsh sought against ADT SSI-Tyco-money damages, statutory damages under TCCWNA, treble damages under the NJCFA, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest-was significant enough to satisfy the local controversy exception to its jurisdiction. It thus appeared that all of the elements of the local controversy exception were present. The Court accordingly granted Walsh's motion by order of January 25, 2018, to reconsider its original ruling in which it had denied the remand motion and it remanded the case to the New Jersey Superior Court. Defendants then filed a timely petition for interlocutory review of the remand order that we have granted. We now consider the remand order on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   IV. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The local controversy exception to a district court's CAFA class action jurisdiction\n   requires a court to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a class action where more than two-thirds of the proposed plaintiff class members and at least one defendant, here ADT SSI-Tyco, are citizens of the state in which the suit was filed, here New Jersey, provided that the local defendant is one \"from whom significant relief is sought by members of the plaintiff class\" and \"whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(aa), (bb). Defendants do not contend that the two-thirds requirement was not met but they do argue that ADT SSI-Tyco cannot be considered a local defendant for purposes of the exception because it is not a real party in interest to this litigation. In addition, defendants dispute whether the \"significant relief\" and \"significant basis\" prongs of the local controversy exception have been satisfied with respect to ADT SSI-Tyco, even if it is considered a local defendant for purposes of the CAFA exception. For the following reasons, we conclude that ADT SSI-Tyco is a local defendant under CAFA from whom Walsh and the proposed class seek significant relief and that its alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted. For those reasons, we will affirm the order remanding this action to the state court from which it was removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    A. ADT SSI-Tyco is a local defendant.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants first challenge the conclusion that ADT SSI-Tyco is a local defendant. They recognize that Walsh filed this case in a New Jersey state court against ADT SSI-Tyco, and they do not deny that, as the District Court recognized,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   II,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20555690\">\n    2018 WL 555690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, ADT SSI-Tyco is a New Jersey citizen. But they claim that ADT SSI-Tyco is merely a \"nominal party\" without \"a real interest in the litigation.\" Appellants' br. at 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    SmithKline Beecham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068134\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/337/#p358\">\n    724 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   358 ). Accordingly, they contend that the Court should have ignored ADT SSI-Tyco's citizenship in its jurisdictional analysis. If it had done so then it could not have said that there was a defendant who was a citizen of the state in which Walsh originally filed the action. We, however, disagree with defendants' contention that ADT SSI-Tyco is a nominal party. To the contrary, ADT SSI-Tyco has an interest in this litigation, and the Court correctly considered it in making its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In determining whether there is diversity jurisdiction, a district court must consider the citizenship of defendants who are \"real and substantial parties to the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Navarro Sav.

Walsh alleges, and we accept the allegation at this stage of the litigation, that ADT SSI-Tyco is at least partly to blame for the inclusion of the allegedly illegal terms in the security service contracts. Although the now-defunct ADT SSI corporation may have drafted the allegedly illegal terms, any liability that ADT SSI could have faced for drafting those terms sits with ADT SSI-Tyco because when a Delaware corporation converts to a Delaware LLC as happened here, when ADT SSI converted to ADT SSI-Tyco, Delaware statutory law automatically transfers the corporation's liabilities to the new LLC.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Del.%20Code%20Ann.%20tit.%206%2C%20%C2%A7%2018-214\">\n    Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 18-214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). And although ADT SSI-Tyco attempted to transfer all potential liability for that conduct to ADT LLC, it has not shown that the transfer freed it from liability. Rather, as Walsh asserts, the transfer did not have that consequence.

When the plaintiffs, one of whom was a Pennsylvania citizen, subsequently brought the action in state court and defendants removed it to the district court, the plaintiffs claimed that the case should be remanded because SmithKline Beecham and\n   one of the plaintiffs were Pennsylvania citizens and thus diversity of citizenship was absent.

Appellants' br. at 17. But the entities are in different positions. Unlike SmithKline Beecham, which dissolved completely and passed all of its liability to GSK LLC, ADT SSI-Tyco is an active entity that has not dissolved. It did not pass all of its liabilities to ADT LLC, to the end that ADT LLC \"has stepped into [its] shoes\"; rather, ADT SSI-Tyco is subject to liability in this case, depending on its outcome,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and can defend the claims against it.

In evaluating whether the amended complaint seeks significant relief from a given defendant, we look to the complaint rather than extrinsic materials such as those on which\n   defendants rely, as the complaint is the best evidence of the relief that the plaintiffs seek.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

In an instructive opinion on the significant relief prong of the local controversy exception, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit observed that based on the plain language of the statute, \"a defendant from whom significant relief is sought does not mean a defendant from whom significant relief may be obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    Coffey v.

As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Kaufman\n   </em>\n   , a court must analyze the significance of a defendant's conduct in relation to that of the other defendants in light of the plain meaning of the word \"significant.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaufman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480983\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/144/\">\n    561 F.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157 (defining \"significant\" as \"important, notable\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2d ed. 1989) ). Walsh argues that ADT SSI-Tyco's conduct forms a significant basis for the proposed class's claims because ADT SSI-Tyco used the allegedly illegal contract provisions at issue and because ADT SSI-Tyco entered into allegedly unlawful alarm-service contracts with 35.3% of class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   While we have observed that the significant basis prong \"does not establish an absolute quantitative requirement\" for the number of class members asserting claims based on a local defendant's conduct, the number of claims involving the local defendant can be a helpful consideration in the analysis.\n   <em>\n    Kaufman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480983\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/144/\">\n    561 F.3d at 155-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the District Court that Walsh's evidence satisfies the required showing for the significant basis prong of the local controversy exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Walsh\n   </em>\n   II,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20555690\">\n    2018 WL 555690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Though a greater number of class members entered into alarm-services contracts with ADT LLC than with ADT SSI-Tyco, the local controversy exception does not require that the local defendant's conduct be\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   significant conduct or that it predominates over claims against other defendants. Because of ADT SSI-Tyco's role with respect to the use of allegedly illegal\n   provisions, and because over a third of the class members entered into contracts directly with ADT SSI-Tyco, it is clear that ADT SSI-Tyco's conduct forms a significant basis for the claims of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   V. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the above-stated reasons, we conclude that the District Court did not err in remanding this action to the state court based on CAFA's local controversy exception to the exercise of its jurisdiction.

Compl. \u00b6 5) and did not include ADT SSI-Tyco as a defendant. The parties agree, however, that ADT SSI, the predecessor to ADT SSI-Tyco, was dissolved in 2012 before Walsh initiated this case, and that the surviving business operates as ADT SSI-Tyco, a limited liability company. Despite naming the wrong entity, Walsh had process served on ADT SSI-Tyco.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    JA 292. Moreover, ADT SSI-Tyco has participated in this litigation in several ways: it appeared with representation before the District Court; several briefs filed in the District Court were purportedly filed on its behalf; and it joined in the petition for interlocutory review of the Court's remand order.
