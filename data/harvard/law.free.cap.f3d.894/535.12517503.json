We must decide whether a revised interpretation of that term by the Board of Immigration Appeals (the \"BIA\" or the \"Board\") is reasonable and therefore entitled to deference under the strictures of\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Like other circuit courts, we had dutifully deferred to the initial interpretation of that term given by the Board in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20211\">\n    19 I. &amp; N.

But, over time, the Board began adding new requirements to its test for determining whether an applicant had established the existence of a particular social group and could thereby claim refugee status. In\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. Attorney General\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879117\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/582/\">\n    663 F.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2011), we concluded that the BIA had departed from\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   without a principled explanation and that its new requirements for proving a particular social group were incapable of consistent application. We therefore held that its interpretation of \"particular social group\" was not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879117\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/582/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879117\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/582/\">\n    at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The BIA has since responded to our concerns. In a pair of precedential decisions,\n   <em>\n    Matter of M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20227\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

The test requires applicants to \"establish that the group [at issue] is (1) composed of members who share a common immutable characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within the society in question.\"\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 237. We now hold that that statutory interpretation is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference, and, applying the newly framed test here, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that the petitioner has not met its requirements. Accordingly, we will deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   S.E.R.L., a native of Honduras, seeks review of the denial of her application for asylum and statutory withholding of removal based on membership in a proposed particular social group that she characterizes as \"immediate family members of Honduran women unable to leave a domestic relationship[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Opening Br. at 21.) She fears persecution by two men, Jose Angel and Juan Orellana. Jose Angel abducted, raped, and continues to stalk one of S.E.R.L.'s daughters, K.Y.R.L. That daughter has already been granted asylum in the United States. Juan Orellana is S.E.R.L.'s stepfather and has repeatedly abused S.E.R.L.'s mother. S.E.R.L. fears that if she is removed to Honduras, both men will persecute her, Jose Angel because of her relationship to her daughter, and Juan Orellana because of her relationship to her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   S.E.R.L. and two of her children fled here from Honduras in 2014. Within a month of their unlawful arrival, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   S.E.R.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   conceded removability, and timely applied for asylum and statutory withholding of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of her claims for relief, she alleged past persecution and a fear of future persecution based on the relationships just noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An immigration judge (\"IJ\") reviewed S.E.R.L.'s application and conducted a merits hearing. Although finding her credible, the IJ concluded that S.E.R.L. had not met her burden to establish eligibility for any of the relief she had requested. According to the IJ, S.E.R.L. had not established past persecution or an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution by Jose Angel, given that he had targeted S.E.R.L.'s daughter, not her. Though crediting S.E.R.L.'s testimony about Juan Orellana's abuse of her mother and past threats directed at S.E.R.L., herself, the IJ also noted that S.E.R.L. said \"her stepfather never physically harmed her.\" (Administrative Record (\"AR\") at 86.) The IJ did not state whether S.E.R.L. had established past persecution by Juan Orellana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The IJ did say that, even if she had suffered past persecution, S.E.R.L. failed to establish that the harm she suffered was on account of a protected ground. Applying the BIA's newly clarified three-part test from\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   , the IJ rejected S.E.R.L.'s argument that \"immediate family members of Honduran women unable to leave a domestic relationship\" constituted a cognizable group. (AR at 89-90.) According to the IJ, the group \"lack[ed] the requisite level of particularity and social distinction\" and thus failed the test's second and third requirements. (AR at 90.) The IJ also noted that \"asylum and refugee laws do not protect people from general conditions of strife, such as crime and other societal afflictions.\" (AR at 90 (quoting\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 235 ).) Consequently, the IJ denied relief and ordered that S.E.R.L. be removed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   She appealed that decision to the BIA. It too concluded that she had not met her burden to establish eligibility for either asylum or withholding of removal. It agreed with the IJ's conclusion that she had not established past persecution by Jose Angel, and it further concluded that she had not established past persecution by Juan Orellana, because any threats he made \"d[id] not rise to the level of persecution[.]\" (AR at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The BIA also agreed that S.E.R.L.'s proposed particular social group-immediate family members of Honduran women unable to leave a domestic relationship-lacked the requisite particularity and social distinction. As to particularity, the BIA observed that \"[the] proposed group could include individuals of any age, sex, or background, and it is not limited to those who ... take overt action to assist, or are meaningfully involved with, the family member who is unable to leave a domestic relationship.\" (AR at 5.) The BIA further \"agree[d] that [S.E.R.L.] ha[d] not presented evidence that this group is socially distinct within Honduran society, as the record does not reflect that members of\n   such a group would be perceived, considered, or recognized in Honduras as a distinct group[.]\" (AR at 5.) Even assuming a cognizable particular social group, the Board \"discern[ed] no legal error or clear factual error\" in the IJ's determination that S.E.R.L. had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution by Jose Angel. (AR at 5-6.) The Board did not, however, reach the issue of future persecution by Juan Orellana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It turned last to the question of withholding of removal and concluded that, \"[i]nasmuch as [S.E.R.L.] has failed to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum, it follows that she has failed to satisfy the more stringent standard required for withholding of removal[.]\" (AR at 6.) The Board thus dismissed the appeal. S.E.R.L. has timely petitioned for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   S.E.R.L. contends that she is entitled to asylum and withholding of removal because she has established a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her membership in a legally cognizable particular social group, that again being \"immediate family members of Honduran women unable to leave a domestic relationship[.]\" (Opening Br. at 21.) The parties' primary dispute is whether the BIA's revised interpretation of \"particular social group,\" as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Matter of M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   , warrants\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. S.E.R.L., supported by amici,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   asks us to reject the test from\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   because it is \"deeply flawed,\" \"has no basis in the asylum statute,\" and fails to resolve the concerns raised in our decision in\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   . (Opening Br. at 1-2.) Instead, S.E.R.L. argues, we should continue to apply the test from\n   <em>\n    Matter of Acosta\n   </em>\n   , which she claims to \"satisf[y] ... with ease.\" (Opening Br. at 22.) She also says that, in the event the Board's new interpretation is given deference, she has met its particularity and social distinction requirements. Finally, she contends that remand is required, if for no other reason, because neither the IJ nor the BIA addressed whether she has a well-founded fear of future persecution by Juan Orellana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before we address those arguments, we first discuss the governing legal principles and provide a review of our\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   decision and the BIA's response in\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

We need not fully repeat that history here but, for purposes of our analysis, will summarize a few important points from the pertinent decisions of the BIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   From 1985 to 2006, the Board interpreted \"particular social group\" to mean \"a group of persons all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic.\"\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879117\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/582/\">\n    663 F.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   , 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233 ). That standard became known as the\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   test. It was rooted in the interpretive doctrine of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , which teaches that words in a list should be understood as referring to things of the same general class or kind.\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   , 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233. In the context of the statutory definition of \"refugee,\" that means that the term \"particular social group\" should be understood as being akin to the other characteristics listed in the definition, namely race, religion, nationality, and political opinion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(42)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1), 1231(b)(3). According to the BIA, all of those focus on \"an immutable characteristic,\" which the BIA explained includes both those characteristics that are technically \"immutable\" as well as those a person \"should not be required\" to change \"as a matter of conscience\" to avoid persecution.\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   , 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233-34. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   test required members of a \"particular social group\" to have \"a common, immutable characteristic\" that \"the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The BIA listed examples of innate characteristics, like \"sex, color, or kinship ties[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also noted that, in certain circumstances, \"a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership\" could be the defining characteristic of a cognizable \"particular social group,\" but such determinations would be made \"on a case-by-case basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Over time, employing the\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   test, the BIA recognized several particular social groups based on discernable and immutable characteristics. For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re H-,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20337\">\n    21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 1996), it accepted \"kinship\" as an immutable characteristic, concluding that \"[t]he record before us makes clear not only that the Marehan [-a familial sub-clan in Somalia-] share ties of kinship, but that they are identifiable as a group based upon linguistic commonalities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20337\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Importantly, however, in other cases, the Board accepted particular social groups that did not share such plainly discernable characteristics.

Thus, in 1999, the BIA began supplementing the\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   test with additional requirements.\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879117\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/582/\">\n    663 F.3d at 596-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Board adhered to its more restrictive interpretation of particular social group, and it clarified the three requirements that an applicant for asylum or withholding of removal must satisfy to establish a cognizable particular social group.

In the Board's view, adding \"particularity\" and \"social distinction\" as requirements for proving a particular social group became necessary, based on its experience in cases since\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 232-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The \"particularity\" requirement, it said, \"is included in the plain language of the [statute] and is consistent with the specificity by which race, religion, nationality, and political opinion are commonly defined.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 239. \"Particularity\" is largely definitional, ensuring that the characteristics defining a group \"provide a clear benchmark for determining who falls within the group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The BIA explained that particularity requires the group to be \"discrete and have definable boundaries\" that are not \"amorphous, overbroad, diffuse, or subjective,\" ensuring that an immutable characteristic is \"sufficiently precise to define a particular social group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The \"social distinction\" requirement, it said, was a reworking of the social visibility requirement and was intended to resolve any \"misconception\" that literal visibility was meant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 236. According to the BIA, social visibility \"was never meant to be read literally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 240. The change in terminology to \"social distinction\" was made to \"clarif[y] that social visibility does not mean 'ocular' visibility-either of the group as a whole or of individuals within the group-any more than a person holding a protected religious or political belief must be 'ocularly' visible to others in society.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, the Board explained, \"[t]o be socially distinct, a group need not be seen by society; rather, it must be perceived as a group by society.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Board noted our concern about the inconsistent application of the former \"social visibility\" requirement, and described why it viewed the revised social distinction requirement as nevertheless being an appropriate approach. It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   It may not be easy or possible to identify who is opposed to [female genital mutilation], who is homosexual, or who is a former member of the national police.

Although acknowledging that \"there is considerable overlap\" between particularity and social distinction, the BIA explained its view that they are both different and necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It said that, although relying on an overlapping body of evidence, \"each emphasize[s] a different aspect of a particular social group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 241. \"Particularity\" addresses \"the 'outer limits' of a group's boundaries and is definitional in nature,\" whereas \"social distinction\" focuses on \"whether the people of a given society would perceive a proposed group as sufficiently separate or distinct[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, the BIA also took the opportunity to emphasize that \"a group's recognition for asylum purposes is determined by the perception of the society in question, rather than by the perception of the persecutor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242. There must be a distinction, the Board explained, between the INA's requirement that an applicant \"establish[ ] the existence of one of the enumerated grounds,\" including \"particular social group,\" and the INA's nexus requirement, which addresses whether an applicant has suffered persecution \"on account of\" that enumerated ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although\n   relevant to the extent indicative of society's views as a whole, the Board stated that \"persecutory conduct alone cannot define [a particular social] group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With that background in mind, we now turn to the main dispute in this case-whether the revised test for determining the cognizability of a particular social group resolves the concerns we raised in\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   and is therefore entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

According to S.E.R.L., our decision in\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   forecloses application of the \"particularity\" and \"social distinction\" requirements.

(Opening Br. at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In addition, those who have filed amicus briefs in this case point out that the BIA's decisions in\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    W-G-R-\n   </em>\n   could be read as inconsistent with certain other BIA decisions and contrary to the canon of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   , the BIA described the kind of evidence that a petitioner could rely on, stating \"[e]vidence such as country conditions reports, expert witness testimony, and press accounts of discriminatory laws and policies, historical animosities, and the like may establish that a group exists and is perceived as 'distinct' ... in a particular society.\" 26 I. &amp; N.

The BIA has adequately distinguished social distinction and particularity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We had expressed concern in\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   that \"social visibility\" (now \"social distinction\") and \"particularity\" were really two ways of saying the same thing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879117\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/582/\">\n    663 F.3d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the BIA has adequately articulated why it deems the ideas to be separate and why both are needed. In the BIA's reasoning, \"social distinction\" works to narrow the universe of \"particular social groups\" to those whose members are seen to be \"distinct\" or \"other,\" like the distinctiveness inherent in the other enumerated grounds of race, religion, nationality, and political opinion, while \"particularity\" ensures that a group has \"discrete ... boundaries\" capable of a common, accepted definition.\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 239-40, 244. We agree that particularity and social distinction address different aspects of whether an applicant has established a particular social group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although they may often involve similar evidence, which the BIA readily acknowledges,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 241, that alone is not a basis to reject them as being indistinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Some overlap is to be expected, given that each requirement is meant to illuminate whether a particular social group exists in the society in question.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[The requirements] overlap because the overall definition is applied in the fact-specific context of an applicant's claim for relief.\"). But particularity and social distinction are different in an important respect: the former is essentially an objective inquiry, asking whether a reasonable person could look at the proposed definition of a social group and determine who falls within it, whereas the latter poses a more subjective question, whether the alien's home society actually does recognize that group as being a \"distinct\" and identifiable group. Inquiring separately about objective and subjective perspectives is a familiar task in the law\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and is not out of bounds in this context. For example, \"[t]he well-found fear of persecution standard involves both a subjectively genuine fear of persecution and an objectively reasonable possibility of persecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Valdiviezo-Galdamez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879117\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/582/\">\n    663 F.3d at 590-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, we are satisfied that the BIA has explained why the two requirements are not really just the same thing done over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The BIA has also explained why it views the addition of \"social distinction\" and \"particularity\" as necessary limitations on the\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   test. It noted its concern that\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   's immutable characteristic requirement resulted in \"confusion and a lack of consistency as adjudicators struggled with various possible social groups, some of which appeared to be created exclusively for asylum purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    M-E-V-G-\n   </em>\n   , 26 I. &amp; N.

She illustrates her argument by way of a Venn diagram, suggesting that her group constitutes a particular social group as a matter of logic. While her reasoning has some superficial appeal, it is flawed, and we reject it for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   First, and most fundamentally, it ignores the factual feature in determining whether a particular social group is cognizable. The BIA has repeatedly stated that the particular social group determination depends on the facts of the case at hand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   , 19 I. &amp; N.

And that must naturally\n   be so, once it is given that social distinction involves proof of societal views. What those views are and how they may differ from one society to another are questions of fact upon which the ultimate legal question of cognizability rests. Consequently, it does not follow that because the BIA has accepted that one society recognizes a particular group as distinct that all societies must be seen as recognizing such a group. Kinship, marital status, and domestic relationships can each be a defining characteristic of a particular social group, but that does not mean that adding two or more of those characteristics together necessarily establishes a cognizable particular social group. In fact, that kind of addition may well broaden, rather than narrow, a group such that the society in question would not recognize it as distinct. Thus, as a matter of logic, it is invalid to assert that proof in one context is proof in all contexts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second and closely related, the Board made an important factual distinction between this case and its prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of A-R-C-G-\n   </em>\n   .

She points to evidence, including country reports documenting violence against Honduran women, Honduran laws enacted to protect women and victims of domestic abuse, and evidence suggesting that those laws are underenforced, as well as a Honduran initiative to combat violence against women. But that evidence does not compel the conclusion that S.E.R.L.'s broader proposed group, which encompasses family members of domestic abuse victims-including family members who are male or female, young or old, and live with or apart from the victims-is socially distinct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We do not read the BIA's opinion as, in effect, \"ignor[ing] S.E.R.L.'s evidence of rampant violence against women and their families in Honduras.\" (Reply Br. at 17, 18.) To be sure, the record includes disturbing evidence of crime, gang-related violence, and general human rights abuses, including gender-based violence against women in Honduras. The Board, however, noted the lack of evidence in the record establishing that \"members of [S.E.R.L.'s proposed] group would be perceived, considered, or recognized in Honduras as a distinct group[.]\" (AR at 5.) Although arguing that the BIA should not be free to credit or ignore evidence or avoid analyzing precedent just by claiming that the issue before it is different, S.E.R.L. fails to direct us to anything in the record that the IJ or BIA has ignored and that would compel the conclusion that Honduran society perceives immediate family members of women who cannot leave domestic relationships as constituting a socially distinct\n   group. Thus, even if such a group were still cognizable after the Attorney General's recent decision overruling\n   <em>\n    A-R-C-G-\n   </em>\n   , the argument for granting the petition for review in this case fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   S.E.R.L.'s criticism of the BIA's analysis strikes at the heart of the Board's discretion to adopt additional requirements for identifying a particular social group and its ability to apply those requirements on a case-by-case basis. That criticism may or may not be valid but, in any event, should be directed to Congress. As the law stands now, the BIA has the discretion it exercised, and while it remains to be seen whether the application of those requirements proves principled and consistent, what matters for our purposes is that they are capable of such application.\n   <em>\n    Martinez Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189822\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/583/#p591\">\n    566 U.S. at 591, 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189822\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/583/#p591\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
