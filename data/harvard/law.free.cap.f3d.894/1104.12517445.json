We hold that such conduct constitutes \"distribution\" as that term is defined in the Sentencing Guidelines and accompanying commentary, and we therefore affirm the distribution enhancement imposed by the district court on Albert Silva Hernandez, Jr. However, because the record suggests that the district court penalized Hernandez by increasing his sentence based on his decision to exercise his Sixth Amendment right to go to trial, we issue a limited remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hernandez coached softball at Silverado High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, and for a club softball team of girls aged eighteen years and younger. Hernandez met N.C.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was 17 years old and a minor under federal law, when she joined his club softball team. Because N.C. was playing a new position, Hernandez provided her with extra coaching sessions to improve her softball skills. After several months, the coach-player relationship turned sexual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the course of their relationship, N.C. and Hernandez exchanged photographs using a password-protected cellular phone application that limited access of the photos sent to only N.C. and Hernandez. N.C. took sexually explicit photographs of herself with her mobile phone, often at Hernandez's direction, and sent the photographs to Hernandez's mobile phone. Hernandez took sexually explicit photographs of himself on his mobile phone and, at times at N.C.'s direction, sent those photographs to N.C. on her mobile phone. Hernandez also took photos of himself and N.C. engaged in sexual activity together, and later sent those photos to N.C. via his mobile phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The relationship between Hernandez and N.C. came to light when N.C. inadvertently called home while engaged in sexual activities with Hernandez. N.C.'s father retrieved her mobile phone and delivered it to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After sexually explicit photographs and text messages were recovered from N.C.'s mobile phone, Hernandez was charged with eight counts of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (e) (sexual exploitation of a child) and three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(1), (b) (transporting child pornography). Following a jury trial, Hernandez was convicted of the sexual exploitation counts and acquitted of the transporting counts. After applying several\n   enhancements and denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the district court sentenced Hernandez to 284 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This is Hernandez's second round before this court. In the first appeal, we rejected Hernandez's arguments \"that the government impermissibly changed its theory of prosecution during rebuttal argument\" and that application of enhancements for sexual contact and abuse of trust constituted impermissible \"double counting.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Hernandez's claim that \"[o]ther courts have already held transmitting images to oneself does not constitute distribution\" is beside the point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grzybowicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179782\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1296/#p1311\">\n    747 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1309 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There is no conflict between\n   <em>\n    Grzybowicz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Merrill\n   </em>\n   -reasoning that the transfer of illicit images to oneself alone does not constitute \"distribution\"-and our holding here-that the transfer of illicit images to the\n   minor victim depicted in the images constitutes \"distribution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Hernandez also argues that \"[d]istribution has consistently been interpreted to require distribution or attempted distribution to third parties.\" However, none of the cases Hernandez cites support this narrow reading.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Carani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505975\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/867/#p869\">\n    492 F.3d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 869-70, 875-76 (7th Cir. 2007) (defendant made child pornography videos available for others to access and download through a file-sharing program on his computer);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, what all of the cases have in common is that a defendant engaged in an \"act ... related to\" the \"transfer\" of illicit, sexually explicit material involving minors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1, cmt. n.1. The lesson learned from these cases is that there are myriad methods to produce, transmit, share, and exchange sexually explicit material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Neither the definition for \"distribution\" in the Guidelines nor the case law supports the interpretation of the sentencing enhancement that Hernandez urges us to adopt here. We affirm the district court's determination that the distribution enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) applies when the illicit pornographic images are transferred to a minor victim depicted in the images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

We must defer that ultimate issue again and remand because the district court appears to have increased Hernandez's sentence or withheld a reduction for acceptance of responsibility based on Hernandez's decision to go to trial. Our review must await the district court's clarification of the basis for the sentence.

More recently, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court emphasized Hernandez's decision to go to trial five separate times during the sentencing hearing. The court first stated that \"it would mean something if [Hernandez] took responsibility before the trial.\" The court then repeated that \"contrition means something when it happens before trial.\" The court went on, stating \"I have never had a defendant-there have been one or two maybe-after being found guilty, who didn't feel contrition ... everybody feels contrition now. Now, when they are looking at spending time in prison, everybody feels remorse for what they did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Still further, the court continued: \"[W]hat I look for is somebody who feels remorse before the trial, before you put this young girl through the-through the agony of testifying, having to testify to what went on, and then identify pictures of herself, personal pictures. So, I don't see-I don't see much remorse there, Mr. Hernandez.\" This comment revealed the court's dim view of Hernandez's right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, just before the district court imposed Hernandez's sentence, it declared:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"You decided to roll the dice, and it came up snake eyes. You didn't think she'd testify, and she did. You went-you wanted to go to trial, so you went to trial. And Probation rightly recommends 327 months for that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This last statement was of particular significance, coming directly before the court handed down the 284-month sentence. Deciding \"to roll the dice\" could only refer to Hernandez's decision to go to trial-a right enshrined in the constitution and guaranteed to him by the Sixth Amendment. U.S. Const. amend. VI. That the dice \"came up snake eyes\"-Hernandez was convicted by the jury-while true, is no reason standing alone to impose a harsher sentence, or to withhold a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The district court's statements run headlong into our precedent \"that a judge cannot rely upon the fact that a defendant refuses to plead guilty and insists on his right to trial as the basis for denying an acceptance of responsibility adjustment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ochoa-Gaytan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9484308\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/265/837/#p842\">\n    265 F.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In recognition of this principle, we have acknowledged that \"a defendant who contests his factual guilt at trial may, under some circumstances, be entitled to such an adjustment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mohrbacher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549375\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/182/1041/#p1052\">\n    182 F.3d 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1052 (9th Cir. 1999). We recognize that sometimes there can be a fine line between putting on a defense at trial, and expressing contrition at sentencing. But this is not a binary, \"either/or\" proposition as suggested by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Critically here, the district court's comments regarding Hernandez's decision to go to trial comprised virtually the entirety of the explanation for the sentence. It does not appear that the court \"based its final decision on the facts of this case and on this particular record as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramos-Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048720\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/932/#p940\">\n    706 F.3d at 941-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court concluded the hearing by stating that the \"midrange of the guideline is sufficient considering all of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) and meets the sentencing goals as outlined by that statute.\" But reciting this boiler-plate statement immediately after chastising Hernandez for going to trial, and without any explanation, does not cure the infirmities in the district court's justification for the sentence imposed. The court did not specify which factors it considered, nor is it apparent how the court may have applied the factors to the facts of Hernandez's case, or whether it considered any facts at all beyond Hernandez's decision to exercise his constitutional rights. On this record, it is impossible to avoid the centrality of the comments about Hernandez's decision to go to trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Enhancing a sentence solely because a defendant chooses to go to trial risks chilling future criminal defendants from exercising their constitutional rights.

As with the district court in this case, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Broxmeyer\n   </em>\n   described the defendant as displaying \"a disturbing lack of remorse for, or even appreciation of, the seriousness of the totality of his conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868532\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/265/#p291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868532\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/265/#p291\">\n    at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Second Circuit viewed Broxmeyer's lack of remorse as \"a circumstance that further expanded the range of substantively reasonable sentences ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868532\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/265/#p291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I cannot conclude that the district court erred in this case by reaching a similar conclusion. As with the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Broxmeyer\n   </em>\n   , Hernandez has continued to insist that the relationship was \"consensual,\" despite the minor's lack of ability to legally consent, and despite the victim's statement to the court that she was manipulated by Hernandez.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868532\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/265/#p291\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I agree with the Second Circuit that it was Hernandez's responsibility \"by virtue of his position as ... coach\" to act as a role model for the teenagers. Instead, Hernandez, similar to Broxmeyer, \"turned [N.C.'s] immaturity and lack of judgment to his own advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868532\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/265/#p291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In sum, Hernandez has not met his burden of establishing that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. A determination of substantive unreasonableness is reserved for the rarest of cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ressam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877768\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/1069/#p1088\">\n    679 F.3d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1088 (9th Cir. 2012),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   . I agree with the Second Circuit that a showing of substantive unreasonableness is made only if the sentence imposed is \"so shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law that allowing [it] to stand would damage the administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Broxmeyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868532\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/265/#p291\">\n    699 F.3d at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). This sentence imposed by the district court at the lower end of the correctly calculated guideline sentencing range is not that case. Because the majority opinion deviates sharply from the analysis articulated in\n   <em>\n    Carty\n   </em>\n   , because its analysis does not track the arguments made by Hernandez, and because the sentence imposed was substantively reasonable, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion concluding that the district court\n   committed reversible error during sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   I agree with the district court that the term \"distribution\" in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) is broad enough to encompass transmission of the sexually explicit images to the victim depicted in the images. Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Roybal\n   </em>\n   supports that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I would affirm the district court's judgment in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The minor victim is referred to by her initials to protect her identity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The 2012 edition of the Guidelines Manual was used to calculate Hernandez's sentence.

It notes the district court's concern in\n    <em>\n     Broxmeyer\n    </em>\n    with the defendant's \"disturbing lack of remorse,\" and equates the\n    <em>\n     Broxmeyer\n    </em>\n    district court's concerns to those of the district court in this case. The underlying facts of\n    <em>\n     Broxmeyer\n    </em>\n    , involving numerous victims and forceful assault, and the defendant's clear comments demonstrating that he did not have remorse and did not take his conduct seriously, are distinguishable from the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Ninety-one percent of criminal defendants in cases terminated in federal district courts in 2014 were convicted as the result of a guilty plea, six percent were dismissed, and three percent received a jury or bench trial.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    US Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, \"Federal Justice Statistics, 2013-14,\"\n    <em>\n     available at\n    </em>\n    https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fjs1314.pdf (Last accessed July 2, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <em>\n     United States v.
