Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 21, 2004, a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Tamplin and three other African-American men for a traffic violation. The officer called for backup after he smelled burned marijuana in the car and observed indicia of gang affiliation. Upon searching the car, officers discovered a .38 caliber handgun and a .357 caliber revolver.\n   <em>\n    People v. Tamplin\n   </em>\n   , No. F050103,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201365988\">\n    2007 WL 1365988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Cal. Ct. App. May 10, 2007). Tamplin was charged in state court with possession of a firearm by a felon.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012021\">\n    Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 12021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). He was also charged with a street gang enhancement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20186.22\">\n    Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 186.22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), as well as four \"strikes\" based on his prior conviction for four criminal offenses on May 28, 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over the course of the next nine months, Tamplin cycled through three appointed attorneys. On February 10, 2005, while represented by public defender Kathleen Hall, Tamplin successfully moved to represent himself. Tamplin asked for appointment of \"assistant counsel\" five days later, but his request was denied. He represented himself without incident for the next four months. Trial was scheduled to begin on July 14, 2005, five months after Hall had last represented him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 22, Tamplin appeared in California Superior Court with privately retained attorney Greg Morris. A minute order shows that Morris requested a continuance to file a motion to substitute counsel. Two boxes on the minute order are checked. Under the heading \"ARRAIGNMENT-VOP,\" a box labeled \"Sub in\" is checked, with the name \"Greg Morris\" handwritten in the blank following the box. Below that, under the heading \"MOTIONS,\" a box labeled \"Granted\" is checked, with the following handwritten text next to it: \"Mr. Morris requests a cont on the motion to file a sub into case.\" That motion was never filed, for two days later, on June 24, Morris was no longer eligible to practice law. His membership in the state bar was suspended in advance of disciplinary proceedings that would ultimately end in his disbarment for misappropriation of client funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a June 30 hearing, the trial court informed Tamplin that Morris had been suspended from practice and could not represent him. The court asked Tamplin how he wished to proceed. Tamplin immediately responded that he wished to continue to represent himself, and he completed a second waiver of counsel form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 8, the court held a hearing on Tamplin's request to continue to represent himself. The court asked Tamplin if he wished \"to return to your status in representing yourself in this case.\" Tamplin stated that he did. The court reviewed the\n   waiver of counsel form that Tamplin had completed on June 30 and thoroughly explained the rights that Tamplin would forfeit. Tamplin confirmed that he understood. The court stated that it would \"make an additional inquiry,\" whether Tamplin would be prepared for trial which was still set for July 14. Tamplin replied, \"Nope.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court then inquired as to why Tamplin wished to represent himself. Tamplin responded, \"Not comfortable-I'm not comfortable with anybody that's in the public defender's office or anybody else that's been hiring [sic] me. They haven't been representing me, they haven't filed anything, they haven't done nothing that's going to help my case. I'm the only one who has filed anything and I'm the only one that has done anything that is going to help my case. Everybody else has done nothing.\" The court pointed out that Tamplin had hired his own attorney. Tamplin explained that he had attempted to hire a private attorney because \"that's what I felt I needed to do at the time.\" Now that it turned out that Morris, whom Tamplin had already paid, was not available, Tamplin explained that he felt that he was \"going to give myself the best representation without feeling like I didn't do everything that I could to fight for me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court again asked Tamplin why he attempted to retain a private attorney. Tamplin responded, \"I hired an attorney at that time ... because I was able to come up with the funds, but also he had insight on my case and he-he had something that I felt that I really couldn't do at the time and I was like well-actually, he was supposed to be co-counsel .... [H]e was supposed to make the objections or the things that I didn't actually catch and follow as far as following the Rules of Court, that's what was supposed to be going on ....\" After a further exchange, Tamplin reiterated, \"I'm representing me now.\" The court confirmed that Tamplin would not be ready for trial in six days. Tamplin stated that he would not, because he needed to file more pretrial motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court then held that Tamplin would not be allowed to represent himself. It stated, \"In this case, given that he desired counsel less than three weeks ago and hired counsel to assist him, the court need not make any inquiry other than that, or delve any further as to those reasons why he wanted counsel, but obviously he wanted counsel to do things he could not do at trial ....\" The court stated that it would not permit Tamplin to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , \"finding that the timeliness is a substantial factor, along with the equivocalness and that the court finds that it is an equivocal demand based on that request for counsel and hiring of counsel on June the 22nd, 2005.\" Tamplin responded, \"[Y]ou're going to violate my due process rights which you just did and by denying my\n   <em>\n    pro per\n   </em>\n   status, which is-I'm granted by law, and you're doing it-\" The court cut him off: \"You don't know the law sir.\" Tamplin replied, \"I don't have to know it that much to know that you are violating my due process rights, what you're doing now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court gave Tamplin the choice to hire his own attorney or to accept a public defender. Tamplin stated, \"I told you I don't want no public defender, none of the ones that you are going to appoint. It is going to be a conflict.\" The court asked if Tamplin could afford a private attorney. He responded, \"Well, if you order my money back [from Morris], I can hire one.\" At the end of the July 8 hearing, after telling Tamplin that it lacked the authority to order Morris to return the money so he could hire private counsel, the court denied his request to represent himself and reappointed public defender Hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court continued the trial for six months. The state habeas court later wrote that the court \"continued the trial date to give petitioner's new counsel time to prepare.\" The trial court's action on July 8 makes clear that, no matter what happened, the trial was almost certainly not going to begin on July 14. Tamplin had indicated that he needed a continuance. His re-appointed counsel, Hall, also needed a continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial, Tamplin was convicted under California's felon-in-possession statute and was sentenced to forty-five years to life under California's Three Strikes sentencing law. On direct appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction but reduced his sentence to twenty-five years to life. Tamplin's appointed appellate counsel on direct appeal failed to raise his\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   habeas petition to the California Superior Court, Tamplin argued that his appointed appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise his\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   claim. The state habeas court held that appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise the claim because Tamplin's\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   rights were not violated. The court based its decision on two grounds. First, Tamplin had not unequivocally requested to represent himself: \"[P]etitioner's hiring of Mr. Morris after the first\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   motion had been granted indicates that petitioner was not unequivocal in his desire to represent himself. Instead, it appears that he was simply searching for a compatible attorney.\" Second, Tamplin had waived his Sixth Amendment right by acquiescing in the trial court's denial of his\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   request: \"Petitioner had at least six months after the denial of the\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   motion in which to object to the appointment of new counsel, but he failed to do so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Tamplin filed a habeas petition in the California Court of Appeal which was denied without comment. He filed a habeas petition in the California Supreme Court, which was also denied without comment. Tamplin then filed a habeas petition in federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.

Faretta was charged with a felony in a California Superior Court. Like Tamplin, Faretta was originally represented by a public defender.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Also like Tamplin, Faretta feared that his public defender would not represent him adequately.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

As we discuss in detail below, Tamplin did not make a new\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   request on June 22 and July 8. He had been representing himself since February 10, and he sought only to continue that self-representation. It may be that the clarity required for an entirely new\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   request is greater than for a request to continue an uninterrupted self-representation. However, we need not address that question, for Tamplin's request was unambiguous under any standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A criminal defendant's unsuccessful attempt to hire private counsel does not make equivocal his request to represent himself if the only alternative to self-representation is representation by a public defender. This is clear from\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   itself. Faretta moved three times for the \"appointment of a lawyer other than the public defender,\" clearly indicating that he did not object to being represented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    422 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   810 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, he\n   <em>\n    wanted\n   </em>\n   to be represented. His only objection was to representation by a public defender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    at 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When presented with the choice of representing himself or being represented by a public defender, Faretta chose to represent himself. The Supreme Court held that the state court violated Faretta's Sixth Amendment right \"[i]n forcing Faretta ... to accept against his will\n   <em>\n    a state-appointed public defender\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Tamplin's case is indistinguishable from Faretta's. His request to represent himself rather than be represented by a public defender was unequivocal. When asked on June 30 how he wished to proceed when he learned that private counsel Morris had been suspended and could not represent him, Tamplin immediately declared his desire to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and he executed on the spot a written waiver of rights form. More than a week later, at the July 8 hearing, he was strongly, even fervently, committed to self-representation. He consistently maintained his position through a long and thorough colloquy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Tamplin's exchange with the trial court on July 8 reads like an exercise in how many ways a defendant can say that he wants to represent himself. In succession: (1) \"[Y]ou don't wish to have counsel appointed to represent you?\" \"No.\" (2) \"[I]t's your request to return to your status in representing yourself in this case ...?\" \"Yes.\" (3) \"I'm going to represent myself ....\" (4) \"I have a right to go\n   <em>\n    pro per\n   </em>\n   at this time. I'm trying to go back to\n   <em>\n    pro per\n   </em>\n   .\" (5) \"I'm going to give myself the best representation without feeling like I didn't do everything that I could to fight for me.\" (6) \"I'm representing me now.\" \"You're still represented by Mr. Morris.\" \"All right. Then I'll make that request.\" (7) \"I told you I don't want no public defender, none of the ones that you are going to appoint.\" Then, immediately after the trial court denied his request, Tamplin twice accused the court of violating his due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Tamplin recognized in his colloquy with the trial court that an attorney could provide assistance in technical and procedural matters, but that hardly made his request equivocal. Under\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   , a defendant's \"technical legal knowledge ... [is] not relevant to an assessment of his knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    at 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A defendant's choice to represent himself necessarily entails a weighing of pros and cons. Foregoing an attorney will virtually always mean that the defendant will have the responsibility to manage aspects of trial for which he is ill-equipped. A defendant may understand these limitations but still prefer to represent himself. Indeed, he must acknowledge his limits in order to waive his right to counsel. A\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   waiver is not competently made unless the defendant understands the \"dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Here, Tamplin conceded that there were technical aspects of the trial with which he would necessarily be unfamiliar but still maintained that he was \"going to give myself the best representation without feeling like I didn't do everything that I could to fight for me.\" Under\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   , the state court was required to respect Tamplin's wish, whether or not he could \"personally handle\" complying with the rules of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2. Waiver by Acquiescence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After the state trial court denied Tamplin's request to represent himself on July 8, and after Tamplin made clear his objection to the court's ruling, Tamplin did not object again. The state habeas court held that because Tamplin did not object again, he had waived his Sixth Amendment right by \"acquiescing\" in the court's ruling. This holding is clearly contrary to\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   held, without qualification, that a defendant who makes an unequivocal and timely request to represent himself has a Sixth Amendment right to self-representation, and that a denial of self-representation in the face of such a request is a violation of that right.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    422 U.S. at 835-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Amendment violation is complete at the time of the court's denial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The state habeas court relied on\n   <em>\n    People v. Rudd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Cal.%20App.%204th%20620\">\n    63 Cal.

The California Court of Appeal held in\n   <em>\n    Rudd\n   </em>\n   that a defendant who makes a timely and unequivocal request to represent himself can subsequently waive his Sixth Amendment right by acquiescing in counsel's representation by failing to continue to object. If the defendant acquiesces and thereby waives his right to self-representation, the Court of Appeal held, his Sixth Amendment rights have not been violated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 630-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20807\">\n    73 Cal.Rptr.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   <em>\n    Rudd\n   </em>\n   court read that\n   sentence in isolation from its context. The context in\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [W]hen a defendant\n   <em>\n    chooses\n   </em>\n   to have a lawyer manage and present his case, law and tradition may allocate to the counsel the power to make binding decisions of trial strategy in many areas. This allocation can only be justified, however, by the defendant's consent,\n   <em>\n    at the outset, to accept counsel as his representative\n   </em>\n   . An unwanted counsel \"represents\" the defendant only through a tenuous and unacceptable legal fiction. Unless the accused has\n   <em>\n    acquiesced in such representation\n   </em>\n   , the defense presented it not the defense guaranteed him by the Constitution, for, in a very real sense, it is not\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    422 U.S. at 820-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first, second and third emphases added). This passage says, unsurprisingly, that a criminal defendant has \"acquiesced in such representation\" when he \"chooses\" \"at the outset, to accept counsel as his representative.\" The passage has nothing to do with a defendant's behavior after he has unequivocally requested to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , and after the trial court has improperly refused that request. The passage cannot be reasonably interpreted to mean that a defendant's failure to continue to object after the trial court has violated\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   constitutes acquiescence in the appointment of a public defender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McKaskle\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the participation of stand-by counsel is not inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment right of a criminal defendant to represent himself or herself. In the case before us, stand-by counsel is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The state habeas court's conclusion that Tamplin waived his Sixth Amendment right by not continuing to object after public defender Hall was re-appointed was clearly contrary to\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   3.

The state habeas court, which provided the last reasoned decision, gave two reasons for its decision, either of which, if valid, sufficed to support its result. The court did not need to reach the question whether Tamplin's request was timely, and it did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The state habeas court explained its decision in a five-page written order, containing just under four pages of actual text. The first page of text recites the procedural\n   history of the case. The second page quotes passages from California court decisions interpreting\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The order then recites the facts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   In the present case, the petitioner originally moved to represent himself in February of 2005, and the court granted the motion. Then, in June of 2005, petitioner hired Greg Morris to represent him. Mr. Morris apparently substituted into the case on June 22, 2005.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   About one week later, on July 8, 2005, petitioner moved to represent himself. However, the trial court denied the Faretta motion, finding that the motion was equivocal and that \"timeliness is a substantial factor\" because the trial date was only about six days away. The court then went on to appoint counsel for petitioner and later continued the trial date to give petitioner's new counsel time to prepare. The case was not ultimately tried until January of 2006, about six months later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The next paragraph begins, \"Under these circumstances, the court finds that petitioner's right to self-representation was not violated.\" That sentence is followed, in the same paragraph, by fourteen lines of text in which the state habeas court held that Tamplin waived his right to represent himself by acquiescing in the trial court's ruling. The next paragraph contains eight lines of text in which the state habeas court held that Tamplin was equivocal in his request to represent himself. That paragraph is followed by a final paragraph of a single line stating, \"The petition is denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The order thus gives two clearly articulated reasons for holding that Tamplin's Sixth Amendment right was not violated. The order nowhere says that Tamplin made his self-representation request too late, or gives that as a reason supporting its holding. We accordingly review de novo the timeliness of Tamplin's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   b. Timeliness of Tamplin's Request\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Tamplin's request to represent himself was timely. As just noted, we decide this question de novo, but we would reach the same decision even if we were to give deference under AEDPA. We reach this decision on two grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (1) Tamplin Continuously Represented Himself from February 10 Forward\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It is undisputed that Tamplin made an unequivocal request to represent himself on February 10, 2005, and that this request was granted. It is also undisputed that Morris appeared in the trial court on June 22; that the minute order for that day states that Morris requested a continuance in order to file a motion to substitute in as counsel; that Morris never made the motion for which he was granted a continuance on June 22; and that on June 24 Morris was suspended from practice. Because Morris never made the motion for which he was granted a continuance, he never legally represented Tamplin in the trial court. It necessarily follows that Tamplin represented himself in the trial court continuously from February 10 onward, and that he did not make a new request on June 30 to represent himself when he learned that Morris had been suspended from practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Our dissenting colleague contends that Morris was actually substituted in as Tamplin's counsel. We disagree. Our dissenting colleague characterizes the minute order of June 22 as \"not a picture of clarity,\" and writes that minute orders \"entered by the court on June 30 and July 8 reflect Morris as the defense counsel of\n   record and all parties, including Tamplin, proceeded as though Tamplin were represented by counsel (Morris).\" Diss. at 28. This is not a full description of the minute orders of June 30 and July 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Greg Morris's name is preprinted at the top of both minute orders, but the bodies of the minute orders tell a different story. The body of the June 30 minute order has two handwritten notations. Next to the heading \"MOTIONS,\" is handwritten, \"Deft requests to go Pro Per / Crt advises deft. that a waiver needs to be made.\" Below that, next the heading \"OTHER,\" is handwritten, \"Mr. Morris is not eligible to practice law.\" The body of the July 8 minute order has several handwritten notations. Under the heading \"ARRAIGNMENT-VDP,\" two boxes labeled \"(Re)appt.\" and \"ADO/\" are checked, and next to the boxes is handwritten the name \"K. Hall.\" Under the same heading, a box labeled \"Relieved\" is checked, and next to the box is handwritten the name \"G. Morris.\" Below that, under the heading \"MOTIONS,\" a box labeled \"denied\" is checked, and next to the box is handwritten \"Faretta mtn (time substantial factor).\" Finally, below that, under the heading \"OTHER\" is handwritten \"Greg Morris-unable to practice law at this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Far from showing that the parties treated Tamplin as \"represented by counsel (Morris),\" the June 30 and July 8 minute orders show that the court understood that Tamplin was not-indeed, could not be-represented by Morris. The June 30 minute order could not have been clearer: \"Mr. Morris is not eligible to practice law.\" During the July 8 hearing, the trial court said, \"Mr. Tamplin is present and has expressed a desire [to represent himself] given that Mr. Morris is unable to represent him at this time ....\" The only suggestion in the body of either minute order that Morris ever represented Tamplin in the trial court is the check in the July 8 minute order of the box labeled \"Relieved.\" In light of what had come before, that check cannot be reasonably read to indicate that Morris had ever successfully moved in the trial court to represent Tamplin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (2) Timely Request on June 30\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Even if we assume, counterfactually, that Tamplin made a new request to represent himself on June 30, as distinct from a request to continue to represent himself, his request was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the typical case of an untimely\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   request, the defendant is represented by counsel when the request is made. In that circumstance, granting a\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   motion would result in a delay that would not occur if counsel were permitted to continue to represent the defendant. A\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   request must therefore be made in a timely manner. But this is not that typical case. On June 30, when Tamplin indicated that he wished to continue to represent himself, he had already been representing himself for over four and a half months. He had appeared in the trial court with Morris on June 22 when Morris was granted a continuance to make a motion to substitute in as counsel (a motion that was never made), and he learned on June 30 that Morris could not represent him. As discussed above, Tamplin indicated unambiguously on June 30 that he wished to continue to represent himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For purposes of argument, we are willing to assume that Tamplin's request on June 30 was a new request, but, as we note, this was far from the typical\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   request. We are also willing to assume that July 14, the formally scheduled date, was a realistic trial date, but, as we note, the court continued the trial for six months after he denied Tamplin's request to represent himself.

The transcript of the July 2005 motion was not in the record on appeal and I did not get a copy of it (from appellant's wife) until yesterday, May 24, 2007. Once I saw it I realized my mistake and took immediate steps to bring this matter before the court.

And this court has also explained that although\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   \"clearly established some timing element,\" the \"precise contours of that element\" are unknown and \"[a]t most, we know that\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   requests made 'weeks before trials' are timely.\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

The timing of the renewed request was very close to trial and Tamplin admitted he could not be ready in time for the scheduled trial date. As this court has noted, \"\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   does not articulate a specific time frame pursuant to which a claim for self-representation qualifies as timely.\"\n   <em>\n    Stenson v.

Moreover, Tamplin's attempt to hire counsel shortly before trial, and for the acknowledged purpose of helping him with matters he did not feel he could personally handle, such as complying with rules of court, definitely calls into question the unequivocal nature of his request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2947692\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/873/#p884\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2947692\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/873/#p884\">\n    at 882-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Washington Supreme Court determination that petitioner's request was equivocal in light of the record as a whole was not objectively unreasonable). Although Tamplin was perhaps \"unequivocal\"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the point in time that he made his renewed request to represent himself,\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   certainly does not preclude the trial court's consideration of the entire record, nor offer any guidance whatsoever on what might constitute equivocation by a defendant, since the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   never wavered in his desire to represent himself in the way\n   Tamplin did here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In sum, I cannot find a holding of the Supreme Court that clearly requires relief under the circumstances present here, and its most recent pronouncements suggest otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kernan v.

In\n   <em>\n    Kernan\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court recently made clear that AEDPA does not permit: (1) granting relief where fairminded jurists could disagree with the reading of Supreme Court precedent, or (2) ordering relief when there was no Supreme Court decision clearly entitling the defendant to the relief he seeks, or (3) relying on circuit precedent, state court decisions, treatises, law review articles, or anything beyond established Supreme Court precedent for AEDPA purposes.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 9. Cognizant of these parameters, I find it is at least debatable under\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   whether Tamplin's renewed request was sufficiently timely and whether he was truly unequivocal in desiring to represent himself. Thus, in my opinion, Tamplin has not established that the state court's decision was \"in direct and irreconcilable conflict with Supreme Court precedent,\"\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238100\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/984/#p999\">\n    745 F.3d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , nor has he shown that the state court ruling applying\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   \"was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    562 U.S. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I would affirm the district court's denial of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The state habeas court cites both federal and state law regarding the timeliness of the motion, described\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    of the trial court's reasons for denying the request, including that \"timeliness is a substantial factor\" and then concluded that \"\n    <em>\n     under these circumstances,\n    </em>\n    \" the right to self-representation had not been violated. I view this as fully incorporating the trial court's reasoning and then elaborating further on its own. The habeas court also offered a third reason for denying Tamplin's petition, in that he did not subsequently renew his request to represent himself. I do not address the validity of this additional \"acquiescence\" reasoning because, as discussed below, I believe the first two reasons sufficient to uphold the ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    I acknowledge that in an older case,\n    <em>\n     Moore v.

The significance of this fact is not discussed in the opinion.
