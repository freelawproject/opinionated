Both defendants appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Allmendinger noted his appeal in November 2011, and we heard oral argument in December 2012. Allmendinger's appellate counsel made four principal arguments. First, counsel claimed that the district court had violated Allmendinger's Fifth Amendment rights by altering the superseding indictment mid-trial.\n   <em>\n    Allmendinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n    706 F.3d at 338-340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, counsel contended that the sentence was substantively unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n    at 343-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, counsel maintained that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable, because the district court erred in calculating the amount of loss attributable to Allmendinger under the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n    at 340-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fourth, counsel asserted that the sentence was also procedurally unreasonable because the sentencing court failed to address Allmendinger's argument that the sentence created an unwarranted disparity with the sentences of similarly situated defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We rejected all of these arguments and affirmed both the conviction and sentence in an opinion issued on January 23, 2013.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n    at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 29, 2013, we heard oral argument in Abdulwahab's companion appeal. His appellate counsel raised an issue not addressed in Allmendinger's appeal, namely, that the \"merger problem\" identified in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674087\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/507/\">\n    553 U.S. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674087\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/507/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674087\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/507/\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), barred Abdulwahab's money laundering convictions.

Accordingly, we reversed Abdulwahab's money laundering convictions, vacated his sentence, and remanded for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566487\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/521/#p528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566487\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/521/#p528\">\n    at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, the district court imposed the same sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

May 3, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Allmendinger, represented by new counsel, then filed this \u00a7 2255 action, claiming,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that his original appellate counsel provided ineffective representation by failing to raise the merger problem. The district court ordered that counsel to respond and, in a sworn declaration, appellate counsel explained that he had \"specifically considered\" raising the merger problem on appeal but decided not to, for strategic reasons. In particular, he \"did not believe this issue, even if successful, would ultimately lead to a reduction of Mr. Allmendinger's sentence,\" and counsel did not want to \"risk detracting from other issues that [he] believed had a greater likelihood, if successful, of significantly reducing\" the sentence. In appellate counsel's view, \"[s]imply obtaining the reversal of a single count or two in a fashion that in all likelihood would not impact the sentence was not ... a desirable outcome.\" Rather, counsel \"wanted to focus the Court of Appeals on what [he] believed to be the strongest grounds for appeal that might result in the reversal of all counts or could have a significant impact on the sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court denied habeas relief, rejecting Allmendinger's ineffective assistance claim. The court agreed that a merger problem existed and opined that, had Allmendinger's appellate counsel raised the issue on direct appeal, we would have overturned the money laundering convictions. Nonetheless, the district court concluded that failure to raise this issue did not amount to ineffective assistance because Allmendinger failed to meet either prong of the two-pronged test for performance and prejudice, as required by\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to the performance prong, the district court found that appellate counsel's failure to assert the \"merger problem\" constituted a \"reasonable tactical decision.\" The court explained that reversal of the money laundering convictions \"would\n   have had no impact\" on Allmendinger's sentence. For largely the same reason, the court held that Allmendinger also had failed to establish prejudice under the second prong because, even absent the money laundering charges, the court \"could-and would-have sentenced him again to 540 months of imprisonment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Habeas counsel timely noted this appeal. We granted a Certificate of Appealability on the question of \"whether Allmendinger's appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to present an argument premised on the merger problem articulated in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That clearly extends to the losses at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Regarding the scope of the conspiracy, the district court found that Allmendinger was a principal architect of a fraudulent scheme pursuant to which A &amp; O representatives lied to investors to attract their money and then lied again by telling investors that A &amp; O would use their money to pre-pay policy premiums (ensuring the policies would not lapse) when in fact the money was used by Allmendinger as a personal \"piggy bank.\"\n   <em>\n    Allmendinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049410\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/706/330/#p333\">\n    706 F.3d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In light of these findings, appellate counsel did not have a near-certain chance of success when arguing that the decision not to pay policy premiums, which occurred after Allmendinger left A &amp; O and caused A &amp; O investors to lose money, was not a reasonably foreseeable act taken by co-conspirators in pursuit of the criminal activity Allmendinger had agreed to join.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Appellate counsel also claimed that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable, because the district court did not address counsel's argument that the sentence created an unwarranted disparity with similarly situated defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).

We will assume (but not decide) that counsel may perform adequately if he has a \"strategic reason\" for not raising a \"clearly stronger\" claim. Even so, counsel's actions still must pass the test of reasonableness; not every purported \"strategic reason\" will do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162039\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/149/#p164\">\n    236 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   164 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, he chose to \"focus\" the appellate court on \"the strongest grounds for appeal that might result in the reversal of all counts or could have a significant impact on the sentence.\" The Government endorses this theory in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This purported strategic rationale rests on a faulty foundation. Neither appellate counsel nor the Government explains why, at the time of Allmendinger's appeal, it was reasonable for counsel to believe that overturning two counts of money laundering (which together accounted for 160 months of a 540-month sentence) would have no effect in resentencing proceedings. We can discern none from the record. When sentencing Allmendinger, the court suggested a 540-month sentence was appropriate, and it imposed count-specific sentences (running consecutively) to reach that total. At that time, the court did not in any way indicate that it would impose the same sentence in the absence of the two money laundering convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Government relies on the fact that, in these \u00a7 2255 habeas proceedings, the district court stated that it would have imposed the same sentence even if counsel\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   raised the merger problem on direct appeal and we had reversed the money laundering convictions. The Government also notes that, after we reversed the money laundering convictions in Abdulwahab's companion case on direct appeal, the district court imposed the same sentence. Reliance on these facts is misplaced, because we examine appellate counsel's performance at the time of the appeal, not in the light of subsequent events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341459\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/824/#p828\">\n    774 F.3d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Government also defends counsel's omission of the merger claim on the ground that reversing the money laundering counts would not have changed the applicable Guidelines range. Even if true, we reject the notion that it was reasonable for appellate counsel to assume, at the time of direct review, that the sentencing court would impose the same sentence in the face of the elimination of two counts of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, we find it difficult to accept appellate counsel's purported strategic rationale in light of its application here. Appellate counsel asserts in his declaration that he wanted to focus on the arguments most likely to have a \"significant impact\" on Allmendinger's sentence. Implicitly, then, he maintains that he believed that prevailing on any claim that he did raise-including the argument that the district court procedurally erred in failing to adequately explain the sentence it imposed-was\n   <em>\n    more likely\n   </em>\n   to result in a \"significant\" sentence reduction on remand than reversal of the two money laundering counts. Tellingly, neither appellate counsel nor the Government even attempt to explain why that would be so. It seems to us that this procedural-error claim in particular would be less likely to result in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   change to the sentence than an argument that would lead to the reversal of the money laundering counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because merger constituted a \"clearly stronger\" argument than the issues raised on direct appeal, and because appellate counsel does not identify any true strategic rationale for failing to raise merger, we hold that appellate counsel's performance was deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Under the second\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prong, Allmendinger must establish that\n   his appellate counsel's deficient performance caused him prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court concluded that Allmendinger failed to show prejudice because, even if appellate counsel had raised merger on direct appeal (and secured a reversal of the money laundering convictions), the district court would have imposed the same sentence. The Government adopts this position before us, claiming that Allmendinger must show that a reversal of the money laundering convictions would have changed his sentence on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But this is not the correct standard for assessing prejudice.
