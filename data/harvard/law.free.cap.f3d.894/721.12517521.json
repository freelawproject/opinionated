When he died, his brothers, Lewis and David Rhinehart (the \"Rhineharts\"), filed an amended complaint on behalf of his estate. After defendants filed motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, only the Rhineharts' Eighth Amendment claims against Dr. Adam Edelman and Dr. Vernon Stevenson (the \"Defendant Doctors\") remained. The district court granted summary judgment to the Defendant Doctors, and the Rhineharts appealed. For the reasons below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the summer of 2009, Rhinehart was an inmate at Alger Maximum Correctional Facility (\"Alger\") in Munising, Michigan. He was 58 years old but in poor health. He had been suffering from many medical conditions, including liver disease, and for the past four years, he had been experiencing general malaise, weight loss, and poor appetite. In August 2009, his prison doctor, Aster Berhane, ordered a CAT (\"CT\") scan of his abdominal area, which revealed a suspicion of bile duct cancer. The parties agree that Rhinehart did not in fact have cancer then or at any other time before his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   But that was unknown in the fall of 2009, so Dr. Berhane arranged to transfer Rhinehart downstate for further investigation of this potential cancer. She contacted defendant Dr. Edelman about transferring Rhinehart to Cotton Correctional Center (\"Cotton\"). Dr. Edelman was the medical director for utilization management at Corizon Health Inc. (\"Corizon\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a company responsible for on-site medical services\n   for all state inmates. He studied internal medicine, but his experience was mainly administrative. His job was to review requests for outside treatment, which other medical providers generally submitted on a form called a 407. Such requests were necessary for a prisoner to be referred to a specialist within Corizon's referral network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Berhane arranged an expedited, doctor-to-doctor transfer from Alger to Cotton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also submitted a 407 request to refer Rhinehart to an oncologist (cancer specialist) or hepatologist (liver specialist) for a biopsy of the potential cancer. Dr. Edelman approved the referral request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around that same time, Dr. Berhane also contacted defendant Dr. Stevenson-a general internist doctor, Corizon employee, and the senior doctor on staff at Cotton-to inform him about Rhinehart's medical issues. During his deposition, Dr. Stevenson testified that he understood that Rhinehart had \"very urgent issues\" and needed to be seen by a specialist for abnormal liver findings. R.263-3, Stevenson Dep., Page ID# 5025-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Rhineharts presented evidence that the Cotton facility assigned inmates to doctors based on their prison number, and that generally, an assigned doctor was responsible for developing an inmate's treatment plan and examining that inmate (unless the doctor was unavailable to do so). Rhinehart's prison number revealed that he was assigned to Dr. Stevenson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rhinehart was transferred to Cotton on October 26, 2009, but saw no doctor until about two months later. This delay is attributable to a failure by the nursing staff at Cotton in processing Rhinehart's intake and scheduling him for a medical-provider visit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the time that Rhinehart had not seen a doctor, he filed complaints and grievances expressing concern about not being referred for a biopsy of his liver to determine his cancer risk. He also asked to see a doctor because of increasing pain in his liver and abdominal area and consequent difficulty in performing his porter job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Stevenson testified that he did not receive notifications of inmate complaints or copies of grievances. But he recalled that in mid-December 2009, Cotton's Health Unit Manager, Beth Gardon, told him that Rhinehart had been at Cotton for six weeks and had not been seen for an intake. Upon hearing this, Dr. Stevenson directed Gardon to bring Rhinehart in for an appointment. The Cotton staff scheduled Rhinehart to see Dr. Stevenson three weeks later. When it came time for Rhinehart's appointment, however, Dr. Stevenson was too busy, so he arranged for another doctor, Dr. Padmaja Vemuri, to examine Rhinehart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From early January until the end of February 2010, Rhinehart had several appointments with prison medical providers but none with Dr. Stevenson. Dr. Vemuri first examined Rhinehart on January 4, 2010; he complained about weight loss and discomfort in his liver area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Vemuri\n   noted that a request for Rhinehart to be referred to an oncologist had already been approved, and she set forth a plan to have the oncology appointment made, to have laboratory testing conducted, and for Rhinehart to have an appointment with the gastrointestinal clinic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After this appointment, Rhinehart attended several more doctor appointments in January 2010 with Dr. Vemuri and another prison doctor, Dr. Zivit Cohen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 3, 2010, Dr. Cohen obtained approval for an ultrasound of Rhinehart's liver, which was completed about a week later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rhinehart was not satisfied with the care that he had received. He filed a grievance related to his first appointment with Dr. Vemuri in which he stated that he was experiencing severe pain and she failed to prescribe him pain medication. After that, he sent letters of complaints to medical and legal officials and filed a pro se lawsuit raising his concerns about his risk for cancer and the lack of care he was receiving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rhinehart's grievance for lack of pain medication was upheld on January 22, 2010. A little less than a month later, Dr. Cohen saw him for his complaints of abdominal discomfort and prescribed him pain medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly after that appointment, a Jackson, Michigan newspaper ran an article reporting that Rhinehart probably had cancer and was in pain but had not been given a referral to a specialist, a liver biopsy, a treatment plan, pain pills, or an explanation for the delay. The article was followed by a call from the ACLU to the Michigan Attorney General's Office. This call resulted in a few internal emails among prison medical staff that showed some confusion about whether Rhinehart's cancer risk had been ruled out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Three days after this exchange of emails, on February 25, 2010, Dr. Stevenson and Dr. Eddie Jenkins (the Regional Medical Director) examined Rhinehart. Rhinehart complained of abdominal pain, nausea, bilateral back and flank pain, blood in his urine, and a decreased urine stream. Dr. Stevenson \"reassured\" Rhinehart that he had no mass or cancer, ordered urine and laboratory tests, and scheduled a follow-up appointment in three weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After that, Dr. Cohen monitored Rhinehart. She regularly examined him, ordered laboratory tests, and treated his pain. On March 8, Dr. Cohen saw Rhinehart for his ESLD. Dr. Cohen conducted a physical exam and noted improvements, including that he presented with an \"okay\" appetite, stable weight, and a reduction in his pain under the prescribed pain medication. In April, Rhinehart had additional follow-up appointments. Dr. Cohen conducted another full examination, prescribed Ensure, ordered lab work, and scheduled a one-month follow-up appointment. Then in May, Dr. Cohen gave Rhinehart a detail for a \"light duty\" work assignment to accommodate his pain. And when Rhinehart reported increased pain, Dr. Cohen prescribed methadone for him, which, during his May follow-up appointment, Rhinehart reported was working well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But that summer, Rhinehart's condition took a turn for the worse. On June 20, 2010, about eight months after his transfer to Cotton, the Cotton medical staff transferred Rhinehart to the emergency room of Allegiance Hospital. The Cotton staff\n   sent him there because he had been complaining of bloating, increased pain in his spleen/liver, general malaise, and fatigue. At the hospital, he presented with constipation, hallucinating, and abdominal pain. He was admitted and treated until his discharge on June 30, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A brief review of the Rhineharts' medical literature and expert testimony is necessary here. Liver disease can lead to cirrhosis of the liver-the deterioration of the liver when scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue. Cirrhosis causes increased pressure in the veins that carry blood to and from the liver. This increased blood pressure can cause the formation of dilated veins in the esophagus, esophageal varices. These varices carry the risk of bleeding, a risk that increases along with the pressure and sizes of the varices. One way for a specialist to diagnose esophageal varices is by inserting a scope into the esophagus-a procedure known in the medical field as Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (\"EGD\") scoping. When esophageal varices are found, \"first level\" treatment includes prescribing medications such as beta blockers (which decrease blood pressure), EGD scoping and ligation banding performed by a specialist (which obliterate the varices), or some combination of both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Rhinehart was admitted into the hospital, he underwent a series of tests, including a CT scan of his abdomen with contrast, an MRI, and an ultrasound. These tests revealed no liver mass but extensive portal venous thrombosis (blood clotting in the vein that carries blood to the liver). His hospital records show that \"no definitive intervention was felt to be indicated other than beta blockers and an EGD to rule out/assess esophageal varices.\" R.259-2, Discharge Summary, Page ID# 4706. Dr. Lynn Schachinger, a hospital gastroenterologist, performed an EGD, which revealed four columns of esophageal varices with no active bleeding; he successfully placed seven ligation bands to obliterate the varices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his post-procedure report, Dr. Schachinger recommended that Rhinehart \"followup [sic] as an outpatient with the prison gastroenterologist for additional EGD with esophageal banding as necessary.\" R.177, Endoscopy Report, Page ID# 2421. In his deposition, Dr. Schachinger testified that \"the risk of [Rhinehart's] bleeding from [his varices] was higher because of the size of the varices\" and that if he had a patient with Rhinehart's conditions under his exclusive control, he would have reevaluated Rhinehart's varices a month later. R.263-13, Schachinger Dep., Page ID# 5399-4000. He also testified that he \"probably would have referred [such a patient] to a tertiary care center that performs a liver transplant to see if at some point that might become necessary,\" but emphasized that the decision to order a transplant would be \"up to the hepatologist\" as \"they deem necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Rhineharts' expert witness, gastroenterologist Dr. Stuart Finkel, agreed. In his deposition, he testified that in the weeks and months after Rhinehart's June 2010 hospitalization, \"[i]n the private world setting, Dr. Schachinger would have recalled the patient in a timely fashion for a repeat [EGD] and banding session.\" R.263-14, Finkel Dep., Page ID# 5442. He also agreed with Dr. Schachinger's opinion that he would have referred Rhinehart for evaluation for a liver transplant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The day after his discharge from the hospital, Dr. Cohen saw Rhinehart. She reviewed his hospital records, ordered lab work, prescribed a beta-blocker medication (Propranolol ) to reduce his blood pressure, and scheduled a one-week follow-up appointment. Rhinehart was not referred for follow-up appointments with a gastroenterologist. Instead, Dr. Cohen continued to\n   monitor Rhinehart that month, examining him on July 8 and again on July 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next month, August 2010, Dr. Stevenson left his employment with Corizon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Dr. Edelman was still working for Corizon, but he did not become re-involved in Rhinehart's healthcare until May 17, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In June 2011, the Cotton medical staff again sent Rhinehart to Allegiance Hospital's emergency room after he complained of increased abdominal pain. R.178, Progress Note, Page ID# 2437-40. An MRI showed \"progression of disease on comparison with previous imaging from June of 2010.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at Page ID# 2437. A CT-guided biopsy was negative for a malignancy. The gastroenterologist's discharge plan included a repeat MRI of Rhinehart's abdomen in four weeks and, if Rhinehart's tumor worsened, an evaluation at a tertiary care center.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at Page ID# 2437, 2439. Dr. Edelman approved the request for Rhinehart to have an MRI of his liver on July 5, 2011. The results were unchanged in comparison to the MRI completed a month earlier. The MRI also showed blockage of the portal vein (the vein that carries blood to the liver). After Rhinehart had blood drawn, Dr. Nancy McGuire, who was now Rhinehart's medical provider, discussed his case with Dr. Edelman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Around this same time, Rhinehart had moved for a temporary restraining order requesting that he be seen by a hepatologist, oncologist, or qualified liver specialist to be evaluated for a liver transplant-the only curative treatment option for ESLD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In responding to the motion, Dr. Edelman and Dr. Kosierowski (an oncologist and Corizon consultant) signed affidavits. They declared that they had discussed Rhinehart's case and had determined that there was no need to send Rhinehart to a specialist. R.258-4, Affidavits of Dr. Edelman and Dr. Kosierowski, Page ID# 4500-09. Both Dr. Edelman and Dr. Kosierowski stated in their affidavits that Rhinehart likely did not have cancer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As for a liver transplant, they avowed that Rhinehart was an unlikely candidate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In his affidavit, Dr. Edelman explained how liver transplants are assigned and why Rhinehart was not realistically eligible to receive one:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Liver transplants are judged by the Model for End-State Liver Disease (MELD) system to prioritize patients waiting for a liver transplant. The range is from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill). The individual score determines how urgently a patient needs a liver transplant within the next three months. The number is calculated using the most recent laboratory tests. Mr. Rhinehart, based on his most recent laboratory tests, would likely score very low on the scale and therefore would not be considered for transplant at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4507-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In his deposition years later, Dr. Finkel disputed Dr. Edelman's and Dr. Kosierowski's opinions about Rhinehart's eligibility for a liver transplant. He opined that \"livers are allocated to patients who are in the worst condition. And then, if nobody is\n   available who is a match, it goes down the line to better candidates. Maybe he would have received a liver, maybe he wouldn't have received a liver, but he would have been a candidate.\" R.263-14, Finkel Dep., Page ID# 5442. Dr. Finkel admitted that Rhinehart's MELD score of 7 (out of 40) \"would not have placed him at the top of the list for [a] liver transplant\" but opined that \"contrary to Dr. Edelman's testimony, it would not have eliminated him or knocked him out of contention.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Finkel also testified that because Rhinehart had such a low MELD score, he \"probably would have done very well with a liver transplant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 12, 2011, Dr. Edelman had a telemedicine appointment with Rhinehart. During the appointment, Dr. Edelman rejected Rhinehart's request to see an outside liver specialist for evaluation for a liver transplant. He reiterated that based on Rhinehart's blood work, his liver health was too good for him to qualify, and Dr. Edelman assured Rhinehart that the prison medical staff could provide his necessary treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Two weeks later, on October 26, 2011, Rhinehart was rushed to Allegiance Hospital after he reported abdominal pain and vomiting large amounts of blood. Dr. Schachinger performed an emergency EGD, discovered four columns of severe esophageal varices that were bleeding, and successfully treated them with ligation banding. At his deposition, Dr. Schachinger testified that if Rhinehart's varices had been monitored after the first banding procedure in June 2010, and if additional banding had occurred, it was possible that this bleed could have been prevented. Dr. Finkel agreed. In his deposition, he opined that the likelihood of Rhinehart's esophagus bleeding in October 2011 \"would have been reduced or eliminated entirely\" if Dr. Schachinger's recommendation for follow-up gastroenterologist appointments in June 2010 were followed. R.263-14, Finkel, Dep., Page ID# 5441.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After treating Rhinehart in October 2011, Dr. Schachinger laid out a recommended plan of care in his post-procedure report. One of his recommendations was that Rhinehart's prison doctors transfer him to a tertiary care institution to undergo a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (\"TIPS\") procedure, which is used to decompress the pressure in the portal vein to decrease the risk of esophageal bleeding. R.259-2, Endoscopy Report, Page ID# 4713. He recommended that \"the transfer should occur if [Rhinehart] has additional bleeding\" because more banding would not be an option.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He summarized Rhinehart's condition: \"The patient's prognosis is quite poor and guarded at this time and there is a fair chance that this is going to bleed again and he may bleed to death and I recommend that he be transferred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In his deposition, Dr. Schachinger testified that he recommended that Rhinehart's healthcare providers \"consider a TIPS procedure\" because it was \"medically ... the right move,\" as Rhinehart had severe varices, which had bled, and a TIPS has been shown to decrease his risk of bleeding. R.263-13, Schachinger Dep., Page ID# 5403. He opined that this procedure would have stopped esophageal bleeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But he also recognized that there are serious risks in performing a TIPS, including a chance of the patient developing brain disease.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 5407.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. Finkel testified that a TIPS is the \"gold standard\" of treatment for patients with esophageal varices. R.263-14, Finkel Dep., Page ID# 5435. He opined that a TIPS is \"a minimally invasive procedure,\" that a patient with Rhinehart's MELD score would \"have a 100 percent chance of survival following [a] TIPS for the first\n   year,\" and that Rhinehart \"had the potential of living for another five years without a liver transplant\" had he received the TIPS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 5440.

In his report, Dr. Al-Shihabi wrote that Dr. Edelman \"denied this transfer and he said that we just need to continue monitoring the patient here, even though Dr. Schachinger said that if the patient bleeds he cannot do to [sic] anything and the patient will be unstable to be transferred or do anything and the patient will definitely die.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Almost a year later, in January 2013, Rhinehart slipped and fell on a wet surface and broke his hip. Rhinehart agreed to undergo surgery to repair the injury, but unfortunately,\n   he did not survive the recovery. He died of a morphine overdose in February 2013 because his liver could not metabolize the morphine used to control his pain. He suffered no esophageal bleed between October 2011 and his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This action began on March 29, 2011, when Rhinehart filed a pro se lawsuit alleging that his medical providers were ignoring his pain, fear of cancer, and his desire to receive a liver transplant. The district court denied his emergency injunctive motions, and this court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhinehart\n   </em>\n   , 509 F. App'x at 516. Soon after, Rhinehart passed away, and his brothers (as joint personal representatives of his estate) then filed an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Defendant Doctors moved for summary judgment on the Rhineharts' claims of deliberate indifference to Rhinehart's serious medical needs. The magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation to deny summary judgment, and the district court adopted the Report and Recommendation in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   About a year later, with the case going on to trial, the Defendant Doctors raised a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   challenge against Dr. Finkel. They objected to Dr. Finkel's testifying about Rhinehart's alleged fear of cancer and pain and suffering from not being evaluated for a TIPS procedure. The district court granted the motion in part. It decided that Dr. Finkel could testify \"consistent with his expertise,\" about \"Rhinehart's fears\" because \"any emotional or physical harm he suffered as a result of their indifference is relevant to the damages Plaintiffs seek.\" But the court precluded testimony on whether \"Rhinehart suffered physical pain due merely to hypertension\" because \"[n]one of the materials before the Court ... assures the Court that [Dr.] Finkel's opinion [on that topic] is based upon sufficient facts and reliable methods.\" The district court ordered the Rhineharts to give \"one day's notice before calling Finkel\" to testify so that the court could hold \"a short hearing\" on \"precisely what Finkel intends to offer and to make any necessary rulings that will curb impermissible testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion was still pending, the Defendant Doctors filed their second motion for summary judgment. They argued that this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mattox v.

They also relied on the\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   trial depositions of Dr. Stieve and Dr. Kosierowski. After the district court ruled on the Defendant Doctors'\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion, it granted summary judgment in their favor.\n   <em>\n    Rhinehart v.

Sept. 7, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The district court held that because the Rhineharts' case was based on the treatments Rhinehart did and did not receive for his ESLD, they had to show \"that Rhinehart's needs were diagnosed by physicians as mandating treatment and that Defendants failed to treat him or so inadequately treated him that he suffered a verified medical injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court determined that at all relevant times Rhinehart received some treatment for his ESLD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-10. It rejected the Rhineharts' claims against Dr. Stevenson because they presented no \"verified medical evidence\" that Rhinehart suffered a harm because of Dr. Stevenson's alleged failings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-7. Similarly, the court determined that the Rhineharts failed to introduce \"verified medical evidence\" showing harm from either Dr. Edelman's failure to ensure that Rhinehart saw a specialist in\n   early 2010 or his failure to refer him for evaluation for a liver transplant in October 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7, *10-11. Finally, in addressing Dr. Edelman's denial of a specialist's request for Rhinehart to be evaluated for a TIPS procedure, the court determined that this \"amounted to a mere disagreement among medical professionals\" and thus did not constitute deliberate indifference to Rhinehart's serious medical needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Rhineharts appealed and challenge the district court's decisions on the Defendant Doctors' second motion for summary judgment and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Richmond v.

We agree with the district court; this is not a case involving cursory treatment amounting to no treatment at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Rhinehart's long prison medical file shows that his Cotton medical providers monitored and treated his ESLD and its symptoms, including esophageal varices and ascites. He had regular appointments with medical providers who examined him, noted his liver disease, and evaluated his symptoms. He underwent lab tests, ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans. His prison doctors prescribed him medication for his pain, and when he reported increased pain, his doctors prescribed stronger medication. When his condition worsened, his medical providers sent him to the hospital, where he received specialist treatment, including EGD scoping and ligation banding for his esophageal varices and paracentesis for his ascites (a process for draining accumulated fluid from the abdomen). And after his varices were discovered, he was prescribed beta blockers to reduce his blood pressure, a recognized \"first-level\" treatment for that condition. No reasonable jury could find that Rhinehart's ESLD treatment amounted to no treatment at all with respect to when Dr. Stevenson was involved in Rhinehart's care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dominguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5584135\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/543/#p551\">\n    555 F.3d at 550-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that inmate's care amounted to no treatment at all when inmate presented with severe heat exhaustion and vomited during examination, but nurse provided only cursory examination and returned him to his non-air-conditioned cube with instructions to drink water and take aspirin).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thus, the Rhineharts' claim against Dr. Stevenson is properly considered an adequacy-of-care claim.

Their expert did not so testify, and they point to no medical articles showing that this desired treatment plan was necessary. Lacking that evidence, they argue that a jury could find that specialist treatment was necessary based on Dr. Berhane's 2009 request for Rhinehart to be transferred to another prison on an expedited basis coupled with her 407 request that Rhinehart be referred to a specialist for a liver biopsy. But neither the context of Rhinehart's transfer nor Dr. Berhane's specialist consultation request\n   advances the Rhineharts' argument that Rhinehart needed prompt and regular specialist treatment for his ESLD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Dr. Berhane's requests were based on a suspicious tumor, not a need for ESLD treatment. The record shows that in September 2009, after Rhinehart underwent a CT scan that revealed a high suspicion for cancer, Dr. Berhane contacted Dr. Edelman, discussed Rhinehart's medical needs, and submitted a formal consultation request. Dr. Berhane recommended that Rhinehart be approved to see an oncologist or hepatologist for a tissue biopsy of his liver. R.263-9, Consultation Request, Page ID# 5193-94. The 407 form that Dr. Berhane submitted provides: \"Request consult for tissue biopsy of these highly suspicious findings for a ... tumor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5193. Of course, Rhinehart never had cancer, and the Rhineharts' Eighth Amendment claim is not based on harm caused by this tumor. Yet the Rhineharts argue that this request for a prompt specialist referral and biopsy would allow a jury to find that Rhinehart needed to see a specialist for his ESLD. But Dr. Berhane's request that Rhinehart see a specialist to evaluate his potential cancer says nothing about a need for ESLD treatment. The 407 listed ESLD under \"Presumed Diagnosis\" but never mentioned any need for Rhinehart to see a specialist for treatment for his ESLD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In sum, Dr. Berhane's requests do not support the Rhineharts' claim that prompt and regular specialist treatment was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Without evidence that Rhinehart's ESLD required regular specialist monitoring, the Rhineharts argue that Rhinehart's ESLD included a \"high\" probability of his developing esophageal varices and that this condition can be discovered by EGD scoping, which can be done by only a specialist. Thus, they argue, Rhinehart required prompt and regular specialist care to monitor for esophageal varices, and because he did not receive it, a jury could find that his treatment was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   But the fact that esophageal varices can be diagnosed by EGD scoping does not establish that specialist monitoring and EGD scoping were \"medical necessit[ies]\" when Rhinehart was transferred to Cotton.\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n    701 F.

For starters, the Rhineharts' medical literature explains that these treatments constitute only one method for discovering varices, along with x-rays and lab tests. R. 315-3, Medical Lit., Page ID# 7803. Rhinehart saw his prison doctors regularly and underwent several lab tests. And when Rhinehart complained of increasing discomfort in June 2010, his prison medical providers transferred him to the hospital, where his esophageal varices were discovered during an EGD scoping procedure. Allegations \"that more should have been done by way of diagnosis and treatment\" and \"suggest[ions]\" of other \"options that were not pursued\" raise at most a claim of medical malpractice, not a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim.\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p102\">\n    429 U.S. at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p102\">\n    97 S.Ct. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Rhineharts' medical literature says nothing about when, how often, or even if an ESLD patient should see a specialist before he is diagnosed with esophageal varices. And they presented no expert medical testimony on this. The Rhineharts have thus shown only a desire for a more aggressive treatment, and they have failed to introduce the requisite evidence for a jury to find that this treatment was necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n    701 F.

Post-Hospitalization\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   When Rhinehart was in the hospital in June 2010, Dr. Schachinger performed\n   an EGD scope, which revealed four columns of esophageal varices with no active bleeding, and he successfully placed seven esophageal bands to obliterate the varices. In his post-procedure report, he recommended that Rhinehart continue taking Propranolol (a beta-blocker medication that reduces blood pressure) and \"followup [sic] as an outpatient with the prison gastroenterologist for additional EGD with esophageal banding as necessary.\" R.177, Endoscopy Report, Page ID# 2421.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   When Rhinehart was discharged from the hospital, his \"discharge instructions\" included an order for blood work that morning and \"[p]rimary care provider followup [sic] within one week.\" R.259-2, Discharge Instructions, Page ID# 4706. In accord with these instructions, Dr. Cohen examined Rhinehart at the prison the day after his discharge. Dr. Cohen reviewed Rhinehart's hospital records, ordered blood work, and started Rhinehart on Propranolol to reduce his blood pressure and prevent esophageal bleeding. Rhinehart was not referred for follow-up appointments with a gastroenterologist. Instead, Dr. Cohen monitored him, examining him on July 8 and July 19. Dr. Stevenson's employment with Corizon ended the next month, August 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Given Dr. Schachinger's recommendation, the Rhineharts argue that before Dr. Stevenson's departure he provided Rhinehart with inadequate care because he failed to refer Rhinehart to a specialist for further EGD scoping and ligation banding. They contend that specialist monitoring and EGD scoping were the only appropriate treatments and assert that because Dr. Stevenson did not order these, Rhinehart endured an esophageal bleed fourteen months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Rhineharts' medical literature shows that, once discovered, the \"first level\" treatment for esophageal varices is either use of medications such as beta blockers or EGD scoping and ligation banding performed by a specialist, or a combination of the two. In his post-procedure report, Rhinehart's hospital doctor, Dr. Schachinger, recommended both. Dr. Schachinger later testified that the risk of Rhinehart's bleeding from his varices was \"higher because of the size of the varices\" and that if he had a patient with Rhinehart's conditions under his exclusive control, he probably would have reevaluated Rhinehart's varices a month later and treated them if necessary. R.263-13, Schachinger Dep., Page ID# 5399-400. During his deposition, Dr. Finkel testified that he agreed with Dr. Schachinger. He explained that in the weeks and months after his hospitalization, \"[i]n the private world setting, Dr. Schachinger would have recalled the patient in a timely fashion for a repeat [EGD] and banding session.\" R.263-14, Finkel Dep., Page ID# 5442.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   A prison doctor's failure to follow an outside specialist's recommendation does not necessarily establish inadequate care.

The same was true here. Though Dr. Cohen did not follow all of Dr. Schachinger's recommendations, she examined Rhinehart and prescribed a recognized medication for his esophageal varices, beta-blocker medication. As in\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   , the Rhineharts had the burden of introducing\n   medical proof that this was inadequate treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We need not decide whether Dr. Schachinger's and Dr. Finkel's respective testimony about what they would have done is enough to create a fact dispute about the adequacy of Rhinehart's care.

Certainly, a jury is entitled to find reckless a doctor who fails to act in such a situation. But a doctor's observing a serious medical problem, failing to locate its cause, and refusing to take further action is quite different from the situation here, where Dr. Cohen treated her patient with a recognized medication. In short, the Rhineharts have failed to enter evidence from which a jury could find that it would have been obvious to any treating physician that Rhinehart needed to see a gastroenterologist after surgery rather than receive beta blockers and general internist monitoring to control his esophageal varices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Because a reasonable jury could not find that the Rhineharts established the objective and subjective components of the their deliberate-indifference claim against Dr. Stevenson, the district court properly granted summary judgment in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   B. Dr. Edelman\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Dr. Edelman was the medical director for \"Utilization Management\" at Corizon. In that position, he was an administrative, non-treating doctor who approved or denied specialist medical referrals that treating doctors sought for their patients. The Rhineharts allege that Dr. Edelman showed deliberate indifference to Rhinehart's serious medical needs at three distinct times: (1) after he approved a specialist consultation for Rhinehart but failed to ensure that Rhinehart was promptly referred for specialist care, (2) in October 2011 when he denied Rhinehart's request to see a specialist for evaluation for a liver transplant, and (3) in October 2011 when\n   he denied a specialist's recommendation that Rhinehart be referred for an evaluation for a TIPS procedure. The Rhineharts' first allegation, like that against Dr. Stevenson, fails because the Rhineharts have not introduced evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that Rhinehart's ESLD required a prompt specialist referral.

Mass. 2016) (holding that objective prong of prisoner's Eighth Amendment claim not satisfied when claim was based on prison doctor's failure to refer inmate for a liver transplant when inmate had a low MELD score of 11). Presented with only Dr. Finkel's testimony, no reasonable jury could find by a preponderance of the evidence that a referral for a liver transplant would have alleviated Rhinehart's symptoms because it could not find that a referral would have resulted in Rhinehart's receiving a new liver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Even if the Rhineharts had shown that a liver transplant was medically necessary and that Rhinehart suffered harm from Dr. Edelman's failure to send him for the referral, their claim would still fail because they failed to show that Dr. Edelman acted with deliberate indifference to Rhinehart's medical needs. The Rhineharts needed to show that Dr. Edelman consciously disregarded a substantial risk to Rhinehart's health. But they presented no evidence that when Dr. Edelman declined to refer Rhinehart for a consultation, he knew that Rhinehart would have been a realistic candidate for a new liver. Even if Rhinehart were a realistic candidate for a liver transplant, if Dr. Edelman subjectively believed that Rhinehart were not, then he could not have been deliberately indifferent in denying a consultation referral. A refusal based on incorrect knowledge shows no more than negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The evidence confirms that when Dr. Edelman rejected Rhinehart's request, he believed that Rhinehart was not realistically eligible for a liver transplant. At that time, Rhinehart's liver condition had been regularly monitored through examinations and testing. And shortly before Rhinehart asked Dr. Edelman to refer him for a liver transplant consultation, he had undergone blood tests. R.259-1, Clinical Progress Note, Page ID# 4677-78. Dr. Edelman was aware of these tests, as he had discussed the results with Rhinehart's treating doctor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354706\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/634/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Edelman had also discussed Rhinehart's case with Dr. Kosierowski, a Corizon oncologist and consultant. They determined that there was no need to send Rhinehart for an evaluation for a liver transplant. R.258-4, Affidavits of Dr. Edelman and Dr. Kosierowski, Page ID# 4500-09. In fact, because Rhinehart filed a lawsuit at that time, Dr. Edelman signed an affidavit explaining his medical opinion that Rhinehart was not a candidate for a liver transplant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354706\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/634/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 4507-08. Based on Dr. Edelman's understanding of the process for determining which patients may receive a new liver (a process which the Rhineharts do not contest), Rhinehart's MELD score placed him near the bottom of the list (7 on a scale ranging from 6 to 40, with a 40 representing the top of the list). Based on this information, Dr. Edelman swore that he believed that Rhinehart was not a candidate for a liver transplant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Years later, Dr. Finkel disputed Dr. Edelman's opinion about Rhinehart's eligibility for a liver transplant. But this does not show that Dr. Edelman knew (when he made the decision) that Rhinehart may have been realistically eligible for a transplant. Though Dr. Finkel opined that Rhinehart had a chance at receiving a liver, he admitted that Rhinehart's MELD score of 7 \"would not have placed him at the top of the list for [a] liver transplant.\" R.263-14, Finkel Dep., Page ID# 5442. So his opinion does not directly contradict that of Dr. Edelman. More important, however, Dr. Finkel's opinion falls short of what a jury would need to infer that Dr. Edelman knew that he was denying Rhinehart a realistic chance at receiving a liver. At most, Dr. Finkel's testimony establishes a dispute about whether Rhinehart objectively had a chance of receiving a liver. This is not enough. To infer that Dr. Edelman knew that Rhinehart had a chance at receiving a liver, the Rhineharts would need to put forth evidence showing that \"any doctor would have known\" that someone in Rhinehart's condition would have been realistically eligible for a liver transplant.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LeMarbe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498867\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/429/#p439\">\n    266 F.3d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Dr. Sarnelle explained that any general surgeon would have known, upon discovering five liters of bile in LeMarbe's abdomen ... that LeMarbe had to be referred immediately to a specialist who could locate and stop the leak if the surgeon was unable\n   to do so himself.\").

Denial of a Specialist's Recommendation that Rhinehart be Referred for an Evaluation for a TIPS Procedure\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   When his esophageal varices bled in October 2011, Rhinehart was admitted to the hospital and Dr. Schachinger performed an emergency banding procedure. After the procedure, Dr. Schachinger wrote a report that recommended a treatment plan. One recommendation was that Rhinehart be transferred to a tertiary care institution to undergo a TIPS procedure to lower the tension in his portal vein and prevent any more bleeding. R.259-2, Endoscopy Report, Page ID# 4713. He advised that \"the transfer should occur if [Rhinehart] has additional bleeding\" because more banding would not be an option.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498867\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/429/#p439\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He warned that \"there is a fair chance that this is going to bleed again and he may bleed to death and I recommend that he be transferred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498867\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/429/#p439\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Dr. Al-Shihabi, the hospitalist who saw Rhinehart at that time, also wrote a report.

R.259-2, Progress Report, Page ID# 4715. According to Al-Shihabi, he spoke with Dr. Edelman and Dr. Stieve about transferring Rhinehart.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498867\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/429/#p439\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 4715-16.

As with the denial of a referral for a liver-transplant consultation, the Rhineharts' claim is that adequate care required a particular treatment. Thus, this court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   again governs their claim. The Rhineharts must present medical proof that the inmate's symptoms \"would have been alleviated by\" a TIPS and that the inmate's condition \"required\" that treatment.\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n    701 F. App'x at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Rhineharts' claim fails on the first prong. Dr. Schachinger's and Dr. Al-Shihabi's respective hospital reports show that a TIPS was recommended to prevent Rhinehart's esophagus from re-bleeding. Dr. Schachinger confirmed this in his deposition. R.263-13, Schachinger Dep., Page ID# 5403. When the Rhineharts' own expert was asked about the TIPS procedure, he explained that it would \"lower[ ] the pressure\" in the esophageal varices and \"would have substantially reduced the risk of rebleeding.\" R.263-14, Finkel Dep., Page ID# 5435, 5440. But after Dr. Edelman denied the request for Rhinehart to be evaluated for a TIPS procedure Rhinehart never suffered another re-bleed. Because Rhinehart never again experienced that symptom, the Rhineharts cannot use a TIPS's effectiveness at preventing esophageal bleeding to show that it would have alleviated his symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   So the Rhineharts had to show that a TIPS procedure would have alleviated some other symptom. Recognizing this, they contend that a TIPS would have had other beneficial effects. They mainly assert that a TIPS would have alleviated pain caused by Rhinehart's ascites, which he endured until his death. They point to Rhinehart's medical records showing that after the denial of a TIPS he continued to experience abdominal pain and distension around his liver area up until his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Rhineharts' medical literature provides that the first form of treatment for ascites is reducing the patient's salt and alcohol consumption and prescribing oral diuretics (water pills). R. 345-6, Medical Lit., Page ID# 8802, 8807, 8812. If those treatments are insufficient, doctors use paracentesis (a needle inserted into the abdomen) to drain the fluid in the abdomen.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 8802, 8808. And if paracentesis does not control fluid accumulation, the doctor may recommend that the patient undergo a TIPS procedure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 8802, 8808, 8812. This might occur where a patient has \"difficult to treat ascites,\" has \"loculated fluid,\" or is \"unwilling or unable to receive frequent paracentesis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 8802, 8809. Accordingly, paracentesis is the \"most widely accepted treatment\" for patients with severe ascites, and doctors only turn to a TIPS procedure in certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 8809. For these \"appropriately selected patients,\" a TIPS procedure is considered a highly effective way to treat ascites and mitigate pain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12405342\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/701/460/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 8809; R.315-3, Medical Lit., Page ID# 7813.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The problem for the Rhineharts is that they have not pointed to any medical evidence showing that Rhinehart fell within the group of ascites patients for which a TIPS procedure was medically necessary. Instead, the record reflects that Rhinehart was prescribed diuretics and underwent paracentesis to treat his ascites. And since the Rhineharts do not contend that Rhinehart had \"difficult to treat ascites\" or \"loculated fluid,\" that Rhinehart was unwilling or unable to receive frequent paracentesis, or that the diuretics and paracentesis were not working, we cannot conclude that Rhinehart's treatment was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Moreover, even if the Rhineharts had shown that the diuretics and paracentesis did not effectively alleviate Rhinehart's pain, the record shows that Rhinehart received an alternative treatment for his pain-regular monitoring and pain medication. The Rhineharts have presented no medical proof that this was an inadequate treatment plan.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

As the district court explained, whether a jury could find that Dr. Edelman acted with deliberate indifference depends on whether he exercised medical judgment-whether the decision amounted\n   to a disagreement among physicians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p102\">\n    429 U.S. at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p102\">\n    97 S.Ct. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a poor exercise of medical judgment would constitute medical malpractice, which would fail to rise to the level of a constitutional violation);\n   <em>\n    Rhinehart\n   </em>\n   , 509 F. App'x at 513 (\"Neither negligence alone, nor a disagreement over the wisdom or correctness of a medical judgment is sufficient for the purpose of a deliberate indifference claim.\"). Because the record shows that Dr. Edelman made a medical judgment in declining to refer Rhinehart for a TIPS procedure, the Rhineharts cannot establish the subjective component of their claim against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The record reveals that when Dr. Edelman decided against transferring Rhinehart for consideration for a TIPS procedure, he consulted with Dr. Stieve. That Dr. Stieve played a role in Dr. Edelman's decision was important because during his deposition, Dr. Stieve described his familiarity with Rhinehart's liver condition and the TIPS procedure. Dr. Stieve testified that \"[e]sophageal varices banding was a very common thing\" for him to be involved with and that he \"would often evaluate inmates to see whether they were a candidate for a TIPS procedure.\" R.340-1, Stieve Dep., Page ID# 8589. He explained that he \"had been involved with approving other TIPS procedures for other inmates,\" and that \"those inmates had different circumstances\" like preparing for a liver transplant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Page ID# 8590.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In an administrative note, Dr. Stieve discussed the reasons for denying Rhinehart's referral for a TIPS evaluation. R.259-1, Progress Note, Page ID# 4689. In that note, he explained that he and Dr. Edelman recognized that a TIPS could reduce a hypothetical risk of re-bleed but that the procedure would not prolong Rhinehart's life and came with an increased risk of brain disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, he explained that the doctors refused to transfer Rhinehart for a TIPS consult after weighing the potential health benefits that the procedure could provide against the potential side-effects-a process that required medical judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Rhineharts dispute that Dr. Stieve had any role in Dr. Edelman's decision. They recycle an argument that they made to the district court that Dr. Stieve only \"concurred\" with Dr. Edelman's decision and that Dr. Stieve could not make the decision. As the district court held, however, Dr. Stieve's testimony that he concurred with Dr. Edelman that Rhinehart should not be transferred does not mean that he had no input or influence on the decision. Dr. Stieve's administrative note shows that he and Dr. Edelman discussed the merits of transferring Rhinehart. And Dr. Stieve testified that he discussed Rhinehart's case with Dr. Al-Shihabi and explained why not transferring Rhinehart would be advisable. R.340-1, Stieve Dep., Page ID# 8589. Moreover, Dr. Edelman testified that he had \"denied the transfer because [he] talked to Dr. Stieve about it.\" R.263-2, Edelman Dep., Page ID# 5001. Thus, the district court correctly considered Dr. Stieve's medical judgment and input in determining whether Dr. Edelman employed medical reasoning in making the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Both the Rhineharts and Judge Moore in her separate opinion also argue that Dr. Edelman's decision was not a medical judgment because it was an illegitimate decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants' Br. at 25; Reply Br. at 22; Concurring and Dissenting Op. at 760 (\"[A] rational factfinder could conclude that [Dr.] Edelman's justification for denying Rhinehart a TIPS procedure was mere pretext to mask deliberate indifference.\"). They contend that given Dr. Schachinger's recommendation that Rhinehart be referred for consideration for a TIPS procedure, Dr. Edelman too heavily\n   weighed (or unreasonably considered) the danger of Rhinehart's developing brain disease. Their strongest evidence comes from Dr. Finkel's testimony. He opined that a TIPS procedure would have increased Rhinehart's \"chance of living from his end-stage liver disease\" and would have come with a \"less than 20 percent\" risk of developing brain disease. R.263-14, Finkel Dep., Page ID# 5440. This testimony questions the correctness of Dr. Edelman's decision. But it does not provide enough evidence for a jury to conclude that Dr. Edelman's decision was not a medical one. We know this because even Dr. Schachinger, the very doctor who suggested that Rhinehart be considered for a TIPS procedure, testified that Dr. Edelman's reasoning was legitimate. During his deposition, he was asked whether, considering his recommendation, there was \"any legitimate reason\" for Dr. Edelman to deny Rhinehart a referral for consideration for a TIPS procedure. R.263-13, Schachinger Dep., Page ID# 5407. Dr. Schachinger responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   A: ... It looks like they were concerned-rightly so-that there are certainly side effects and other co-morbidities that can occur because of the TIPS like [brain disease ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, the very doctor who recommended that Rhinehart be considered for a TIPS acknowledged that Dr. Edelman was \"rightly\" concerned about the risks of side effects from that procedure. Dr. Schachinger's testimony is significant not because it shows that Dr. Edelman and Dr. Stieve made the right decision, but because it shows that the medical reasons relied on by Dr. Edelman and Dr. Stieve were legitimate, not pretextual. Thus, Dr. Finkel's disagreement with Dr. Edelman and Dr. Stieve at most raises an issue of medical malpractice not deliberate indifference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Finally, the Rhineharts attack Dr. Edelman's weighing of the risk of brain disease because, as they assert, Rhinehart had already been \"experiencing symptoms\" of brain disease before Dr. Edelman denied the referral. They also argue that even if this condition worsened after a TIPS, it could be managed with medication and treatment. R.296-3, Medical Lit., Page ID# 7083-88, 7123-26. But this cannot show that Dr. Edelman's decision involved no medical judgment. First, that Rhinehart had brain disease before Dr. Edelman's decision finds no support in his medical record. The Rhineharts point to no diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and instead cite only his having complained about experiencing sporadic \"mental clouding\" and \"confusion.\" R.259-1, Medical Record, Page ID# 4629, 4640.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   And even taking as true that Rhinehart experienced symptoms much like brain disease at some point before Dr. Edelman's decision, this does not render illegitimate Dr. Edelman's having considered the risk of brain disease in making his call on the TIPS referral. The last time Rhinehart had complained of confusion, according to the medical records that the Rhineharts proffer, was March 2010-more than eighteen months before Dr. Edelman made his decision. So Dr. Edelman would have been justified in considering that Rhinehart had not experienced these symptoms in over a year and a half. In any event, Rhinehart's having experienced symptoms of brain disease and his risk of developing brain disease from a new procedure are two different ills. A doctor contemplating a patient's treatment would likely commit malpractice if he failed to consider the latter even if he knew about the former. Thus, Dr. Edelman had good reason to consider this additional side-effect, and the fact that he did so does not render his decision a nonmedical one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Because a reasonable jury could not find that the Rhineharts established the objective\n   and subjective components of the their deliberate-indifference claim against Dr. Edelman, the district court properly granted summary judgment in his favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Rhinehart sued his prison doctors under the Eighth Amendment, alleging that they inflicted \"cruel and unusual punishments\" on him.

As the Rhineharts' submissions make clear, cirrhosis causes portal hypertension, and portal hypertension in turn can cause both ascites and varices, the former of which is painful and the latter of which can kill.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 315-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7802-03); R. 327-2 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #8268); R. 345-6 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #8804). During his June 2010 hospitalization, Rhinehart was treated for both: approximately half a liter of ascitic fluid was removed from his abdomen via paracentesis, and an emergency scoping (or \"EGD\") and banding procedure was performed on his varices. R. 259-2 (June 2010 Discharge Summary at 2-3) (Page ID #4706-07) (*sealed*). Dr. Lynn Schachinger, who did the scoping and banding, accordingly recommended that Rhinehart see a \"gastroenterologist for additional EGD with esophageal banding as necessary,\" R. 177 (Medical Records) (Page ID #2421), noting Rhinehart's \"high risk for both esophageal varices and bleeding from them,\" R. 259-2 (June 2010 Discharge Summary at 2-3) (Page ID #4706) (*sealed*). As the majority notes, both Dr. Stuart Finkel (the Rhineharts' expert) and Schachinger testified that they would have very likely ensured that such follow-up occurred for any comparable patient under their personal care, R. 263-13 (Schachinger Dep. at 17) (Page ID #5400); R. 263-14 (Finkel Dep. at 109) (Page ID #5442), and it is not hard to understand why,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 296-3 (Medical Lit.)

Stevenson's failure deprived Rhinehart, a patient whose end-stage liver disease had yielded both varices and ascites, of a chance even to consult with the kind of doctor specially equipped to monitor the grave risks that those symptoms signaled. A factfinder could rationally conclude that such a deprivation posed a substantial risk of serious harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Rhinehart did, of course, receive\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   treatment following the June 2010 hospitalization: he was prescribed beta blockers.

Op. at 742-43 (declining to decide), is that there is a clear basis on which a\n   rational factfinder could find for the Rhineharts: both Finkel's and Schachinger's testimony support the conclusion that Rhinehart's October 2011 crisis could have been avoided if he had merely been monitored occasionally by a gastroenterologist. R. 263-13 (Schachinger Dep. at 17, 19-20) (Page ID #5400); R. 263-14 (Finkel Dep. at 108) (Page ID #5441) (\"Had [Rhinehart received follow-up care], the likelihood of that second bleed a year later would have been reduced or eliminated entirely.\"). Common sense confirms this premise, because it is not at all clear-nor does the defense or the majority explain-how Rhinehart's primary-care providers could have been expected to identify, much less forestall, the crisis that Rhinehart in fact suffered in October 2011 in the absence of a specialist's knowledge and tools.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, as I read the record, a rational factfinder could easily conclude that the objective result of the \"care\" that Rhinehart received was to let the prisoner's esophageal veins, rather than a specialist's monitoring, serve as the warning system. That takes this case outside the analogic sweep of a case like\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   , to which the majority likens it, Maj. Op. at 742-43, in which an outside dermatologist recommended one medication for a condition but prison doctors continued to prescribe another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717965\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/585/#p591\">\n    734 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   591 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717965\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/585/#p591\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717965\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/585/#p591\">\n    at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the medication that the outside dermatologist recommended was \"not part of the standard treatment\" for the prisoner's condition and that the prisoner\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   receive the recommended medication within less than a month). Here, while the beta blockers that Rhinehart was prescribed may have decreased the risk of a further crisis, that risk was already heightened, as the majority notes, Maj.

In my view, the factual questions here are at least debatable enough to preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   First, there is the question of what Stevenson knew. This is the toughest part of the test for the Rhineharts to satisfy, but I believe that there is enough circumstantial evidence to make summary judgment inappropriate. For one, while the majority is correct that Dr. Zivit Cohen seems to have played a larger role in Rhinehart's care than Stevenson did after the June 2010 hospitalization, there is nevertheless evidence that would enable a trier of fact to conclude that Stevenson not only supervised Cohen but also had direct responsibility for Rhinehart's care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 259-1 (Medical Records) (Page ID #4612) (*sealed*) (\"This is the Patient of DR,Stevenson [sic]....\"); R, 263-4 (Howell Dep. at 40) (Page ID #5088) (\"[F]or this particular prisoner, it would have been Dr. Stevenson....\"); R. 263-5 (Vermuri Dep. at 38-40, 130-31) (Page ID #5115, 5138) (agreeing that Stevenson was in charge of other doctors, including Cohen, and assigned patients to them);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 92, 109-111 (Page ID #5128, 5133) (agreeing that Rhinehart was specifically assigned to Stevenson). So Stevenson's role provides some circumstantial evidence to conclude that Stevenson knew what was going on with Rhinehart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Then there is the evidence that Stevenson (prior to his August 2010 departure) not only remained involved in Rhinehart's care after the hospitalization but also-much more probatively-was consulted by a nurse as it was becoming clear that Rhinehart was not tolerating the beta blockers, which were causing him shortness of breath.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 315-2 (Medical Records) (Page ID #7736) (\"Spoke with Dr. Stevenson: Informed of increasing episodes of SOB....\"). This is why the majority's minimization of Stevenson's involvement after the June 2010 hospitalization,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 742-43 &amp; n.15, is so unsatisfying. The beta blockers were, as the majority readily acknowledges, the only meaningful treatment that Rhinehart was given to manage the life-threatening varices that had already been discovered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 742-43. And the fact that Stevenson knew about Rhinehart's difficulties with the beta blockers makes it significantly more likely that he was aware of why Rhinehart was on beta blockers and what other alternatives existed. A rational factfinder could certainly conclude as much.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   That brings us to the second question of the subjective prong: what Stevenson actually\n   inferred. To be clear, the Rhineharts need not locate a mind reader who can testify to exactly what synapses fired in Stevenson's brain; it is enough to show, for example, that Stevenson \"declined to confirm inferences of risk that he strongly suspected to exist.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   843 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here there is again enough circumstantial evidence for summary-judgment purposes. Stevenson has been a doctor since 1997. R. 263-3 (Stevenson Dep. at 5 (Page ID #5014) ). He knew that Rhinehart had likely been suffering from cirrhosis from the time of his transfer,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49 (Page ID #5024-25), and he had known since well before the June 2010 hospitalization that Rhinehart's referring doctor had felt that Rhinehart needed to see specialists, including a gastroenterologist,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56 (Page ID #5026). Stevenson also appears to have been familiar with esophageal varices,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 113 (Page ID #5041)-at least enough to know that they require getting an expert involved. For while Stevenson asserted that he had \"very limited, if any, contact with\" Rhinehart after June 2010, Stevenson also testified that if he had treated someone with Rhinehart's conditions \"in private practice,\" \"[the patient] definitely would see an [sic] gastroenterologist,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-19 (Page ID #5042). In other words: knowing what a rational factfinder could find Stevenson to have known, Stevenson very likely would have concluded that it was highly risky for Rhinehart not to see a specialist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Third, there is the question of whether Stevenson disregarded the risk. Here, the record is plain: aside from overseeing the provision of beta blockers and Cohen's generalist monitoring, Stevenson did nothing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 118 (Page ID #5042); Appellees' Br. at 31-32. The majority concludes that Stevenson cannot be held liable in light of the treatment that Stevenson's associates provided,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 743-44 (asserting that the Rhineharts have \"failed to show that the treatment Rhinehart received amounted to a conscious disregard of the risk that Rhinehart faced\"), but this argument gives that treatment too much credit. Just as it does not clinch this case on the objective prong, the simple fact that Rhinehart received beta blockers and generalist monitoring does not mean victory for the defendants on the subjective prong if it was clear that Rhinehart needed more. Rather, this subjective defense is available only to prison doctors who \"respond[ ] reasonably to [a] risk.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comstock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457776\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/693/#p703\">\n    273 F.3d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a physician cannot \"do[ ] less than [his] training indicate[s] [is] necessary\" (second alteration in original) (citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Self v.

And as the above discussion shows, there is medical evidence that Rhinehart needed a specialist's monitoring-just as Schachinger said that he did-even if beta blockers and a generalist might have been sufficient for other patients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 177 (Medical Records) (Page\n   ID #2421); R. 263-13 (Schachinger Dep. at 15-17) (Page ID #5399-5400).

Op. at 743-44 (citing\n   <em>\n    Self\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31301\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1227/#p1232\">\n    439 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1232-33 ), when there is evidence for a rational factfinder to conclude that Stevenson's response was unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, a rational factfinder could conclude that Stevenson (1) knew about Rhinehart's situation, (2) inferred the risks stemming from it, and (3) did nothing in the face of those risks.

Portal hypertension, in turn, can cause both varices and ascites.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11143524\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/739/#p742\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Page ID #7802-03); R. 327-2 (Medical Lit.)

Rhinehart, we know, had cirrhosis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 263-3 (Stevenson Dep. at 48-49) (Page ID #5024-25). His cirrhosis evidently caused portal hypertension.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 259-2 (June 2010 Discharge Summary at 2-3) (Page ID #4706-07) (*sealed*). His portal hypertension evidently caused serious ascites at the time of both of his hospitalizations: roughly half a liter of \"straw-colored fluid\" was removed via paracentesis on June 29, 2010, R. 259-2 (June 2010 Discharge Summary at 2) (Page ID #4706) (*sealed*), and nearly a liter and a half was removed at the end of October 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 345-3 (Oct. 2011 Discharge Summary at 1) (Page ID #8755). And his ascites evidently caused ongoing pain.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 349-2 (Page ID #8927-28, 8930-31, 8938-40, 8950-52). That all is enough for a rational factfinder to conclude that Edelman's denial of a TIPS caused Rhinehart pain that he would not have otherwise endured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Subjective\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   I believe that the Rhineharts can also satisfy the subjective prong of the deliberate-indifference standard on summary judgment. As noted above, the Rhineharts must introduce sufficient facts from which a rational factfinder could conclude that Edelman \"(1) subjectively perceived facts from which to infer substantial risk to [Rhinehart], (2) did in fact draw the inference, and (3) then disregarded that risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717965\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/585/#p591\">\n    734 F.3d at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The first two steps are easily satisfied: there is no real debate that Edelman knew sufficient facts about Rhinehart's medical situation and had heard Schachinger's and Dr. Mohmmed Al-Shihabi's dire warnings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 263-2 (Edelman Dep. at 184-85) (Page ID #4999-5000); Maj. Op. at 749-50. As Al-Shihabi summarized things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   Dr. Schachinger expressed that if the patient bled again, he cannot do anything about that and the patient might bleed until he died.... I have discussed this case with the nurse supervisor on the secure unit and the case management who also contacted Dr. Edelman [about a transfer for a TIPS procedure]. [Dr. Edelman] denied this transfer and he said that we just need to continue monitoring the patient here, even though Dr. Schachinger said that if the patient bleeds he cannot do to anything [sic] and the patient will be unstable to be transferred or do anything and the patient will definitely die.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   R. 259-2 (Oct. 2011 Progress Note at 1) (Page ID #4715) (*sealed*). Rhinehart's discharge summary from the same hospitalization, moreover, noted not only the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding, but also the risk of recurrent ascites and the likely need for further paracentesis in the absence of a TIPS procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 345-3 (Oct. 2011 Discharge Summary at 1) (Page ID #8755) (\"[T]he patient has potential to re-bleed from his esophageal varices and recurrent paracentesis if TIPS procedure is not performed.\"). Based on these facts, a rational factfinder could easily conclude that Edelman understood the facts surrounding Rhinehart's situation and inferred that there was a substantial risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The third step presents a harder question. As the majority indicates, Maj. Op. at ---- - ----, the question conceivably comes down to a mere difference of doctors' opinions: Schachinger and Al-Shihabi said that a TIPS was necessary, and Edelman and another prison administrator, Dr. Jeffrey Stieve, suggested that a TIPS was unnecessary and that its risks outweighed its rewards.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 263 (Edelman Dep. at 201) (Page ID #5004). If this were in fact a dilemma susceptible to no clear answer, then I agree that the Rhineharts would not be able to prove that Edelman consciously disregarded a known risk; instead, he would have permissibly adopted one of several reasonable medical approaches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Whether one puts it in terms of duty or deliberate indifference, prison officials who act reasonably cannot be found liable under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.\"). On the other hand, however, a defendant cannot automatically win on summary judgment simply by proposing some hypothetical downside: if the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Blackmore\n   </em>\n   , for example, had claimed that they had declined to initiate an appendectomy because occasionally appendicitis patients die during appendectomies, a jury surely could have concluded that this rationale was mere pretext, given that a much greater percentage of patients die if\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   appendectomies.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Battista v. Clarke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5652636\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/449/#p452\">\n    645 F.3d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452, 455 (1st Cir. 2011) (upholding preliminary injunction based on district court's finding of \"a collection of pretexts, delays, and misrepresentations\" in prison officials' justifications,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5652636\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/449/#p452\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 452 ). If a rational factfinder could conclude that Edelman's justification for denying Rhinehart a TIPS procedure was mere pretext to mask deliberate indifference, then summary judgment is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On my read of the record, Edelman's justification is shaky enough to preclude summary judgment. True, he and Stieve had\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   facts on their side: there is no evidence that a TIPS would have prevented Rhinehart from\n   <em>\n    eventually\n   </em>\n   dying of liver disease, and use of a TIPS carries with it an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 263-13 (Schachinger Dep. at 48) (Page ID #5407); R. 263-14 (Finkel Dep. at 102-04) (Page ID #5440); Maj. Op. at 754-55 (noting Stieve's explanation that a TIPS \"would not prolong Rhinehart's life and came with an increased risk of brain disease\"). But on closer inspection, neither of these justifications is as compelling as they at first appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   For one, the fact that a TIPS would not have affected Rhinehart's\n   <em>\n    overall\n   </em>\n   mortality is not dispositive. Doctors are, of course, not absolved of Eighth Amendment liability simply because a particular treatment will not cure a disease.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Ambani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041756\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/642/#p648\">\n    577 F.3d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648 (6th Cir. 2009) (reversing dismissal of claim based on \"refusal to provide pain medication\"). Moreover, there is medical evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that a TIPS would have prolonged and improved Rhinehart's life.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , R. 263-14 (Finkel Dep. at 102-04) (Page ID #5440); R. 296-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7064) (documenting increased quality of life from TIPS intervention, including through diminished ascites);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041756\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/642/#p648\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Page ID #7113) (documenting \"significant reductions in treatment failure and in mortality\" from \"early use of TIPS\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 315-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7813) (concluding that \"TIPS is effective in lowering elevated portal pressures,\" \"has acceptable postprocedure complication and mortality rates,\" and \"ameliorates ascites\"). So the fact that a TIPS would not have changed Rhinehart's underlying prognosis does not preclude a finding that Edelman was deliberately indifferent in denying Rhinehart care that would have extended or improved his remaining years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Then there is the danger of HE, described in one record source as \"confusion and forgetfulness caused by poor liver function and the diversion of blood flow away from your liver.\" R. 315-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7803). But Edelman's HE justification is also questionable. First, as the Rhineharts note, Appellants' Br. at 25 &amp; n.26, HE, while not trivial, is \"a complication in a minority of patients treated with TIPS,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and where it occurs it appears more likely to be episodic and temporary rather than \"recurrent or refractory.\" R. 296-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7123);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 315-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7813) (finding that twenty percent of TIPS recipients sustain \"new or worsening\" HE). In other words, the likelihood of a TIPS causing HE in Rhinehart's case-as well as the likely seriousness even if HE were to manifest-is highly speculative. Second, in contrast to the majority's ominous use of the phrase \"brain disease,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 732-33, 751-53, the medical literature in the record describes\n   HE as a manageable side effect-a condition that \"can be treated with medications, diet, or by replacing the shunt.\" R. 315-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7806);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 296-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7083) (finding certain types of shunts, which \"can be modified on the basis of the patient's clinical condition,\" to be \"effective in reducing shunt flow and rapidly improving\" patients with otherwise refractory HE). In short, HE was a possible complication, but far from a certain or inexorable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   HE is also not a condition brought on\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   by a TIPS. Rather, HE can alternately stem from portal hypertension itself-the very condition that a TIPS can help alleviate. R. 315-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7803-04). Indeed, \"HE is clinically classified into three major categories: Type A occurs in patients with acute liver failure. Type B occurs in patients with [a TIPS]. Type C is related to underlying cirrhosis.\" R. 296-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7123). Rhinehart already fell into the first and third of those categories, meaning that he was at risk of HE regardless. Further, as the Rhineharts argue, Appellants' Br. at 26, there is evidence that Rhinehart may have been suffering from cirrhosis/portal-hypertension-induced HE at times already. R. 259-1 (Medical Records) (Page ID #4629, 4640) (*sealed*). It is therefore possible that a TIPS actually could have\n   <em>\n    ameliorated\n   </em>\n   that preexisting condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 315-3 (Page ID #7813) (\"Three months after TIPS, the incidence of new or worsening hepatic encephalopathy was 20%, but encephalopathy\n   <em>\n    improved\n   </em>\n   in an equal proportion of patients.\" (emphasis added) ). In other words, it is not as if HE was simply a threat that Edelman could protect Rhinehart from by denying Rhinehart a TIPS procedure. Instead, Edelman potentially consigned Rhinehart to\n   <em>\n    continuing\n   </em>\n   to suffer with HE that a TIPS could have helped abate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in any event, Edelman was choosing between two options that\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   carried with them the risk of HE for Rhinehart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Edelman's generalized HE justification consequently begins to look a good deal thinner, particularly when juxtaposed against Schachinger's dire warnings about Rhinehart's specific condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 259-2 (Oct. 2011 Endoscopy Report at 3) (Page ID #4713) (*sealed*) (\"[T]here is nothing further, I believe, that I can do given all the bands that are already placed on the esophageal varices and those bands would get knocked off trying to treat any additional bleeding and would be ineffective.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041756\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/642/#p648\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]here is a fair chance that this is going to bleed again and he may bleed to death and I recommend that he be transferred.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 259-2 (Oct. 2011 Progress Note at 1) (Page ID #4715) (*sealed*) (\"Dr. Schachinger said that if the patient bleeds he cannot do to anything [sic] and the patient will be unstable to be transferred or do anything and the patient will definitely die.\"). It is, in other words, very far from clear that the risks of HE matched up with the rewards of a TIPS procedure in any meaningful way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   This imbalance looks even starker once one compares Schachinger's and Edelman's expertise. Schachinger was a specialist in gastroenterology who had twice performed endoscopies on Rhinehart. R. 263-13 (Schachinger Dep. at 8, 29-30) (Page ID #5397, 5403). Edelman, on the other hand, was an administrator who had\n   never treated Rhinehart and \"rarely saw patients\" at all during the years at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 263-2 (Edelman Dep. at 24-25) (Page ID #4959-60);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 187 (Page ID #5000) (\"[Schachinger] has more experience than me, and expertise, yes.\"). And in fact, as both Finkel and the Rhineharts have pointed out, R. 263-10 (Finkel Report at 9) (Page ID #5381); Appellants' Br. at 24-25, Edelman was not even clear on the nature of a TIPS procedure, opining that it was \"very invasive,\" with an \"incision ... probably made in the femoral area.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 263-2 (Edelman Dep. at 211) (Page ID #5006).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   R. 315-3 (Medical Lit.) (Page ID #7805) (\"The TIPS procedure is not a surgical procedure. The radiologist performs the procedure within the vessels under X-ray guidance. The procedure lasts 1 to 3 hours.\"). While Edelman's comparative disadvantage in expertise and first-hand knowledge of Rhinehart's condition does not mean that he could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have reasonably disagreed with Schachinger's recommendation, it does cast further doubt on the idea that denying the TIPS reflected a mere good-faith difference of opinion among doctors based on genuine concerns about HE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   On balance, then, I do not believe that Edelman's purported explanation suffices to preclude a rational factfinder from concluding that Edelman purposefully disregarded a known risk. To be sure, I agree that a factfinder\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   conclude at trial that Edelman denied the TIPS procedure because he was concerned about HE. But both the medical and circumstantial evidence suggests that a rational factfinder could also permissibly subscribe to Finkel's analysis and conclude that, while \"[t]here may have been non-medical reasons, ... there was no medical reason to deny\" Schachinger's recommendation for a TIPS procedure and, accordingly, that Edelman's explanation was not the sincere, reasonable medical judgment that the majority takes it to be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 263-14 (Finkel Dep. at 104-05) (Page ID #5440-41);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   842-43 &amp; n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here is the clinical note that memorialized his involvement in that one instance:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n    Informed of increasing episodes of SOB,\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n    Assessment relayed to MD as documented.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n    Continue to monitor &amp; Detail for Combivent breath in txs TID PRN x 2 weeks.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    R. 259-1, Clinical Progress Note, Page ID# 4672. Judge Moore argues that the existence of this note \"makes it significantly more likely that [Dr. Stevenson] was aware of why Rhinehart was on beta blockers and what other alternatives existed.\" Concurring and Dissenting Op. at 756. We do not see how. The note says nothing about Rhinehart's ESLD or his beta-blocker medication. Rhinehart had smoked for forty years, experienced breathing difficulties since the late 1990s, and reported shortness of breath long before his hospitalization in June 2010.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , R. 259-1, Medical Note Summary, Page ID# 4624. Given this history, no reasonable jury could infer that Dr. Stevenson knew Rhinehart faced a serious ESLD-related risk-for example, a risk of an esophageal bleed-from a nurse's having told him that Rhinehart was experiencing shortness of breath in August 2010.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    United Network for Organ Sharing, The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, Transplants in the U.S. by Region, at https://optn.transplant hrsa.gov/data/ (last modified June 26, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Though the Rhineharts also appeal the district court's decision finding inadmissible Dr. Finkel's testimony about pain Rhinehart allegedly endured \"due merely to hypertension,\" we need not address the district court's ruling on this issue.

But it is not clear that Rhinehart's generalist prison doctors were equipped to perform this monitoring, and some medical evidence suggests that the best approach for managing variceal bleeding is to enlist \"a team of gastroenterologists, hepatologists, hematologists, critical care physicians, surgeons, and interventional radiologists,\" which suggests that follow-up with a single specialist was closer to a bedrock necessity than a gold-standard luxury.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 296-3 (Medical Lit.)

Schachinger, moreover, clearly recommended that Rhinehart see a \"gastroenterologist for additional EGD with esophageal banding as necessary,\" providing medical evidence that in\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    case, a qualified medical expert thought that generalist monitoring was not enough.

Op. at 744. Schachinger was a specialist, R. 263-13 (Schachinger Dep. at 8) (Page ID #5397); Schachinger recommended that Rhinehart follow up with a specialist for further scoping after his June 2010 hospitalization, R. 177 (Medical Records) (Page ID #2421); R. 263-13 (Schachinger Dep. at 15-17) (Page ID #5399-5400); and Stevenson, who seems to have been well-positioned to act, did nothing to make that follow-up happen. To the extent that a rational factfinder could conclude that Stevenson knew the relevant facts and drew the relevant inferences-questions that I believe are satisfied here-this is, on my read, very much a case in which a prison doctor (Stevenson) ignored a specialist's recommendation (Schachinger's).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Nor is it any answer to distinguish this case from one like\n    <em>\n     LeMarbe v.

While some risks may indeed be particularly obvious, the issue here is that the facts of this particular situation, as seemingly known to Stevenson, at least arguably would have made clear to Stevenson that Rhinehart faced a serious medical risk. Thus, given that there was evidence to conclude that\n    <em>\n     Stevenson\n    </em>\n    did \"less than [his] training indicated was necessary,\"\n    <em>\n     Comstock\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457776\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/273/693/#p703\">\n     273 F.3d at 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (alteration in original) (citation omitted), it is no more dispositive that Stevenson did not overlook something absurdly obvious than it would be, in a manslaughter trial, to note that the defendant did not commit first-degree murder.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    This was, it bears noting, a \"significant amount of ascites,\" R. 345-3 (Oct. 2011 Discharge Summary at 2) (Page ID #8756), and the doctor who wrote Rhinehart's discharge summary made clear not only that Rhinehart had the \"potential to re-bleed from his esophageal varices,\" but also that he would require \"recurrent paracentesis if [a] TIPS procedure [were] not performed,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 1 (Page ID #8755).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    The majority suggests that this logic still must fail because the Rhineharts have not proven that the monitoring, diuretics, and pain medication that Rhinehart did receive was not an adequate alternative treatment plan. Maj. Op. at 749-50.
