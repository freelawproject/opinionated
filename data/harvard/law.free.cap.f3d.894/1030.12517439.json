The government's suit arose from the car manufacturer's installation in some of its cars of \"defeat devices\"-surreptitious pieces of software that allowed VW to cheat on emissions\n   tests. Six months after filing suit, the parties reached a final proposed consent decree, and the government filed it with the court.

Discovery of \"defeat devices\" &amp; ensuing litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In May 2014, researchers at West Virginia University published a study showing that two of Volkswagen's 2.0-liter \"light diesel\" models emitted significantly higher quantities of pollutants during normal road operation than during emissions testing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following publication of the study, Volkswagen represented to the EPA and to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) that the identified discrepancies were caused by \"technical issues and unexpected in-use [driving] conditions.\" Testing by the EPA and CARB demonstrated that Volkswagen's explanations did not account for the disparate emissions levels. Unsatisfied, the two agencies threatened to withhold certificates of conformity for Volkswagen's 2016 model year light diesel cars, without which the company could not sell the cars in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under that pressure Volkswagen confessed: its 2.0-liter light diesel models released between 2009 and 2015 contained a \"defeat device.\" The device was designed so that when it sensed-and only when it sensed-the precise driving conditions of an emissions compliance test, software in the car altered engine performance so the vehicle emitted permissible levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx). Nitrogen oxide reacts with other compounds in the atmosphere to form ozone and smog. When the cars equipped with a defeat device operated under normal \"in-use\" road conditions, they emitted between 10 and 40 times the EPA-compliant level of NOx.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 18, 2015, the EPA sent a \"Notice of Violation\" (NOV) to Volkswagen stating that VW's installation of the defeat device on certain 2.0-liter VW diesel automobiles (the \"affected vehicles\") violated the Clean Air Act. Soon after, the EPA issued a press release, which contained the following message for vehicle owners:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Car owners should know that although these vehicles have emissions exceeding standards, these violations do not present a safety hazard\n   <em>\n    and the cars remain legal to drive and resell.\n   </em>\n   Owners of cars of these models and years do not need to take any action at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The VW defeat device scheme became front page news across the country. By December 2015, hundreds of private lawsuits against Volkswagen, most of them class actions, were filed in or removed to federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Volkswagen \"Clean Diesel\" Mktg., Sales Practices, and Prods.

The government sought (1) injunctive relief prohibiting VW from continuing to engage in the conduct alleged; (2) an order mandating appropriate steps by VW, including mitigation of NOx emissions, to remedy the violations of the Act; and (3) civil penalties for each violation of the Act. The JPML transferred the enforcement action to the MDL court on January 15, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The settlement process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Shortly after the government filed suit, the district court appointed Robert S. Mueller III as Settlement Master to \"to facilitate settlement discussions among all parties to this multi-district litigation as soon as is feasible.\" The court selected lead counsel and a 22-member Plaintiffs' Steering Committee (PSC) to manage consolidated pre-trial litigation for the class. A \"government coordinating counsel\" was appointed to represent the government's interests during pretrial proceedings and settlement talks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties to the various cases reached an agreement in principle concerning the 2.0-liter vehicles. On June 28, 2016, the United States filed a proposed consent decree for this civil enforcement action, and the PSC filed a settlement agreement for preliminary approval in the class action. The consent decree established a program by which VW would buy back, permit the termination of leases of, or perform modifications on the emissions systems of all affected vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   VW would also pay $2.7 billion into a \"mitigation trust\" to offset the increased NOx emissions caused by\n   the affected vehicles, and pay another $2 billion to support public awareness of zero-emissions vehicles. For the buyback-lease termination-modification program, the consent decree set a participation target of 85% of the affected vehicles; for each percentage point below 85%, VW had to pay additional funds into the mitigation trust. The terms of the class action settlement largely overlapped with the terms of the consent decree between VW and the government and also with a separate consent order filed by the Federal Trade Commission.

Fleshman's attempt to intervene\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While settlement talks were well underway in the cases proceeding in California, Fleshman filed suit against VW in the Circuit Court of Campbell County, Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time Fleshman filed suit, he owned a 2012 model year light diesel Jetta.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Later, when the settlement talks were close to fruition, Fleshman moved to intervene in the class action, \"to object to the proposed Consumer Class Action Settlement Agreement and Release.\" The district court refused to allow the intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Undeterred, Fleshman moved a week later to intervene in the government's enforcement action. He argued that the consent decree \"violate[d] Federal and Virginia law\" because it did not require rescission of sale for all affected vehicles; instead, it permitted vehicle owners and lessees to keep their unmodified vehicles if they wished. Fleshman also alleged that Virginia's SIP prohibited the owners of affected vehicles from driving them, so the buyback should have been mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The specific SIP provision Fleshman relied upon reads in full: \"No motor vehicle or engine shall be operated with the motor vehicle pollution control system or device removed or otherwise rendered inoperable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Va.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-40-5670\">\n    9 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-40-5670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(3). Under Fleshman's reading, this SIP provision prohibited vehicle owners from driving unmodified affected vehicles. Fleshman maintained in his intervention motion that the EPA's statement of September 18, 2015, advising that \"the [affected] cars remain[ed] legal to drive and resell\" was inconsistent with the Virginia SIP. Fleshman sought intervention to \"protect his interest as a Virginian[ ] in enforcing the laws of Virginia ... incorporated into the Clean Air Act by way of Virginia's [SIP].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argued that the Clean Air Act's citizen-suit provision provided him with a statutory right to intervene, presumably pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fleshman further contended that\n   he had a protectable interest in the enforcement of Virginia's SIP not adequately protected by the parties to the litigation, presumably invoking Rule 24(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The government observed in its opposition papers that Fleshman had not appended a complaint to his motion to intervene. In response, Fleshman attached one to his reply brief, and shortly thereafter he filed a First Amended Proposed Complaint-in-Intervention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint consisted largely of allegations that the EPA was not adequately prosecuting the action against VW.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his prayer for relief, Fleshman sought various declarations and orders against the EPA (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"[f]ind and order that the EPA cannot propose and support a monetary penalty which is an incentive to violate the Clean Air Act\"); none of the requested relief was directed at Volkswagen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court denied Fleshman's motion to intervene in this civil enforcement action. The court held that the Clean Air Act's citizen-suit provision permits intervention of right only when the intervenor seeks to enforce the same \"standard, limitation, or order\" as the government does in its action. Because Fleshman sought to enforce Virginia's SIP-not the same \"standard, limitation, or order\" as the Clean Air Act provisions underlying the government's complaint-the Act did not permit him to intervene as a matter of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the district court entered the proposed consent decree in the government enforcement action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fleshman appeals the denial of his motion to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Under Rule 24, a stranger to a lawsuit may intervene \"of right\" where (1) a federal statute gives the would-be intervenor an \"unconditional right\" to intervene in the suit, or (2) letting the lawsuit proceed without that person could imperil some cognizable interest of his.

Scope of intervention under the Clean Air Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Clean Air Act entitles any person to sue for a violation of \"an emission standard\n   or limitation under this chapter\" or \"an order issued by the Administrator or a State with respect to such a standard or limitation.\" \u00a7 7604(a)(1). A citizen's right to sue under the Act has limitations, however:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   No action may be commenced-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) under subsection (a)(1) of this section-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (A) prior to 60 days after the plaintiff has given notice of the violation (i) to the Administrator, (ii) to the State in which the violation occurs, and (iii) to any alleged violator of the standard, limitation, or order, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (B) if the Administrator or State has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil action in a court of the United States or a State to require compliance with the standard, limitation, or order, but in any such action in a court of the United States any person may intervene as a matter of right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00a7 7604(b)(1). This tripartite structure for citizen suits-a right of action, qualified by a notice requirement and a \"diligent prosecution\" bar, which in turn is leavened by a right to intervene-is replicated in a host of other federal environmental statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

After examining the parameters of \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(B) 's diligent prosecution bar, we hold that it circumscribes a citizen's right to intervene in an enforcement action under that same provision. That is, a citizen who retains the right to file suit on his own, despite a government enforcement action, has no statutory right to intervene in that action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 7604(b) 's two subparts work together to delimit citizen suits against alleged violators of the Act. First, before filing suit, a plaintiff must give sixty days' notice to the EPA, the relevant State, and the alleged violator. \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(A). Second, no citizen suit may be commenced if the EPA or a state is already diligently litigating an action \"to require compliance with the standard, limitation, or order.\" \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(B). \"The time between notice and filing of the action should give the administrative enforcement office an opportunity to act on the alleged violation.\" S. Rep. No. 91-1196, at 37 (1970) (report of the Senate Committee on Public Works). \"If the Administrator or the State commences enforcement action within that 60-day period, the citizen suit is barred, presumably because governmental action has rendered it unnecessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v.

The word \"such\" restricts the actions in which a person may intervene to those mentioned in the preceding clause-that is, diligently prosecuted enforcement actions that bar a citizen suit under subsection (a)(1). The connective \"but\" sets the grant of intervention in opposition to the diligent prosecution bar: you can't bring your own suit, but you're allowed to intervene in this one.

Section 7604(f) explains that the term \"emission standard or limitation,\" for purposes of the citizen-suit provision, covers several broad categories of regulatory requirements, including-somewhat unhelpfully-\"emission standard[s]\" and \"emission limitation[s].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 7602, which defines terms used throughout the Clean Air Act, more concretely defines \"emission limitation\" and \"emission standard\" to mean \"a requirement established by the State or the Administrator which limits the quantity, rate, or concentration of emissions of air pollutants on a continuous basis, including any requirement relating to the operation or maintenance of a source to assure continuous emission reduction, and any design, equipment, work practice or operational standard promulgated under this chapter.\" \u00a7 7602(k). Neither the \u00a7 7602(k) definition nor the \u00a7 7604(f) list of categories of \"emission standard[s]\" and \"emission limitation[s]\" encompasses the generic statutory prohibitions in \u00a7 7522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For an example of an \"emission standard,\" consider\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2086.1811-04\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 86.1811-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The diligent prosecution bar applies only when the government is enforcing a \"standard or limitation under this chapter\" or an \"order ... with respect to such a standard or limitation.\" \u00a7 7604(a)(1). Fleshman's claims were thus not precluded by that bar, and he was free to bring his own citizen suit alleging them. And because a citizen has a statutory right to intervene in a government enforcement action under the Clean Air Act only if precluded by the diligent prosecution bar from bringing his own suit, Fleshman had no right to intervene here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Fleshman sought to enforce the Virginia SIP, not the requirements of \u00a7 7522\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   There is an alternative reason Fleshman had no statutory right to intervene in this action. Even if \u00a7 7522 's statutory prohibitions were \"standard[s], limitation[s], or order[s]\" that would foreclose, through \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(B), a citizen suit, this government enforcement action would not bar Fleshman from litigating the claims in his proposed suit. Properly viewed, Fleshman's claims are not predicated on any \u00a7 7522 violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Fleshman's first proposed complaint-in-intervention focused entirely on the EPA's inadequate enforcement of state SIPs. He sought declaratory relief to remedy the inadequacy and unlawfulness of the consent decree flowing from its inattention to state SIPs. In particular, Fleshman's first complaint-which does not refer to \u00a7 7522 at all-alleged a violation of a provision of Virginia's SIP that prohibits the operation of cars whose \"pollution control system[s] or device[s]\" had been \"removed or otherwise rendered inoperable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Va.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-40-5670\">\n    9 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-40-5670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The government's enforcement action did not allege that VW had not complied with Virginia's (or any state's) SIP, or seek relief connected with SIP compliance. That, indeed, was Fleshman's central gripe in his original intervention complaint. Because Fleshman's original complaint alleged violations entirely distinct from those the government identified, Fleshman could have proceeded with his own citizen suit. \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7604(f)(4) (private plaintiffs may sue to enforce a \"standard, limitation, or scheduled established under ... any applicable State implementation plan approved by the [EPA]\"). He therefore had no statutory right to intervene in the government's action based on his original complaint-in-intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In his amended proposed complaint-in-intervention, Fleshman emphasized somewhat different purported violations-namely, the EPA's failure to demand that all of Volkswagen's non-conforming cars be removed from the road, all sales be rescinded, and all purchase prices be refunded,\n   relief that he argues was mandated by the Clean Air Act. Fleshman Compl. at 11. Like the earlier complaint, however, the second one did not identify any of the subsections of \u00a7 7522 as the source of the violations alleged or the relief sought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Fleshman's proposed amended complaint-in-intervention does not actually set forth\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claims or causes of action; it contains many paragraphs of allegations followed by a request for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   If anything, Fleshman's refrain that the EPA failed to enforce the \"mandatory, non-discretionary\" requirements of the Clean Air Act, Fleshman Compl. at 2-8, indicates that his claims are, in reality, claims\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the EPA under a different provision of the Act from \u00a7 7522.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7604(a)(2) (\"[A]ny person may commence a civil action on his own behalf ... against the Administrator [of the EPA] where there is alleged a failure of the Administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter\n   <em>\n    which is not discretionary\n   </em>\n   ....\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, the government's enforcement action did not bar Fleshman's suit under the diligent prosecution bar, \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(B). The statutory provisions the United States sued to enforce-\u00a7 7522-are not \"standard[s], limitation[s], or order[s]\" that would preclude a citizen suit under \u00a7 7604(a)(1). Even if they were, Fleshman's proposed complaints-in-intervention demonstrate that he was not seeking to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 7522 invoked by the government. For both reasons, Fleshman could have filed his own suit against Volkswagen or the EPA to enforce Virginia's SIP. Ergo, he was not entitled to intervene in the government's action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7604(b)(1)(B). And because the Clean Air Act did not grant Fleshman an \"unconditional right to intervene,\" he was not entitled to do so under Rule 24(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

By contrast, Fleshman asked the court to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (1) declare that enforcement of \u00a7 7522 requires the rescission of the sale of each of the hundreds of thousands of affected vehicles;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (2) declare that the EPA had no authority to \"annul or repeal\" the SIPs of various states, or to \"impair or impede\" the enforcement of SIPs, by \"promoting and endorsing\" an allegedly deficient and unlawful consent decree;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (3) declare that \u00a7\u00a7 7413 and 7541 require the EPA to notify\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   owners and lessees that it is illegal to operate their vehicles in the United States, and to notify the States of \"widespread\" violations of various provisions of the Clean Air Act and numerous SIPs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (4) and declare that the EPA could not \"support a monetary penalty which is an incentive to violate the Clean Air Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In short, Fleshman desires a series of declarations that the Clean Air Act requires the United States to seek a full-rescission remedy, and, conversely, prohibits it from pursuing anything short of that in a settlement with VW.

But it is not at all clear that he could. Fleshman's ability under \u00a7 7604(a)(1) to maintain a separate lawsuit against Volkswagen, or the EPA, to enforce the Clean Air Act would seem to defeat any argument that adjudication of the government's enforcement action without his participation will impair his interests.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
