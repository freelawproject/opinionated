For the reasons set forth below, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the decision of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sexton operated a number of businesses in Kentucky. Jonathan Williams (\"Williams\") was a certified public accountant (\"CPA\") who acted as manager or co-owner of Sexton's companies. Sheila Flynn (\"Flynn\") was the office manager. Between May 2006 and September 2010, Sexton and his co-conspirators secured loans for the businesses from banks by making misrepresentations about the businesses' assets and the identity of the true borrowers. For example, Sexton owned three mobile home parks, and Sexton and Williams submitted financial records to banks and other lenders valuing the parks significantly higher than their actual value. Sexton and Williams also submitted to banks financial records falsely valuing a jet, and false and unfiled tax returns containing inflated adjusted gross income amounts. In addition, they arranged for straw purchases of condominiums that Sexton owned that were in foreclosure proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The banks who issued the loans included PBI Bank, Community Trust Bank, Farmers National Bank, Forcht Bank, and Central Bank. The total amount of funds disbursed from these banks was $8,160,400. Sexton and Williams also submitted applications for higher loan amounts ($13,600,000 and $13,800,000) toward the end of the time period involved, but those loan funds were never disbursed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 5, 2016, Sexton, along with Williams, Flynn, and Joseph Tobin (\"Tobin\"), a bank loan officer at PBI Bank, was charged in a twenty-four count indictment. Count 1 alleged conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), and Counts 2-24 alleged bank fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The indictment also alleged forfeiture to the U.S. of certain property pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20981\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C), 982(a)(2)(A), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202461\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 3, 2017, Sexton pleaded guilty to Count 1 pursuant to a plea agreement. At sentencing, the government moved to dismiss Counts 2-24. On March 28, 2017, a Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") was prepared for Sexton. Relevant to this appeal, the PSR gave Sexton a four-level increase for being an\n   organizer or leader under USSG \u00a7 3B1.1(a). The PSR also gave Sexton one criminal history point pursuant to USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1(c), 4A1.2(m), and 4A1.2(f) for a 2005 California sentence for willful infliction of corporal injury to which Sexton pleaded nolo contendere. Finally, the PSR gave Sexton another two criminal history points pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.1(d) for committing the instant offense while on probation for the California sentence. Sexton's guideline imprisonment range was 97-121 months. Sexton objected to both the organizer/leader adjustment and his criminal history calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sexton was sentenced on June 19, 2017. At sentencing, the district court overruled Sexton's objections to the organizer/leader enhancement and to the criminal history score. The district court applied the leader enhancement, finding that there were more than five participants, that Sexton exercised responsibility, leadership, or organizational responsibility over Flynn, that the conspiracy was otherwise extensive, and that Sexton was entitled to a large share of the fruits of the crime. The court also assessed three criminal-history points finding that the California case represented a prior sentence and that Sexton committed the instant offense while still serving that sentence. The court sentenced Sexton to 109 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 27, 2017, Sexton timely filed his notice of appeal. He argues on appeal that the district court incorrectly increased his criminal history score three points based on the California sentence, that the district court incorrectly applied the organizer/leader enhancement, that Sexton's sentence was substantively and procedurally unreasonable, and that both the forfeiture order and restitution judgment were erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

A district court assigns zero to three criminal history points for each of a defendant's prior sentences. USSG \u00a7 4A1.1. A prior sentence is \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense.\" USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1). If the prior sentence was not a \"sentence of imprisonment,\" the district court adds one point. USSG \u00a7 4A1.1(c). After assigning points for each of the prior sentences, the district court must determine whether the present offense was committed \"while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\" USSG \u00a7 4A1.1(d). If so, the court must add two points.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123142\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/407/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 19, 2005, Sexton pleaded nolo contendere to willful infliction of corporal injury in the Los Angeles Superior Court of California. The court found Defendant guilty. The court did not sentence Sexton to prison, but placed Sexton on 24 months of summary probation with several conditions. The court provided that if Sexton successfully completed summary probation, he would be permitted to withdraw his plea and the case would be dismissed. On December 23, 2008, Sexton was permitted to withdraw his plea, and the case was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district correctly assessed one criminal history point for this prior California sentence under USSG \u00a7 4A1.1(c). Though Sexton was not sentenced to prison, he was placed on probation by the California court, which is treated as a sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1(c). USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.2. That Sexton was eventually permitted to withdraw his plea makes no difference. A \"diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1(c) even if a conviction is not formally entered.\" USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(f). This rule \"reflects a policy that defendants who receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.\" USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.9. The arrangement provided by the California court fits within the definition of a diversionary disposition under \u00a7 4A1.2(f). Sexton's sentence was not otherwise reversed, vacated, invalidated, or expunged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123142\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/330/407/#p411\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.6, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district also correctly assessed two criminal history points under USSG \u00a7 4A1.1(d).

At sentencing, Flynn testified that she worked for one of Sexton's companies and that Sexton was her boss. Flynn testified that she prepared false documents while working at Sexton's company and under Sexton's direction, including false bank statements, false rent rolls, and a false airline appraisal. She testified that after preparing those documents, she gave them to either Williams or Sexton. She testified that the documents were then submitted to banks or loan companies. Flynn also testified that Sexton fired her in October 2005. At that time, Sexton received a foreclosure notice on his properties, decided to go to California, and took $25,000 in cash with him. In response, and while Sexton was gone, Williams and Flynn tried to seize control of the company. When Sexton returned from California, he fired Williams and Flynn and retook control of the company. He later rehired both Williams and Flynn. In light of this evidence, the district court reasonably found that that Sexton \"exerted control over at least one individual within [the] criminal organization.\"\n   <em>\n    Swanberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9242222\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/370/622/#p629\">\n    370 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Sexton did not merely exercise authority over one participant. Turning to the other factors, the district court also reasonably found that Sexton had a right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime. For instance, Flynn testified that some of the money from the loans \"went back into the property, but a majority of it was diverted to a house in the Bahamas and a house in Indiana.\" (R. 262, Sentencing Tr., PageID # 1077.) She testified that the house in the Bahamas belonged to Sexton, and the house in Indiana belonged to Sexton's girlfriend. Flynn also testified that the money for Sexton's trips to California\n   came from the rents that the company collected, even though the rent money was supposed to pay off the loans or bills the company incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A third factor, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, also supports the district court's conclusion. Sexton owned and operated a number of businesses involved in the scheme. His companies' assets were used to secure the loans, and his employees were used to carry out the fraudulent activities. The companies were the vehicle through which the bank fraud was accomplished. And Sexton was not a mere owner or operator of the businesses. Sexton knew of the role his businesses and employees played in the scheme, allowed the scheme to continue, participated in the scheme,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and benefitted from the scheme both personally and as owner and operator of those businesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

App'x 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (6th Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In all, three of the factors laid out by the Guidelines cut in favor of finding Sexton was a leader of the criminal activity. That Williams may have qualified as a leader during the same period of time does not preclude Sexton from also occupying a leadership or organizational role. USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n.4;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That Williams may have been the actual brains behind the operation also does not preclude Sexton from being a leader when there is sufficient other evidence of Sexton's leadership role.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Burley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3112447\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/241/290/#p296\">\n    241 F.

He opened up his businesses to carry out the fraudulent enterprise. He bankrolled the operation and provided the infrastructure for the conspiracy by allowing his assets and employees to be used to accomplish the fraud. He knew of the fraud, took actions to assist in the fraud, personally and professionally benefitted from the fraud, and at the very least implicitly approved of the fraud.

The parties reserved the right to \"object or argue in favor of other calculations.\" (R. 154, Plea Agreement, PageID # 441.) The PSR, which was prepared after the plea agreement was entered into, calculated a restitution amount of $2,637,058.32. The district court ordered restitution in the amount of $2,637,058.32. The court explained that the number contained in the plea agreement was lower than the number contained in the PSR because one of the financial institutions was not able to sell some of the collateral for as much as it had originally agreed upon. The court noted that it was a joint and several obligation with Williams for\n   the same amount, and with Flynn up to $1,467,674.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On appeal, Sexton first argues that the \"charge-off\" methodology used in the PSR to calculate loss was \"not defined as to allow determination that [the losses] are legal in any way whatsoever.\" (Sexton Br. at 34.) But Sexton has not cited case law where a similar methodology was found inappropriate. And we are not persuaded by Sexton's argument. The district court based its restitution amount on the PSR, which detailed the methodology for calculating loss. The PSR explained that \"[e]ach of the banks (PBI, Farmers, Forcht, and Community Trust) that lent money to the defendants, or their straw borrowers, have supplied records detailing the loan amounts, payment history, and collateral for each loan.\" (PSR, PageID # 740.) The records provided by the banks specified \"charge-off\" amounts for each loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The \"charge-off\" amount \"is the amount of money that a bank determines it has incurred in the event of a borrower's default.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"The charge-off amount for a loan is calculated by subtracting the appropriate credits against loss, including but not limited to, payments made on the loan and liquidated collateral, from the principal loan balance (interest and fees are not included). The resulting difference approximates a bank's pecuniary loss for a particular loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The PSR indicated where numbers had changed due to the sale of collateral. Because the PSR detailed how it calculated the banks' losses, we do not think it was plain error for the district court to accept the PSR's \"charge-off\" methodology in order to calculate the banks' losses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

More specifically, Forcht Bank provided a supplemental declaration of victim losses, which included amounts for accrued interest, late fees, legal fees, property taxes, force place insurance, and appraisal fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Sexton argues that \"[t]he restitution statute does not provide\" for these items to be included in a restitution order. (Sexton Br. at 38-39.)

Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(4), the district court must order restitution to \"reimburse the victim for ... other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.\" In\n   <em>\n    Elson\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that the specific attorney fees involved in the case were \"directly related to the offense of conviction,\" and therefore \"recoverable as restitution under the MVRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Elson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4042289\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/713/#p726\">\n    577 F.3d at 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The record\n   does not contain any information as to whether Forcht Bank paid those fees as part of the government's investigation and criminal proceedings. Because it is not clear to us how these fees were accrued, it is hard to say that the district court committed any error. To the extent Sexton's argument challenges the district court's findings as to the amount of loss, this Court has previously held that \"a district court is required to make adequate factual findings in calculating the loss amount when there is a 'disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
