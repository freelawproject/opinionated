STEWART, Chief Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Gonzalez-Longoria raised in this appeal a challenge to the assessment of a Sentencing Guideline enhancement based on the classification of his prior Texas conviction as an aggravated felony. Mr. Gonzalez-Longoria has been released from imprisonment and no longer wishes to pursue any challenge to his term of imprisonment or Sentencing Guideline calculation. Accordingly, we DISMISS his appeal as to these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Gonzalez-Longoria also challenged the description in the judgment of his offense as being an illegal reentry after \"having previously been convicted of an aggravated felony.\" We REMAND to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect the correct offense of conviction by elimination of the clause \"having previously been convicted of an aggravated felony.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
