The first, written by Michael Aytes, Associate Director of Domestic Operations of the USCIS (the \"Aytes Memo\"), sets forth the burden of proof a petitioner must meet to show that he or she poses no risk to his or her alien relative. Specifically, the memo interpreted the \"no risk\" requirement to mean that to avoid denial of a petition, \"a petitioner who has been convicted of a specified offense against a minor must submit evidence of rehabilitation and any other relevant evidence that clearly demonstrates, beyond any reasonable doubt, that he or she poses no risk to the safety and well-being of his or her intended beneficiar[ies].\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Guidance for Adjudication of Family-Based Petitions and I-129F Petition for Alien Fianc\u00e9(e) under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Feb. 8, 2007),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Laws/Memoranda/Static_Files_Memoranda/adamwalshact020807.pdf.

In 2004, he was convicted of aggravated indecent\n   assault and unlawful contact with a minor. He was sentenced to 11.5 to 23 months' imprisonment, 10 years of probation, and lifetime sexual offender registration. He was required to undergo a psychosexual evaluation and prohibited from any unsupervised contact with minors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2012, Bakran married Zara Qazi, an adult Indian national. He then sought lawful permanent resident status for her by filing a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and a Form I-485, Application for Permanent Residence, 8 C.F.R. 245.2(a)(3)(iii), with the USCIS. In January 2014, he received a Request for Evidence/Notice of Intent to Deny his petition (the \"Notice\"), which noted that his 2004 conviction prevented him from designating his wife as his immediate relative for the purposes of exempting her Application for Permanent Residence from the worldwide levels of numerical limitations pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201151\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(i) unless he could show he posed no risk to her. Bakran had already submitted materials regarding his conviction with his initial application, and he filed additional documents in response to the Notice. The USCIS determined that Bakran had committed a \"specified offense against a minor\" under the AWA, and denied his application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bakran filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Defendants based on the denial of his petition. He alleged the denial violated the Constitution and APA. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to review the Secretary's determination of Bakran's petition. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that Bakran \"does not question the Secretary's ... 'unreviewable discretion' \" concerning the decision about him.\n   <em>\n    Bakran v.

Of relevance here, the AWA states that a citizen, such as Bakran, convicted of a specified offense may not file a petition for immediate relative status \"unless the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's sole and unreviewable discretion, determines that the citizen poses no risk to the alien with respect to whom a petition ... is filed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(viii)(I). The AWA therefore precludes judicial review of the Secretary's no-risk determination concerning a specific citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The issue here is whether the two procedures set forth in the Aytes and Neufeld Memos are themselves reviewable. Bakran argues that the Secretary, through the USCIS, acted ultra vires in imposing upon citizen petitioners a requirement that they prove beyond any reasonable doubt that they pose no risk to the alien beneficiary and by informing field officers that granting permission to file petitions on the beneficiaries' behalf should be rare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our authority to review these claims depends on whether the standard of proof and rareness directive are part of the Secretary's statutorily-granted unreviewable discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To make this decision, we examine the statute's language to identify the boundaries of the discretion granted to the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The INA and\n   <em>\n    Alaka\n   </em>\n   instruct that courts lack jurisdiction to review decisions that are within the Secretary's sole discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii);\n   <em>\n    Alaka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3349480\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/88/#p95\">\n    456 F.3d at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The AWA states that the Secretary has sole and unreviewable discretion when it \"determines\" that a citizen petitioner poses no risk to the alien for whom the petition is filed. The choice of the word \"determines\" frames the matters within this discretion. The word \"determine\" means \"to fix conclusively or authoritatively\" as well as \"to come to a decision concerning as the result of investigation or reasoning.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 616 (1993). Congress's use of the word \"determines\" therefore grants the Secretary unreviewable discretion in both concluding that a petitioner poses no risk and the process by which the Secretary reaches this decision. Thus, the exercise of discretion includes deciding the type of proof required, the evidentiary standard a petitioner must satisfy, and whether the petitioner's evidence meets that standard. Because these considerations are inextricably intertwined with how and whether to exercise that discretion, and \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) provides that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any ... decision or action of ... the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of ... the Secretary of Homeland Security,\" we are precluded from reviewing both the decision and process for reaching it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gebhardt v.
