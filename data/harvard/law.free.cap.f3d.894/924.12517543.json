After a bench trial, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   found that (1) the NAACP had proved the preconditions for a section 2 claim, and (2) the totality of the circumstances indicated that the district's black voters had less opportunity to elect their preferred candidate than other members of the electorate.

Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   FFSD is a school district located in northern St. Louis County, Missouri. It was created after a 1975 desegregation order required the original FFSD to annex two neighboring school districts \"to achieve a meaningful desegregation\" within one unified district.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It includes all or part of eleven municipalities, and is governed by a seven-member school board. Each member is elected \"at-large\" by the popular vote of the entire district. Members of the FFSD board serve three-year terms with two or three seats filled by an election every April.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Voting in FFSD board elections works as follows. Assume there are three seats to be filled in a given election. All of the candidates are listed on a single ballot. Each voter gets three votes, one for each seat, and can cast those three votes for any three candidates, but cannot vote for any candidate more than once. The top three vote-getters assume seats on the board. In a two-seat year, the same procedures are followed with two votes rather than three. The only time this procedure is not followed is when the election is uncontested (i.e., there are the same number of candidates as there are available seats). In that circumstance, the candidates simply assume the positions on the board and the election is cancelled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

The district court relied on the 2010 Decennial Census to conclude that whites continued to outnumber blacks within FFSD. The district court also held that, even if black voters comprised a bare majority of the voting age population in the district, that would not prevent a vote-dilution claim from going forward if the district's black voters had been historically discriminated against and disenfranchised. On appeal, FFSD contests both determinations. FFSD also argues that the district court failed to consider whether a revised election system would remedy vote dilution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    i. Use of Census Data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   FFSD argues the district court erred in relying on the 2010 Decennial Census data instead of data it submitted from the American Community Survey (ACS). As an initial matter-and, as the district court noted-\"[t]he census is presumed accurate until proven otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNeil v. Springfield Park Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11356815\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/851/937/#p946\">\n    851 F.2d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946 (7th Cir. 1988) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harvell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416316\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1382/#p1390\">\n    71 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1385 &amp; n.1 (citing figures from the 1980 census). FFSD asserts that it successfully overcame this presumption based on the ACS and the testimony of its expert. The ACS is a sample survey that seeks to provide up-to-date estimates because the Decennial Census (as is implied by its name) is only conducted every ten years. The 2011-2013 version of the ACS suggested that the black voting age population within FFSD was approximately 50.3%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district's expert, Dr. Jonathan Rodden, also created projections of the black voting age population in FFSD based on historical trends within the district. These projections were based on the ACS. According to FFSD, the ACS and Dr. Rodden's projections established that black voters made up a majority of the district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The district court found, however, that changes in the ACS did not show, with any reliable degree of certainty, that the population within the district had shifted since the 2010 Census. Further, the district court noted that \"[t]he Census Bureau itself cautions against using ACS estimates rather than the Decennial Census complete count to determine the population of a given geographic area,\" and cited, as an example, the fact that the ACS had projected that the overall population of St. Louis would grow throughout the 2000s, only to be disproved when the actual data for the 2010 Census were collected. In light of these methodological limitations, the district court determined that the most reliable data available were the 2010 Census\n   data. We detect no clear error in that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Bare Numerical Majority\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court also concluded that, \"even if [it] were to find that African Americans constitute a majority of the District's [voting age population], that would not be the end of the analysis.\" The district court explained that \"[r]acial minorities do not suddenly lose the broad protections of the VRA at the moment that they surpass 50% of a jurisdiction's [voting age population].\" FFSD disagrees, asserting that only a numerical minority enjoys the protections of the VRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   notes, under the VRA, the term \"minority\" does not refer to a purely numerical fact.

Although neither party presented FFSD-specific data as to felony disenfranchisement or voter registration, NAACP submitted evidence about how these issues disproportionately affect black Missourians. Particularly as to felony disenfranchisement, the district court used the statewide data as a starting point, and then credited and relied on expert testimony about how the high criminal conviction rate of black FFSD residents likely led to a high rate of disenfranchisement in the district. The court also noted that home ownership, for which FFSD-specific data were presented, \"is a strong predictor of voting in local elections.\" Whenever possible, of course, parties must provide the court with the most location-specific data available. But we discern no clear error in this case because the district court still conducted an \"intensely local appraisal,\" even if part of the appraisal included statewide statistics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    iv.

This testimony aided the district court in determining which candidates were black-preferred, which candidates were supported by the white bloc, and whether white bloc voting has successfully defeated most black-preferred candidates. After analyzing the experts' methodological approaches and the completeness of their analyses, the district court credited Dr. Engstrom's testimony because his analysis was \"accurate, complete, and reliable.\" It relied on some of Dr. Rodden's findings and testimony as well, but noted that they had \"limitations\" and that the NAACP expert's methods were \"superior to the other methods proposed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The district conducted a thorough analysis of the expert testimony, considering each election individually.

FFSD argues that these were only narrow defeats, that black voters did not allocate their votes efficiently, and that there were other special circumstances. The other special circumstance that FFSD focuses on was a controversial vote by the FFSD school board, just prior to the 2011 election, wherein the board voted unanimously to give the former superintendent of the district (and his wife) a lifetime health insurance policy. FFSD argues that it was this board vote, and not racial bloc voting, that was responsible for the election results in 2011 and 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As an initial matter, it is not clear how much weight should be placed on the narrowness of the black-preferred candidates' defeats. Narrow losses could indicate no meaningful vote dilution at all. Or such losses may signal particularly targeted and effective vote dilution efforts. Of course, \"the ultimate right of \u00a7 2 is equality of opportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success for minority-preferred candidates of whatever race.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

And its analysis of the multiple factors that were relevant in those elections is persuasive. Incumbents who cast the purportedly unpopular health insurance vote came up for reelection in 2011, 2012, and 2013, due to the staggered election system. In 2011, only one of the black-preferred candidates running for election was an incumbent (who had voted for the health insurance policy), yet both black-preferred candidates were defeated, receiving nearly identical percentages of the vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the black incumbent would have been classified as black-preferred under either Dr. Engstrom's or Dr. Rodden's estimates. In 2012, there was only one black-preferred candidate. She received near-unanimous support from black voters in the district, but nonetheless lost to a white incumbent (who had voted for the health insurance policy). In 2013, there was one black-preferred incumbent and one white incumbent seeking reelection (both of whom had voted for the health insurance policy), but the white incumbent was successful, while the black-preferred incumbent was defeated. This evidence shows that this health insurance vote-regardless of its perceived popularity or unpopularity-likely did not affect incumbent reelection across racial lines. Therefore, any error on the part of the district court for not directly addressing this issue in its analysis was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Considered Special Circumstances\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   FFSD next objects to the special circumstances that the district court\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   consider, which relate to the 2014 and 2015 elections. In 2014, there were three black-preferred candidates who ran together as a slate called \"Grade A for Change.\" These candidates were motivated to run, in part, due to the board's treatment of Dr. Art McCoy, the first black superintendent of the district, who had recently resigned. This issue also served to motivate black voters. In 2015, the board election followed on the heels of the death of Michael Brown, which had led to large demonstrations, political unrest, and national attention on the Ferguson area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court concluded that special circumstances were present in the 2014 and 2015 elections, but were not overwhelming, and only \"slightly\" discounted the election of one black-preferred candidate in each of those elections. It is apparent from the record that the district court considered the evidence in context and did not clearly err in deciding how much weight to give those special circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In sum, we find no clear error in the district court's determination that the third\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Once the three preconditions have been satisfied, plaintiffs must still show\n   that the \"totality of the circumstances\" demonstrates a section 2 violation.

As to Factor 7-\"the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction,\"\n   <em>\n    Bone Shirt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672218\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1011/#p1018\">\n    461 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1022 -the district court concluded that \"African American electoral successes have generally been minimal in FFSD, and their overall success rates continue to be disproportionately low compared to those of white candidates.\" FFSD makes three arguments as to why this conclusion is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   FFSD argues that the district court \"unduly narrowed\" its analysis under this factor by failing to consider non-racial reasons for electoral defeat of black-preferred candidates, and alleges that the court \"failed to consider the circumstances surrounding electoral defeat\" of black-preferred candidates. To some degree, these arguments echo FFSD's arguments under the third\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition, which we concluded lacked merit. And we note that FFSD does not contest the finding that success rates of black candidates continue to be lower than for white candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   What FFSD also asserts, however, is that the district court failed to consider election-specific evidence relevant to the three \"Grade A for Change\" candidates in 2014: that it was only the winning candidate of the three who was highly qualified, presented herself as a professional, and \"campaigned extremely hard.\" These reasons, not race-based ones, explain the defeat of two black-preferred candidates in that election, according to the district. However, the facts of the 2014 election do not support this argument. In that election, the three black-preferred candidates received similar levels of support. According to estimates of both parties' experts, the winning black-preferred candidate received between one and three percent more black votes than the unsuccessful black-preferred candidates. Due to the significant margins of error, there was no way to conclude with any level of certainty that the winning black-preferred candidates received any more votes from black FFSD residents than did the unsuccessful black-preferred candidates. In short, in spite of the arguments about candidate and campaign quality, all of the black-preferred candidates received effectively equal shares of the vote in 2014. As a result, any error in failing to consider the additional information regarding the campaigns of successful and unsuccessful candidates would not have affected the overall totality-of-the-circumstances analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The core question posed in Factor 7 is whether black candidates have historically been successful in the district, not whether individual black candidates were more attractive candidates or could have run better campaigns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bone Shirt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3672218\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/461/1011/#p1018\">\n    461 F.3d at 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the number-in that case \"not one\"-of successful Native-American candidates under Factor 7);\n   <em>\n    Harvell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416316\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1382/#p1390\">\n    71 F.3d at 1390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"only minimal electoral success under the present scheme,\" as represented by \"only [one] minority victory in nine attempts\"). The district court considered the evidence FFSD presented, but discounted its usefulness in determining whether NAACP had proven a section 2 violation. Under a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, the district court's assessment of FFSD's evidence was not clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, FFSD argues that the district court \"failed to give recent elections more weight.\" As discussed, the district court \"slightly\" discounted the 2014 and 2015 elections. And FFSD asserts that the district court failed to accord adequate weight to the 2016 election in particular, wherein one black representative and one white representative were elected. In its quantitative analysis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the district court discussed the relative numerical successes of black candidates and white candidates over both a longer window-from 2000 to 2016-and a short window-from 2011 to 2016-and found that white candidates were far more successful across both. And, in discussing the more recent elections, the district court explained that \"despite the growth of the African American population in the District since 2000, minority electoral success has not improved, with near equal rates of success in the last six contested elections as there w[ere] between 2000 and 2015.\" The district court considered all the relevant elections appropriately,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and accurately noted no change in more recent elections relative to the historical pattern. This was not clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, FFSD argues that the district court should have given greater weight to the fact that, after the 2016 election, three of the seven members of the FFSD board were black, which \"place[d] African American representation at near proportionate levels with their population.\" The district court observed that section 2 does not provide a \"safe harbor\" based solely on current proportionality. It stated, \"the totality of the circumstances and a searching and practical evaluation of the facts suggest that the more recent successes of African American candidates are not representative of the community's ability to be elected to the Board.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harvell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416316\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1382/#p1390\">\n    71 F.3d at 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, while \"proportional representation is an important factor to consider in evaluating the validity of an electoral process,\" it \"is not ... the statutory touchstone and does not\n   provide an absolute safe harbor in which a defendant can seek refuge from the totality of the circumstances\" (citing\n   <em>\n    De Grandy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39646\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/997/#p1022\">\n    512 U.S. at 1017-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39646\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/997/#p1022\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Simply put, proportionality alone does not indicate that a racial minority has achieved the ability to effectively participate in the political process. This is one reason why a totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry is required. It was not erroneous for the district court to note the appearance of proportionality but nevertheless to conclude that a section 2 violation was on-going.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Factors 1, 3, and 5\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   FFSD also challenges the district court's factual findings under Factor 1 (\"the history of voting-related discrimination in the State or political subdivision\"), Factor 3 (\"the extent to which the State or political subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group, such as unusually large districts, majority vote requirements, and prohibitions against bullet voting\"), and Factor 5 (\"the extent to which minority group members bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p42\">\n    478 U.S. at 44-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p42\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In finding that each of these factors weighed in favor of the NAACP, the district court extensively recounted the history of official discrimination that had occurred throughout Missouri, Metropolitan St. Louis, and FFSD. The court examined specific jurisdictions within FFSD, and relied on the continued effects of discrimination in the area. FFSD argues, however, that this was clearly erroneous because it did not involve the requisite \"intensely local appraisal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We see no clear error in the district court's exhaustive factual findings, even where some are based on statewide data or expert testimony applying general data to the district. The district court relied on the testimony of Drs. Kimball and Gordon to conclude that \"there is a history of officially sanctioned discrimination in the region and the District, and that history is not just a distant memory.\" It further found that \"[g]iven the extent to which African Americans in FFSD continue to experience the effect of discrimination, their ability to participate in the political process is impacted.\" And, the district court noted, \"[t]here is also some evidence that staggered terms in FFSD enhance the opportunity for discrimination, particularly because they are combined with at-large voting.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harvell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416316\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1382/#p1390\">\n    71 F.3d at 1390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]taggered terms[ ] and at-large structure ... tend to suppress minority voters' influence.\"). The evidence amply supports these conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. Factors 4 and 8\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The district court determined that Factor 4 (\"the exclusion of members of the minority group from candidate slating processes\") \"weigh[ed] very slightly in favor of Plaintiffs\" and that Factor 8 (whether\n   \"elected official are unresponsive to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group\") should be accorded \"neutral weight.\" FFSD, however, argues that both factors should have weighed in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As to Factor 4, the district court assessed whether slating processes were available in the district, applying Eighth Circuit precedent that defines a slating group as a group that \"consists of a small number of individuals who select candidates to run as a bloc to fill seats which are up for election.\"\n   <em>\n    Clay v. Bd. of Educ. of St. Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050273\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1357/\">\n    90 F.3d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1362 n.11 (8th Cir. 1996). It determined that there were two local slating organizations and that, while the organizations had endorsement processes that were open to everyone, \"African American candidates have less success than white candidates in getting endorsed by these organizations.\" The district court accorded this factor \"very slight[ ]\" weight because there was little evidence that access was explicitly denied to black candidates, but there was undisputed evidence that white candidates were more likely to be endorsed. Even if the district court erred, however, any such error would not have affected the result, as this factor was given such low weight, and no one factor is outcome-determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Similarly, in assessing Factor 8, the district court was faced with conflicting evidence. FFSD had made some efforts to meet the particularized needs of the black community, but there were noted instances of unresponsiveness. The district court's determination that \"the Board is making efforts to respond\" but \"ha[d], at times, been unresponsive\" was not clearly erroneous, nor was its ultimate conclusion that this factor should be accorded neutral weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The district court found a section 2 violation after engaging in the requisite precondition analysis and conducting a thorough totality-of-the-circumstances balancing.
