Argentina challenged that decision in district court, arguing that a member of the arbitration panel had, with a connection to two of the parties to the proceeding, shown \"evident partiality\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), and that the way the panel reached its determination exceeded its authority under \u00a7 10(a)(4). The district court enforced the panel's award against Argentina, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1993, Argentina awarded a contract to Aguas Argentinas S.A. (AASA), a consortium of seven companies. Three were Argentine and four were not (AWG Group Ltd. (\"AWG\"), Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., Vivendi Universal, S.A. (\"Vivendi\"), and Suez). According to the contract, AASA agreed to invest in and operate Argentina's water services. By its terms, the contract was set to run through 2023 but allowed for earlier termination if either AASA or Argentina failed to live up to its commitments. Argentina also entered bilateral investment treaties with the home countries of the members of AASA promising fair and equitable treatment of their investments in Argentina (the \"fair-treatment provisions\"). These treaties also established arbitration procedures to resolve disputes that might arise from investments in the signatory countries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the turn of this century, Argentina's economy fell into crisis, and its government responded with emergency regulatory measures. One measure unpegged Argentina's currency, the Argentine peso, from the U.S. dollar. Another froze the tariffs AASA could charge customers. Together these measures suppressed the peso's value and prevented AASA from increasing its prices, which led to a significant loss of revenue from its services. AASA had committed to repaying loans that were denominated in dollars and claimed that it could not pay for the quality of service that it had provided when the peso was more valuable unless something changed. Argentina denied AASA's repeated requests to alter the emergency measures or modify its obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2003, the non-Argentine members of AASA began arbitration proceedings at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\") in Washington, D.C. The gravamen of their claim was that Argentina had breached its contract by treating them unfairly. Among its defenses, Argentina maintained that its conduct was compelled by the need to protect its economy and provide safe water. Three years into the arbitration, Argentina terminated the contract on the ground that AASA had failed to keep the nation's water supply free from contaminants. The arbitration lasted twelve years. At its conclusion in April 2015, a unanimous panel rejected Argentina's defense that its conduct was necessary to protect its economy and water supply and concluded that Argentina had breached the contract by treating AASA unfairly. The panel later awarded the claimants the profits they would have realized had Argentina honored the fair-treatment provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July 2015, Argentina brought suit in district court seeking to vacate the panel's award to AWG on two grounds. First, that the panel member selected by AASA was biased in favor of two of the non-Argentine consortium members. Although Argentina does not allege that the panel member had an outside interest in AWG, its fate in the arbitration was wrapped up with the fate\n   of its fellow consortium members. Second, that the panel exceeded its authority by failing to credit Argentina's necessity defense and by compensating AASA with hypothetical profits earned after Argentina had lawfully terminated the contract. The district court rejected each of Argentina's arguments and granted AWG's cross-petition to enforce the award.\n   <em>\n    Republic of Argentina v. AWG Grp.

Salacuse, an expert in international law. Three years into the proceedings, in April 2006, international financial-services company UBS AG (\"UBS\") appointed panel member Kaufmann-Kohler to serve on its board of directors. She was paid for her services in part with UBS stock and in part with a cash salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the time of Kaufmann-Kohler's appointment, UBS managed trillions of dollars in investments, including over $2 billion in Suez and Vivendi. Most of those investments were made for the clients of UBS, who relied on the company to manage their funds. Only a sliver of the Suez and Vivendi shares were purchased as investments for UBS. Owning shares in Suez and Vivendi made UBS a passive shareholder without a management role or entitlement to the firms' profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When she accepted the position on the board of directors, Kaufmann-Kohler did not know of UBS's investments in Suez and Vivendi. UBS ran a check for any conflicts of interest she might have had with the company, and as part of that process Kaufmann-Kohler reported her activity as an arbitrator, including the arbitration involving Argentina, Suez, and Vivendi. The only conflict UBS identified was Kaufmann-Kohler's upcoming participation in the jury for the America's Cup race in which UBS had sponsored a yacht. UBS did not alert her to any connection the company had with Suez or Vivendi. In fact, Kaufmann-Kohler first learned of UBS's investments in them in November 2007, when Argentina sought her recusal from the panel because of her relationship with\n   UBS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other members of the panel rejected Argentina's challenge, concluding that UBS's interests in Suez and Vivendi were too trivial to cause a reasonable person to doubt Kaufmann-Kohler's fairness. Even so, Kaufmann-Kohler resigned from the board on April 15, 2009, more than a year before the panel reached its decision finding Argentina liable to AASA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We must decide whether Kaufmann-Kohler's brief service on the board obliged her to disclose to the arbitration parties her connections to Suez and Vivendi.

A majority of the Court in\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth Coatings\n    </em>\n    suggested that frequent deals with a party may make an arbitrator's interest significant although only small sums are exchanged.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 146,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11311699\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/145/\">\n     89 S.Ct. 337\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (plurality opinion);\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 150,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11311699\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/145/\">\n     89 S.Ct. 337\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (White, J., concurring). And we found in\n    <em>\n     Al-Harbi\n    </em>\n    that an arbitrator's relationship with a firm at which he no longer worked and that had formerly represented a party to the arbitration in an unrelated matter was too thin to be meaningful.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571812,3693711\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/680/\">\n     85 F.3d at 682-83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Neither case, however, examines the interest a passive investor has in the companies it holds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Argentina seems to agree that the relationship UBS had with Suez and Vivendi was limited to purchasing and selling shares in the parties. UBS had no management responsibilities nor any guarantee of directly sharing in their profits. At the same time, Argentina does not explain why this kind of relationship is comparable to recurrent client relationships, which arbitrators might have wanted to retain. While Suez and Vivendi might have been interested in retaining UBS as an investor because the company owned more than 2% of their shares, Argentina does not explain how the importance of the parties' interest in UBS affects the interest UBS had in the parties.\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth Coatings\n    </em>\n    requires us to gauge the interest of Kaufmann-Kohler's firm in the parties, not their interest in her firm. We see no hint from Argentina that UBS cared about staying in the good graces of Suez and Vivendi.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Argentina proposes that the relationship UBS had with the parties was significant simply because it was ongoing while the arbitration was pending. Yet even assuming that a fresh relationship with a party is more important than one that has gone stale, Argentina does not satisfy its heavy burden to explain why this makes the interest of a passive investor, which is far more detached than the company-client relationships it cited as examples, a substantial one. We have been given no reason to think that the Act proscribes the relationships UBS had with Suez and Vivendi simply because they coincided with the arbitration.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    That leaves Argentina to rely on the sheer number of dollars UBS had wrapped up in the parties as evidence of significance. We agree that the more than $2 billion UBS had invested in Suez and Vivendi added up, to state the obvious, to a significant sum. However, Argentina forgets to put that number in context. UBS is in the business of managing money by purchasing and selling shares in corporations. The $2 billion that UBS invested in Suez and Vivendi made up less than 0.06% of the $3.6 trillion UBS had in invested assets. That percentage is too small to suggest much significance, and Argentina does not provide additional context to persuade us otherwise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    We have no problem agreeing with Argentina that UBS was interested in the\n    success of companies in which it had invested $2 billion, no matter what percentage of its portfolio that amount made up. However, Argentina fails to put forth any specific facts beyond the dollars invested to show why that interest was more than trivial to such a mammoth investment firm. Speculation that UBS's investment of 0.06% of its assets, most of which was credited to its clients and not its own bottom line, created a substantial interest in Suez and Vivendi is simply not enough to satisfy the Act's high standard of proof.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Argentina does not give us reason to find that the passive investments UBS made in Suez and Vivendi created evident partiality in Kaufmann-Kohler. If the interest presented here could disqualify an arbitrator who did not disclose it, parties would hesitate to select arbitrators associated with financial companies that invest broadly. The risk would be too high that \"evident partiality\" challenges, like Argentina's, could uproot results of decade-long arbitrations without any evidence of bias beyond a diversified portfolio.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Epic Sys.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611962\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1612/#p1621\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (warning courts to \"be alert to new devices and formulas that would\" undermine the Act's endorsement of arbitration). Requiring arbitrators to either avoid working for companies with sophisticated financial strategies or investigate the far reaches of their investment plans would upset the balance between experience and neutrality struck in\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth Coatings\n    </em>\n    . And nothing in our decision here prevents parties who seek additional protection from agreeing that the arbitrators of their disputes must make known trivial passive-investor relationships that would not trigger the Act's rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Because UBS's interests in Suez and Vivendi were trivial, and therefore Kaufmann-Kohler's interests in these parties were insignificant, they could not have created evident partiality, and there is no basis for vacating the panel's award under \u00a7 10(a)(2).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Al-Harbi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571812,3693711\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/680/\">\n     85 F.3d at 683\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Argentina next argues the panel exceeded its authority by rejecting the country's necessity defense without explanation and by basing the award on events that Argentina prevented by canceling the contract. The Act authorizes vacatur of an award if \"the arbitrators exceeded their powers\" under the arbitration agreement. \u00a7 10(a)(4).

Argentina tries, but fails, to show that the panel's decision had no basis in the governing arbitration agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Argentina contends that the panel failed to fully consider its necessity defense. Necessity is a well-known principle of international law that, as presented by Article 25 of the International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for Intentionally Wrongful Acts, would excuse Argentina from liability if its breach of the fair-treatment provisions was the \"only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril\" that Argentina had not itself caused.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    During the arbitration proceeding, Argentina alleged that the unforeseen economic crisis had limited its ability to accommodate AASA's requests while\n    preserving safe water services for the country's residents and resuscitating its economy. The panel rejected Argentina's assertions with brief conclusions, left unsupported by particular evidence, about the panel's understanding of the government's role in the crisis and the actions it might have taken to comply with the fair-treatment provisions. Argentina interprets the cursory dismissal as suggesting that the panel based its decision on its own policy preferences instead of the criteria to which the parties had agreed. Otherwise, Argentina reasons, the panel would have addressed with care each of Argentina's arguments that it breached the fair-treatment provisions out of necessity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    We have never required of an arbitration award the sort of extended explanation Argentina urges. In fact, we have determined that a panel's decision may be upheld even if it offered no explanation at all because the alternative, requiring a particular level of detail for every response to each party's theories, would \"unjustifiably undermine the speed and thrift sought\" from arbitration proceedings.\n    <em>\n     Sargent v.

But Argentina did not point to anything in the record suggesting that the panel rejected the defense to suit its own preferences instead of the criteria set out in the agreement.

The final award included estimated profits from 2002, the time at which Argentina began treating AASA unfairly, until 2023, the default expiration date of the contract. The panel reasoned that in a world in which Argentina treated AASA fairly and equitably, Argentina would have granted the consortium some relief from the country's emergency economic policies and preserved, not canceled, the contract.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    According to AWG, it was reasonable for the panel to assume that the contract would have lasted past 2002 had there been no breach, and so it was appropriate for the panel's award to include estimated profits from the years 2006 through 2023. Argentina takes issue with the panel's assumption that the contract would have continued past 2006, the time at which Argentina actually terminated the contract. But the government fails to show how the arbitration agreement prohibits making that assumption. Argentina also fails to prove that the panel exceeded its powers by basing AWG's compensation on payments that were not discounted to account for the risk of lawful termination. Even had the panel erroneously overestimated the probability that Argentina would have granted relief to AASA and ignored the risk of contract termination, we would still uphold the panel's decision as the result of its good-faith understanding of the type of compensation permitted by the arbitration agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Oxford Health Plans\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697060\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/564/#p568\">\n     569 U.S. at 572-73\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697060\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/564/#p568\">\n     133 S.Ct. 2064\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     United Paperworkers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v.
