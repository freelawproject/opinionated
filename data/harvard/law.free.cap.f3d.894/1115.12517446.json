FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) summarized the crime:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [Pavatt] and his co-defendant, Brenda Andrew, were each charged with conspiracy and first-degree capital murder following the shooting death of Brenda's husband, Robert (\"Rob\") Andrew, at the Andrews' Oklahoma City home on November 20, 2001. [Pavatt] met the Andrews while attending the same church, and [Pavatt] and Brenda taught a Sunday school class together. [Pavatt] socialized with the Andrews and their two young children in mid-2001, but eventually began having a sexual relationship with Brenda. Around the same time, [Pavatt], a life insurance agent, assisted Rob Andrew in setting up a life insurance policy worth approximately $800,000. [Pavatt] divorced his wife in the summer of 2001. In late September, Rob Andrew moved out of the family home, and Brenda Andrew initiated divorce proceedings a short time later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Janna Larson, [Pavatt's] adult daughter, testified that in late October 2001, [Pavatt] told her that Brenda had asked him to murder Rob Andrew. On the night of October 25-26, 2001, someone severed the brake lines on Rob Andrew's automobile. The next morning, [Pavatt] and Brenda Andrew concocted a false \"emergency,\" apparently in hopes that Rob would have a traffic accident in the process. [Pavatt] persuaded his daughter to call Rob Andrew from an untraceable phone and claim that Brenda was at a hospital in Norman, Oklahoma, and needed him immediately. An unknown male also called Rob that morning and made the same plea. Rob Andrew's cell phone records showed that one call came from a pay phone in Norman (near Larson's workplace), and the other from a pay phone in south Oklahoma City. The plan failed; Rob Andrew discovered the tampering to his car before placing himself in any danger. He then notified the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   One contentious issue in the Andrews' divorce was control over the insurance policy on Rob Andrew's life. After his brake lines were severed, Rob Andrew inquired about removing Brenda as beneficiary of his life insurance policy. However, [Pavatt], who had set up the policy, learned of Rob's intentions and told Rob (falsely) that he had no control over the policy because Brenda was the owner. Rob Andrew spoke with [Pavatt's] supervisor, who assured him that he was still the record owner of the policy. Rob Andrew then related his suspicions about [Pavatt] and Brenda to the supervisor. When [Pavatt] learned of this, he became very angry and threatened to harm Rob for putting his job in jeopardy. At trial, the State presented evidence that in the months preceding the murder, [Pavatt] and Brenda actually attempted to transfer ownership of the insurance policy to Brenda without Rob Andrew's knowledge, by forging his signature to a change-of-ownership form and backdating it to March 2001.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On the evening of November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew drove to the family home to pick up his children for a scheduled visitation over the Thanksgiving holiday. He spoke with a friend on his cell phone as he waited in his car for Brenda to open the garage door. When she did, Rob ended the call and went inside to get his children. A short time later, neighbors heard gunshots. Brenda Andrew called 911 and reported that her husband had been shot. Emergency personnel arrived and found Rob Andrew's body on the floor of the garage; he had suffered extensive blood loss and they were unable to revive him. Brenda Andrew had also suffered a superficial gunshot wound to her arm. The Andrew children were not, in fact, packed and ready to leave when Rob Andrew arrived\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   ; they were found in a bedroom, watching television with the volume turned up very high, oblivious to what had happened in the garage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Brenda was taken to a local hospital for treatment. Her behavior was described by several witnesses, experienced in dealing with people in traumatic situations, as uncharacteristically calm for a woman whose husband had just been gunned down. One witness saw Brenda chatting giddily with [Pavatt] at the hospital later that night.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Rob Andrew was shot twice with a shotgun. A spent shotgun shell found in the garage fit a 16-gauge shotgun, which is a rather unusual gauge. Andrew owned a 16-gauge shotgun, but had told several friends that Brenda refused to let him take it from the home when they separated. Rob Andrew's shotgun was missing from the home when police searched it. One witness testified to seeing Brenda Andrew engaging in target practice at her family's rural Garfield County home about a week before the murder. Several 16-gauge shotgun shells were found at the site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Brenda told police that her husband was attacked in the garage by two armed, masked men, dressed in black, but gave few other details. Brenda's superficial wound was caused by a .22-caliber bullet, apparently fired at close range, which was inconsistent with her claim that she was shot at some distance as she ran from the garage into the house. About a week before the murder, [Pavatt] purchased a .22-caliber handgun from a local gun shop. On the day of the murder, [Pavatt] borrowed his daughter's car and claimed he was going to have it serviced for her. When he returned it the morning after the murder, the car had not been serviced, but his daughter found a .22-caliber bullet on the floorboard. In a conversation later that day, [Pavatt] told Larson never to repeat that Brenda had asked him to kill Rob Andrew, and he threatened to kill Larson if she did. He also told her to throw away the bullet she had found in her car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Police also searched the home of Dean Gigstad, the Andrews' next-door neighbor. There they found evidence that someone had entered the Gigstads' attic through an opening in a bedroom closet. A spent 16-gauge shotgun shell was found on the bedroom floor, and several .22-caliber bullets were found in the attic itself. There were no signs of forced entry into the Gigstads' home. Gigstad and his wife were out of town when the murder took place, but Brenda Andrew had a key to their home. The .22-caliber bullet found in Janna Larson's car was of the same brand as the three .22-caliber bullets found in the Gigstads' attic; the .22-caliber bullet fired at Brenda and retrieved from the Andrews' garage appeared consistent with them in several respects. These bullets were capable of being fired from the firearm that [Pavatt] purchased a few weeks before the murder; further testing was not possible because that gun was never found. The shotgun shell found in the Gigstads' home was of the same brand and odd gauge as the 16-gauge shell found in the Andrews' garage. Ballistics comparison showed similar markings, indicating that they could have been fired from the same weapon. Whether these shells were fired from the 16-gauge shotgun Rob Andrew had left at the home was impossible to confirm because, as noted, that gun also turned up missing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In the days following the murder, [Pavatt] registered his daughter as a signatory on his checking account, and asked her to move his belongings out of his apartment. He obtained information over the Internet about Argentina, because he had heard that country had no extradition agreement with the United States. Larson also testified that after the murder, Brenda and [Pavatt] asked her to help them create a document, with the forged signature of Rob Andrew, granting permission for the Andrew children to travel with Brenda out of the country.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Brenda also asked Larson to transfer funds from her bank account to Larson's own account, so that Larson could wire them money after they left town. Brenda Andrew did not attend her husband's funeral. Instead, she and [Pavatt] drove to Mexico, and took the Andrew children with them. [Pavatt] called his daughter several times from Mexico and asked her to send them money. Larson cooperated with the FBI and local authorities in trying to track down [Pavatt] and Brenda. In late February 2002, having run out of money, [Pavatt] and Brenda Andrew re-entered the United States at the Mexican border. They were promptly placed under arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Pavatt v.

An amended information was filed on July 19, 2002, charging them with one count of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. The prosecution also filed a bill of particulars alleging three aggravating circumstances for Mr. Pavatt: (1) that he committed the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration or employed another to commit the murder for remuneration or the promise of remuneration (the remuneration aggravator); (2) that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel (the HAC aggravator); and (3) that he constituted a continuing threat to society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Pavatt was tried separately from Ms. Andrew (who was also convicted on both counts and sentenced to death). His trial, which began on August 25, 2003, included a guilt phase followed by a sentencing phase. The jury found him guilty on both counts and found the remuneration and HAC aggravators. It also found that these aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and it recommended that Mr. Pavatt be sentenced to death on the first-degree-murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Pavatt filed a direct appeal asserting 18 propositions of error. On May 8, 2007, the OCCA rejected Mr. Pavatt's arguments and affirmed his convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pavatt I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303711\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/159/272/#p276\">\n    159 P.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On April 11, 2008, the OCCA issued an unpublished opinion denying the application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pavatt v.

On April 1, 2009, his counsel filed a \u00a7 2254 application asserting 15 grounds for relief. The application conceded that some of the claims were \"newly developed\" and \"m[ight] require further exhaustion.\" R. Vol. 3 at 335. For that reason, Mr. Pavatt requested that his application \"be held in abeyance so that he [could] return to state court to accomplish any necessary exhaustion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2062\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the district court declined to stay the case or otherwise hold it in abeyance.

On February 2, 2010, the OCCA issued an unpublished opinion denying the application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pavatt v.

Indeed, it begins with the sentence, \"Trial counsel objected to the admission of the video recording of the hunting trip.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this court Mr. Pavatt argues that the trial objection to the video was inadequate; but that claim was not made below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As for category 2, one sentence in the \"Live Photographs\" section of the petition states, \"A review of his conduct further reveals that trial counsel allowed multiple witnesses, who were friends and family of Rob Andrew, to testify to entirely irrelevant matters that could only raise sympathy in the minds of jurors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grounds 2, 7,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 318.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this one sentence, which is not developed further, and which is buried in a section whose heading\n   does not encompass the point, does not adequately preserve this ineffectiveness issue. The district court, not perceiving it as an issue, did not address it in the 112-page opinion denying relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, the only ineffectiveness claim relating to the guilt phase of the trial that was preserved in federal district court is that trial counsel did not adequately object to the admission of the photographs (and that appellate counsel did not raise on appeal this deficiency of trial counsel). Mr. Pavatt has not argued that admission of this evidence during the guilt phase violated any federal constitutional right. The alleged ineffectiveness was only counsel's failure to argue that the evidence should have been excluded under Oklahoma law. This ineffectiveness challenge clearly fails with respect to one of the pictures (State's Exhibit 219). In his first state postconviction petition, Mr. Pavatt argued that his trial and appellate counsel should have objected to the admission of the exhibit. But the OCCA rejected the argument, holding that the claim was barred by res judicata and noting that it had sustained the admissibility of a similar photograph in a prior case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pavatt II,\n   </em>\n   No. PCD-2004-25 at 6 n.6. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object to evidence cannot be sustained if the objection was doomed to fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

But even if competent counsel should have objected to the evidence, Mr. Pavatt's ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of prejudice. To prevail on such a claim, he must show that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the [guilt phase] would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054199\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1184/#p1198\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054199\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1184/#p1198\">\n    at 1197-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). We are at a total loss to see how, in light of the compelling evidence of guilt, the three photographs could have been a significant factor in the verdict; and Mr. Pavatt offers no argument in support.

The State agrees that it had to prove that Mr. Andrew experienced conscious physical suffering. But the supporting evidence is slim. The State points to three items of evidence. First, the testimony of the medical examiner. All he said, however, was that it was\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   (he did not testify that it was\n   <em>\n    probable\n   </em>\n   ) that Mr. Andrew could have been conscious for a time after the shooting; regarding pain, he said only that Mr. Andrew could have experienced pain while dying.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 2457-67. Second, the conversation between Mrs. Andrew and the 911 operator. While reciting her fabricated account of the murder, Mrs. Andrew, prompted by the operator, said that Mr. Andrew was still breathing and trying to talk to her. (She did not mention any sign of suffering or pain.) Finally, Mr. Andrew's body was found holding a plastic bag of cans, which, in the OCCA's view, \"reasonably suggested that he either tried to ward off his attacker or shield himself from being shot.\"\n   <em>\n    Pavatt I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8303711\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/159/272/#p276\">\n    159 P.3d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Perhaps a reasonable juror could have found this to be sufficient evidence of conscious physical suffering (although we note that the jury was never instructed that it needed to make that finding).

And\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   established that even when a State has previously applied a constitutionally valid narrowing construction of an aggravator, a death penalty imposed under the aggravator must still be based on a construction that in a \"principled way\" can distinguish the case from the many in which the penalty was not imposed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183794\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/420/\">\n    446 U.S. at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183794\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/420/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This case illustrates that the OCCA no longer construes \"conscious physical suffering\" so that it distinguishes in a principled way between crimes deserving death and the many cases in which the death penalty is not imposed. Virtually any murder in which the victim did not die instantly could qualify for the enhancement as presently construed if there is a possibility that the act of murder did not immediately render the victim unconscious and the wounds could have caused pain. The State has not offered any reason to believe, or even bothered to argue, that \"the brief period of conscious suffering necessarily present in virtually all murders,\"\n   <em>\n    Medlock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233423\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/1314/#p1324\">\n    200 F.3d at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lucero,\n   J., concurring), could provide a \"principled way to distinguish this case, in which the death penalty was imposed, from the many cases in which it was not,\"\n   <em>\n    Maynard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217116\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/356/#p359\">\n    486 U.S. at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217116\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/356/#p359\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if, though we doubt, many murder victims do not experience even a brief period of conscious physical suffering between the time of the fatal blow and death, that possibility would so often be purely a matter of chance that we think it is not a principled way to determine who should suffer the penalty of death and who should not. (Of course, the murderer's intent to cause such suffering would be another matter altogether.) Thus, the OCCA did not apply a constitutionally acceptable interpretation of Oklahoma's HAC aggravator in determining that the aggravator was supported by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   An important point requires emphasis. We are not saying that the OCCA in this case unconstitutionally applied a constitutionally acceptable narrowing construction of the State's HAC aggravator. We are saying that it did not apply the narrowing construction that we previously approved. By expanding the meaning of \"conscious physical suffering\" to encompass \"the brief period of conscious suffering necessarily present in virtually all murders,\"\n   <em>\n    Medlock,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233423\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/1314/#p1324\">\n    200 F.3d at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lucero, J., concurring)-as it did in this case-Oklahoma has construed the HAC aggravator in a constitutionally impermissible manner.\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   distinguished\n   <em>\n    Godfrey\n   </em>\n   on the ground that \"[u]nlike in\n   <em>\n    Godfrey,\n   </em>\n   there is no dispute in this case that the Arizona Supreme Court applied its narrowing construction of Arizona's ... aggravating circumstance to the facts of respondent's case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219216\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/764/#p774\">\n    497 U.S. at 776-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219216\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/764/#p774\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, however, there is such a dispute, and it is the heart of the matter. We are unwilling to hold that once we have held that an aggravator has been or could be constitutionally construed, we cannot revisit the issue after it is clear that the state court has not adopted a constitutionally acceptable construction. That is the lesson of\n   <em>\n    Godfrey,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   did not reject that lesson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We recognize that our standard of review in this appeal is established by AEDPA. We can grant relief \"with respect to [a] claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\" only if that adjudication \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). Here, however, the decision of the OCCA failed to pass muster under this provision. To properly decide whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the aggravator, the court needed to determine that the evidence would support a finding of\n   <em>\n    conscious physical suffering\n   </em>\n   under a definition of that term that satisfied both Oklahoma law and the Eighth Amendment. Although it could certainly determine how\n   <em>\n    conscious physical suffering\n   </em>\n   should be defined under Oklahoma law and (we will assume) it properly concluded that the evidence at trial satisfied that definition, it totally failed to consider the other component of the analysis-whether the definition it applied satisfies the Eighth Amendment. As Mr. Pavatt puts it, the OCCA did not address \"whether there was sufficient evidence to support a constitutional reading and application of the [HAC] aggravator.\" Reply Br. at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As we understand recent Supreme Court authority, the OCCA's rejection of Mr. Pavatt's sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim without applying or even considering controlling Supreme Court precedent (or at least engaging in an equivalent analysis even if not citing Supreme Court precedent) rendered its decision contrary to clearly established federal law.

In district court the State said that Mr. Pavatt's Ground Ten had been \"exhausted for purposes of federal habeas review.\" Response to Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus at 128. In its response to that ground the State included substantial references to the Eighth Amendment constraints on aggravators. And although the State's brief on appeal argued procedural bar with respect to several of Mr. Pavatt's claims, it did not argue in its appellate brief that the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim or any of its components was procedurally barred, nor did it argue procedural bar when questioned at oral argument about the insufficient-narrowing component of that claim. Likewise, the State has not objected to the Eighth Amendment component of Mr. Pavatt's sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim on the ground that our grant of COA did not encompass the issue.

I agree with Part III of the majority's opinion, which rejects certain of Pavatt's ineffective assistance of counsel claims and affirms the denial of federal habeas relief on Pavatt's convictions for first degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree murder. As I explain in greater detail below, however, I would add that there is no merit to any of Pavatt's ineffective assistance claims, or to his additional argument urging us to recognize an exception to the procedural bar that applies to most of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As for Part IV of the majority's opinion, I disagree with it in full. As I shall discuss in greater detail below, Pavatt's appellate brief in this case attempts to assert three distinct challenges to the jury's second-stage finding that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel (the HAC aggravating circumstance): (1) that the jury was not properly instructed regarding the HAC aggravating circumstance; (2) that the evidence presented at his sentencing proceeding was constitutionally insufficient to support the HAC aggravating circumstance; and (3) that the HAC aggravator, as applied in his case, is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Part IV of the majority's opinion only briefly touches on and does not ultimately resolve the first and0 second of these issues. Instead, Part IV focuses on and ultimately grants federal habeas relief on the basis of the Eighth Amendment claim. In doing so, however, Part IV ignores the undisputed fact that the Eighth Amendment claim is unexhausted because Pavatt never presented it to the OCCA. Part IV also ignores the undisputed fact that this court never granted Pavatt a certificate of appealability (COA) as to the Eighth Amendment claim. In short, Part IV grants Pavatt federal habeas relief on the basis of a claim that was never presented to or decided by the OCCA and that is not properly before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Thus, in sum, I would affirm the judgment of the district court denying Pavatt's petition for writ of habeas corpus in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Pavatt asserts a number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and appellate\n   counsel, including the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel that are addressed and rejected in Part III of the majority opinion. Although I agree with the majority that Pavatt is not entitled to federal habeas relief on the basis of these claims, I would conclude that only one of Pavatt's ineffective assistance claims is properly before us, and that the remainder are procedurally barred due to Pavatt's failure to present them to the OCCA \"in compliance with relevant state procedural rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Cone v.

That was a claim that his appellate attorneys failed to challenge on direct appeal the admissibility of a photograph of Rob Andrew taken prior to his death (State's Exhibit 219), and that the admission of that photograph \"rendered ... Pavatt's trial fundamentally unfair, depriving him of the Due Process of Law, and unconstitutionally injected passion, prejudice, and other arbitrary factors into the sentencing proceeding.\" Original App. for Post-Conviction Relief at 54 (citations omitted).

More specifically, the district court concluded \"it [wa]s clear that based on the case cited by the OCCA in its denial of [Pavatt]'s claim,\n   <em>\n    Marquez-Burrola\n   </em>\n   , as well as other cases decided by the OCCA prior to [Pavatt]'s appeal, that [Pavatt] would not have prevailed on appeal had the claim been raised.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   I agree with the district court. In\n   <em>\n    Marquez-Burrola\n   </em>\n   , the OCCA considered and rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 2403 of the Oklahoma Evidence Code, which states, in pertinent part, that \"an appropriate photograph of the victim while alive shall be admissible evidence when offered by the district attorney to show the general appearance and condition of the victim while alive.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2012%2C%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n    Okla.

The OCCA in that case also rejected the defendant's argument that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting, pursuant to \u00a7 2403, a single, premortem photograph of the victim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8318776\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/157/749/#p760\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8318776\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/157/749/#p760\">\n    at 760-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, the premortem photograph of Rob Andrew was admitted at Pavatt's trial without objection pursuant to \u00a7 2403, and I see nothing about that photograph or the facts of Pavatt's trial that would distinguish it from\n   <em>\n    Marquez-Burrola\n   </em>\n   . Further, the OCCA itself explicitly stated that, in light of\n   <em>\n    Marquez-Burrola\n   </em>\n   , it would not have granted relief to Pavatt had he challenged the admission of Exhibit 219 on direct appeal. Consequently, Pavatt has failed to establish that he was prejudiced\n   by the failure of his appellate counsel to raise the issue on direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   All of the remaining ineffective assistance claims asserted by Pavatt in this appeal-trial counsel's failure to prevent the admission of pervasive victim-impact evidence in both stages of trial (other than Exhibit 219), trial counsel's failure to investigate and present a compelling mitigation case, and appellate counsel's failure to assert these claims of ineffective assistance on direct appeal-were first presented by Pavatt to the OCCA in his second application for state post-conviction relief. The OCCA concluded that these claims were procedurally barred under the provisions of the Oklahoma Post-Conviction Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201080\">\n    Okla.

State\n   </em>\n   , No. PCD-2009-777 at 2 (Okla. Crim. App. Feb. 2, 2010). Further, the OCCA noted that it could \"not consider the merits of any claim made in a subsequent application for postconviction relief, unless (1) the legal basis for that claim was previously unavailable, or (2) the facts supporting the claim were not previously ascertainable through the exercise of reasonable diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201080\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201080\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, he contends that \"[t]he OCCA did not clearly impose a procedural bar of these claims, but instead stated the 'current arguments merely modify or expand the claims made, and rejected, in prior proceedings.' \" Aplt. Br. at 50 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pavatt\n   </em>\n   , No. PCD-2009-777 at 4). This argument makes little sense when one recalls that the ineffective assistance of counsel claims he now asserts were first raised in his second application for state post-conviction relief. Further, as discussed above and as Pavatt ultimately concedes in a related footnote, the OCCA quite clearly concluded that these claims were procedurally barred under Oklahoma's Post-Conviction Procedure Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201080\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 50-51 n.14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   That leads to Pavatt's second argument: \"Even if this Court determines the OCCA imposed a procedural bar, such a bar is not without exception. Post-conviction counsel's ineffectiveness in not fully challenging the failures of prior counsel to object to the inadmissible sympathy evidence is the 'cause' that excuses any default.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201080\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2022%2C%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201080\">\n    at 50-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

With this I would agree. And, in any event, I conclude, for the reasons outlined below, that the OCCA's resolution of the claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   In challenging the OCCA's decision, Pavatt begins by offering his own summary of the relevant evidence, arguing that the crime at issue resulted in \"[a] shotgun death\" that involved \"no conscious suffering beyond what accompanies any murder.\" Aplt. Br. at 21. According to Pavatt, \"[t]here was no gratuitous violence,\" \"no torture,\" and \"no anguish or suffering beyond that which necessarily accompanied the underlying killing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, Pavatt argues that \"[t]he two shotgun blasts were both independently fatal\" and Rob Andrew \"could not have remained conscious for more than a few moments, before going into shock and quickly bleeding to death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22. In sum, Pavatt argues, \"[i]f Rob Andrew's homicide was 'heinous, atrocious or cruel,' then any murder in which the victim does not die instantly satisfies this factor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The problem with Pavatt's description of the evidence is that it wholly ignores the standard of review mandated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   . As we have noted,\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   requires a reviewing court to \"view[ ] the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    443 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/#p319\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When that standard is applied to the evidence presented in Pavatt's case, it simply does not support his description of the relevant facts. Although it is true that each of the shotgun blasts were independently lethal, Pavatt is simply incorrect in asserting that Rob Andrew \"could not have remained conscious for more than a few moments.\" Aplt. Br. at 21. Indeed, the medical examiner who testified on behalf of the prosecution conceded it was possible that Rob Andrew remained conscious for several minutes after sustaining the wounds. And that testimony, combined with Brenda Andrew's statements to the 911 operator regarding Rob Andrew's condition (which we will discuss in greater detail below), would have allowed the jury to reasonably find that he indeed remained conscious far longer than \"a few moments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Pavatt also argues that the OCCA \"relied on irrelevant speculation about what Rob [Andrew] was feeling.\" Aplt. Br. at 24. In support, Pavatt examines and attempts to discredit each of the factors cited by the OCCA in support of its determination. To begin with, Pavatt asserts that \"[t]he 'numerous wounds ' referred to by the OCCA were caused by pellets from the same shotgun, shot at nearly the same time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Although Pavatt is correct on this point, that does not prove the OCCA's determination to be wrong. Indeed, the medical examiner testified at trial that the two shotgun blasts damaged Rob Andrew's right lung, aorta, and liver. In addition, the photographs of Rob Andrew's body quite clearly indicate that the shotgun pellets caused numerous, separate entry and exit wounds on his body. And, although Pavatt asserts that these wounds\"did not contribute to an inordinate amount of conscious pain prior to death,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30, the medical examiner testified to the contrary, noting the wounds would, indeed, have been painful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Pavatt in turn argues that, contrary to the OCCA's determination, \"the quick loss of blood from both wounds resulted in shock and loss of consciousness within one minute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But this argument ignores, and is ultimately contrary to, the testimony of the medical examiner. The medical examiner testified that, as a result of the blood loss associated with the wounds, Rob Andrew would have lost consciousness before he actually died. The medical examiner declined on direct examination to give an exact amount of time that Rob Andrew remained conscious after sustaining the wounds. On cross-examination, the medical examiner agreed that it was possible that Rob Andrew died less than one minute after sustaining the wounds, but he also testified that Rob Andrew \"probably\" would have lost consciousness within five minutes. Tr. at 2462. And, on redirect, the medical examiner testified it was possible that Rob Andrew remained conscious for more than one minute after sustaining the wounds. Ultimately, the medical examiner's testimony, construed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would have allowed the jury to find that Rob Andrew remained conscious for several minutes after sustaining the wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Pavatt argues that the fact that Rob Andrew was found \"clutching the plastic trash bag was meaningless in determining whether [he] consciously suffered and thus, it was unreasonable for the OCCA to speculate about why [he] may have been holding the bag.\" Aplt. Br. at 30. I disagree. It is unknown whether Rob Andrew was holding the trash bag prior to being\n   ambushed, or whether, instead, he was able to pick up the bag and attempt to fend off his attacker after sustaining one or both shotgun blasts. Because the OCCA was obligated to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was entirely reasonable for it to draw the latter inference. And that inference was relevant to the OCCA's assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the HAC aggravator because it would have supported a finding that Rob Andrew remained conscious, and indeed mobile, after one or both shotgun blasts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Pavatt also complains that it was unreasonable for the OCCA \"to conclude that Rob consciously suffered based on Brenda's statements in her 911 calls, when everything she said in those calls was determined to be false.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The fallacy of this argument, however, is the notion that all of Brenda's statements to the 911 operator were proven to be false. The fact of the matter is that at least some of Brenda's statements during the two 911 calls were obviously true. For example, it is undisputed that she was physically present with Rob Andrew after he suffered the two shotgun blasts and during at least the second 911 call. Further, her statements to the 911 operator that she and Rob Andrew had been shot were indisputably true. Likewise, some of her statements describing what she was witnessing, such as the arrival of police officers to her house, were also quite clearly true (indeed, officers' voices can be heard in the background during the second 911 call at the precise time that Brenda tells the 911 operator that the police have arrived on the scene). Thus, the jury, having listened to recordings of both 911 calls, was left to decide whether her statements to the 911 operator regarding Rob's condition, including her statement that he was conscious and attempting to talk to her, and her repeated statements that he was breathing, were credible or not. Although the jury was not bound to give credence to those statements, it was certainly within the jury's province to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry v. New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    565 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 732,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186177,12445445\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/228/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (noting it is \"the jury's task [to] assess[ ] witness credibility and reliability\"). Consequently, I conclude it was in turn reasonable for the OCCA, applying the standard of review mandated by\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , to treat as credible Brenda's statements regarding Rob Andrew's condition in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to support the HAC aggravator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Finally, Pavatt argues that no \"deference [should be] afforded [the jury's verdict] under\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   \" because \"[t]here were no conflicting facts about how Rob [Andrew] died.\" Aplt. Br. at 22. I disagree.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   provides, in relevant part, that \"a federal habeas corpus court faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume-even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record-that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\" at 326. That is precisely the situation we have here. As we have already explained, the evidence presented at Pavatt's trial most certainly \"supports conflicting inferences\" regarding how long Rob Andrew remained conscious after sustaining the two shotgun blasts. We therefore presume that the jury in Pavatt's trial, having found the existence of the HAC aggravator, resolved these conflicts in favor of the prosecution. And, in turn, we, like the OCCA, must defer to that resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In sum, I conclude that Pavatt has failed to establish that the OCCA's determination that the evidence was sufficient to support the HAC aggravator was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Thus,\n   Pavatt is not entitled to federal habeas relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   In his third and final challenge, Pavatt argues that the HAC aggravating circumstance, as applied in his case, is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The majority agrees with Pavatt and indeed grants him federal habeas relief on the basis of this claim. In doing so, however, the majority ignores the fact that the claim is both procedurally barred and not properly before this court. Moreover, even ignoring these procedural problems, the majority's analysis ignores the fact that the jury's finding of the HAC aggravator in Pavatt's case is entirely consistent with the body of OCCA case law that has tailored and applied the HAC aggravating circumstance in a manner that avoids the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death penalty. Consequently, Pavatt is not entitled to federal habeas relief on the basis of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <em>\n    Pavatt's failure to present the claim to the OCCA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   In his second application for state post-conviction relief, Pavatt argued to the OCCA that the HAC aggravating circumstance was facially vague, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (i.e., a facial challenge to the HAC aggravating circumstance). The OCCA declined to review the merits of that claim, noting that the claim could have been raised in Pavatt's first application for state post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   At no point has Pavatt ever argued to the OCCA that the HAC aggravating circumstance, as applied in his case, is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments (an as-applied challenge). Consequently, the OCCA has never had an opportunity to address that claim. And, were Pavatt to attempt to present the claim now to the OCCA, by way of a belated application for state post-conviction relief, the OCCA would presumably treat it as untimely and procedurally barred. Thus, the claim has been procedurally defaulted for purposes of federal habeas review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

In light of\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   , it appears clear that such a factual finding can be made only by a jury.
