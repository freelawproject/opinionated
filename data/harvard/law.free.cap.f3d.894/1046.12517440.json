Deborah Colbert died after a confrontation with police. Her biological son, plaintiff Leland Wheeler, seeks to assert claims on her behalf under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Fourth Amendment, the\n   Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Rehabilitation Act (\"RA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wheeler also brings a Fourteenth Amendment claim under \u00a7 1983 on his own behalf for loss of companionship resulting from her death. The district court dismissed the case, finding that Wheeler had no legally cognizable interest in his relationship with Colbert and that he was not a proper successor in interest to her under California law because he had been adopted by other parents as an infant. The district court also denied leave to amend the complaint. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The complaint in this case alleges as follows: Deborah Colbert called 911 on April 13, 2014, and stated that she had taken pills, drank heavily, and would use a baseball bat to provoke the police to shoot her. Police officers were dispatched to her residence in response to her call. One of the officers had effectuated an involuntary mental health detention on Colbert eight days prior. When another officer obtained a key to Colbert's apartment from a building manager and attempted to enter, Colbert emerged from her apartment holding a baseball bat. The officers shot Colbert, and she died the following day from her resulting injuries. Leland Wheeler is the biological son and only known living relative of Colbert. He was adopted by other parents as an infant, but alleges that he maintained a \"close relationship with Ms. Colbert during part of his childhood and throughout his adult life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Wheeler filed this action in his individual capacity and on behalf of Colbert against the City of Santa Clara and several Santa Clara police officers (\"Santa Clara\"). The complaint also named as a plaintiff \"John Doe 1,\" described as \"the to-be-identified personal representative\" of Colbert's estate. Colbert's estate was not submitted to probate and no personal representative was appointed. Wheeler asserted two \u00a7 1983 claims on his own behalf: a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim for deprivation of his right to a familial relationship with his biological mother and a related\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim for supervisory liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wheeler also asserted a Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, a related\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim for supervisory liability, and claims under the ADA and RA\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of Colbert. Santa Clara moved to dismiss Wheeler's substantive due process claims and the claims asserted on Colbert's behalf. Wheeler requested leave to amend the complaint with the name of the Colbert estate's personal representative once one had been appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Granting Santa Clara's motion, the district court dismissed all of the claims without leave to amend. The court found that, although California's survivorship law prevented Wheeler from bringing claims on behalf of Colbert, the statute was not inconsistent\n   with \u00a7 1983. The court also held that federal common law would not permit him to bring the \u00a7 1983 and ADA and RA survivorship claims. The court further determined that Wheeler lacked a constitutionally protected interest in his relationship with Colbert because their legal relationship had been severed. Finally, the district court denied his request for leave to amend as futile. Wheeler timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This court reviews de novo standing issues,\n   <em>\n    In re Zappos.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516627,12516628\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1020/\">\n    888 F.3d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1024 (9th Cir. 2018), and orders granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,\n   <em>\n    Lloyd v.

He contends that (1) California's survivorship law undermines the deterrence and compensation goals of \u00a7 1983 because it would allow claims to abate when a civil rights violation caused the decedent's death; (2) federal common law of survivorship permits Wheeler to assert claims on behalf of Colbert; (3) the Fourteenth Amendment protects the companionship interests of all biological children and parents, regardless of the legal status of their relationship; and (4) the court abused its discretion by not allowing Wheeler to substitute an as yet nonexistent personal representative for Colbert's estate as plaintiff in this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    California's Survival Statute Applies to Wheeler's \u00a7 1983 Claims.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Wheeler asserts that state survivorship law can fill interstices where federal civil rights legislation does not provide a survivorship regime only so long as state law is not inconsistent with the purposes of the relevant federal civil rights law. He contends that because California's survivorship law allows claims to abate when a civil rights violation causes the decedent's death, its application would undermine the deterrence and compensation goals of \u00a7 1983.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, he argues, the California survivorship law is so inconsistent with \u00a7 1983 that recourse to federal common law is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[T]he decision as to the applicable survivorship rule\" in a \u00a7 1983 action \"is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

As Wheeler indisputably does not meet the requirements for standing under California law, he cannot assert \u00a7 1983 claims on behalf of Colbert. Further, although federal common law applies to the ADA and RA claims, Wheeler is still not an appropriate plaintiff for a survival action based on those laws. Wheeler also cannot bring a claim for loss of companionship with Colbert because they did not have the kind of parent-child relationship entitled to this type of constitutional protection. Finally, because no proper plaintiff existed at the time of the district court's ruling, denying leave to amend the complaint was not an abuse of discretion. Therefore, we affirm the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   WARDLAW, Circuit Judge, concurring in opinion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While Wheeler does not and cannot allege a viable claim, I wish to emphasize what this opinion does not hold. We do not hold that no adopted-out child could prove he had a protected interest in his relationship with his biological parent under the Fourteenth Amendment. We no longer live in a world of conventional families with two heterosexual parents and only one mother. Some children have two mothers in a same-sex marriage; some children have two mothers because their heterosexual parents got divorced and remarried; and in fact, there are some children who have even more than two mothers. The intimate relationship between a parent and child is not limited by number; it is a practice, dependent on intimacy and association over time. Whether we approve or disapprove of these developing alternative family structures is irrelevant. There is no reason why an adopted-out child could not have had a \"deeply loving and interdependent relationship\" with both his adoptive and his biological mother under other circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Spielman v.
