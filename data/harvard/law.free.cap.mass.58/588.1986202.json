And we are of opinion that the motions are fully sustained by the Rev. Sts. <em>c, </em>109, <em>\u00a7 </em>7, and v. 90, <em>\u00a7 </em>16, and <em>c. </em>2, \u00a7 13. By the first statute it is provided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>that \u201c If all the persons named as trustees dwell in one county, the writ shall be returnable in that county.\u201d If the trustees were natural persons, dwelling in the county of Worcester, there can be no doubt that the writ should have been made returnable in that county; for such is the express requirement of the statute. By the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>2, \u00a7 13, it is provided, that the word \u201c person \u201d may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate, as well as to individuals. And by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>90, \u00a7 16, it is provided, that \u201c When one of the parties to the action\u201d (that is, any action) \u201cis a corporation, of any other description than those before mentioned in this section,\u201d (not including banking corporations,) \u201cthe action may be brought in any county, in which such corporation shall have any established or usual place of business, or shall have held its last usual meeting, or shall usually hold its meetings ; or if the other party to such action is a natural person, the action may be brought in the county where such person lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">From the language of the first-cited statute it might be doubtful, whether it should be so construed as to apply to bodies politic and corporate, as well as to individuals; but taking into consideration the other two statutes, in the construction of that first cited, we think there can be no reasonable doubt, that it was intended to apply to corporations, such as the trustees in this case, as well as to natural persons. There can be no reason why it should not be so construed; for the object of the statute is, to prevent trustees from being compelled to answer in any other county than that in which they dwell; and although the word \u201c dwell \u201d is not usually applied to corporations, yet the reason of the provision unquestionably applies to corporations. We are therefore of opinion, that the motions to dismiss the action are well founded; nor can the action be maintained by the plaintiff\u2019s discontinuing against the trustees. The tenth section of the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>109, applies only to cases where the court has jurisdiction. The case of <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Fales, </em>6 Greenl. 405, cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel, fully supports the defendants\u2019 motion on this point. That case, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ever, was decided on a plea in abatement; and by the law of Maine relative to this subject, it is provided, that if an action is brought in a wrong county, the writ shall abate. But there is no such provision in this state, and we think no plea in abatement is necessary, all the essential facts appearing on the writ and return. See <em>Jacobs </em>v. Mellen, 14 Mass. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>Action dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
