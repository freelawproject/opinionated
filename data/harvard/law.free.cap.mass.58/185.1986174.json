Sts. <em>c. </em>48, <em>\u00a7 </em>2, <em>cl. </em>10) relating to the settlement of the inhabitants of a town, on a division thereof, as to the settlement of the paupers referred to in such act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">This was an action of assumpsit for the support of Benjamin B. Pettis, a pauper, whose settlement was alleged to be in the town of Rehoboth. The trial was before <em>Hopkinson, </em>J., in the court of common pleas. It being admitted, that the expenses sued for had been incurred by the plaintiffs, as alleged by them, and that the defendants had received due notice, it was contended, on the part of the plaintiffs, that the pauper derived his settlement through his father, Ira Pettis, from James Pettis, his grandfather, whose settlement was in Rehoboth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-9\">To establish the settlement of James Pettis, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>offered evidence of his residence in Rehoboth from 1768 to 1799 ; of the publication of intentions of marriage between him and Mary Streeter, on the 8th of October, 1768; of the births of children of James and Mary Pettis, in the record of births in the town of Rehoboth, at different times from 1769 to 1795, and among others that of Ira Pettis, the father of the pauper, on the 17th of May, 1795; that James Pettis, after the year 1799 (but the precise time when did not appear), removed to the town of Hopkinton, in the county of Middlesex, where he resided until the year 1819; that during his residence in Hopkinton, he at different times received relief as a pauper from the defendants; that in the year 1819, James Pettis and his wife were removed, at the expense of the defendants, to Rehoboth, and there supported as paupers until their death, three or four years after-wards; and that in the year 1820, fra Pettis, the son of James and father of the pauper, received aid from the town of Hopkinton, as a pauper, and that the expense so incurred was repaid by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-5\">The defendants introduced as a witness the town clerk of Rehoboth, who stated that there were records of that town from 1643, but that for some years there were no assessors\u2019 lists to be found, and that he had examined the books of the town, to see if James Pettis had been assessed. The plaintiffs objected to any testimony of the witness as to the contents of the books; but the court permitted him to testify, that he had made such examination and found no such assessment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-6\">The defendants also introduced Peter Wheaton, who testified that he was born in 1768, in the then town of Rehoboth ; that his birth took place and he had ever since resided upon that part of the town which was afterwards incorporated as Seekonk; that he had known James Pettis from his (witness\u2019s) boyhood to 1799; that during all this time, James Pettis resided in that part of Rehoboth, which after-wards became Seekonk; and that he (the witness) could recollect things which occurred when he was ten years old.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-7\">The town of Seekonk was incorporated by the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>1811, <em>c. </em>133, passed on the 12th of February, 1812, the third section of which provided, that all the expenses arising for the support of the poor of Rehoboth, with which it was then chargeable, together with such poor as had removed out of Rehoboth prior to the act, but who might thereafter be lawfully returned to said town for support, should be equally divided between Seekonk and Rehoboth; and that when the town of Seekonk should be organized, the paupers, whether supported in whole or in part only, should be divided as nearly as might be, and one half of the number delivered over to the overseers of the poor of that town, to be by them in future supported.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">The court instructed the jury, upon this evidence, that if they believed the facts stated by Wheaton, as to the residence of James Pettis, they would not be warranted in finding that the settlement of the pauper was in the town of Rehoboth; and the jury having returned their verdict accordingly for the defendants, the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-6\"><em>B. F. Thomas, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-7\"><em>N.

He removed from Rehoboth in 1799, when his son Ira, the father of the pauper, was only four years old; and his last dwelling-place was in that part of Rehoboth which is now Seekonk. Neither the grandfather nor father of the pauper ever acquired a settlement in any other town, and of course the settlement of the pauper is the same as theirs, until he acquires a new one; which he has not yet done.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">What is the law, on these facts ? By <em>St. </em>1793, <em>c. </em>34, \u00a7 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>(reenacted in the Rev. Sts. c. 45, \u00a7 1, <em>cl. </em>10,) \u201c upon the division of towns, or districts, every person having a legal settlement therein, but being removed therefrom at the time of such division, and not having gained a legal settlement elsewhere, shall have his legal settlement in that town or district wherein his last dwelling-place or home shall happen to fall upon such division.\u201d By this provision, the settlement of the pauper\u2019s grandfather and father was transferred to Seekonk, upon the division of the town of Rehoboth. So of the settlement of the pauper, if he was born before the division. If he was not born till afterwards, then, by virtue of another provision in <em>St. </em>1793, <em>c. </em>34, \u00a7 2, he follows and has the settlement of his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">It was argued for the plaintiffs, that by the act incorporating Seekonk, <em>(St. </em>1811, <em>c. </em>133, \u00a7 3,) the provisions of the general law are so changed as to fix the pauper\u2019s settlement in Rehoboth. But we are clearly of opinion, both on principle and on the authorities cited by the defendants\u2019 counsel, that the general law must be applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
