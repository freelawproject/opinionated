It also appeared, that the defendants had male <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>payments to the amount of $243064, and it was for the balance, with interest, that this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">The defendants filed an account in set-off, in which, in addition to their payments, they claimed the sum of $9024, the amount of certain charges for loss on the ale by its bursting or souring; and it appeared, that there was a custom among dealers in ale, that ale should be at the risk of the seller while on its passage, and that all losses by bursting or souring during that time should fall on the seller. It did not appear, that any notice was ever given to the plaintiff of the alleged losses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">The defendants offered evidence tending to show a custom among dealers in ale, for the buyer, in the case supposed, to charge such losses to the seller in general account; and also evidence to prove the nature and amount of the losses charged in the present case. But they contended, further, that if they failed to establish the custom to charge for losses, the evidence as to the nature and amount of the losses was nevertheless competent to go to the jury to show, that the ale sold was so injured or inferior as not to be worth the sum charged for it, or that it was not of the quantity or quality alleged to have been sold to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">The presiding judge instructed the jury, that if they should not find such a custom, \u2014 no notice to the plaintiff of loss or damage being proved, \u2014 the defendants could not introduce evidence of the partial loss or deterioration of the ale; and that all such evidence must, in that event, be disregarded by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-9\"><em>E.
