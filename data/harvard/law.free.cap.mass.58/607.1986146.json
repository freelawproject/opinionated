The defence was a discharge duly obtained by the defendant under the bankrupt law of the United States, for the benefit of which he petitioned on the 28th of June, 1842. The defendant occupied the premises until the 4th of August, 1842, which was the date of the writ, and was then ejected by the statute process of forcible entry and detainer.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-10\">There was no appearance for the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-11\"><em>J W </em>Perry, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Fletcher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">The discharge in bankruptcy does not discharge this claim, and the plaintiff must have judgment for one quarter\u2019s rent. The petition in bankruptcy was on the 28th of June, 1842. The quarter under the lease expired and the rent for the quarter now claimed became due on the 9tli of July, 1842. This was not a debt due at the time of the discharge, nor was it a contingent debt within the meaning of the bankrupt law, because the claim is in part for the occupancy of the premises by the bankrupt after the discharge, and though that part be but a small part, it does not affect the principle. The assets of the bankrupt cannot be charged for the occupancy of the bankrupt after the time of the discharge. <em>Hendricks </em>v. <em>Judah, </em>2 Caines, 25; <em>Bosler </em>v. <em>Kuhn, </em>8 W. &amp; S. 183.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
