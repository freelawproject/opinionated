(SAG) was interested in establishing an automobile dealership and corporate headquarters on U.S. Route 1, south of Alexandria. SAG, however, wanted someone else to acquire and develop the property, and Benjamin B. Bell, Jr., agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">In September 1986, SAG signed a 10-year lease for over 60% of the 88,000 square feet of rentable space in a multi-story building that Bell planned to erect on the property. Edwin L. Stohlman, III, personally guaranteed the tenant\u2019s obligations under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">Later, the lease contract was amended, substituting S&amp;B Limited Partnership (S&amp;B) for Bell as the lessor, and adding Edwin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Stohlman, Inc., T/A Stohlman Nissan/Saab, as a tenant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since the two Stohlman corporations and Edwin L. Stohlman, III, do not distinguish between their respective rights and liabilities in this case, we will refer to them individually and collectively as Stohlman.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">S&amp;B, with Stohlman\u2019s participation, designed the ground floor and basement of the building for one of SAG\u2019s automobile dealerships and the top two floors for SAG\u2019s executive offices. SAG\u2019s lease was to begin upon Bell\u2019s substantial completion of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In April 1989, S&amp;B executed a deed of trust upon the property and assigned the Stohlman lease to American Security Bank (ASB) to secure the payment of ASB\u2019s $11 million acquisition and construction loan upon the property. Stohlman subordinated its lease to the deed of trust. Stohlman also agreed that if the property was sold under the deed of trust, Stohlman would be \u201cdirectly bound\u201d to any purchaser of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Thereafter, ASB made periodic advances to S&amp;B for acquisition of the land and construction of the building. During the course of construction, Stohlman advised S&amp;B that \u201cit no longer [had] any interest\u201d in leasing space in the building. However, S&amp;B contended that Stohlman was still bound on the lease and continued construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In the latter part of 1990, the Northern Virginia market for the rental and sale of this type of property declined. And beginning in 1991, there was a severe recession in that market. On October 25, 1990, when the building was 85% complete, Stohlman gave written notice to ASB that Stohlman would not lease space in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">On November 5, 1990, Stohlman filed a bill in equity against S&amp;B and Bell seeking, among other things, a declaration that the lease was void and unenforceable. S&amp;B and Bell responded by asking the court to declare the lease valid and binding. ASB intervened and filed an answer and cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">ASB deemed the \u201cprospect of protracted and expensive litigation regarding the lease\u201d and the diminution of the value of its security by the possible loss of Stohlman\u2019s lease as material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>changes in S&amp;B\u2019s financial condition. Accordingly, ASB exercised a contractual right not to make further advances unless S&amp;B deposited $387,217 with ASB to cover the expected \u201cshortfall\u201d of funds to complete and finance the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Since S&amp;B was unable to make the deposit, ASB advanced no further funds and construction stopped. And S&amp;B could not comply with ASB\u2019s later demand under their contract that S&amp;B pay the $8,229,768.49 principal balance of the loan, plus interest and other charges. Hence, ASB directed the trustee to sell the property under the deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">ASB, the only bidder at the trustee\u2019s sale on October 23, 1991, bought the property for $1,150,000, and assigned its rights to SOB-A Corporation (SOB-A), which was organized by ASB. Upon acquisition of title from the trustee on November 6, 1991, SOB-A found that it would cost from $750,000 to $950,000 to complete construction of the building. Accordingly, SOB-A decided to sell the property without completing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">SOB-A planned to dispose of the property, either by leasing it to a credit-worthy tenant and selling \u201cthe value of that lease to an investor,\u201d or by selling the property directly to a user or investor. SOB-A mailed information about the property to 31 possible tenants and real estate brokerage companies, and directly contacted 13 of those parties, as well as a number of other possible users. However, SOB-A received only four offers to purchase the property and no offers to lease the property at any price. On October 28, 1992, SOB-A contracted to sell the property to Jemal Alexandria, Inc., for $1,950,000 and closed on that contract in September 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The case was tried before the court in January 1994. By agreement of the parties, ASB\u2019s claim against Stohlman seeking damages for breach of the lease was heard first. At the conclusion of ASB\u2019s case, Stohlman rested its case without presenting evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Conceding that it had breached the lease between October 19 and 25, 1990, Stohlman nevertheless moved for judgment in its favor upon the ground that ASB had failed to prove its damages. Stohlman contended that ASB had not introduced evidence of the fair market rental value of the leased premises, \u201cready to go, [and] functional,\u201d on the date of the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Concluding the evidence showed that at the time of Stohlman\u2019s breach and afterward the premises had no apparent rental value, the court denied Stohlman\u2019s motion. Hence, the court entered judgment against Stohlman for $4,579,093, the discounted present value of the lease as of the date of the breach, less the sale price of the property to Jemal, since ASB was willing to give Stohlman this credit. Stohlman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Because Stohlman breached the provisions of its lease prior to taking possession of the premises, its liability for that default arises from breach of contract. <em>James </em>v. <em>Kibler, </em>94 Va. 165, 172, 26 S.E. 417, 418 (1896); <em>see Branning Mfg. Co. v. Norfolk-Southern R.R., </em>138 Va. 43, 60, 121 S.E. 74, 79-80 (1924). And, ASB had the burden of showing \u201cthat the rental value of the [Stohlman lease] was less than the contract rental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 121 S.E. at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Stohlman argues that the judgment should be reversed because \u201cASB failed to offer <em>any </em>evidence as to the fair market rental value of the lease premises in question in violation of this court\u2019s ruling in Branning.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Stohlman\u2019s reliance upon <em>Branning </em>is misplaced. In <em>Branning, </em>the evidence showed that the completed buildings had rental value; indeed, some of these buildings continued to be rented to prior tenants after the defendant\u2019s breach. In contrast, Bell testified that not long before Stohlman\u2019s breach, when Stohlman told him it was no longer interested in the space, he and Stohlman attempted unsuccessfully to interest a number of other automobile dealers in leasing the Stohlman space. In addition, ASB\u2019s evidence showed that it was likewise unsuccessful in its attempt to lease the entire building after Stohlman\u2019s breach. In our opinion, this evidence and the evidence of the market decline provide <em>prima facie </em>evidence that Stohlman\u2019s lease in the uncompleted building had no apparent market value on the date of Stohlman\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">However, Stohlman contends that ASB had the additional burden of showing the \u201chypothetical\u201d market rental value of Stohlman\u2019s portion of the building had ASB completed construction. ASB denies that it had this additional burden under the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Stohlman\u2019s contention ignores the reality of the situation shown in this record. ASB\u2019s uncontradicted evidence discloses that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>would have cost up to $950,000 to complete the building in a severely depressed real estate rental and sale market.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Thus, the evidence permits an inference that it would have been unreasonable to spend those additional funds. Therefore, ASB had no obligation to do so. As noted by one authority on damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">If the effort, risk, sacrifice or expense which the person wronged must incur in order to avoid or minimize a loss or injury is such that under all the circumstances a reasonable man might well decline to incur it, a failure to do so imposes no disability against recovering full damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>Charles T. McCormick, Handbook on the Law of Damages </em>\u00a7 35 (1935); <em>accord CSX Transp., Inc. v. Casale, </em>247 Va. 180, 185-86, 441 S.E.2d 212, 216 (1994) (plaintiff must do what reasonable man would have done to limit damages); <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Caligari, Inc., </em>204 Va. 284, 289-90, 130 S.E.2d 447, 451 (1963) (contract breacher\u2019s mitigation instruction speculative and improper where \u201cmost probable\u201d suggested mitigation would have increased damages); <em>Hannan </em>v. <em>Dusch, </em>154 Va. 356, 378, 153 S.E. 824, 831 (1930) (plaintiff must exercise \u201creasonable exertions or care\u201d to prevent damages). Accordingly, we conclude that ASB established a <em>prima facie </em>case of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">And, where a plaintiff makes a <em>prima facie </em>case of damages, we impose the burden upon the defendant of going forward with evidence to reduce those damages. <em>Casale, </em>247 Va. at 185-86, 441 S.E.2d at 215-16 (reduction of injured Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act plaintiff\u2019s projected loss-of-wage claim to present market value); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>237 Va. 626, 630-31, 379 S.E.2d 464, 467 (1989) (evidence of landlord\u2019s betterment in replacing personal property wrongfully removed by tenant); <em>see Paddock </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>187 Va. 809, 818-19, 48 S.E.2d 199, 203-204 (1948) (opportunity for \u201cother employment of an approximately similar kind reasonably adapted to his abilities\u201d by wrongfully discharged employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Since ASB had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of damages, we think that Stohlman had the burden of going forward with evidence to show the advisability of completing the building in order to shift the burden to ASB to prove the \u201chypothetical\u201d rent. There being no such evidence, we conclude that the evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ports the trial court\u2019s finding that the premises had no apparent rental value on the date of Stohlman\u2019s breach.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajv\">Accordingly, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> S&amp;B was originally comprised of Bell and Edwin L. Stohlman, III, as limited partners and Bell as the general partner. Later, when Edwin L. Stohlman discovered that he would have to personally guarantee payment of any construction financing, he assigned his interest in the partnership to Bell and Bonnie L. Bell, Bell\u2019s wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\"><em> </em>S&amp;B and Bell took no part in the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\"> We do not consider Stohlman\u2019s contention that any recovery should be reduced by the costs of completing, maintaining, and operating the building during the term of the lease.
