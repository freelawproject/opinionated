Tait\u00f3n, the defendant below, was involved in developing a 9.5-acre tract of land that he had purchased in 1981 in Fairfax County. The project is known as Williamsburg Commons and involves construction in two phases of houses on 38 lots. Each lot was valued at $175,000, and the anticipated sales prices of the homes ranged from $470,000 to $700,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In early 1992, the project was behind schedule and construction was stopped because defendant\u2019s lender, Dominion Bank, had ceased financing and begun foreclosure proceedings. At that time, defendant owed approximately $4 million to Dominion, which had committed funds for \u201cacquisition,\u201d \u201cdevelopment,\u201d and \u201cconstruction.\u201d Defendant procured Dominion\u2019s tentative agreement to discount the $4 million debt to $2.5 million if defendant could find another lender to refinance the obligation to Dominion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">During the \u201cfirst quarter of 1992,\u201d defendant contacted consultants and numerous banks seeking financing. These efforts produced several \u201cfinancing packages,\u201d but they were unsatisfactory because, according to defendant, they \u201cweren\u2019t going to occur timely enough.\u201d Defendant then contacted several brokers, including appellant Lenders Financial Corporation, the plaintiff below, to find him the necessary financing. Plaintiff was a mortgage banking company that, in 1992, \u201cdid some brokering of commercial type loans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In early 1992, several of plaintiffs officers met with defendant on the project site. At the time, only one home, which was occupied by defendant, had been completed. Defendant \u201cexplained his predicament\u201d and stated that \u201che really needed a new loan to keep the project going\u201d and \u201cto get out from under the present loan with Dominion Bank.\u201d The plaintiffs president, James R. Niblock, told defendant he \u201cwas very skeptical that anything at all could be done\u201d and urged defendant \u201cto work out something\u201d with Dominion Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">About a week later, plaintiffs representatives, including William C. Harrison, its executive vice president, met defendant on the site. Defendant stated that he \u201cjust needed a loan to take out Dominion\u201d and represented that he had procured sales contracts from six prospective purchasers who \u201cwere willing and able to sign for their own construction loans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">After further discussions, defendant and his wife signed a letter addressed to Harrison dated March 26, 1992 to \u201coutline\u201d the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>quest for financial assistance. In a section of the letter labelled \u201cWhat we need,\u201d defendant wrote, \u201cA commitment for a two and one half million dollar loan ($2,500,000)\u201d and \u201cA letter of credit to Fairfax County for approximately $200,000.\u201d In the letter, defendant stated that \u201cSix houses have been sold\u201d and that he expected to sell \u201can additional two to three in April.\u201d Commenting on the progress of the project, he wrote, \u201cAll of the utilities are in for the eleven lots in Phase I with more than 40% of the work performed for Phase II. Three lots in Phase II are ready for construction.\u201d Defendant also wrote that the potential lender \u201cwould not have to provide the house construction loans, unless of course it would like to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">Against this background, Harrison, for the plaintiff, and defendant entered into the contract in dispute, which the plaintiff calls on brief a \u201cfinders fee agreement.\u201d The agreement is comprised of two writings, both executed by the respective parties: first, a letter drafted and signed by Harrison addressed to defendant dated March 30, 1992 from which defendant deleted one sentence that is not relevant to this controversy; and second, a paper labelled \u201cFirst Amendment to Agreement,\u201d drafted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The first writing follows, showing the deletion and complete with spelling and punctuation errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cThis letter sets forth the terms pursuant to which Lenders Financial Corporation (placement agent) is being retained by David Tait\u00f3n and The Tait\u00f3n Company (borrower) to assist in the placement of an acquisition; development and construction loan (ADC) in the approximate amount of two million five hundred thousand dollars ($2,500,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cLFC will introduce David Tait\u00f3n to specific lenders that have an interest in lending such monies as needed to finance such project known as Williamsburg Commons, Vienna, Virginia. If the transaction is closed with the borrower and lender then a fee of (3%) of gross sales is due Lenders Financial Corporation. Such fee will be no less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), paid as follows; one hundred thousand ($100,000) from the proceeds of the first 4 settlements and ten thousand dollars ($10,000) on each settlements thereafter until the project is sold out. Any balance owed to LFC will be paid from the last sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\u201cIn the event of any dispute relating to this agreement, the prevailing-party shall be entitled to attorney fees. Agent will be protected for a period of twenty-four (24) months with such lenders as maybe introduced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201cWe are looking forward to working with you on this transaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The second writing provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cAn agreement between David Tait\u00f3n and Lenders Financial was set forth on March 30, 1992. This first amendment to that agreement shall be incorporated into that agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">1. In no event shall the total fees due Lenders Financial Corporation exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">2. It is expressly agreed that no fee shall be earned by Lenders Financial Corporation unless and until closing has been held and proceeds have been funded and received by Tait\u00f3n.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">3. Lenders Financial Corporation shall register each lender with David Tait\u00f3n.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Following execution of the agreement, plaintiff introduced defendant to Virginia First Savings Bank, actively assisted defendant during his negotiations with Virginia First, and contacted Dominion Bank regarding its discount. In June, Virginia First agreed to advance defendant $2.8 million, and the loan was closed. As a result of the Virginia First loan and additional construction financing by that bank, work on the project resumed. Subsequently, a number of houses were sold, and defendant refused to pay plaintiffs fee for services. This action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">In a motion for judgment filed in December 1992, plaintiff sued on the agreement, asserting that it \u201csuccessfully provided the services that Tait\u00f3n requested in the contract.\u201d Plaintiff alleged that the refusal to pay the agreed fee constituted a breach of the contract because \u201cat least four houses at the Williamsburg Commons project referred to in the contract have gone or will go to settlement prior to the end of 1992\u201d and that \u201cmore houses are ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>pected to go to settlement within the next several months.\u201d Plaintiff asked for \u201cat least $100,000 under the terms of the contract\u201d and asserted that it had \u201csuffered damages of up to $500,000 due to Talton\u2019s breach of contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Responding, defendant generally denied that plaintiff was entitled to recover under the agreement, that he had breached the agreement, and that plaintiff had suffered any damages. Additionally, without elaboration defendant asserted defenses of fraud, duress, undue influence, \u201cNo meeting of the minds,\u201d breach of contract, and lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In a January 1994 bench trial, the defendant moved to strike the plaintiff\u2019s evidence at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief. The defendant\u2019s motion had three bases: first, plaintiff had failed to perform the contract in that the Virginia First loan only provided \u201cacquisition\u201d funds, not \u201cdevelopment\u201d and \u201cconstruction\u201d funds, contrary to the agreement which specified \u201cplacement of an acquisition; development and construction loan;\u201d second, plaintiff had failed to perform because the contract provided that plaintiff would introduce defendant to lenders having an interest in lending monies \u201cas needed to finance such project,\u201d and the project was the development and construction of Williamsburg Commons, not the refinancing of the Dominion loan; and, third, plaintiff had failed to prove damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion on the first two grounds, ruling the plaintiff had established, prima facie, that it had performed the contract and that the defendant had breached the contract by nonpayment. The court sustained defendant\u2019s motion on the third ground, however, ruling that the plaintiff had failed to prove damages with reasonable certainty. The court, based upon its interpretation of the contract, opined that plaintiff failed to show the sale prices of the approximate six houses and two lots that, according to the evidence, had sold by the time of trial. The court stated: \u201cEven if all eight of those properties sold at $700,000, the three percent gross sales still wouldn\u2019t come to the minimum $250,000 that is being sought to be imposed here.\u201d Accordingly, the court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We awarded the plaintiff an appeal based upon its assignments of error asserting the trial court incorrectly ruled it had failed to prove damages. We also awarded the appeal upon defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>assignments of cross-error asserting the trial court incorrectly ruled plaintiff had performed the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Initially, we shall address the performance issue raised by defendant\u2019s assignments of cross-error. On appeal, defendant first argues that, considering the terms of the contract, plaintiff was required to prove \u201cthat it had assisted in the placement of an Acquisition, Development &amp; Construction loan,\u201d but that the \u201ctestimony and exhibits showed that the loan which closed was an acquisition loan only.\u201d Second, defendant contends that even if such loan had been placed, plaintiff \u201cwould not have earned its fee until closing had been held and proceeds for acquisition, development, and construction had in fact been received by Tait\u00f3n. Again, the only funds received by Tait\u00f3n were funds for acquisition, not funds for construction or development.\u201d On appeal, defendant has split into two contentions the first ground of his motion to strike made at the trial level. He has wisely abandoned the second ground of that motion to the effect that the contract did not contemplate mere refinancing but provided for financing the balance of the development and construction of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We do not agree with defendant\u2019s contentions. In accord with settled principles of appellate review in a case like this when a trial court has sustained a defendant\u2019s motion to strike at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief, we are viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">There is no dispute in plaintiff\u2019s evidence that it introduced defendant to Virginia First Bank, plaintiff participated and assisted defendant in his negotiations with the bank, and the bank advanced defendant in excess of $2.5 million. Proof of these facts ordinarily would establish, prima facie, that plaintiff fully performed its obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Defendant contends, however, that the <em>type </em>of loan he received was not the type of loan he asked plaintiff to procure for him. There is no merit to this contention. Even though the first paragraph of the agreement refers to assistance in the placement \u201cof an acquisition; development and construction loan (ADC),\u201d nowhere in the agreement are those terms defined. Moreover, definitions of those terms were never the subject of any discussion between the parties prior to execution of the contract, although Harrison testified to his perception of the words, and the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>fails to reveal that there is any standard industry definition of the terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The evidence to this point in the case is clear, however, that when defendant approached plaintiff in March 1992 for assistance, defendant\u2019s project was about to collapse. He was in default on his $4 million loan from Dominion Bank, work had stopped, and foreclosure was imminent. The sums advanced by Dominion had been used for acquisition and development of the land as well as construction of the houses. Defendant had been unsuccessful in obtaining, through his individual efforts, satisfactory financing to \u201ctake out\u201d Dominion Bank. Almost contemporaneous with the drafting of the agreement, defendant wrote plaintiff on March 26th stating a need for only a $2.5 million advance plus a $200,000 letter of credit to Fairfax County. In a separate memo sent by defendant to plaintiff on March 26th, defendant made plain that he did not expect any prospective lender to advance more than the sum necessary to purchase the \u201cold loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In sum, the interpretation most consistent with the circumstances of the parties at the time of contracting indicates that the mention of an \u201cADC loan\u201d in the first paragraph of the contract merely referred to obtaining refinancing of Dominion\u2019s loan, without any binding condition about the manner in which the loan proceeds actually would be used. This is precisely the benefit defendant received from plaintiffs efforts when the proceeds were paid by Virginia First Bank. Consequently, we hold that the trial court did not err in overruling the motion to strike and in deciding that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case of contract performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">And, because defendant\u2019s repudiation of this executory contract constitutes an anticipatory breach, plaintiff may sue on the contract without waiting for the time of defendant\u2019s performance to arrive. <em>Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County </em>v. <em>Ecology One, Inc., </em>219 Va. 29, 33, 245 S.E.2d 425, 427-28 (1978); <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>189 Va. 392, 397-98, 53 S.E.2d 21, 23-24 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">We turn to the issue in the main appeal raised by the plaintiffs contention that the trial court erred in ruling that it failed to prove its damages with reasonable certainty. Plaintiff contends that the contract mandates a minimum fee of $250,000 regardless of the total amount of gross sales at Williamsburg Commons.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Parenthetically, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that plaintiff is \u201cbarred from raising this argument due to its failure to allege in its pleadings that there was a minimum fee provision.\u201d The motion for judgment alleged plaintiff \u201cis due at least $100,000 under the terms of the contract\u201d and has \u201csuffered damages of up to $500,000.\u201d Moreover, during argument of the motion to strike, plaintiffs counsel said, \u201cBut our damages are based on what the agreement says, and for one thing, the agreement puts a floor of 250,000, and a ceiling of 500,000, regardless of what happens.\u201d While the language of the motion for judgment is imprecise on the issue, it clearly is sufficient to support plaintiffs minimum-fee contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Plaintiff argues that if the fee provisions of the agreement are read harmoniously and given their plain meaning, \u201cthe \u20183% of gross sales\u2019 provision only applies to the amount of the fee earned or payable after payment of the minimum fee of $250,000.\u201d According to plaintiff, it \u201cthus proved damages of at least $250,000 with reasonable certainty because: (1) it successfully performed the contract; (2) the contract was in evidence; (3) Tait\u00f3n admitted he had sold eight houses subsequent to the closing of the Virginia First loan; and (4) it was undisputed and a matter of record that Tait\u00f3n had breached the contract by renouncing and repudiating it.\u201d We agree with the plaintiff and its analysis of the contract documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">There is no ambiguity in the fee provisions of this contract. Thus, we are not bound on review by the trial court\u2019s construction of such provisions. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 187, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984). The intention of the parties as expressed by them in the words they have used governs contract construction; courts must conclude that the parties intended what the written instrument plainly declares. <em>Magann Corp. </em>v. <em>Virginia-Carolina Elec. Works, Inc., </em>203 Va. 259, 264, 123 S.E.2d 377, 381 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The fee provisions, as the plaintiff argues, include five categories. First, the total amount of the fee is stated: \u201cIf the transaction is closed with the borrower and lender then a fee of (3 %) of gross sales is due Lenders Financial Corporation.\u201d This general statement is modified by more specific remaining provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Second, an absolute minimum fee is established: \u201cSuch fee will be no less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).\u201d Third, the agreement provides that the minimum fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>is to be \u201cpaid as follows\u201d in installments, \u201cone hundred thousand ($100,000) from the proceeds of the first 4 settlements and ten thousand dollars ($10,000) on each settlements thereafter until the project is sold out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Fourth, the contract has a provision for payment of fees earned but not otherwise paid during the course of the project: \u201cAny balance owed to LFC will be paid from the last sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Fifth, the parties in the amendment agreed to fix a maximum fee amount: \u201cIn no event shall the total fees due Lenders Financial Corporation exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Therefore, and contrary to the trial court\u2019s interpretation, the plaintiff did not have to present evidence of the exact sales price of each of the houses sold by defendant to be entitled to the minimum fee of $250,000 and to survive a motion to strike. Plaintiff was entitled to the minimum fee when evidence was presented that defendant had sold only one house after the Virginia First transaction was closed. The \u201c3% of gross sales\u201d provision, and hence the sales prices of the houses, becomes relevant only when there must be a determination of the maximum fee that can be earned. In other words, the $250,000 minimum fee is absolute; the manner of payment of that sum relates to the sales of the first 19 houses ($100,000 from the proceeds of the first four settlements and $10,000 from each of the next 15 settlements); and the \u201c3% of gross sales\u201d provision governs the fees that are earned above the $250,000 minimum fee until the \u201ccap\u201d of $500,000 is reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court misconstrued the contract and erred in ruling that the plaintiff had failed to establish any damages; the plaintiff proved damages of at least $250,000. Thus, the judgment appealed from will be reversed, and the case will be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
