(the Bank) filed a motion for judgment against Joseph J. Mahoney, Jr., and Helen M. Mahoney (the Mahoneys), guarantors of a deed of trust note made by Oakton Mews Limited Partnership (Oakton Mews or the Partnership). The Bank, the holder of the note, sought recovery of the outstanding balance due on the note, plus accrued interest, late charges, and attorney\u2019s fees. Subsequently, the Mahoneys and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Partnership paid the outstanding indebtedness in full, plus attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of 25 % of the balance due.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Prior to paying the note in full, however, the Mahoneys filed a counterclaim against the Bank, seeking recovery of damages in the amount of $500,000. The Mahoneys alleged that the Bank breached its obligation of good faith, as prescribed in Code \u00a7 8.1-203.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They claimed that the Bank acted in bad faith when it refused to approve proposed sales of certain property and to release the property from the deed of trust so that the proceeds of the sales could be applied to the payment of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">After extensive discovery, the Bank filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the Mahoneys\u2019 counterclaim. The Bank also requested that the court require the Mahoneys to pay its attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The trial court granted the Bank\u2019s summary judgment motion. In its memorandum opinion, the court concluded that all the alleged actions in bad faith were allowed by express provisions of the contract, and, therefore, the UCC\u2019s obligation of good faith could not be invoked to alter those contract provisions. The trial court, however, denied the Bank\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">On December 29, 1993, the trial court entered its final judgment effecting its rulings. Both parties appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">No material fact is genuinely in dispute with respect to the summary judgment ruling. The Mahoneys were limited partners in Oakton Mews, a partnership formed to purchase three large building lots in Fairfax County. Purchase of the lots was financed by a $450,000 loan from Sovran Bank, N.A. (now NationsBank) and secured by a deed of trust on the lots. Oakton Mews, acting by and through its general partner, Riverview Associates, Inc., was the maker of the deed of trust note, and the Mahoneys personally endorsed and guaranteed payment of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">The Mahoneys also executed a separate guaranty agreement whereby they unconditionally guaranteed full and prompt payment of the note. The guaranty agreement provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Mahoneys agreed that the Bank \u201cmay . . . substitute, release, relinquish, subordinate, exchange, renew, extend, modify, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>or compromise, in whole or in part, any security or securities\u201d held as collateral for the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In addition, the Mahoneys signed and accepted three commitment letters, issued by the Bank, each of which contained provisions for the release of collateral. Although the amount required for the release of collateral varied with each commitment letter, the amount required for the release of an individual lot from the deed of trust was never less than $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">After Oakton Mews purchased the land and developed the lots, the real estate market declined. As a result, the sale of the lots became more difficult, and Oakton Mews experienced difficulty in keeping the interest payments current.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Thereafter, Oakton Mews presented the Bank with two contracts for the sale of Lot 2 and one contract for the sale of an easement over Lot 3. The Bank, however, refused to release the collateral because the minimum requirement of $150,000 prescribed by the commitment letters was not met by any of the sales contracts. Consequently, none of the transactions occurred. Later, the Bank did agree to release its lien on Lot 1, the sale of which yielded about $162,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Oakton Mews failed to keep current its payments on the note, and the Bank, in accordance with the note\u2019s terms, demanded payment of the outstanding balance. When such payment was not made, the Bank instituted the action against the Mahoneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The Mahoneys concede that the Bank had the legal contractual right to act as it did. They contend, nonetheless, that Code \u00a7 8.1-203 imposed an obligation of good faith upon the Bank that required it to exercise its discretion regarding the release of its collateral reasonably and with proper motives, not arbitrarily or in a manner inconsistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations. The Mahoneys assert that the sales contracts the Partnership presented to the Bank were \u201ccommercially reasonable and should have been accepted.\u201d According to the Mahoneys, the Bank\u2019s refusal to release the collateral was arbitrary and constituted a breach of the UCC\u2019s obligation of good faith. The Bank contends, on the other hand, that its actions were authorized by contract provisions expressly agreed to by the Mahoneys and that the obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>gation of good faith prescribed in Code \u00a7 8.1-203 cannot negate or modify the contract terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">We have not previously considered this issue. However, courts in other jurisdictions have dealt with the matter. In <em>Nantahala Village, Incorporated </em>v. <em>NCNB National Bank of </em>Florida, 976 F.2d 876, 881 (4th Cir. 1992), a guarantor claimed that a bank acted in bad faith because it held the guarantor\u2019s stock as excess collateral. The guaranty agreement at issue gave the bank \u201ca lien upon, security title to and a security interest in all property of [the guarantor] now or at any time hereafter in the possession of [the] Bank in any capacity whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 878. In rejecting the guarantor\u2019s bad faith contention, the district court, applying Florida law, concluded that all acts of the bank complained about \u201cflowed from valid and binding loan documents executed by both parties,\u201d and, therefore, the bank did not breach the statutory duty of good faith when it \u201cmerely exercise [d] its contractual rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 882. The court of appeals agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 881-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Similar conclusions have been reached by other federal courts of appeals. In <em>Grand Light &amp; Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Honeywell, Inc., 711 </em>F.2d 672, 674 (2nd Cir. 1985), the court considered a claim of bad faith with regard to the termination of a distributorship arrangement between a manufacturer and one of its authorized distributors. The manufacturer had issued a \u201cDistributor Policy\u201d stating that \u201c \u2018[germination may be made by either party with 30 days written notice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675. The court, applying Connecticut law, held that the termination was proper because the UCC\u2019s obligation of good faith \u201cmay not be used to override explicit contractual terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679. In <em>Triangle Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Stauffer Chemical Company, </em>753 F.2d 734, 739 (9th Cir. 1985), the court of appeals considered a mining contract that provided for its termination at will by either party upon 90 days\u2019 notice. The court, applying Idaho law, ruled that the contract\u2019s termination clause could not be negated by any implied obligation of good faith. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The foregoing decisions from other jurisdictions, with which we agree, appear to be the majority view. Consequently, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling and hold that, when parties to a contract create valid and binding rights, one party does not breach the UCC\u2019s obligation of good faith by exercising such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Next, we consider the issue regarding attorney\u2019s fees. At the outset, it is important to note that the Mahoneys have paid attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of 25% of the unpaid balance on the note. The Bank contends, nonetheless, that the trial court erred in refusing to require the Mahoneys to pay additional attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">To decide the question, we must examine the pertinent contract provisions. The note provides, in relevant part, that its obligors agreed to pay</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">all costs and expenses incurred by the Bank in connection with the enforcement of [the] Note . . .or the collection of the indebtedness evidenced [by the Note] ... or the defense of any claim arising out of, or in any way related to, [the] Note or any deed of trust or security agreement or other instrument securing [the] Note or related to the making of the loan evidenced [by the Note], including, without limitation, attorney\u2019s fees of twenty-five percent (25%) of the unpaid balance hereof if [the] Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The Mahoneys, as \u201cEndorsers and Payment Guarantors\u201d of the note, unconditionally endorsed and guaranteed payment of the note \u201cincluding, without limitation [,] . . . all. . . costs and attorneys fees, all in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of the Note.\u201d In the separate guaranty agreement, the Mahoneys agreed to pay \u201call expenses incurred in collecting such indebtedness . . . and in enforcing this Guaranty, including twenty-five per cent (25%) attorney\u2019s fees, if . . . such indebted<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ness ... or this Guaranty, or both, be placed in the hands of an attorney for collection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Although the Bank consistently has made clear that it sued only on the separate guaranty agreement, it relies upon the note\u2019s language that the obligors agreed to pay \u201call costs and expenses incurred by the Bank in connection with ... the defense of any claim arising out of, or in any way related to, [the] Note.\u201d The Bank asserts that its attorney\u2019s fees were \u201cexpenses incurred\u201d in connection with the defense of a claim arising out of, or related to, the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The Mahoneys, however, contend that, by the terms of the separate guaranty agreement and of the note, attorney\u2019s fees are limited to 25% of the unpaid balance of the indebtedness and that they have paid such a fee. Therefore, they assert, nothing further is owing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The Bank drafted the separate guaranty agreement and the note, and, clearly, under their terms, the Bank was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the collection of the indebtedness. Both the separate guaranty agreement and the note also clearly provide for the Bank\u2019s recovery of expenses incurred in the collection of the indebtedness. The Bank, therefore, distinguished between expenses and attorney\u2019s fees with respect to the debt\u2019s collection. Arguably, then, \u201ccosts and expenses\u201d incurred in the defense of claims does not include attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">At most, an ambiguity exists regarding whether the Bank was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the defense of the Mahoneys\u2019 counterclaim. The Bank could have expressly provided for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the defense of claims just as it did for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the collection of the indebtedness. The Bank, however, did not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">When an ambiguity exists, a court will construe a contract more strictly against the party who prepared it. <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Aleda Const. Co., </em>227 Va. 304, 307, 315 S.E.2d 193, 195 (1984). Applying this principle in the present case, we conclude that the Bank is not entitled to recover additional attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">In sum, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank on the Mahoneys\u2019 counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>claim. We further hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to award the Bank additional attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Record No. 940478 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHG\">Record No. 940484 \u2014 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-12\"> Code \u00a7 8.1-203 provides that \u201c[e]very contract or duty within [the UCC] imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> The Bank also contends that it pursued its rights \u201cat all times\u201d only under the separate guaranty agreement and that such agreements are not governed by the UCC.
