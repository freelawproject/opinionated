The opinion of the court expressed the views of four judges; three judges concurred in the result; and one judge dissented, joined in part by another judge. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 277, 443 S.E.2d 419 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">We awarded the defendant an appeal from the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment to consider questions dealing with \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence and with expert testimony on the ultimate fact in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">The facts adduced at trial were undisputed. On August 15, 1991, narcotics investigator Margaret A. DeBoard and other Fairfax County police officers went to an apartment rented to defendant\u2019s cousin located on Patrick Henry Drive in Fairfax County to execute a search warrant. Defendant, who was alone in the apartment, opened the door and was served with the warrant. A search of the premises revealed several packages containing 160 grams of cocaine in a closet and dresser in the same bedroom. The police also found drug paraphernalia, $160 in cash, and a black nylon bag. Inside the bag, the officers discovered a set of scales and a pay stub with defendant\u2019s name on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">DeBoard arrested defendant and interviewed him later after advising him of his constitutional rights according to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). During the interview, defendant confessed that he had been selling cocaine for his cousin for about three months; that he travelled to New York City about once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>every week to obtain drugs to be sold; that he had purchased 4.5 ounces of the drug for $2,600 in New York the day before his arrest; that he was residing at two locations in Fairfax County, on Beacon Tree Lane with a sister and at the Patrick Henry Drive apartment with the cousin; that he owned the black nylon bag and the scales; and that, using the scales, he assisted the cousin in weighing cocaine to be distributed in the County. The events of August 15 gave rise to the indictment and the conviction under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">At trial, the prosecutor, over defendant\u2019s objection, presented evidence showing that DeBoard first met defendant \u201cseveral weeks\u201d prior to August 15 when she arranged through an informant to buy cocaine from defendant. As DeBoard sat in a car in a parking lot in the County, defendant drove a vehicle into the lot with the informant as a passenger and parked close to DeBoard\u2019s car. The informant gave her an eighth of an ounce of cocaine in exchange for $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">About a week later, according to the evidence, defendant, accompanied by the informant, drove a different vehicle to another meeting with DeBoard. DeBoard and defendant conversed from their vehicles while the informant entered the investigator\u2019s car. A second sale of cocaine took place in the same manner as the first transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">During defendant\u2019s post-arrest confession, he discussed with DeBoard the two \u201ccontrolled buys.\u201d Defendant told the investigator that he accompanied the informant to the cousin\u2019s apartment on the first occasion, that defendant obtained the cocaine from the apartment, and that he drove the informant to deliver the cocaine to DeBoard. \u201cOn the second deal,\u201d according to the investigator, defendant informed her that the cousin \u201chad actually given the informant the cocaine,\u201d apparently at the apartment, and defendant \u201csimply drove him out to meet me on that occasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">At trial, the court gave the jury the following limiting instruction related to the controlled buys: \u201cYou may consider evidence that the defendant committed offenses other than the offense for which he is on trial only as evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent and for no other purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Addressing the first issue in this appeal, the defendant contends that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision allowing the testimony about two prior sales of cocaine to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>admitted into evidence on the issue of his intent to distribute the drug. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Generally, evidence that the accused committed other crimes is inadmissible to prove guilt of the crime for which the accused is on trial, even though the other crimes are of the same nature as the one charged in the indictment. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970). But the exceptions to the general rule are as well established as the rule itself. <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 216, 222, 315 S.E.2d 224, 228, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 862 (1984). Apropos the present case, recognized exceptions to the general rule permit introduction of evidence of other offenses when \u201cthe evidence is connected with or leads up to the offense for which the accused is on trial\u201d or when \u201cthe other crimes constitute a part of the general scheme of which the crime charged is a part.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 272, 176 S.E.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Here, according to defendant\u2019s confession, he had been selling cocaine for his cousin for about three months prior to being arrested. The hub of this activity was the Patrick Henry Drive apartment, where the dope was weighed and repackaged for local distribution. The drugs warehoused there had been obtained by defendant during his regular trips to New York City. Indeed, the day before the arrest the defendant apparently had stocked the apartment with a fresh supply of New York narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Given the foregoing undisputed facts, proof relating to the controlled buys occurring within several weeks of defendant\u2019s arrest for the present offense clearly is evidence \u201cconnected with\u201d the offense for which the accused is on trial and constitutes \u201cpart of the general scheme of which the crime charged is a part,\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Kirkpatrick </em>exceptions. The controlled buys stemmed from the enterprise centered in the apartment, the same location that spawned defendant\u2019s arrest and conviction. In short, the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence was admissible to establish defendant\u2019s intent because it was \u201cso intimately connected and blended with the main facts adduced in evidence\u201d that it should not be excluded from consideration. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>28 Va. (1 Leigh) 574, 576 (1829), <em>quoted in Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 273, 176 S.E.2d at 806. And, the legitimate probative value of the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence outweighs the incidental prejudice to the defendant. <em>See Woodfin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 95, 372 S.E.2d 377, 380-81 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1009 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The cases of <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 300 S.E.2d 768 (1983); <em>Eccles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 20, 197 S.E.2d 332 (1973); and <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 52, 189 S.E.2d 359 (1972), relied on by defendant, do not require a different result. In those cases holding inadmissible \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, the prior sales of drugs by the defendants in <em>Donahue </em>and <em>Boyd, </em>and the prior use of drugs in <em>Eccles, </em>were wholly unrelated to the offenses for which the respective defendants were on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Even though the Attorney General maintains the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment should be affirmed on this issue, he argues that the court\u2019s plurality opinion \u201cwent too far in requiring that such otherwise \u2018highly relevant\u2019 evidence must be shown to be part of the \u2018same stash\u2019 as the drugs in question in order to be admissible.\u201d The Attorney General refers to the following statement in the plurality opinion made in the course of ruling the evidence admissible: \u201cThe fact that the defendant previously had sold cocaine on two recent occasions would not be admissible without further evidence linking the sales to the cocaine which he possessed on this occasion.\u201d 18 Va. App. at 282, 443 S.E.2d at 423, <em>citing Wilson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 213, 429 S.E.2d 229, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>17 Va. App. 248, 436 S.E.2d 193 (1993). The Attorney General urges us to make clear that the nexus does not have to be so finite as the Court of Appeals specified, that is, the drugs involved in the prior sales do not have to be from the same cache of drugs that are the subject of the offense for which the defendant is being tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">If the Court of Appeals established a so-called \u201csame stash\u201d rule in this context, we reject it. We have been referred to no case decided by this Court that adopts such a rule, and we have found none. And nothing we have said in this opinion should be construed as embracing such an idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Addressing the second issue in this appeal, the defendant contends that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that defendant failed to contemporaneously object to inadmissible testimony of an expert witness relating to an ultimate issue of fact. The question arises in the following manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Before a police narcotics investigator testified as an expert witness, defense counsel moved to exclude the testimony as invading the province of the jury on an ultimate issue of fact, defendant\u2019s intent to distribute, citing <em>Llamera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 262, 414 S.E.2d 597 (1992). In response to the objection, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>prosecutor made a proffer of the substance of the expert\u2019s testimony, and the trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The Court of Appeals held the expert\u2019s testimony that possession of 160 grams of cocaine \u201cwould be for distribution use\u201d departed \u201cfrom that avowed to the trial court and upon which the trial court ruled.\u201d Rodriguez, 18 Va. App. at 286, 443 S.E.2d at 424-25. Thus, the Court of Appeals decided, defendant\u2019s failure to object to the testimony when offered violated its contemporaneous objection rule and it was \u201cbarred by Rule 5A:18 from reviewing the question of the admissibility of the expert\u2019s final testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Because of the view we take of the issue, it is unnecessary for us to rule on the question whether the Court of Appeals properly invoked its procedural bar. We will assume that the expert\u2019s response violated the rule articulated in <em>Llamera </em>and that defendant\u2019s objection was sufficient to save the point for appeal. Nonetheless, we conclude that if the trial court erred in admitting the testimony, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Defendant admitted participating in the drug distribution, obtaining 4.5 ounces of cocaine in New York City the day before his arrest, owning the scales found with the cocaine, procuring drugs from the apartment to sell to investigator DeBoard, and using the scales to weigh the dope for distribution. Also, DeBoard testified about defendant\u2019s part in the two prior sales to her. In sum, the accused has had a fair trial according to law, and the proof is conclusive of his guilt; any error in admitting the expert\u2019s testimony was utterly harmless. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-678; <em>Lavinder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (citing <em>Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 433, 442 n.4, 389 S.E.2d 886, 892 n.4, <em>cert. granted in part, </em>498 U.S. 894, 111 S.Ct. 242 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>500 U.S. 415, 111 S.Ct. 1899 (1991) (discussing non-constitutional harmless error)).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
