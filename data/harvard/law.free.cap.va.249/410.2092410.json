The sole issue is whether the Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the child\u2019s best interests would be served by awarding custody to the mother. We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">No novel questions of law are involved; the legal principles applicable under these circumstances to child custody cases are settled in the Commonwealth. We took jurisdiction of this appeal because we decided that the application of the law to the facts of this case involves a matter of significant precedential value. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">In March 1993, appellant Pamela Kay Bottoms filed a petition against her daughter, appellee Sharon Lynne Bottoms, in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of Henrico County seeking an award of custody of the daughter\u2019s son, born in July 1991. In the petition, the grandmother alleged that the \u201cinfant is currently living in an environment which is harmful to his mental and physical well being.\u201d Following a hearing, at which both parties were represented by counsel, the juvenile court awarded custody to the grandmother and granted the mother restricted visitation rights. The mother appealed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">In May 1993, because the mother stated she was not represented by an attorney at that time, the circuit court appointed a guardian ad litem \u201cfor the infant child to represent him in these proceedings.\u201d Following psychological evaluations of the parties and the child, and after studies of the homes of the parties, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>trial court conducted a hearing <em>de novo </em>in September 1993 at which eight witnesses testified. Participating in the hearing were the grandmother\u2019s attorney, the guardian ad litem, and the mother\u2019s present counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court ruled that custody of the child should be awarded to the grandmother, with restricted visitation rights granted the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The mother appealed to the Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel unanimously reversed and vacated the trial court\u2019s order, remanding the case to the circuit court for entry of an order \u201ceffectuating the resumption of custody by the mother of her son.\u201d <em>Bottoms </em>v. <em>Bottoms, </em>18 Va. App. 481, 495, 444 S.E.2d 276, 284 (1994). We awarded the grandmother this appeal from the Court of Appeals\u2019 June 1994 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u201cIn all child custody cases, including those between a parent and a non-parent, \u2018the best interests of the child are paramount and form the lodestar for the guidance of the court in determining the dispute.\u2019\u201d <em>Bailes </em>v. <em>Sours, </em>231 Va. 96, 99, 340 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986) (quoting <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>203 Va. 417, 421, 124 S.E.2d 195, 198 (1962)). In a custody dispute between a parent and non-parent, \u201cthe law presumes that the child\u2019s best interests will be served when in the custody of its parent.\u201d <em>Judd </em>v. <em>Van Horn, </em>195 Va. 988, 996, 81 S.E.2d 432, 436 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Although the presumption favoring a parent over a non-parent is strong, it is rebutted when certain factors, such as parental unfitness, are established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Bailes, </em>231 Va. at 100, 340 S.E.2d at 827. The term \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d is defined as the measure or degree of proof that will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction upon the allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance, but not to the degree of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases; it does not mean clear and <em>unequivocal. Fred C. Walker Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lucas, 215 </em>Va. 535, 540-41, 211 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1975). The burden to show unfitness is upon the one seeking to alter the parent\u2019s right to custody. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>203 Va. at 421, 124 S.E.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In custody cases, the welfare of the child takes precedence over the rights of the parent. <em>Malpass </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 399, 192 S.E.2d 794, 799 (1972). But, when the contest is between parent and non-parent, this rule is conditioned upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>principle that a parent\u2019s rights \u201care to be respected if at all consonant with the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 192 S.E.2d at 799. Some of the foregoing principles have been codified recently by the General Assembly in Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-124.1 to -124.6. Acts 1994, ch. 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">When the trial court hears the evidence <em>ore tenus, </em>its findings are entitled to the weight accorded a jury verdict, and these findings should not be disturbed by an appellate court unless they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. <em>Bailes, </em>231 Va. at 100, 340 S.E.2d at 827. A reviewing court should never redetermine the facts on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Absent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to an appellate court with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts. <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977). And, the appellate court should view the facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing before the trial court. Accordingly, we shall summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the grandmother, resolving all conflicts in the evidence in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">This child\u2019s mother, born in February 1970, \u201cdropped out\u201d of school in the twelfth grade. Until she was 18 years of age, she resided at home with her mother, who is a divorcee, and her mother\u2019s boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Upon leaving home, the child\u2019s mother was supported by and lived with a cousin, a friend, and a sister respectively. In December 1989, the child\u2019s mother married Dennis Doustou, whom she had been dating for several years. She left Doustou after eight months of marriage, and resumed living with the cousin for a while. The child was born during the separation in July 1991. The parties were divorced, and the mother was awarded custody of her child. The child\u2019s father has expressed little interest in his son and pays no child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The maternal grandmother, born in January 1951, resides in the Richmond area. Her boyfriend ceased living with her shortly before the juvenile court hearing, and has not returned. The grandmother did not complete her high school education, and has worked as a nurse\u2019s aide and manager of a shoe store. She currently is employed as a \u201cnanny,\u201d taking care of two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">During the two-year period before the trial court hearing, the child had spent 70 percent of the time with the grandmother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>30 percent with his mother. The grandmother has kept the child for \u201cweeks at a time\u201d and during \u201cevery weekend since he\u2019s been born.\u201d On at least three occasions during that period, the mother left the child with the grandmother without informing her of the mother\u2019s whereabouts or how she could be reached \u201cin the event something happened to the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Following the mother\u2019s separation from Doustou, she continued a \u201crelationship\u201d with another man that had begun during her marriage. She contracted a venereal disease during this relationship that prevents her from having additional children. During the child\u2019s first year, the mother \u201cslept with two or three different guys, maybe four, in the same room\u201d with the child \u201cwhere his crib was.\u201d At the time, the mother \u201clived two blocks away\u201d from the grandmother, and the mother kept the child\u2019s \u201csuitcase packed\u201d for visits to the grandmother\u2019s home. The mother said that she has \u201chad trouble\u201d with her temper, and that when the child was about \u201ca year\u201d old, she \u201cpopped him on his leg too hard a couple of times,\u201d and left her fingerprints there. She has had \u201ccounseling\u201d in an effort to control her temper.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">At \u201csome point subsequent to\u201d the child\u2019s birth, the mother lived in a dwelling with yet another man who supported her for more than a year. After the mother \u201cleft\u201d this man, she \u201clived with\u201d a lesbian \u201ccouple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Except for brief employment as a grocery store cashier, the mother had been unemployed during most of the three-year period prior to the trial court hearing. She was receiving \u201cwelfare money\u201d which often was spent to \u201cdo her fingernails before the baby would get any food.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">During May 1992, ten months before the juvenile court hearing, 16 months before the trial court hearing, and when her son was ten months old, the mother met April Wade, a lesbian. Wade, born in April 1966, had been discharged from the U.S. Army in 1986. Wade is a \u201crecovering alcoholic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The mother and Wade \u201cmoved in together\u201d in September 1992. From that time, with the exception of a two-week period, the mother and Wade have lived in \u201ca lesbian relationship.\u201d According to the mother, the relationship involves hugging and kissing, patting \u201con the bottom,\u201d sleeping in the same bed, \u201cfondling,\u201d and \u201coral sex.\u201d The mother testified that she loves Wade and that they \u201chave a lifetime commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>At the time of the juvenile court hearing, the mother, the child, and Wade were living in a two-bedroom apartment with \u201cEvelyn,\u201d another lesbian. \u201cAt one time,\u201d the child\u2019s bed was in the room where the mother and Wade slept, having \u201csex in the same bed.\u201d At one point in her testimony, however, when asked \u201chow many times did you do it when the child was sleeping in the same bedroom,\u201d the mother responded, \u201cNone.\u201d She said that she and Wade displayed other signs of affection \u201cin front of\u2019 the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Wade, employed as a gift shop manager, supports the mother. The pair lives in an apartment complex in Western Henrico County. Wade has become \u201ca parent figure\u201d to the child, who calls Wade \u201cDa Da.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Two months before the petition for custody was filed, the mother revealed her lesbian relationship to the grandmother. This disclosure alienated the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">During the period after the juvenile court hearing, when regimented visitation with the mother began, the child demonstrated certain traits. For example, when the child returned to the grandmother from being with the mother, he would \u201cstomp\u201d his foot, tell himself to \u201cgo to the corner,\u201d and then would stand in the corner of a room, facing the wall. He curses, saying \u201cshit\u201d and \u201cdamn,\u201d language never used in the grandmother\u2019s home. On one occasion, when the mother and Wade \u201ccame to pick him up,\u201d the child \u201cheld his breath, turned purple. He didn\u2019t want to go with her,\u201d according to the grandmother. During a period in mid-1993, each time the mother \u201cwould come pick him up,\u201d the child would scream and cry.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Wade has admitted she \u201chit\u201d the child. Also, on one occasion, when an argument developed between the mother and Wade, on the one hand, and the grandmother, on the other, about the timing of the exchange of the child for visitation, Wade said during the quarrel, \u201cI might end up killing somebody.\u201d According to the grandmother, the child is \u201calways neglected.\u201d For example, when the child returns to the grandmother\u2019s home, she testified that he \u201ccan\u2019t even sit down in the bathtub. That\u2019s neglect from changing his diaper. He is so red.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the guardian ad litem made a closing statement to the trial judge. Saying that he \u201ctook this appointment very seriously,\u201d the guardian ad litem stated he had \u201cdone extensive reading in many areas,\u201d including \u201cthe effect ho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>mosexuality will have on the rearing of children.\u201d He stated that he had \u201ctalked with psychiatrists in the field,\u201d and met \u201cat length\u201d with the mother, the grandmother, Wade, and the child, and \u201cinterviewed all of these parties as best I could.\u201d He asked another attorney, a woman, to assist him in order to obtain \u201canother perspective.\u201d The guardian ad litem said that he and his associate \u201cliterally\u201d spent the entire month before the hearing on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In evaluating the case, the guardian ad litem said he is \u201ca pretty open-minded guy\u201d without any biases, \u201cespecially involving a homosexual issue.\u201d He stated that the child\u2019s father \u201cshould be ashamed of himself\u2019 for having no interest in the child and for contributing \u201cnothing towards financial support of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">He stated that Wade is \u201ca very nice person,\u201d but \u201cshe has a lot of baggage that she brings along with her\u201d causing him to question her \u201cstability.\u201d He observed that Wade genuinely \u201cloves the child,\u201d but in view of her \u201crather sketchy\u201d employment history, he was \u201ccurious as to how she will support the child if custody goes with\u201d Wade and the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Commenting on the mother, the guardian ad litem said he has \u201cno question that she loves [the child] very much,\u201d but he found her to be a \u201cvery . . . immature young lady.\u201d He noted that she has \u201cnever really completed anything,\u201d has \u201cjumped from relationship to relationship, from one place to another,\u201d and has \u201cnever really put roots down.\u201d Observing that \u201cshe has no employment to speak of, no skills, no education\u201d and that her \u201cfuture in the job market ... is rather bleak,\u201d nevertheless, the guardian ad litem said, she is the child\u2019s natural mother, and \u201cthe love between a natural mother and child is something that\u2019s almost sacred.\u201d He stated that he \u201cfirmly\u201d believed that the mother\u2019s love for the child \u201cis an honest love\u201d and \u201cthat she comes to this court with clean hands in that regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Referring to the grandmother, he said he found \u201cher to be an equally very nice person, a very sincere person.\u201d He said he regarded her \u201cas a bit more than\u201d a third-party stranger, and that she has had \u201cmore than a typical grandmother relationship with the child.\u201d He noted she \u201chas taken care of this child the majority of the child\u2019s life,\u201d and \u201chas provided for the child financially, fed the child, clothed the child,\u201d and \u201ctaken the child to the doctor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The guardian ad litem observed, \u201cThe homosexual issue does not alarm me,\u201d stating his belief \u201cthat a homosexual should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>allowed to raise a child.\u201d One matter \u201cdid concern\u201d him about the mother. He referred to evidence that the mother separated herself from Wade after the juvenile court hearing, on the advice of counsel, to \u201chelp . . . with the custody fight,\u201d but returned to live with her two weeks later on the advice of new counsel. When asked why she is presently living with Wade if she thought living apart would help her regain custody, the mother responded, \u201cI was taking a chance.\u201d The guardian ad litem observed that the mother felt her individual \u201crights\u201d were as important as her child\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Summarizing, and noting \u201cthat custody is something that\u2019s flexible and can change if the circumstances change,\u201d the guardian ad litem suggested to the court that the child\u2019s best interests, \u201cat this time under this actual situation,\u201d would be served by awarding custody to the grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The trial judge, announcing his decision from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing, said the dispute \u201cpresents the question . . . whether the child\u2019s best interest is served by a transfer of the custody of the child from [his] mother to [his] maternal grandmother.\u201d Stating that the mother\u2019s conduct is \u201cillegal,\u201d and constitutes a felony under the Commonwealth\u2019s criminal laws, and that \u201cher conduct is immoral,\u201d the court recognized the \u201cpresumption in the law in favor of the custody being with the natural parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Mentioning the evidence of lesbianism and specified \u201cother evidence\u201d in the case not involving homosexual conduct, the trial court concluded from \u201call the facts and circumstances ... of the case,\u201d that \u201cthe custody will be with the grandmother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cthe evidence fails to prove\u201d that the mother \u201cabused or neglected her son, that her lesbian relationship with April Wade has or will have a deleterious effect on her son, or that she is an unfit parent.\u201d <em>Bottoms, </em>18 Va. App. at 484, 444 S.E.2d at 278. \u201cTo the contrary,\u201d said the Court of Appeals, the evidence showed that the mother \u201cis and has been a fit and nurturing parent who has adequately provided and cared for her son. No evidence tended to prove that the child will be harmed by remaining with his mother.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held \u201cthat the trial court abused its discretion by invoking the state\u2019s authority to take the child from the custody of his natural mother . . . and by transferring custody to a non-parent, . . . the child\u2019s maternal grandmother.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We disagree. The Court of Appeals failed to give proper deference upon appellate review to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, and misapplied the law to the facts viewed from a proper appellate perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The evidence plainly is sufficient, when applying the clear and convincing standard and when viewing the facts from the correct appellate perspective, to support the trial court\u2019s findings that the parental presumption has been rebutted, that the mother is an unfit custodian at this time, and that the child\u2019s best interests would be promoted by awarding custody to the grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Among the factors to be weighed in determining unfitness are the parent\u2019s misconduct that affects the child, neglect of the child, and a demonstrated unwillingness and inability to promote the emotional and physical well-being of the child. Other important considerations include the nature of the home environment and moral climate in which the child is to be raised. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>218 Va. 196, 199, 237 S.E.2d 89, 91 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">We have held, however, that a lesbian mother is not <em>per se </em>an unfit parent. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>222 Va. 736, 748, 284 S.E.2d 799, 806 (1981). Conduct inherent in lesbianism is punishable as a Class 6 felony in the Commonwealth, Code \u00a7 18.2-361; thus, that conduct is another important consideration in determining custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">And, while the legal rights of a parent should be respected in a custody proceeding, those technical rights may be disregarded if demanded by the interests of the child. <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Haney, </em>204 Va. 712, 716, 133 S.E.2d 533, 536 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">In the present case, the record shows a mother who, although devoted to her son, refuses to subordinate her own desires and priorities to the child\u2019s welfare. For example, the mother disappears for days without informing the child\u2019s custodian of her whereabouts. She moves her residence from place to place, relying on others for support, and uses welfare funds to \u201cdo\u201d her fingernails before buying food for the child. She has participated in illicit relationships with numerous men, acquiring a disease from one, and \u201csleeping\u201d with men in the same room where the child\u2019s crib was located. To aid in her mobility, the mother keeps the child\u2019s suitcase packed so he can be quickly deposited at the grandmother\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The mother has difficulty controlling her temper and, out of frustration, has struck the child when it was merely one year old with such force as to leave her fingerprints on his person. While in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>her care, she neglects to change and cleanse the child so that, when he returns from visitation with her, he is \u201cred\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t even sit down in the bathtub.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Unlike <em>Doe, 222 </em>Va. at 747, 284 S.E.2d at 805, relied on by the mother, there is proof in this case that the child has been harmed, at this young age, by the conditions under which he lives when with the mother for any extended period. For example, he has already demonstrated some disturbing traits. He uses vile language. He screams, holds his breath until he turns purple, and becomes emotionally upset when he must go to visit the mother. He appears confused about efforts at discipline, standing himself in a corner facing the wall for no apparent reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">And, we shall not overlook the mother\u2019s relationship with Wade, and the environment in which the child would be raised if custody is awarded the mother. We have previously said that living daily under conditions stemming from active lesbianism practiced in the home may impose a burden upon a child by reason of the \u201csocial condemnation\u201d attached to such an arrangement, which will inevitably afflict the child\u2019s relationships with its \u201cpeers and with the community at large.\u201d <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>228 Va. 722, 728, 324 S.E.2d 691, 694 (1985). We do not retreat from that statement; such a result is likely under these facts. Also, Wade has struck the child and, when there was a dispute over visitation, she has threatened violence when her views were not accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Finally, the recommendation of the guardian ad litem in this case, while not binding or controlling, should not be disregarded. <em>Contra Matter of Baby K, </em>832 F. Supp. 1022, 1031 n.2 (E.D. Va. 1993), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>16 F.3d 590 (4th Cir. 1994), <em>cert. </em>denied,_U.S__, 115 S.Ct. 91 (1994) (recommendation of court-appointed guardian ad litem \u201cirrelevant\u201d to disposition of declaratory judgment proceeding to authorize withholding by hospital of infant\u2019s ventilator treatment). The duty of a guardian ad litem in a child custody dispute is to see that the interest of the child is \u201crepresented and protected.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-9. <em>See </em>Rule 8:6 (describing role of guardian ad litem appointed for child in juvenile and domestic relations district courts). This child had no other independent participant in the proceeding, aside from the trial court, to protect his interests. Thus, this diligent guardian ad litem\u2019s recommendation that custody be awarded to the grandmother was entitled to be considered by the court in reaching a decision on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that the trial court, based on all the facts and circumstances, correctly ruled on the custody question. And, the study of the grandmother\u2019s home by the Chesterfield-Colonial Heights Department of Social Services determined there was \u201cno reason\u201d why she should not be awarded custody should the trial court make such a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Thus, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be reversed and the case will be remanded, with directions that the Court of Appeals remand the case to the Circuit Court of Henrico County for reinstatement of that court\u2019s order of September 21, 1993 awarding custody of the child to Pamela Kay Bottoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b441-7\">JUSTICE KEENAN,</author>\n<p id=\"AED\">with whom JUSTICE WHITING and JUSTICE LACY join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">This Court has held, as the majority states, that a lesbian mother is not <em>per se </em>an unfit parent. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>222 Va. 736, 748, 284 S.E.2d 799, 806 (1981). Nevertheless, the majority ignores the trial court\u2019s refusal to follow this established law of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The record plainly shows that the trial court made a <em>per se </em>finding of unfitness based on the mother\u2019s homosexual conduct. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">I will tell you first that the mother\u2019s conduct is illegal. It is a Class 6 felony in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I will tell you that it is the opinion of this Court that her conduct is immoral. And it is the opinion of this Court that the conduct of Sharon Bottoms renders her an unfit parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The trial court added to this statement only by citing two other factors to support its custody award. These factors were the \u201csocial condemnation\u201d that would \u201cinevitably\u201d affect the child, and \u201cother evidence of the child being affected or afflicted with the evidence [sic] which is unrebutted of the cursing, the evidence of the child standing in the corner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">As the Court of Appeals properly recognized, \u201cadverse effects of a parent\u2019s homosexuality on a child cannot be assumed without specific proof.\u201d <em>Bottoms </em>v. <em>Bottoms, </em>18 Va. App. 481, 493, 444 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>S.E.2d 276, 283 (1994); <em>see also Doe, </em>222 Va. at 746, 284 S.E.2d at 805. Although there is no evidence in this record showing that the mother\u2019s homosexual conduct is harmful to the child, the majority improperly presumes that its own perception of societal opinion and the mother\u2019s homosexual conduct are germane to the issue whether the mother is an unfit parent. Thus, the majority commits the same error as the trial court by attaching importance to factors not shown by the evidence to have an adverse effect on the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Additionally, I believe that this appeal cannot be resolved by imposition of final judgment. Since the trial court applied the wrong rule of law in this custody determination, this case must be remanded to the trier of fact, pursuant to <em>McEntire </em>v. <em>Redfearn, 217 </em>Va. 313, 316-17, 227 S.E.2d 741, 744 (1976), for application of the correct principles of law to all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The majority\u2019s award of final judgment is doubly inappropriate under the holding of <em>McEntire, </em>because approximately 19 months have passed since the last evidentiary hearing in this case. In <em>McEntire, </em>the trial court had applied the wrong rule of law, and almost 18 months had passed since the last evidentiary hearing. This Court held that, based on the passage of that amount of time, \u201cwe are unable at this time properly to determine the issue of custody from the record before us. Accordingly, we will remand the case to the circuit court with direction to hold forthwith another hearing . . . applying the law in a manner consistent with this opinion.\u201d 217 Va. at 317, 227 S.E.2d at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In the present case, the same disposition is required. Thus, I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that the trial court erred in applying a <em>per se </em>rule of parental unfitness based on the mother\u2019s homosexual conduct, but would reverse its imposition of final judgment and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
