Code \u00a7 55-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-16\">Carole A. Hudson was divorced from the grantor, Forrest Gatewood Hudson, in 1988. A property settlement agreement, incorporated into the final divorce decree, required Forrest to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Carole $1,200 per month in spousal support. The agreement further provided that this obligation would terminate upon Carole\u2019s death or remarriage, but that, if support were still payable at the time of Forrest\u2019s death, Carole would be paid $75,000 from the proceeds of Forrest\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Forrest married Judith E. Hudson in 1990. At that time, he was the sole owner of the real property that is the subject of the claimed voluntary conveyance. He was also the president and sole shareholder of Select Construction, Inc. (Select).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Forrest executed a deed of gift, recorded on August 4, 1992, transferring the subject real property to himself and Judith as tenants by the entireties. He died on August 14, 1992. Thereafter, Carole made a demand on his estate for payment of $75,000 pursuant to the property settlement agreement. Judith, who was executor of Forrest\u2019s estate, paid Carole $9,600, leaving $65,400 unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Carole filed a bill of complaint against Judith, individually and as executor of Forrest\u2019s estate, asking the trial court to rule that the deed of gift was a voluntary conveyance, void as to Carole, because she was an existing creditor at the time of the transfer and Forrest was rendered insolvent by the conveyance. Carole further alleged that the transfer was made in an effort to defeat her claim under the property settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">At trial, Carole testified that she had continued to receive support payments until Forrest\u2019s death, so that she was entitled to the payment of $75,000 from his estate. She did not attempt to prove that the conveyance was made with the intent to defraud her. Instead, she contended that Forrest was insolvent or rendered insolvent when he conveyed to Judith a survivorship interest in his separately held real estate. Carole introduced the inventory of Forrest\u2019s estate and stated that she was not aware of any property Forrest owned that was not shown on the inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In the inventory, filed pursuant to Code \u00a7 26-12 and signed on May 18, 1993, Judith listed personal property valued at $3,500 as an asset of Forrest\u2019s estate. The only other asset listed was Forrest\u2019s stock in Select, which Judith valued at $0.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Judith testified that she was Select\u2019s corporate secretary and treasurer. She acted as office manager and \u201cdid all the bookkeeping and assisted Forrest.\u201d Judith testified that Select\u2019s construction business consisted of \u201cmostly [federal] government and [s]tate work.\u201d She stated that these federal and state contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>required Select to obtain performance bonds, and that Forrest personally guaranteed all obligations undertaken by a private bonding company pursuant to these contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Judith stated that Select was solvent the day before Forrest died. However, shortly after his death, the bonding company cut off all future bonding commitments and did not agree to consider writing bonds for new projects until the middle of October 1992. Because of this delay, Select was unable to complete certain bid applications that were due on September 30, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Judith introduced into evidence a copy of the probate tax return that she had filed at the time she submitted Forrest\u2019s will to probate on September 2, 1992, pursuant to Code \u00a7 58.1-1714. In the probate tax return, she had valued Forrest\u2019s personal property at $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">When asked to explain why she had valued this property at $250,000 on the probate tax return, although she later gave the value of the Select stock as $0 on the inventory, Judith replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">Well, when I valued the company at $250,000, that was based on the June 30th, 1992 tax return. And I knew the insurance money would be coming in. I knew of the liabilities that there were. So I thought I was okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">Then when the bonding company cut me off and so many months had passed, four months had passed, we did not have any work, new work that\u2014on the books. Money was steadily going out. ... I had people coming out of the woodwork basically asking for money for various things that they thought that they were owed. And so by the time the four months had rolled around, I knew at that point in time that there would be basically nothing left in the company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Judith also testified that, shortly after Forrest\u2019s death, his tangible personal property was appraised at approximately $11,000. The value of this property is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Outstanding at Forrest\u2019s death were personal debts of about $3,000, as well as medical bills and current mortgage and utility bills in unspecified amounts. Judith stated that Forrest paid all his bills as they matured, and that he was not in arrears in payment of any bills on the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Judith also presented the testimony of an expert witness, Louis Charles Einwick, Jr., chief of the valuation section of Crestar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Bank\u2019s merger and acquisition department. He testified that he is engaged solely in determining the value of private businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Einwick stated that he was asked to value Select for estate tax purposes. He testified that he valued the company on an adjusted asset basis, in which he calculated the fair market value of the company\u2019s assets and then subtracted the liabilities from that amount. Among other data, he reviewed Select\u2019s financial statements, including the fiscal-year-end statement for June 30, 1992, shortly before Forrest\u2019s death, which showed a net worth of $236,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Einwick stated that he consulted with Judith regarding the projected losses for the last six months of 1992, and that he calculated the value of the company\u2019s fixed assets at 50% of their stated value. After considering all these factors, Einwick concluded that Select had an \u201cadjusted equity value\u201d of $239,000 as of December 1992. He stated that this amount constituted \u201cour best estimate of what would be acceptable to the IRS and everybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In addition, Paul Wring, a certified public accountant, testified that he had prepared annual and semi-annual financial statements for Select for a number of years. He prepared Select\u2019s corporate income tax return for its fiscal year ending June 30, 1992, and its semi-annual financial statements for the periods ending June 30, 1992, and December 31, 1992. Although the tax return and the financial statements were prepared using different accounting methods, Wring testified that, under either method, Select was a solvent corporation on December 31, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">After receiving this evidence, the trial court ruled that the transfer was void as to Carole, and that Judith was indebted to Carole in the amount of $65,400. In its final order, the trial court stated: \u201cDuring [Forrest\u2019s] lifetime, Select Construction Co., had some value. Upon his death, the business had no value. Upon the execution and delivery of the Deed of Gift of the residence, Forrest G. Hudson was rendered insolvent pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 55-81.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">On appeal, Judith argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the real estate transfer rendered Forrest insolvent. In support of her assertion, Judith points to the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Select had \u201csome value\u201d during Forrest\u2019s lifetime. Further, Judith contends that Carole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>presented no evidence of insolvency as of the date of transfer, but only evidence of insolvency after Forrest\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">In response, Carole notes that Code \u00a7 26-12 requires an executor to file an inventory listing the assets owned by decedent at the date of death and fixing the value of those assets as of that date. Thus, she argues that the inventory constitutes evidence that, within ten days of the transfer, Forrest\u2019s tangible and intangible assets totalled only $3,500. Carole also points to Judith\u2019s own testimony that \u201cForrest was the asset of the company. . . . [A]s long as Forrest was there, the company could survive . . . . [T]he company could not survive without Forrest.\u201d Carole argues that this is further evidence that supports the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In resolving this issue, we first emphasize that, in accordance with Code \u00a7 8.01-680, the trial court\u2019s decision will be upheld unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Westvaco Corp., </em>244 Va. 139, 150, 419 S.E.2d 661, 668 (1992). Since the trial court has heard the evidence ore tenus, its findings based on an evaluation of the testimony are entitled to the same weight as those of a jury. <em>Id.; Quantum Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Luckett, </em>242 Va. 159, 161, 409 S.E.2d 121, 122 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Under Code \u00a7 55-81, a voluntary conveyance is void as to a prior creditor upon proof that: (1) the transfer was not made upon consideration deemed valuable in law or the transfer was made upon consideration of marriage; (2) the transfer was made by an insolvent transferor, or by a transferor who was rendered insolvent by the transfer; and (3) the transferor\u2019s debt to the creditor was contracted before the time of the transfer. Since, in the present case, it is undisputed that the transfer by gift was not made upon consideration deemed valuable at law, we examine whether the evidence is sufficient to show that Forrest Hudson was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer. In reviewing this factual finding, we will assume, without deciding, that he was indebted to Carole Hudson in the amount of $75,000 at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">A debtor is insolvent, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 55-81, when he has insufficient property to pay all his debts. <em>See McArthur </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 683, 694 (1857). In order to prove insolvency, both the value of the debtor\u2019s assets and the amount of his liabilities must be established. <em>See Darden </em>v. <em>George G. Lee Co., </em>204 Va. 108, 109-11, 129 S.E.2d 897, 898-99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(1963); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>181 Va. 52, 63-64, 23 S.E.2d 803, 808-09 (1943). Thus, Carole was required to establish that the amount of Forrest\u2019s liabilities at the date of the transfer exceeded the amount of his assets, exclusive of the transferred real estate, on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The only evidence in the record suggesting that Forrest was insolvent after the transfer was the estate inventory indicating that Select was worthless and that his total assets were $3,500 at the date of his death. However, Judith also testified that she had placed the date-of-death value of the Select stock at $250,000 when she filed the probate tax return in September, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Although Code \u00a7 26-12 requires that the estate inventory, like the probate tax return, must reflect the value of the estate\u2019s assets at the time of death, the evidence is undisputed that Judith did not state the date-of-death value of Select in preparing the inventory. Instead, Judith\u2019s testimony shows that the May 1993 inventory reflected her perception of Select\u2019s value based on events that transpired during the months following Forrest\u2019s death. Thus, the inventory is not credible evidence of the value of Select on or about the date of the transfer, but is relevant only to the value of Select at a date several months after Forrest\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">No other evidence establishes that Forrest was rendered insolvent by the transfer. As stated above, the valuation evidence presented by Einwick showed that, as of December 1992, Select had a value of $239,000. Also, as previously stated, the June 30, 1992 financial statement prepared by Wring shows that Select had a net worth of $236,000, and Wring testified that, as of December 1992, Select remained solvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Carole argues, however, that, notwithstanding any value that the Select stock may have had, the amount of Forrest\u2019s personal liabilities exceeded the value of that stock. Carole notes that Judith testified Forrest had personally guaranteed all obligations of the bonding company on the government contracts, and that these contracts constituted most of Select\u2019s work. She argues that these guarantees represent contingent liabilities that must be weighed in determining Forrest\u2019s insolvency. Carole suggests that the amount of these liabilities may be established by reference to Wring\u2019s figures regarding Select\u2019s income. For the year ending June 30, 1992, Wring\u2019s statement shows that Select\u2019s net sales totalled $2,858,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>We will assume, without deciding, that such personal guarantees are liabilities properly to be considered in determining insolvency. Nevertheless, we conclude that the evidence of Select\u2019s net sales, standing alone, does not establish the amount of Forrest\u2019s liability on the guarantees at or near the date of the transfer. Without evidence regarding which government contracts still were uncompleted at or near that date, and the remaining amount of the bonding commitments connected therewith, there is no evidence to show the amount of Forrest\u2019s contingent liability at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Based on this record, we conclude, as a matter of law, that there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Forrest Hudson was rendered insolvent by the subject transfer. For these reasons, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and enter final judgment in favor of Judith E. Hudson, individually and as executor of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
