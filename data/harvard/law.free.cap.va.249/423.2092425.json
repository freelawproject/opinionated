In the penalty phase of a bifurcated trial, the jury fixed Mickens\u2019 punishment at death, based upon findings beyond a reasonable doubt of both the \u201cvileness\u201d and the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicates. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced Mickens in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment and the death sentence. <em>Mickens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 395, 442 S.E.2d 678 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Mickens petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, and, on October 11, 1994, in a summary disposition, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to this Court \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>512 U.S._, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994).\u201d <em>Mickens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>513 U.S._, 115 S.Ct. 307 (1994). By order entered December 1, 1994, we placed this case on our March 1995 docket with directions for briefing and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">In <em>Simmons, </em>the Supreme Court held that, when \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d is at issue in the sentencing phase of a capital murder case, the jury is entitled to be informed of the defendant\u2019s parole <em>ineligibility. </em>512 U.S. at_, 114 S.Ct. at 2189. Code \u00a7 53.1-151 (Bl) prescribes the test for determining whether a defendant is ineligible for parole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">Any person convicted of three separate felony offenses of (i) murder, (ii) rape or (iii) robbery by the presenting of firearms or other deadly weapon, or any combination of the offenses specified in subdivisions (i), (ii) or (iii) when such offenses were not part of a common act, transaction or scheme shall not be eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">In a pretrial motion, Mickens contended that Virginia\u2019s rule barring evidence about a defendant\u2019s parole eligibility \u201cprevents the jury from giving full consideration to all mitigating factors.\u201d Mickens represented to the trial court that he would not have been eligible for parole if he were convicted of capital murder, and he claimed that the rule violated his federal and state constitutional rights.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The trial court rejected this contention, and we affirmed that ruling. <em>Mickens, </em>247 Va. at 404-05, 442 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>685. At the time of Mickens\u2019 pretrial motion, <em>Simmons </em>had not been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Mickens asserts that the trial court\u2019s ruling prevented him from presenting his parole ineligibility to the jury, thereby depriving the jury from considering \u201ca truly mitigating factor.\u201d He contends that the holding in <em>Simmons </em>invalidates his death sentence and requires that we either impose a life sentence or remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We conclude that the holding in <em>Simmons </em>requires a remand of the case for resentencing. \u201cFuture dangerousness\u201d was an issue in the sentencing phase of the capital murder trial; therefore, the jury was entitled to be informed of Mickens\u2019 parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Accordingly, we will remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\n<em>Remanded for sentencing hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-14\"> Mickens claims that he is ineligible for parole because, in addition to his capital murder conviction, he was convicted on June 3, 1974, of robbery by the presenting of a deadly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>weapon (a knife) and on February 4, 1980, of another robbery by the presenting of a deadly weapon (a knife).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
