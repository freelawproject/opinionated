Lawrence Carr, Jr. and Debra A. Carr, individually and trading as <em>Homes &amp; Land Magazine of Newport News/Hampton </em>and <em>Homes &amp; Land Magazine of Historic Williamsburg </em>(the Taxpayers), are engaged in the business of compiling and distributing to the general public magazines in which real estate brokerage firms advertise residential property for sale. The Taxpayers operate under a franchise from Homes &amp; Land Publishing Corporation, a Florida corporation (Homes).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">Homes prints all the magazines for the Taxpayers and ships them to the Taxpayers\u2019 office in Newport News. The Taxpayers pay Homes a royalty fee and additional fees for printing and shipping the magazines. The magazines are published every four weeks, <em>i.e., </em>13 times a year, and are distributed by the Taxpayers free of charge in the cities shown on the title covers of the magazines. The Taxpayers have never paid any sales or use taxes to the Commonwealth on the cost of the printing of the magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">On March 12, 1990, the Department of Taxation (the Department) assessed Homes with sales tax and interest in the amount of $226,997.05 for <em>Homes &amp; Land Magazines </em>distributed in Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>during the period of April 1, 1984, through December 31, 1989. On March 11, 1991, W.H. Forst, Tax Commissioner of the Commonwealth (the Commissioner), issued a letter ruling, designated as Public Document 91-29, in which the Commissioner ruled that the Taxpayers\u2019 magazines do not qualify for the media-related exemption from taxation, as set forth in former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Homes has not remitted any sales tax to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Taxpayers brought a declaratory judgment proceeding, seeking a determination that they are exempt from the retail sales and use tax. Both the Taxpayers and the Commissioner filed motions for summary judgment, conceding that the question presented was purely one of statutory interpretation. The trial court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the Taxpayers\u2019 motion, holding that the magazines were not exempt, under former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c), from the retail sales and use tax. We awarded the Taxpayers an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Code \u00a7 58.1-603 levies and imposes a sales tax \u201cupon every person who engages in the business of selling at retail or distributing tangible personal property.\u201d Code \u00a7 58.1-604 levies and imposes a tax \u201cupon the use or consumption of tangible personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c), however, provided that such taxes shall not apply to \u201c[a]ny publication issued daily, or regularly at average intervals not exceeding three months, and advertising supplements and any other printed matter ultimately distributed with or as part of such publications, except that newsstand sales of the same are taxable.\u201d Regulation 630-10-73, promulgated by the Department, provides, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">The [retail sales and use] tax does not apply to the retail sale of any newspaper, magazine or other publication issued daily, or regularly at average intervals not exceeding three months, except that newsstand sales of the publications are taxable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The regulation defines the term \u201cpublications\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>As used herein the term \u201cpublications\u201d shall mean any written compilation of information available to the general public. Publication does not include general reference materials and their periodic updates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The Commissioner contends that the Taxpayers\u2019 magazines are taxable under Code \u00a7\u00a7 58.1-603 and -604. The Taxpayers contend that the magazines are exempt from such taxes pursuant to former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">When a tax exemption is claimed, certain well-established principles of law must be considered. The Constitution of Virginia, in Article X, Section 6(f), provides that \u201c[e]xemptions of property from taxation . . . shall be strictly construed.\u201d Thus, \u201ctaxation is the rule and not the exception; and . . . statutory tax exemptions are strictly construed against the taxpayer, with doubts resolved against the exemptions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Research </em>Analysis, 214 Va. 161, 163, 198 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1973); <em>accord Roberts </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>249 Va. 2, 5-6, 453 S.E.2d 258, 260 (1995) (this day decided); <em>Westminster-Canterbury </em>v. <em>City of Virginia Beach, </em>238 Va. 493, 501, 385 S.E.2d 561, 565 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">By statute, the tax commissioner has \u201cthe power to issue regulations relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the laws . . . governing taxes,\u201d Code \u00a7 58.1-203(A), and any such regulation \u201cshall be sustained unless unreasonable or plainly inconsistent with applicable provisions of law,\u201d Code \u00a7 58.1-205(2). Further, the tax commissioner\u2019s construction of a tax statute is entitled to great weight. <em>Winchester TV Cable </em>v. <em>State Tax Com., </em>216 Va. 286, 290, 217 S.E.2d 885, 889 (1975). Therefore, a presumption of validity attaches to the tax commissioner\u2019s ruling, and the burden is on the taxpayer to prove that the ruling is contrary to law or that the commissioner has abused his discretion and acted unreasonably. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wellmore Coal, </em>228 Va. 149, 153, 320 S.E.2d 509, 511 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">It also is well established, however, that, if a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court must accept its plain meaning and not resort to extrinsic evidence or rules of construction. <em>USAA Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>248 Va. 185, 192, 445 S.E.2d 145, 148-49 (1994); <em>Reistroffer </em>v. <em>Person, </em>247 Va. 45, 49, 439 S.E.2d 376, 379 (1994); <em>Norfolk Airport Authority </em>v. <em>Nordwall, </em>246 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>391, 394, 436 S.E.2d 436, 438 (1993); <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Fairfax Hospital System, 239 </em>Va. 307, 310, 389 S.E.2d 458, 459 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In his letter ruling, the Commissioner opined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">The express statutory reference to advertising supplements in [former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c)] indicates that the General Assembly intended for advertising to be outside the scope of the exemption granted for regularly issued and periodic publications. Additionally, a compilation of advertisements promoting the sale of particular property or services would not be considered a publication providing information of general interest to the public under the term as defined in the regulation. The exemption, thus, is limited to publications providing general news and information only and does not extend to those providing only advertising.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Consistent with this ruling, the Commissioner, on brief, states that \u201capplication of the exemption depends on the <em>purpose </em>of the publication in question; whether the publication is intended to promote the sale of goods and/or services or intended to communicate ideas and information.\u201d The exemption does not apply to the magazines in the present case, the Commissioner asserts, because their purpose is to advertise the sale of real estate rather than to communicate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The trial court, relying upon <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Tax Comm., </em>217 Va. 988, 234 S.E.2d 297 (1977),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> determined that the \u201cprintings\u201d are not newspapers or magazines, which the court stated are defined as \u201cperiodical [s] containing miscellaneous pieces, articles, stories, and poems.\u201d The court further stated that a periodical is defined as \u201c \u2018something published within a fixed interval\u2019 \u201d and concluded, therefore, that \u201ca question exists\u201d whether the General Assembly \u201cintended \u2018periodical\u2019 to mean just anything published between intervals, or whether [it] intended periodical to mean an item listed in something like an index to periodicals.\u201d Consequently, the trial court could not say that the Commissioner\u2019s ruling was unreasonable. We do not agree with the trial court or the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">When the exemption set forth in former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c) is examined in the light of the foregoing principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of law, we conclude that the language is clear and unambiguous and that the Commissioner misinterprets the statute. More precisely, the Commissioner reads into the statute an element (i.e., the purpose of the publication) that is contrary to the statute\u2019s plain meaning. Former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c) exempts \u201c[a]ny publication\u201d without any exception or qualification. Although the exemption also applies to \u201cadvertising supplements and any other printed matter\u201d which are distributed with or as a part of \u201csuch publications,\u201d it does not follow that the provision regarding advertising supplements qualifies the term \u201cany publication\u201d and excludes from the exemption publications providing only advertising. Had the General Assembly intended such an exclusion, it could have so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">We hold, therefore, that the magazines in question are publications exempt from the retail sales and use tax under former Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c) (now Code \u00a7 58.1-609.6(3)). Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and enter final judgment in favor of the Taxpayers, declaring that they are exempt from the retail sales and use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\"> Code \u00a7 58.1-608(A)(6)(c) has been recodified and now appears, without any substantive change, as Code \u00a7 58.1-609.6(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-10\"> In <em>Jefferson, </em>we defined the term \u201cpublication\u201d as \u201ca newspaper, magazine or other periodical which is available for general distribution to the public.\u201d 217 Va. at 992, 234 S.E.2d at 300.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
