(Taylor), as \u201cContractor,\u201d agreed to construct a project located in Chesterfield County and designated in the contract as \u201cNew Sanctuary and Education Building.\u201d The contracting \u201cOwner\u201d was \u201cAsbury United Methodist Church\u201d (the Church).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The contract provided for a \u201cguaranteed maximum cost\u201d to the Owner of $2,370,943, subject to adjustment for changes in the work as provided by the contract. In addition, the contract contained an arbitration clause, Paragraph 7.9.1, which provided in material part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">All claims, disputes and other matters in question between the Contractor and the Owner arising out of, or relating to, the Contract Documents or the breach thereof . . . shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then obtaining unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">On November 2, 1990, Taylor submitted a Demand for Arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause. Taylor alleged that the Church had made numerous changes to the construction work by a change order dated June 29, 1990 (the June 1990 change order), which increased the guaranteed maximum cost of the work. Taylor alleged that it was owed $362,462.28 as a result of the change order \u201cunder the [cjontract,\u201d and that the Church had \u201cbreached the [cjontract\u201d by failing to tender this additional amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">On December 4, 1990, the \u201cTrustees of Asbury United Methodist Church\u201d (the Trustees) filed a motion for declaratory judgment in the trial court. The Trustees alleged they \u201cownfedj\u201d the real estate on which the construction work was done and that, at a duly held church conference meeting, they had been authorized to encumber the property and contract with Taylor for the improvements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Trustees further alleged, however, that Taylor was entitled only to the \u201cguaranteed maximum cost,\u201d as adjusted, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>they asked the trial court to declare that the June 1990 change order under which Taylor claimed additional charges was invalid, because it had been signed without the authority of the church congregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Taylor replied to the declaratory judgment action by seeking an order compelling arbitration, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-581.02(A). The trial court ordered the parties to arbitrate, ruling that the arbitration clause was broad enough to encompass the parties\u2019 dispute regarding the validity of the June 1990 change order.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The arbitrator, Orran Lee Brown, conducted two days of hearings and issued a \u201cDecision of Arbitrator\u201d dated August 19, 1991. Brown found that the June 1990 change order had been signed by two of the trustees for the Church who had no actual or apparent authority to bind the Church. Citing Code \u00a7 57-15 and other authority, Brown concluded that, in order for any change order to be valid, Taylor was required to obtain the congregation\u2019s authorization and a circuit court\u2019s approval to bind the Church contractually for improvements to the Church\u2019s property. Thus, Brown ruled that the Church was not obligated by the terms of the June 1990 change order \u201cas a contractual matter.\u201d However, Brown also stated that Taylor could seek recovery based on quantum meruit for the value of its services, and he granted Taylor leave to arbitrate such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The Trustees asked the trial court to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s ruling that the June 1990 change order was invalid, but to vacate that portion of the arbitrator\u2019s decision holding that Taylor could assert a request for quantum meruit relief. The Trustees contended that this ruling exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s powers, because it was outside the scope of the matters submitted to him by the trial court\u2019s order compelling arbitration. By order dated January 7, 1992, the trial court granted the Trustees\u2019 request confirming in part and vacating in part the arbitrator\u2019s decision. In its order, the trial court also referred the matter back to the arbitrator for apportionment of fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Thereafter, Taylor obtained leave from the arbitrator to file an Amended Demand for Arbitration. In the Amended Demand, Taylor asserted claims based on theories of breach of contract and quantum meruit, stated in the alternative, against both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Church and several \u201cIndividual Respondents [,] in their individual rather than representative capacities,\u201d who were members of the Church\u2019s board of trustees. The arbitrator later dismissed the individual respondents as parties to the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Trustees opposed the Amended Demand in the trial court by seeking to enjoin Taylor from \u201cproceeding in any manner to raise any issue other than that provided for in the Court\u2019s Order of January 7, 1992,\u201d because, they said, Taylor\u2019s Amended Demand went beyond the scope of the hearing on apportionment of fees and costs that had been ordered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Taylor, however, continued to seek arbitration of its Amended Demand. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-581.02(A), Taylor again applied to the trial court for an order compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The trial court granted Taylor\u2019s motion and ordered arbitration. In an opinion letter dated February 12, 1992, the trial court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">[A]lthough defendant\u2019s original <em>Demand For Arbitration </em>did not include the issue of <em>quantum meruit, </em>defendant did allege a breach of contract by plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s <em>Amended Demand </em>again alleges a breach of contract by plaintiff, among other allegations. Breach of contract has not been addressed by the arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">The issues included in defendant\u2019s <em>Amended Demand </em>are arbitrable, therefore the Court hereby grants defendant\u2019s <em>Application to Stay Proceeding and to Compel Arbitration.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">On April 10, 1992, the trial court denied the Trustees\u2019 request for an injunction and ordered the parties to arbitrate \u201cthe matters set forth in the Amended Demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Brown, the arbitrator, then stated that \u201c[t]he remaining [arbitration] hearing will not address the breach of contract claim, as that has been disposed of previously. The hearing will concern the claimant\u2019s allegation that Asbury has been unjustly enriched and the claimant should recover $362,462.28 an [sic] extracontractual quatum meriuit [sic] recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Brown conducted hearings on the request for quantum meruit relief in October 1992 and January 1993. The transcripts of those hearings show that Brown ruled that, since there was no express and enforceable contract as to the claims for work performed under the invalid change order, a claim would lie for quantum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>meruit relief for the reasonable value of that work. On March 26, 1993, Brown issued an Award of Arbitrator (the March 1993 award), stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">ASBURY UNITED METHODIST CHURCH shall pay to TAYLOR &amp; PARRISH, INC. the sum of TWO HUNDRED SIXTY-THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TEN DOLLARS AND NINETY-SEVEN CENTS ($263,310.97) ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">The administrative fees and expenses of the American Arbitration Association and fees for the remuneration of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">This Award is in full settlement of all claims submitted to this arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Taylor asked the trial court to enter an order confirming the March 1993 award and entering judgment in its favor. In opposition to this request, the Trustees asked the trial court to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s decision of August 19, 1991, and to vacate the March 1993 award. The Trustees argued that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers, had misapplied the law, and did not have authority to consider quantum meruit relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The trial court rejected the Trustees\u2019 arguments. In an opinion letter dated October 13, 1993, the trial court held that the arbitration clause in the contract was broad enough to encompass the issue of quantum meruit relief because that claim \u201carises out of, or relates to, the contract.\u201d The trial court further stated that the arbitrator had not exceeded the scope of the issues submitted to him by the order granting a second arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The trial court declined to enter a proposed order in which Taylor requested judgment against the Trustees and the Church, jointly and severally. Instead, the trial court\u2019s order of November 2, 1993, recited that judgment was entered in favor of Taylor \u201cagainst ASBURY UNITED METHODIST CHURCH\u201d in the amount of $263,310.97, plus interest and one half of the fees and expenses of the American Arbitration Association and the fees of the arbitrator. Both Taylor and the Trustees have appealed from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\n<em>I. The Trustees\u2019 Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Trustees contend that the trial court erred in confirming the March 1993 award. They argue that the trial court was required to vacate the award under Code \u00a7 8.01-581.010(3), because the arbitrator exceeded his powers in allowing recovery on a quantum meruit basis. The Trustees assert that the remedy of quantum meruit is available only when there is no express contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In response, Taylor first argues that the Trustees have no standing to appeal from the trial court\u2019s order, because judgment was not entered against the Trustees, but against the Church. Taylor further contends that the trial court acted properly in construing the March 1993 award liberally and in conducting a limited review of the award. Taylor argues that, under the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules that were made a part of the contract, the arbitrator was empowered to \u201cgrant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties.\u201d American Arbitration Association, Construction Industry Arbitration Rules, Rule 43 (rev. January 1, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Initially, we address Taylor\u2019s argument that the Trustees have no standing to bring this appeal, because the trial court entered judgment only against the Church, in accordance with the March 1993 award. Taylor contends that, because judgment was not entered against the Trustees, the Trustees are not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the trial court\u2019s order, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-670. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-670 provides, in material part, that \u201cany person may present a petition for an appeal to the Supreme Court if he believes himself aggrieved: . . . 3. By a final judgment in [a] civil case.\u201d In <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Commission </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 415, 344 S.E.2d 899 (1986), this Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">[i]n order for a petitioner to be \u201caggrieved,\u201d it must affirmatively appear that such person had some direct interest in the subject matter of the proceeding that he seeks to attack. The petitioner \u201cmust show that he has an immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest in the litigation, and not a remote or indirect interest.\u201d . . . The word \u201caggrieved\u201d in a statute contemplates a substantial grievance and means a denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>some personal or property right, legal or equitable, or imposition of a burden or obligation upon the petitioner different from that suffered by the public generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 344 S.E.2d at 902-03 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The arbitrator\u2019s award was directed only to the Church, which was the entity named as \u201cOwner\u201d in the construction contract; however, only the Trustees were parties before the trial court, having initiated the declaratory judgment proceeding in which the order of judgment against the Church was entered. In the motion for declaratory judgment, nine individuals alleged that, \u201cas Trustees of Asbury\u201d United Methodist Church, they \u201cown[ed] a parcel of real estate\u201d on which the construction was done, and Taylor admitted this allegation of ownership in its \u201cGrounds of Defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The nature of the Trustees\u2019 ownership interest is not shown by the record; however, acquisition and ownership of property by churches are matters governed by statute, in accordance with Article IV, \u00a7 14 of the Constitution of Virginia. Code \u00a7 57-7.1 validates transfers, including transfers of real property, for the benefit of local religious organizations. <em>See Norfolk Presbytery </em>v. <em>Bollinger, </em>214 Va. 500, 506, 201 S.E.2d 752, 757 (1974) (construing former Code \u00a7 57-7).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Code \u00a7 57-8 authorizes the appointment of trustees \u201cto effect and promote the purpose and object\u201d of a conveyance of land, \u201cand the legal title to such land shall for that purpose and object be vested in the trustees.\u201d Such trustees merely hold the legal title to the land for the use and benefit of the religious organization. <em>Globe Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Jerusalem Baptist Church, </em>103 Va. 559, 561, 49 S.E. 657, 658 (1905). Thus, pursuant to statute, the Trustees held legal title, for the benefit of the Asbury United Methodist Church, to the land and improvements thereon that were the subject of the contract with Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The Trustees were both a party to the trial court proceedings and had a specific property interest, peculiar to themselves, in the real property that was the subject of the contract at issue. <em>Cf. Virginia Beach Beautification, </em>231 Va. at 420, 344 S.E.2d at 903. Further, the relief they requested in the trial court proceedings effectively was denied by the entry of judgment against the Church. Thus, we conclude that the Trustees are proper parties to maintain this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Turning to the merits of the Trustees\u2019 appeal, we first recognize that an \u201carbitration award \u2018must be construed liberally so as to uphold it, if possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howerin Residential Sales Corp. </em>v. <em>Century Realty of Tidewater, Inc., </em>235 Va. 174, 179, 365 S.E.2d 767, 770 (1988) (quoting <em>Sydnor Pump &amp; Well Co. v. County Sch. Bd., </em>182 Va. 156, 167, 28 S.E.2d 33, 37 (1943)). Moreover, the party attacking an arbitrator\u2019s award bears the burden of proving the invalidity of the award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The trial court\u2019s review of an arbitration award is governed by specific statutory criteria. Code \u00a7 8.01-581.010 provides, in material part, that \u201c[u]pon application of a party, the court shall vacate an award where: ... 3. The arbitrators exceeded their powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Here, the order of April 10, 1992, broadly referred to the arbitrator all matters stated in the Amended Demand, which included Taylor\u2019s request for quantum meruit relief. The trial court\u2019s referral of the quantum meruit request was void, however, because the trial court could not confer jurisdiction on the arbitrator to adjudicate disputes that were not based on the parties\u2019 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Arbitrators derive their authority solely from the parties\u2019 contractual agreement to arbitrate disputes arising under the contract. Thus, arbitrators exceed the scope of their authority when they purport to act beyond the terms of the contract from which they draw their authority. <em>Gordon Sel-Way, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence Bros., Inc., </em>475 N.W.2d 704, 710 (Mich. 1991); <em>County College of Morris Staff Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>County College, </em>495 A.2d 865, 869-70 (N.J. 1985); <em>JBC of Wyoming Corp. </em>v. <em>City of Cheyenne, </em>843 P.2d 1190, 1196 (Wyo. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The contract between Taylor and the Church committed to the arbitrator\u2019s decision those \u201cclaims, disputes and other matters . . . arising out of, or relating to, the Contract Documents or the breach thereof.\u201d Paragraph 7.9.1. The term \u201cContract Documents\u201d included only the parties\u2019 \u201cStandard Form of Agreement,\u201d certain other specifically enumerated documents, and \u201call Modifications issued after execution of the Contract,\u201d including \u201ca Change Order.\u201d Paragraphs 1.1, 16.2, and 1.1.1. A \u201cChange Order,\u201d as defined by the contract, is \u201ca written order to the Contractor signed by the <em>Owner </em>and the Architect . . . authorizing ... an adjustment in the Contract Sum[, which] may be changed only by Change Order.\u201d Paragraph 12.1.1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In his decision of August 1991, the arbitrator ruled that the June 1990 change order had not been \u201csigned by the Owner\u201d because the individuals signing it had no authority to bind the Church as \u201cOwner.\u201d This portion of the arbitrator\u2019s decision was confirmed by the trial court and, since Taylor did not object or assign error to this ruling, it has become the law of the case. <em>See Medical Ctr. Hosps. </em>v. <em>Sharpless, </em>229 Va. 496, 498, 331 S.E.2d 405, 406 (1985). Thus, because the June 1990 change order was not among the \u201cContract Documents,\u201d Taylor\u2019s claim for quantum meruit recovery for the work performed under the invalid change order was not a claim \u201crelating to the Contract Documents.\u201d By the parties\u2019 contract, claims not relating to the Contract Documents were not within the arbitrator\u2019s scope of authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Wild West Trading Co. v. gbs &amp; h Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners, Inc., </em>881 P.2d 1070, 1074 (Wyo. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In purporting to decide whether Taylor was entitled to payment for work that had not been performed in accordance with the contract, the arbitrator exceeded the scope of the authority granted him by the parties\u2019 contract. As this Court stated in <em>Doyle &amp; Russell, Inc. v. Roanoke Hospital Association, </em>213 Va. 489, 193 S.E.2d 662 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">[T]he extent of the duty to arbitrate, just as the initial duty to arbitrate at all, arises from contractual undertakings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">A party cannot be compelled to submit to arbitration unless he has first agreed to arbitrate. By the same token, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>cannot be compelled to arbitrate a question which, under his agreement, is not arbitrable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 494, 193 S.E.2d at 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Thus, we hold that the trial court erred in confirming that portion of the March 1993 award which found that Taylor was entitled to $263,310.97 plus interest based on the invalid change order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>II. Taylor\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">We turn now to the single assignment of error raised by Taylor in its separate appeal. Taylor argues that the trial court erred in refusing to enter judgment against the Trustees and the Church, jointly and severally, as Taylor requested in its application to confirm the March 1993 award. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-581.011 provides that, unless the trial court grants an application to modify or correct an arbitration award, \u201cthe court shall confirm the award as made.\u201d When the court grants an order confirming an award, \u201ca judgment or decree shall be entered in conformity therewith.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-581.012.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Taylor did not apply to the arbitrator or to the trial court to modify or correct the award, as provided in Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-581.08 and 8.01-581.011. Moreover, Taylor did not name the Trustees in either of its demands for arbitration. Therefore, the trial court did not err in declining to enter a joint and several judgment which would not have conformed with the award and which impermissibly would have modified the award. <em>See Wessell Bros. Found. Drilling Co. </em>v. <em>Crossett Pub. Sch. Dist., No. 52, </em>701 S.W.2d 99, 101-02 (Ark. 1985); <em>Thacker Constr. Co. v. A Betterway Rent-A-Car, Inc., </em>368 S.E.2d 178, 180 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">In conclusion, we will reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award of $263,310.97 plus interest to Taylor and enter final judgment. We will affirm that portion of the judgment rendered in favor of Taylor in the amount of one half of fees and expenses relating to the arbitration proceeding, as the Trustees have not advanced any argument that the trial court improperly confirmed that award of costs. Finally, we will remand the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment order in favor of Taylor for a specific amount representing one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>half of the fees and expenses of the American Arbitration Association and the fees of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Record No. 940162 - Reversed in part and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9T\">\n<em>Record No. 940166 - Affirmed in part and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\"> The Trustees did not allege that they had obtained a circuit court order, pursuant to Code \u00a7 57-15, authorizing the encumbrance and improvement of the land. Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the Trustees stipulated in the trial court and on brief in this appeal that the construction contract was valid and enforceable and \u201cis binding between the Church and [Taylor].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> In <em>McMullin v. Union Land &amp; Management Co., </em>242 Va. 337, 410 S.E.2d 636 (1991), we considered the scope of an arbitration clause contained in a partnership agreement and held that the clause was broad enough to cover a partner\u2019s claim for services. The issue in dispute was whether the claim conformed to a provision in the agreement stating that partners would be compensated for their services to the partnership only if the partners contracted for such compensation. We concluded that, \u201c[b]ecause the litigants must refer to that provision in resolving this controversy,\u201d the dispute fell within the language of the arbitration clause covering any claim \u201crelating to this Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341-42, 410 S.E.2d at 639. The present case is distinguishable from <em>McMullin </em>because here there was no claim \u201crelating to the Contract Documents\u201d which the arbitrator was authorized to resolve. Once the arbitrator had decided that the June 1990 change order was invalid and thus was not among the \u201cContract Documents,\u201d and the trial court had confirmed this decision, neither the parties nor the arbitrator had any contract provisions to which they could refer in resolving Taylor\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
