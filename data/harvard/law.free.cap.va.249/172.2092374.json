The amended motion sought damages for wrongful death allegedly resulting from the failure of a psychiatrist and a psychiatric hospital to warn a victim of the release from the hospital of a former boyfriend who had threatened to kill her. Finding that the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrers, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Because the case was decided on demurrer, \u201cwe will consider the allegations pursuant to the settled rule that a demurrer admits the truth of all well-pleaded material facts. All reasonable factual inferences fairly and justly drawn from the facts alleged must be considered in aid of the pleading.\u201d <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Custis, </em>236 Va. 69, 71, 372 S.E.2d 373, 374 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">As alleged in the amended motion for judgment, the deceased, Angela Nasser Lemon, had been involved in a relationship with George Edwards, but she rejected him and attempted to terminate their relationship. Edwards had a history of committing violent acts against women who rejected him. On December 5, 1990, Edwards held a gun to Lemon\u2019s head and threatened to kill her. She obtained a warrant for his arrest, and, fearing for her safety, left her Virginia Beach home in an effort to conceal her whereabouts from Edwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Shortly after the December 5 incident, Edwards consulted Charles E. Parker, M.D., a licensed psychiatrist who had been treating Edwards for mental problems over a period of seventeen years. Dr. Parker was aware of Edwards\u2019 history of violence toward women who rejected him and also was aware that Edwards recently had threatened Lemon. The doctor concluded that Edwards\u2019 mental condition was deteriorating and that Edwards needed prolonged intensive therapy in a mental hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On or about December 10, 1990, Edwards was admitted \u201con a voluntary basis\u201d to Peninsula Psychiatric Hospital in Hampton (the hospital). Dr. Parker visited Edwards in the hospital and observed that the patient had not been placed in a secure section.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Learning that Dr. Parker knew about Edwards\u2019 actions and his condition and that the doctor had arranged for Edwards to be hospitalized for a prolonged period, Lemon returned to her home. The day after his admission, Edwards left the hospital. Neither Dr. Parker nor the hospital notified Lemon of Edwards\u2019 departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Edwards visited Dr. Parker on December 13 or 14, 1990. The doctor prescribed medication for Edwards\u2019 mental illness. On December 17, Edwards shot and killed Lemon in her home and then killed himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Lemon was survived by an infant son. Lemon\u2019s father, Michael J. Nasser, Sr., in his capacity as administrator of Lemon\u2019s estate (the plaintiff), brought the present action seeking damages for Lemon\u2019s death against three defendants, namely, Dr. Parker and the two corporations that operated the hospital, the Hospital Corporation of America and Virginia Psychiatric Company, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">All three defendants demurred to the plaintiffs original motion for judgment. The trial court sustained the demurrers on the ground that the motion for judgment failed to allege that the defendants had \u201ctake[n] charge\u201d of Edwards within the meaning of \u00a7 319 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965). Granted leave to amend, the plaintiff filed an amended motion for judgment which alleged that Dr. Parker \u201ctook charge\u201d of Edwards \u201cby accepting [him] as his patient for the purpose of providing prolonged treatment . . ., prescribing medication . . ., and arranging for [his] admittance to [the] Hospital.\u201d The motion for judgment also alleged that the hospital \u201ctook charge\u201d of Edwards by \u201caccepting and admitting [him] as a patient for the purpose of providing continued and prolonged psychiatric treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>All three defendants demurred again. The trial court sustained the demurrers, holding that even though the amended motion for judgment alleged that the defendants \u201ctook charge\u201d of Edwards, the facts as alleged showed that \u201cneither defendant took charge of Mr. Edwards as a matter of law.\u201d The trial court\u2019s final order dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action with prejudice. We awarded the plaintiff this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the defendants were under a duty to notify Lemon of Edwards\u2019 departure from the hospital and that the defendants failed in this duty. The plaintiff acknowledges the general rule that there is \u201cno duty to control the conduct of third persons in order to prevent harm to another.\u201d <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>239 Va. 315, 318, 389 S.E.2d 902, 904 (1990). But, the plaintiff says, this Court has recognized that \u201ca duty to protect one from the wrongful acts of a third party may exist because of a \u2018special relationship\u2019 between the defendant and the third party,\u201d as provided in \u00a7 315(a) of the Restatement. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The plaintiff maintains that the \u201cspecial relation\u201d requirement of \u00a7 315(a) is met in this case by both the doctor-patient relationship that existed between Dr. Parker and Edwards and the hospital-patient relationship existing between the hospital and Edwards. The plaintiff states that although this Court has never decided the question whether \u201ca psychiatrist-patient relationship or a psychiatric hospital-patient relationship constitutes a Section 315(a) \u2018special relation,\u2019 virtually every other Court, which has considered the issue, has found that both relationships constitute such a relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The plaintiff says that <em>Tarasoff </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, </em>551 P.2d 334 (Cal. 1976), is \u201cthe most similar case to the instant case\u201d and is also \u201crecognized as the foremost authority on the duty of a mental health professional to warn a known victim of the danger presented to him or her from the professional\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>patient.\u201d In <em>Tarasoff, </em>a patient, Poddar, confided to a psychologist employed by a hospital at the University of California that he intended to kill the plaintiffs\u2019 daughter, Tatiana, who was then in Brazil. At the psychologist\u2019s request, campus police briefly detained Poddar, but released him when he appeared rational. The psychologist\u2019s superior then directed that no further action be taken to detain Poddar. No one warned the plaintiffs of Tatiana\u2019s peril, and, shortly after she returned from Brazil, Poddar went to her apartment and killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Reversing the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on demurrer, the Supreme Court of California found that the plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings established \u201cas between Poddar and defendant therapists the special relation that arises between a patient and his doctor or psychotherapist\u201d within the meaning of Restatement \u00a7 315(a). 551 P.2d at 343. The court went on to say that such a relationship \u201cmay support affirmative duties for the benefit of third persons,\u201d for example, \u201ca hospital must exercise reasonable care to control the behavior of a patient which may endanger other persons,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201c[a] doctor must . . . warn a patient if the patient\u2019s condition or medication renders certain conduct, such as driving a car, dangerous to others,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The court stated further that \u201conce a therapist . . . determine [s], or under applicable professional standards reasonably should have determined, that a patient poses a serious danger of violence to others, he bears a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect the foreseeable victim of that danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345. This duty, the court concluded, \u201crequires the therapist to warn the endangered party or those who can reasonably be expected to notify him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In other words, the <em>Tarasoff </em>court ruled that a doctor-patient relationship or a hospital-patient relationship alone is sufficient, as a matter of law, to establish a \u201cspecial relation\u201d under \u00a7 315(a), that such a relationship imposes certain duties concerning third persons whose conduct needs to be controlled, and that among these duties is the obligation of a therapist to warn an identifiable potential victim that the third person poses a threat of danger to the victim. While we think <em>Tarasoff </em>is factually distinguishable from the present case, we find the decision unpersuasive for another reason \u2014 it is at odds with this Court\u2019s interpretation of the Restatement\u2019s provisions relating to one\u2019s duty to control the conduct of a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>In determining whether one has a duty concerning the conduct of a third person, we have considered Restatement \u00a7\u00a7 315(a) and 319 together, as we think they are intended to be considered. Indeed, Comment c to \u00a7 315 states that \u201c[t]he relations between the actor and a third person which require the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct are stated in \u00a7\u00a7 316-319.\u201d Sections 316, 317, and 318 are inapplicable here. Section 319 is applicable, and it provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Our decision in <em>Fox, </em>236 Va. 69, 372 S.E.2d 373, emphasizes the interactive effect \u00a7\u00a7 315(a) and 319 have upon one another and highlights the important part the \u201ctakes charge\u201d language of \u00a7 319 plays in determining whether a special relationship exists under \u00a7 315(a). <em>Fox </em>involved the criminal conduct of Morris Odell Mason, a parolee, who burned down the dwelling house of one plaintiff; abducted, beat, raped, and set fire to a second plaintiff; and shot, stabbed, and otherwise attacked a third plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">In separate motions for judgment sounding in negligence, the three plaintiffs sought damages from the parole officers responsible for Mason\u2019s supervision. The trial court sustained demurrers to the three motions for judgment. The plaintiffs appealed, and we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">We said that \u201cthe threshold question in [the] case [was] whether a duty of care existed on the part of these defendants to these plaintiffs.\u201d 236 Va. at 74, 372 S.E.2d at 375. Then, after quoting \u00a7\u00a7 315(a) and 319, we said that the question became whether \u201ca \u00a7 315(a) special relationship existed between defendants and Mason, <em>that is, whether the defendants took charge of or exercised control over him.\u201d </em>236 Va. at 75, 372 S.E.2d at 376 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Noting that, according to statute, a parole officer must \u201c \u2018[supervise and assist all persons within his territory released on parole,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>we stated that \u201cto \u2018supervise and assist\u2019. . . does not mean to assert custody in the sense that the parolee is in the personal care and control of the officer,\u201d <em>id. </em>Accordingly, we held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>that \u201cthe defendants did not take charge of or exercise control over Mason within the meaning of accepted rules of tort law articulated in Restatement \u00a7\u00a7 315(a) and 319\u201d and, \u201c[h]ence, no special relationship existed between defendants and Mason which imposed a duty upon them to control his conduct to prevent him from causing harm to persons or property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75-76, 372 S.E.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Offender Aid and Restoration, Inc., </em>241 Va. 270, 401 S.E.2d 878 (1991), also highlights the importance of the \u201ctakes charge\u201d language of Restatement \u00a7 319 in determining whether a duty exists under \u00a7\u00a7 315(a) and 319 to control the conduct of a third person. There, Offender Aid and Restoration of Richmond, Inc. (OAR), had a contract with the Department of Corrections to receive prisoners who met certain criteria. Although he did not meet the criteria, Timothy Wilson Spencer, a felon who was serving a penitentiary term and had been denied parole, was received by OAR and placed in a halfway house. OAR failed to enforce security measures required by its contract with the Department of Corrections. On the evening in question, during an unauthorized absence, Spencer broke open a window of an apartment and raped and murdered a young woman. Her administrator brought an action against OAR for its alleged negligence. OAR demurred. Relying upon <em>Fox, supra, </em>the trial court sustained the demurrer, the plaintiffs appealed, and we reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We said <em>Dudley </em>differed from <em>Fox. </em>Pointing out that, when received by OAR, Spencer was in the custody of the Department of Corrections, we said that \u201c[ajnyone assuming that custody from the Department necessarily became \u2018[o]ne who takes charge\u2019 of Spencer within the meaning of Restatement \u00a7 319.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 401 S.E.2d at 881. Furthermore, we stated, the \u201ccustodial duties of OAR far surpassed those of a parole officer and met the criterion of Restatement \u00a7 319 for \u2018one who takes charge\u2019 of its inmates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 401 S.E.2d at 882. Finally, we said that \u201ca person \u2018likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled,\u2019 in the language of Restatement \u00a7 319, is a potential threat to all who come within his reach,\u201d and, \u201c[i]n those circumstances, \u2018[o]ne who takes charge\u2019 of such a dangerous person incurs a \u00a7 319 duty to an entire class of prospective victims ... to control his dangerous charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 401 S.E.2d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">It is a settled rule of decision in this Court, therefore, that, in order to establish a \u201cspecial relation\u201d under Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u00a7 315(a) and overcome a demurrer in this type of case, a plaintiff must allege facts which, if proven, would show that the defendant had \u201ctake[n] charge\u201d of a third person within the meaning of \u00a7 319. As noted previously, this view is completely at odds with the holding in <em>Tarasoff. </em>Indeed, the <em>Tarasoff </em>opinion does not mention Restatement \u00a7 319 or the section\u2019s requirement that one must take charge of a third person to trigger a duty to control the third person\u2019s conduct. <em>See </em>Peter F. Lake, <em>Revisiting Tarasoff, </em>58 Alb. L. Rev. 97, 130 (1994) (characterizing <em>Tarasoff </em>as unpersuasive for failure to reference Restatement \u00a7 319).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Accordingly, we disagree with the holding of <em>Tarasoff </em>that a doctor-patient relationship or a hospital-patient relationship alone is sufficient, as a matter of law, to establish a \u201cspecial relation\u201d under Restatement \u00a7 315(a). Within the context of the Restatement, there is nothing special about the ordinary doctor-patient relationship or hospital-patient relationship. We think there must be added to those ordinary relationships the factor, required by \u00a7 319, of taking charge of the patient, meaning that the doctor or hospital must be vested with a higher degree of control over the patient than exists in an ordinary doctor-patient or hospital-patient relationship before a duty arises concerning the patient\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The plaintiff argues, however, that while a higher degree of control might be appropriate when an effort is made to impose upon a doctor or hospital a duty to confine the third person, such degree of control is inappropriate \u201cwhen the sole question is whether there existed a duty to warn a known potential victim of the danger [posed] by the at large patient.\u201d In the latter situation, the plaintiff opines, \u201cthe necessary amount of control is minimal,\u201d and he requests that we apply the minimal degree standard in this case and reverse and vacate the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrers.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Considering that \u201cminimal\u201d means \u201cthe least possible in . . . degree,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1438 (1986), we deny the plaintiffs request. To grant the request would be to render all but meaningless the \u201ctakes charge\u201d language of Restatement \u00a7 319. That language imports much more than a minimal degree of control, conveying, instead, the notion, as pertinent in the health care context and applicable to both a duty to confine and a duty to warn, that to take charge of a patient means, paraphrasing <em>Fox, </em>to \u201cassert custody in the sense that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>[patient] is in the personal care and control of the [doctor or hospital].\u201d <em>Fox, </em>236 Va. at 75, 372 S.E.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Adverting to the allegations of the plaintiffs amended motion for judgment, including the avowal that Edwards entered the hospital \u201con a voluntary basis,\u201d we do not think Dr. Parker took charge of Edwards within the meaning of Restatement \u00a7 319 by \u201caccepting [him] as his patient for the purpose of providing prolonged treatment . . ., prescribing medication . . ., and arranging for [his] admittance to [the] Hospital.\u201d Nor do we think the hospital took charge of Edwards by \u201caccepting and admitting [him] as a patient for the purpose of providing continued and prolonged psychiatric treatment.\u201d The trial court did not err, therefore, in sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrers and dismissing the plaintiffs action.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
