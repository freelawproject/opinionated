Woodward, a convicted felon and an inmate in a State Correctional Unit in Clarke County operated by the Virginia Department of Corrections, sustained a work-related injury in September 1990 in Warren County. The injury occurred while the convict was trimming a tree beside a secondary highway as part of a ten-man \u201cgun gang,\u201d pursuant to an agreement between the Department of Corrections and the Virginia Department of Transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">Subsequently, the convict applied to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for benefits under the Act, alleging he suffered a compensable injury. Following a hearing, a deputy commissioner decided that the claimant was entitled to benefits as an \u201cem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ployee\u201d of the Commonwealth. Upon review, the full Commission held that the claimant was not an employee of the Commonwealth when he was injured. Thus, the Commission reversed and vacated the deputy\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The claimant appealed, and a panel of the Court of Appeals ruled that claimant was an employee of the Commonwealth at the time of the injury, reversed the Commission, and remanded the case. <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 526, 438 S.E.2d <em>777 </em>(1993). We accepted jurisdiction and awarded the Commonwealth this appeal because the decision of the Court of Appeals involves a matter of significant precedential value. Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">At the outset, we will dispose of a procedural issue. The Attorney General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, has attached a 44-page \u201cAddendum\u201d to the appellant\u2019s opening brief. This addendum contains Department of Corrections\u2019 rules on the subjects of \u201cGood Conduct Allowance,\u201d \u201cInstitutional Classification Management,\u201d and \u201cInmate Discipline.\u201d None of these documents was submitted in any of the proceedings below. Granting the claimant\u2019s motion to strike the addendum, we will disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Equating the rules set forth in the addendum to the \u201claw of this Commonwealth\u201d and relying on Code \u00a7 8.01-386 (in any civil action, court shall take judicial notice of the law), the Attorney General argues that we must take notice of the rules. We do not agree. Even assuming the rules have the force of law, an issue we do not decide, an appellate court may not take judicial notice of such documents when they were not relied upon before the court or commission below. <em>See Stevens </em>v. <em>Mirakian, 177 </em>Va. 123, 129, 12 S.E.2d 780, 782 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The relevant facts are undisputed. At the time of his injury, the claimant was incarcerated for a 1989 felony conviction and was in custody of the Department of Corrections, assigned to a correctional unit. Prior to incarceration, the claimant worked as a tree trimmer. He was given other duties while a prisoner, but asked to be assigned to a \u201cgun gang\u201d that worked on state roads. The Department of Corrections granted this request, pursuant to its program to give prisoners the opportunity to request the kind of work suitable to their skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">When injured, claimant was not on a work release program under Code \u00a7 53.1-60; he was working pursuant to a statutorily authorized arrangement between the Department of Corrections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>and the Department of Transportation. Code \u00a7 53.1-56 provides that persons in the custody of the Department of Corrections shall, so far as practicable, be employed in the construction and maintenance of the State\u2019s system of highways. The statute also provides that the transportation department may make requisition upon the corrections department for the number of prisoners necessary to perform road construction and maintenance. When a road crew was assembled at a work site, a representative of the Department of Transportation supervised the work and an armed correctional officer was in charge of security.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Code \u00a7 53.1-57 provides that the transportation department shall pay monthly to the corrections department an amount agreed upon by the two agencies for the hours prisoners are so employed. At the time of this incident, the rate of payment was $2.00 per hour for each person in the road gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Code \u00a7 53.1-43 authorizes the establishment of a system of pay incentives for prisoners. Pursuant to an Inmate Pay System adopted by the Department of Corrections, prisoners working on road crews were paid individually a token sum for work performed, which sum was credited to the inmate\u2019s personal account at the correctional facility. The claimant was paid at the rate of 27 cents per hour. The record shows that the \u201cgoing rate\u201d for tree trimmers in the private sector ranged from $10.50 to $14.00 per hour. At the time of the accident, inmates from the correctional facility were being used to do the work in lieu of private contractors retained by the Department of Transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The Court of Appeals ruled the claimant \u201cworked pursuant to an agreement that contained all of the elements of a contract.\u201d <em>Woodward, </em>17 Va. App. at 529, 438 S.E.2d at 779. The court said the two state agencies \u201cunequivocally offered\u201d the claimant \u201ca paid position trimming trees;\u201d he \u201cverbally accepted the offer;\u201d the agencies \u201cacknowledged his acceptance by putting him to work on a road gang;\u201d and there was \u201csufficient consideration\u201d because if he \u201cchose to work, he was paid 27 cents an hour\u201d but if \u201che did not work, he was not paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that because prisoners in Virginia \u201care not legally incompetent to enter into contracts,\u201d citing <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>216 Va. 234, 239, 217 S.E.2d 849, 854 (1975), and because the inmate\u2019s \u201ccontractual employment is not specifically excluded\u201d under the Act, the claimant is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Woodward, </em>17 Va. App. at 531, 533, 438 S.E.2d at 780, 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>On appeal, urging affirmance of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, the claimant argues that, although a prisoner, he \u201ccould contract to perform services with an agency of the Commonwealth and was thus entitled to be covered\u201d by the Act. He contends the Court of Appeals correctly found that he worked pursuant to an agreement containing all the elements of a contract, an offer and an acceptance supported by valid consideration. He argues that once he voluntarily agreed to work during incarceration, he was under the \u201ccontrol\u201d of state employees and was paid for his services, thus becoming an \u201cemployee\u201d in every sense of the word. We do not agree with the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">A claimant must be an \u201cemployee\u201d to be eligible for compensation under the Act. Former Code \u00a7 65.1-4 (now \u00a7 65.2-101), in effect at the time of claimant\u2019s injury, defined \u201cemployee\u201d under the Act to include \u201cevery person ... in the service of another under any contract of hire . . . , written or implied, except one whose employment is not in the usual course of the trade, business, occupation or profession of the employer.\u201d The pivotal question then becomes whether prisoners in Virginia, who are not on a work release program, are capable of making a true contract of hire with the Commonwealth or any of its agencies. We answer that query in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Generally, convicts and prisoners not on work release have been denied compensation for injuries sustained while performing inmate labor under the supervision and control of correctional authorities. \u201cThe reason given is that such a convict cannot and does not make a true contract of hire with the authorities by whom he is confined. The inducements which might be held out to him, in the form of extra food or even money, are in no sense consideration for an enforceable contract of hire.\u201d 1B Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 47.31(a) (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">We adopt this reasoning and agree with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission that this claimant, as a prisoner in Virginia\u2019s corrections system, \u201cwas a ward of the state under control of the Department of Corrections at the time of his injury. As a prisoner under sentence, he was not at liberty to contract unilaterally for personal services with either the Department of Corrections or the Department of Transportation. As a prisoner, he was given limited opportunity within the rules and confines of the correctional system to request particular work and to earn a limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sum dependent upon specific assignment by the Department of Corrections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">As the Commission pointed out, the Department of Corrections is in the business of providing housing and furnishing correctional and rehabilitative services to criminals. When the Department, as authorized by statute, makes an agreement with another state agency and assigns an inmate to specific work, the Department acts within its statutory correctional responsibilities and does not act as an employer of the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Accordingly, we hold that because the claimant was not a person in the service of another under a true contract of hire at the time of his injury, he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d of the Commonwealth, or either of its agencies, within the meaning of former \u00a7 65.1-4 of the Act. Hence, he is not entitled to benefits under the Act, and the Court of Appeals erred in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Consequently, the judgment below will be reversed and the claimant\u2019s application for benefits will be dismissed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"><em> </em>In 1993, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 53.1-32.1.
