BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">Willie Mae Byrd was the plaintiff in a third party action for the wrongful death of her husband, Lawrence Byrd, arising under the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>and general maritime law. Mr. Byrd was killed when 3,000 pounds of cardboard cartons fell from the hold of a ship owned by the defendant, Heinrich Schmidt Reederei, and crushed his chest. At trial, the District Court denied Byrd\u2019s motion for directed verdict on the issue of contributory negligence, and also prohibited her from introducing testimony on inflation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict for $125,000, but found Mr. Byrd 50% contributorily negligent and reduced the award to $62,500. A panel of this Court, 638 F.2d 1300,.reversed the District Court\u2019s denial of a motion for directed verdict and ordered the trial court to enter judgment for Byrd in the full amount of the damages assessed. The trial court also rejected the issue of whether future inflation may be considered by the jury when assessing an award of future damages on the basis of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. Penrod Drilling Co., </em>510 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1975) (en banc). In an opinion issued concurrently with the present opinion, <em>Culver v. Slater, </em>688 F.2d 280 (5th Cir. 1982), this Court held that, under certain guidelines, evidence of wage increases due to inflationary trends may be introduced at trials in this Circuit. Therefore, we remand this case for a new trial on Byrd\u2019s damages, in accordance with the principles of <em>Culver, </em>unreduced by any percentage for the contributory negligence of Mr. Byrd.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">Several arguments raised by the defendant in this case merit discussion. The defendant argues that this Court may not properly reach the inflation issue because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Byrd did not introduce or proffer evidence upon which inflation could be considered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given that Byrd was prohibited at trial from introducing testimony upon future inflationary trends, and in light of the instruction that the jury was not to consider inflation in determining future damages, both limitations created by <em>Penrod, </em>we need not closely examine either the probative weight of the evidence presented on inflation or the subsequent absence of a detailed recitation of reasons underlying Byrd\u2019s objection to the jury instructions. <em>See </em>F.R. Civ.P. 51. In cross-examining the defendant\u2019s investment expert, Byrd attempted to ask questions about the effect of inflation rates on the bond market. The District Court, on the basis of <em>Penrod, </em>sustained the objections to that line of questioning. At that time, counsel for Byrd tried, to no avail, either to distinguish <em>Penrod </em>or to explain that doubts have arisen in the Circuit with regard to evidence on inflation. The court granted a recess, and the following discussion took place between counsel for Byrd and the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">THE COURT: .. . What you started . . . to pursue was the effect of inflation on the market generally. And at that point I sustained the objection, and would \u2014 and would and do sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">COUNSEL: Alright, sir. Your Honor, I wish to proffer for the record some information . . . because to, in effect, require this person to reduce their investment for the future but not let them take into consideration the increase in value, the loss of the borrowing, the loss of the purchasing power of the dollar, is in effect to give a double reduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">The reason this money \u2014 the reason that a person pays these dollars for a thousand dollar bond has to do with inflation. And to let that go in to reduce this person\u2019s recovery because they believe they will be able to get this amount of money in the future, in effect, causes a double reduction. Because at the end of 2007 that one thousand dollars she gets back will be worth five hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT: But hasn\u2019t that been laid to rest in <em>Penrod?}</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfC\">THE COURT: I understand \u2014 and he does, too \u2014 in the en banc decision of the Fifth Circuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">* * * <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">COUNSEL: Well, let me proffer in the presence of the witness and ask if this is correct before the jury physically comes in the door. I believe that may be sufficient, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">I believe the witness has told me that the current U.S. Government estimated rate of inflation is six and a half to seven percent for the coming year, that his company\u2019s estimated rate of inflation is seven and a half percent; that the lowest rate he, himself, has ever heard of in the past is between three and a half or four percent.. . . and that in his opinion, based upon reading and other knowledge in the field, he believes the best that people can hope for in the future is a five percent rate of inflation.... We would proffer all that in evidence as indicating the minimum amount of rate of inflation that the plaintiffs should be entitled to, regardless, and we would take three and a half percent if that were proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYs\">THE COURT: Well, the proffer is in the record. It\u2019s not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">Reading the trial transcript, we are convinced that counsel for Byrd was attempting to create a record to challenge or at least find an exception to <em>Penrod. </em>Byrd\u2019s later objection to the instruction that the jury should not employ an estimated rate of inflation to increase damages must be viewed in the context of Penrod\u2019s shackles. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>While it is true that counsel for Byrd did not offer a lengthy explanation for his objection to the instruction, we find that the matter was sufficiently presented to the judge at trial and that all parties understood the dilemma \u2014 Byrd wanted the jury to consider inflation, and <em>Penrod </em>stood in the way. <em>See Culver, supra. </em>In short, we find that Byrd\u2019s objection to the jury charge is properly before this Court under F.R.Civ.P. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-18\">. This case was consolidated and argued with <em>Culver v. Slater Boat Co., </em>688 F.2d 280 (5th Cir. 1982), and the present opinion was issued concurrently with that in <em>Culver.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">. A question is also raised whether evidence of sufficient probative value was presented for the jury on the issue of inflation. Moreover, the defendant argues that Byrd neither requested any instruction on inflation nor explained in detail her objection to the Court\u2019s charge which stated that the jury could not use estimated rates of inflation to increase future earnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b419-6\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AmEG\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Although I agree with the majority that the time has now arrived for reconsideration of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Penrod Drilling Company, </em>510 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1975), I write separately to make clear that the majority opinion should be read as doing nothing more than overruling <em>Penrod\u2019s </em>flat proscription of competent, otherwise admissible evidence on inflation. Henceforth, the Federal Rules of Evidence alone will govern the admissibility of such evidence, and render appropriate a jury instruction on inflation commensurate with the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Appellees are justified in pointing out that neither the Pre-trial Stipulation, Record, vol. 1, at 13, nor the Pre-trial Order, Record, vol. 1, at 14, gives any indication that the plaintiffs sought to raise the inflation issue at trial. Indeed, plaintiffs rested their case without an offer of proof on inflation, which clearly would have been the most appropriate way to preserve the <em>Pen-rod </em>question for appeal. Although appellants did not do all that they should have done to preserve the inflation issue, their proffer was sufficient to satisfy the Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(2). The proffer made during the cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s investment expert, Gerald Powers, was probably sufficient to establish a groundwork for appeal, although it should not be considered as a guide for the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">On cross-examination, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked Powers: \u201cAre you familiar with the general rates of inflation as predicted by the Federal Government?\u201d Record, vol. 7, at 172. The court sustained the defendant\u2019s general objection. After an extended colloquy on whether the defendant had \u201copened the door\u201d to inflation questions on cross-examination by putting the issue before the jury on direct, the court ruled that he had not, and then sustained the objection to further inflation inquiry on <em>Penrod </em>grounds. It should be emphasized that <em>at no time </em>did the defendant make a specific objection to the line of questioning, or the subsequent proffer, as improper because they were beyond the scope of the direct examination. Contrary to the claim in the Supplemental Brief of Defendant on Rehearing En Banc at 7, the record shows that counsel\u2019s argumentation went exclusively to whether defendant had opened the door to questioning otherwise clearly barred by the <em>Penrod </em>rule of exclusion. Similarly, the record demonstrates that the court excluded such evidence solely on <em>Penrod </em>grounds, without any consideration of the potential objection that plaintiffs had rested their case and could not now delve into these matters. Record, vol. 7, at 172, 179, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">At that point, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made a speaking proffer, in the presence of the witness, as to the rationale for including inflation in a damages award and various estimated rates of inflation. <em>See </em>Record, vol. 7, at 179-80, 182-83; Majority Opinion at 326. Defendant did not object contemporaneously to the adequacy of the proffer and did not challenge the qualifications of the expert to give this testimony. Nor did he seek re-direct examination on this offer of proof or offer any rebuttal of the witness\u2019 \u201ctestimony\u201d or its probative value. Thus, all these potential objections to plaintiffs\u2019 offer of proof must be considered to have been waived. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Evid. 103(a)(2). We agree, therefore, with the majority that counsel for plaintiffs did succeed in creating a record to \u201cchallenge or at least find an exception to <em>Penrod,\u201d </em>Majority Opinion at 326, although their effort to do so was tardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">I emphasize the limited nature of the court\u2019s holding today: evidence concerning the impact of inflation on recoveries of lost future wages will be admitted insofar as it conforms to the Federal Rules of Evidence, and a jury instruction on inflation will be appropriate if a predicate of competent, relevant and otherwise admissible evidence has been established. As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has written, \u201c[W]e allow the trier of fact in awarding damages to take into account only such estimates of future changes in the purchasing power of money as are based on sound and substantiated economic evidence, and as can be postulated with some reliability.\u201d <em>United States v. English, </em>521 F.2d 63, 75-76 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Specifically, the trial court should ensure that the expert testimony concerning inflation meets the requirement of Fed.R.Evid. 702:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">If scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZq\">Once rule 702 has been satisfied, the trial court should also exercise sound discretion to ensure compliance with Fed.R.Evid. 403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4j\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">This rule is particularly important with a complex issue such as inflation, where confusing expert testimony might well hinder rather than assist the trier of fact. The application of these evidentiary filters is critical if today\u2019s holding is to enhance the accuracy of damages awards in this circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b420-8\">JAMES C.
