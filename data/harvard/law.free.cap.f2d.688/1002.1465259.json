On Monday, August 17, 1981, plaintiffs filed the complaint initiating this case, seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by defendant\u2019s negligent operation of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-23\">Defendant answered, claiming that the action was barred by the six year statute of limitations. Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-49 (1972). The district court granted a motion to dismiss for that reason. This appeal presents only the question whether a claim filed on Monday when the statute of limitations expires on Sunday is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>Neither party has cited us a case bearing directly on this question, and we have discovered none. Thus, the ease presents an important question unresolved by Mississippi jurisprudence and appropriate for certification under the procedure authorized by Mississippi Supreme Court Rule 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">CERTIFICATE FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSISSIPPI AND THE HONORABLE JUSTICES THEREOF:</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">It appears to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that this case involves questions of Mississippi law that are determinative of the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to maintain this suit. There appear to be no controlling precedents in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Mississippi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court, therefore, certifies the following question of law to the Supreme Court of Mississippi for decision pursuant to Rule 46.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-7\">When the last day of the'six year statute of limitations for filing a personal injury action falls on a Sunday, is an action filed on the next day, Monday, timely?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The record in this case, together with copies of the parties\u2019 briefs, including the briefs submitted in response to our inquiry concerning certification, are transmitted herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\">QUESTION CERTIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">. Each party insists that Mississippi law provides a clear answer, but each finds the answer to be different.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">. The particular phrasing used in the certified question is, of course, not to restrict the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the issues as that Court perceives them in its analysis of the certified record. <em>Martinez v. Rodriguez, </em>394 F.2d 156, 159 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
