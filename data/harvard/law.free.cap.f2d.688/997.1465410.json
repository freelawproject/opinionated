RUBIN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1090-17\">For almost four years, an employer, Bell Helicopter Textron (Bell), and a union, Bell Production Engineers Association (BPEA), have engaged in a dispute concerning Bell\u2019s right, under its collective bargaining agreement, to create a job classification called Tool Application Engineer (TAE). Bell considered the classification to be one not covered by its collective bargaining agreement with the union and, therefore, sought to define it without consulting the union and to fill the job with employees not in the collective bargaining unit. The union contested the decision and demanded arbitration. After one arbitration failed to resolve the controversy, a second arbitration was sought, and the arbitrator required Bell to abolish the TAE position. Bell then created what it considered a new classification within the unit. The union contended that this was not the abolition decreed by the arbitrator. Invoking federal jurisdiction under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, BPEA sought enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-18\">After a bench trial, the district court held that Bell had not complied with the award and that the new TAE classification was essentially the same as the first TAE job. Accordingly it entered judgment in favor of BPEA. In August 1981, after suit was filed, Bell and BPEA negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement. Bell submitted a package agreement including a proposal, denominated Item 13, that the TAE position would be excluded from BPEA\u2019s bargaining unit and that the duties performed in that position would not be covered by the collective bargaining agreement. The district court found that BPEA ratified Bell\u2019s package, and thus saw no need to grant prospective relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>BPEA having sustained no monetary damage, the sole relief awarded was a declaration that Bell had not complied with the arbitrator\u2019s award and attorney\u2019s fees. Once again, we decide an appeal whose sole real issue is the right to attorney\u2019s fees. Finding the trial judge\u2019s decision on the facts supported by the evidence, and his award of attorney\u2019s fees within the discretion imparted to him, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">Bell seeks dismissal on the ground that the new collective bargaining agreement recognizing the TAE position has mooted this suit. That there is no longer any controversy for the future does not render the suit moot. There was a real and substantial controversy between the parties when suit was filed, and that controversy continued until the day of judgment. It concerned whether or not, at the time suit was filed, and until the new agreement was ratified, Bell had complied with the arbitrator\u2019s award. The new collective bargaining agreement made injunctive relief unnecessary, but it did not foreclose the union\u2019s right to attorney\u2019s fees for seeking compliance with the arbitrator\u2019s award prior to signing of the agreement. The award of attorney\u2019s fees, in turn, necessitated a determination that the employer had unjustifiably refused to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s award. Bell cannot escape the consequences of its past failure to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s award by entering into an agreement for the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">While the company did adduce evidence to support its position concerning the lack of similarity between the previous TAE classification and the one later created within the bargaining unit, the record amply supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the two jobs were the same. This conclusion is binding on us unl\u00e9ss clearly erroneous, Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); <em>Pullman-Standard v. </em>Swint,-U.S.-, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1789, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). There was testimony that the new TAE jobs were filled by the same people who had served in the abolished classification, on the company\u2019s insistence, even though the jobs had been brought under the umbrella of the collective bargaining agreement. There was also testimony that the duties were substantially the same even though the job description itself was changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">Turning to what is ultimately at issue, the question of attorney\u2019s fees, the prevailing litigant under the American rule, in the absence of statutory authorization, is not ordinarily entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees from the loser. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness </em>Society, 421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1616, 44 L.Ed.2d 141, 147 (1975). Section 301 of the LMRA does not specifically provide for costs and attorney\u2019s fees in suits for enforcement of arbitration awards, but we have held that, when a challenger refuses to abide by an arbitrator\u2019s decision without justification, attorney\u2019s fees and costs may properly be awarded. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, Dist. 776 </em>v. Texas <em>Steel Co., </em>538 F.2d 1116, 1121-22 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1095, 97 S.Ct. 1110, 51 L.Ed.2d 542 (1977); <em>International Union of Dist. 50, UMW v. Bowman Transportation Co., </em>421 F.2d 934, 935 (5th Cir. 1970). The district' court concluded that the company\u2019s refusal to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s award was without justification, making judicial enforcement neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>sary, and that an award of attorney\u2019s fees would further the federal labor policy favoring voluntary arbitration. The finding that the company acted without justification is not clearly erroneous, and the award was within the discretion which we have imparted to the district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">For these reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1090-15\">. BPEA contends, however, that it ratified the package without Item 13. The union\u2019s minutes for the ratification meeting show that the membership voted to ratify the Bell package only after voting to \u201ctake [Item 13] to NLRB.\u201d BPEA communicated its ratification to Beil, but did not mention its reservations concerning Item 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-20\">On September 2, 1981, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company, which is now the subject of an NLRB complaint. Bell Helicopter Textron, Case No. 16-CA-10039. An administrative law judge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>NLRB Region 16 held a hearing on the complaint in May 1982, but has not yet filed a decision. The complaint characterizes Item 13 as a nonmandatory subject of bargaining, and charges that Bell\u2019s insistence on Item 13 as a condition of any collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unfair labor practice. The complaint further states that BPEA and Bell bargained to impasse, and that BPEA refused to accede to Bell\u2019s demand. The complaint assumes, then, that no collective bargaining agreement has been reached. Whether or not such an agreement has been made is a matter within the jurisdiction of the NLRB. For purposes of this appeal, we accept the district court\u2019s finding that the agreement was ratified. <em>General Warehousemen and Helpers Local 767 v. Standard Brands, Inc., </em>560 F.2d 700, 703-04, (5th Cir. 1977), <em>rh\u2019g en banc, </em>579 F.2d 1282, 1289 (1978), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>441 U.S. 957, 99 S.Ct. 2420, 60 L.Ed.2d 1075 and 443 U.S. 913, 99 S.Ct. 3103, 61 L.Ed.2d 877 (1979). Should the NLRB conclude that the agreement was not ratified, BPEA may request the district court to review its conclusions on the appropriateness of injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
