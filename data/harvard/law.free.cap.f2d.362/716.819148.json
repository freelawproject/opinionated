Moreover, the NLRA undertook to provide several methods for the peaceful settlement of labor disputes and the avoidance of disruptions and dislocations generated by strikes and other forms of industrial strife so harmful to our economy. See NLRA section 1, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. At the heart of the statutory scheme was the duty, now imposed upon both sides, to bargain with each other \u201cin good faith.\u201d NLRA sections 8(a) (5), 8(b) (3) and 8(d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a) (5), 158(b) (3) and 158(d). But, that bargaining duty was not restricted to the negotiation and execution of labor-management agreements; it encompassed post-contractual obligations as well, such as the good faith day-to-day administration of the grievance procedures the parties created for the settlement of their disputes. See United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior and Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960). Generally, the National Labor Relations Bo\u00e1rd (Board) and the Courts have abstained from interfering with the conduct of this dispute-resolving machinery; but, there are occasions, as in the case before us, where we are compelled, in the interest of avoiding the dissension which flows from uncertainty, to set forth guidelines or place our imprimatur on procedures sought to be utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">This case is before us on cross-petitions for review and enforcement of an order of the Board directing the Fafnir Bearing Company (Company) to permit the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, Local 133, UAW, AFL-CIO (Union) to conduct independent time studies at the Company\u2019s plant for the purpose of determining whether the Union should accept certain proposed piece rates or proceed to arbitration, the final step in the grievance procedure. The Union, which filed the underlying charge, has intervened in this proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition for review and enforce the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The factual setting which gave rise to this proceeding is, in the main, undisputed. Many of the essential facts were stipulated; and, as to other facts, we find substantial evidence to support the findings of the trial examiner and the Board. See N. L. R. B. v. Universal Camera Corp., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The Company operates a production plant in New Britain, Connecticut which manufactures ball bearings and related products. Since 1944, the Union has represented the Company\u2019s production and maintenance employees in periodic negotiations concerning wages, hours and working conditions. According to the pertinent provisions of the contract executed in February 1962, wages are paid pursuant to what is commonly termed a \u201cpiece rate system.\u201d This method of compensation is designed to provide employees with an incentive to maximize their productivity. Its basic operation is not complex. A time study is conducted by an industrial engineer to determine how many units per hour an average employee working at a normal pace can produce. This figure is called the \u201cstandard.\u201d Workers who turn out less than or as much as the standard receive a minimum wage. But, the conscientious and resourceful employee, who so desires, can increase his rate of pay by raising the level of his production. If, for example, he produces double the units specified in the applicable standard, he will receive twice as much compensation as his less ambitious colleague.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">There is, however, no demonstrably accurate method for setting \u201cstandards\u201d; and, as can be readily predicted, this area is a fertile source of disputes requiring invocation of the Company-Union grievance machinery. Indeed, considering that the Company has established over 10,000 new piece work prices each year, the number of grievances to which they gave rise was relatively modest. In 1961, there were 86 piece rate grievances; in 1962, the corresponding figure was 47; and in the first half of 1963, 33 such grievances were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">The governing agreement established only general guidelines as to how \u201cstandards\u201d were to be formulated. Section 8.4 provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that piece work prices \u201cshall be set so that the average qualified operator working under normal job conditions and applying normal incentive efforts shall be able, after a reasonable trial period, to earn <em>5% </em>above the standard earning rate of his labor grade (as indicated in the schedule initialled by the parties).\u201d Subsection 8(a) (4) authorized a piece rate revision only when \u201cthere has been a measurable change or accumulation of changes over a period of time in material, method or processes not previously taken into account in setting the price * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">On various dates prior to February 1963, the Union filed grievances<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that certain piece work prices were improperly established by the Company and did not conform to Section 8.4 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>governing agreement. After unsuccessfully utilizing the first two steps of the Company-Union grievance machinery, key representatives of the Company and the Union met on February 7, 1963, at the third stage of the grievance procedure. At this meeting, the Union requested all time study data which the Company had utilized in setting the piece rates which had prompted the grievances and the Company furnished all the relevant information in its possession. Kermit K. Mead, Director of the Time Study and Industrial Engineering Department of the Union\u2019s parent International, the United Automobile Workers, examined this material during a recess, and upon reconvening, proceeded to question Company representatives about the data supplied. Dissatisfied with the responses, particularly because the Company could not account for a 5% \u201cadjustment factor,\u201d Mead requested permission to conduct his own time study of the operations involved so that he could verify the Company\u2019s proposed rates and intelligently advise the Union whether to accept them or invoke arbitration \u2014 the fourth and final step of the grievance machinery. The Company refused this request on three principal grounds: (1) such study was unnecessary for the Union to determine whether to seek arbitration; (2) the governing agreement did not authorize the Union to conduct independent time studies, and (3) in any event, the Union\u2019s rights were adequately protected because the arbitrator would conduct his own studies as he had in the past.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">When the Union filed the underlying charge with the Board, a complaint issued alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Company had refused to bargain in good faith as required by section 8(a) (5) of the Act. Thereafter, a full hearing was held before a trial examiner who found as a fact that Mead was unable to determine \u201cfrom the data set forth in the Company\u2019s studies whether the piecework rates were established in accordance with the contract, and, therefore, was unable to advise the Union whether to request arbitration.\u201d Despite this finding, the examiner believed he was constrained to recommend that the complaint against the Company be dismissed because, <em>inter alia, </em>he was \u201cunable to find any present compelling authority * * * which sanctions the view that a union is entitled to make its own independent time studies after it has received the employer\u2019s time study records.\u201d The Board<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> endorsed its examiner\u2019s findings of fact<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but rejected his conclusion. In a determination attacked here by the Company, the Board held that sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (5) were violated when the Company refused to grant the Union access to its plant for the purpose of conducting an independent time study of the disputed operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">A threshold question must be determined by us. Contending that principles of <em>stare decisis </em>should control the outcome of this proceeding, the Company maintains that the decision of the Board is directly contrary to this Court\u2019s holding in N. L. R. B. v. Otis Elevator Co., 208 F.2d 176 (2d Cir. 1953). While it is true that in <em>Otis, </em>a per curiam opinion (Judge Clark vigorously dissenting), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>declined to enforce that portion of the Board\u2019s order directing a company to permit a union to conduct an independent time study which the union sought for the purpose of assessing the accuracy of proposed piece work prices, we believe <em>Otis </em>is distinguishable in at least two vital respects. First, the company in <em>Otis </em>not only refused to permit the union to make a \u201clive\u201d study, but, rejected outright the union\u2019s request for whatever data the company had in its possession.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Otis </em>reached this Court on a sparse record. Neither the trial examiner nor the Board had been afforded an opportunity to analyze the Company\u2019s time study material. Consequently, no determination had been made as to whether this data alone would have been sufficient for the union to make an informed judgment to accept the company\u2019s proposed rates or seek arbitration. Second, and even more significant, this Court in <em>Otis, </em>on the relatively skimpy record before it, concluded that whatever additional information the union sought could have been obtained merely by interviewing its members. In view of this circumstance, the Court determined that no \u201cinvasion of respondent\u2019s plant\u201d was necessary. 208 F.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Seizing upon this language, the Company urges that in the instant case, the Union had alternative sources for the information it sought and therefore did not really require independent time studies. But, there was ample evidence before the trial examiner and the Board to justify the rejection of this contention out of hand. Mead testified in detail as to the absolute need for a \u201clive\u201d time study stating that without it the Union could not make an informed judgment on the Company\u2019s proposed rates. The testimony of Mead and Bertram Gottlieb, Staff Industrial Engineer of the AFL-CIO, also gave the trial examiner a full view of how time studies were generally made: Piece work prices were established by a ratesetter (usually an industrial engineer) on the basis of a combination of subjective and objective factors. Preliminarily, the ratesetter examined the place where the work was performed and noted environmental factors such as heat, light and other conditions which might have a bearing on productivity. He then reduced the particular job under study into its component parts, designated \u201ccyclic\u201d and \u201cnon-cyclic\u201d elements. Cyclic elements were those performed in the production of every unit; non-cyclic elements comprised factors such as going to the lavatory, consulting with the foreman or getting stock from a storage area. Next, the ratesetter observed several operators performing their jobs and made a record of the \u201cactual performance of the job in terms of the motion pattern used.\u201d If the ratesetter believed that a particular employee under examination was above or below average pace, he would \u201cnormalize\u201d the performance by adjusting the actual timing of the job upward or downward. He then added an allowance, based upon his personal observation and judgment, for \u201cpersonal fatigue and delay,\u201d and other elements of the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Mead testified, as we have indicated, that he could not assess the accuracy of the Company\u2019s studies without making his own investigations. As illustrative, he noted that with respect to one of the piece rates which was the subject of a grievance the Company had employed a normalizing factor of 90%. But, without conducting his own study, Mead had no way of determining whether this adjustment was appropriate. The record is replete with numerous similar examples. Based upon all the testimony with respect to the need for \u201clive\u201d studies, we believe that unlike <em>Otis, </em>there was substantial evidence in this record to support the Board\u2019s finding that Union-conducted \u201clive\u201d studies provided the only means for full assessment and verification of the Company\u2019s proposed rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">The Company argues, in the alternative, that section 8(a) (5) does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>not encompass refusals to admit Union representatives to plant facilities for the purpose of conducting \u201clive\u201d studies. The Company points out that it has already turned over to the Union all of its time study data and suggests that by so doing it has fulfilled its obligation to bargain in good faith. This contention presents the most troublesome issue for our decision. An employer\u2019s duty to provide relevant information to union representatives so that they can effectively bargain on behalf of their members has been established beyond question. See N. L. R. B. v. Truitt Mfg. Co., 351 U.S. 149, 76 S.Ct. 753, 100 L.Ed. 1027 (1956); N. L. R. B. v. Whitin Mach. Works, 217 F.2d 593 (4th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 905, 75 S.Ct. 583, 99 L.Ed. 1242 (1955); N. L. R. B. v. New Britain Mach. Co., 210 F.2d 61 (2d Cir. 1954); N. L. R. B. v. Jacobs Mfg. Co., 196 F.2d 680 (2d Cir. 1952); N. L. R. B. v. Yawman &amp; Erbe Mfg. Co., 187 F.2d 947 (2d Cir. 1951). And, it is true that by turning over its own time study data, the Company believed it had complied with all that was required of it under the Act. The issue confronting us, however, is whether in the circumstances presented here, the Company in fact was required to take that next step and grant permission to the Union to make a live study so that it could reliably evaluate the Company\u2019s data. While it is true that the material the Union sought, because of its subjective nature, was not in the Company\u2019s filing cabinets, it was nevertheless within the Company\u2019s exclusive control, cf., N. L. R. B. v. Item Co., 220 F.2d 956 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 836, 76 S.Ct. 73, 100 L.Ed. 746 (1955). Consequently, on the evidence and findings presented in this proceeding, we believe the Board, exercising its expertise and special competence, could properly determine that the Union\u2019s need to conduct these tests outweighed the Company\u2019s interests in closing its doors to outsiders. Cf. Republic Aviation Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945). Of course, we are not to be understood as saying that if the Company had established that Union-conducted studies would have severely disrupted production, see Note, 17 Stan.L.Rev. 507 (1965), we would not have a significantly different case; but, we shall defer judgment on such a situation until another day. Here, however, the major inconvenience which the Company asserted was that some of its employees might have been distracted' when Union studies were being conducted. But, in the context of this case we find little merit in this contention. The workers were, after all, on a piece rate system and, except for a fixed minimum, were paid on the basis of what they produced. Moreover, a time study to be accurate must be conducted under normal conditions and thus to a certain extent is its own guarantor of minimal interference with production or discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">It is also urged that since the arbitrator was authorized to conduct his own studies, what the Union sought here was merely duplication of effort; thus, the Company\u2019s restrictive view of Section 8(a) (5) should prevail. But, this argument misses the mark. The reason the Union desired to make \u201clive\u201d tests was not to usurp the function of the arbitrator and thereby interfere with standard grievance procedures; it was needed, instead, to determine whether to take the grievances to arbitration in the first place.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By preventing the Union from conducting these studies, the Company was, in essence, requiring it to play a game of blind man\u2019s bluff. Only by guess-work could the Union determine which piece rates to protest and which to accept. Of course, the Union always had the option of demanding that <em>all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>grievances on proposed piece work prices be reviewed by the arbitrator; but that alternative obviously would be impractical, expensive and indeed strife-breeding, considering that there were over 10,000 new proposed rates each year. Thus, if the Company-Union grievance machinery was to work smoothly, it was essential that the Union obtain the information necessary for a considered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Nor are we persuaded that the Board\u2019s decision unduly invaded the Company\u2019s property rights. In other circumstances, the courts have not hesitated to afford union representatives access to company premises in furtherance of the Act\u2019s purposes. See N. L. R. B. v. Stowe Spinning Co., 336 U.S. 226, 69 S.Ct. 541, 93 L.Ed. 638 (1946) (union granted access to company town to hold organizational meeting); N. L. R. B. v. Lake Superior Lumber Corp., 167 F.2d 147 (6th Cir. 1948) (union granted access to company-owned logging camp to solicit membership); N. L. R. B. v. Cities Service Oil Co., 122 F.2d 149 (2d Cir. 1941) (union granted access to company ship to discuss grievances with unlicensed personnel). Similarly, the distinction urged by the Company between affording employees access to the production areas of the plant while limiting non-employees to the non-production areas, cf. N. L. R. B. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 351 U.S. 105, 76 S.Ct. 679, 100 L.Ed. 975 (1956), has little merit in a case such as this. It would be a rare coincidence where an employee happened to be also a qualified industrial engineer and could adequately conduct time studies on behalf of his union. Moreover, it is apparent that these studies must be made in the production areas of the plant; they are designed, after all, to measure productivity under normal and usual circumstances. Thus, adopting the Company\u2019s suggested distinction would foreclose all Union-conducted time studies, a step which, as already indicated, we believe contrary to the purposes Congress intended the Act to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Equally without merit is the Company\u2019s argument that the failure of the governing agreement to specifically provide for independent time studies is dispositive of this proceeding. While it is true that the Union had not requested permission to make these tests in the past, we do not find that determinative. Our main concern here is with statutory rights. Thus, the agreement did not expressly prohibit union-conducted studies and its silence in these circumstances cannot be construed as a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d waiver. See N. L. R. B. v. Perkins Mach. Co., 326 F.2d 488, 489 (1st Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Finally, the Company urges that the Board\u2019s order is too broad. In pertinent part, the order directs the Company to permit the Union to perform \u201cindependent time studies through its own experts on jobs involved in grievances arising under [the] * * * collective bargaining agreement.\u201d The Company insists that this language authorizes the Union to conduct a fishing expedition in the Company\u2019s plant. But, the order is to be read in the light of this opinion and that of the Board\u2019s. Generally, as we have already indicated, independent time studies should be authorized only when essential for the union to function intelligently in behalf of employees and only when such studies will not unduly disrupt the productive operations of the company. We do not refute the argument that access to company property for the purpose of conducting these studies could be employed by the unscrupulous as a tool of harassment. But such is not the case here. And, we are confident that the Board will perform its traditional function of balancing carefully the respective interests on both sides in cases where the need for time studies is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">Order enforced.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">.
