They were filed pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon joint motion of all parties, the cases were ordered consolidated for all purposes of this review. There are two principal issues which, for simplicity, will be referred to as (1) the \u201ccost\u201d issue; and (2) the \u201ctax\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The facts surrounding the \u201ccost\u201d issue may be summarized as follows: Petitioner, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), which owns and operates natural gas pipeline facilities extending from Texas to and throughout Florida, is successor in interest to the Houston Texas Gas and Oil Company (Houtex), which was organized during the 1950\u2019s to build and operate a natural gas pipeline. In order to finance the project, Houtex sold an aggregate of approximately 37.5% of its stock to four engineering and construction firms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It then entered into an agreement with the firms whereby they would perform specified services necessary to construct the pipeline and be compensated \u201cat the going rate\u201d for such work. Houtex thereafter applied to the Federal Power Commission for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. The Commission reviewed all the facts relating to the project and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">\u201cFinally, it appears that the labor necessary for construction of the facilities of Houston Gas will be furnished by three construction companies, the president of each of which is an official and director of Houston Gas and that two of these construction companies own blocks of Houston Gas stock. Furthermore, a member of the firm of engineers which will supervise the construction and operation of the pipeline is also a vice president and director of Houston Gas. While as we have already stated, the cost of the proposed facilities appears to be reasonable, in view of this fact, this cost will be carefully scrutinized in any future proceeding dealing with accounting or rates of Houston Gas *\u2022 <em>* </em>* \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">Opinion 301, 16 FPC 118, 142 (1956).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">At a subsequent rate determination hearing, the Commission refused to consider as part of Houtex\u2019 \u201ccost-of-service\u201d the profits it paid to the four firms for their services because of the so-called \u201cno-profits-to-affiliates\u201d rule. Opinion 431, 31 FPC 1402, 1403 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">The facts surrounding the \u201ctax\u201d issue may be summarized as follows: FGT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>is also successor in interest to the Coastal Transmission Corporation (Coastal) which between 1958 and 1961 filed consolidated income tax returns with its parent corporation and fellow subsidiaries pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Coastal itself realized taxable income during this period, it incurred no actual tax liability because substantial losses from the other members of the corporate family were included in the return. During the same aforementioned rate proceeding, the Commission also refused to consider those taxes Coastal <em>would have paid, </em>had it filed a separate return, as part of its \u201ccost-of-service.\u201d 31 FPC 1402, 1410 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Subsequent to the rate hearing, the Commission denied FGT\u2019s Motion for Rehearing, Opinion 431-A, 32 FPC 518 (1964), and Motion to Re-open the Record for introduction of further evidence, Opinion 431-B, 32 FPC 908 (1964). Florida Public Utilities Commission intervened and aligned itself with FGT.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"> At the outset, we can readily dispose of the \u201ctax\u201d issue with our recent decision in United Gas Pipe Line Company v. FPC, 357 F.2d 230 (5 Cir. 1966), in which we adopted the rule of the Tenth Circuit, as set forth in Cities Service Gas Co. v. FPC, 337 F.2d 97 (10 Cir. 1964), that the federal taxes which a gas transmission company would have paid, but for a consolidated return, are properly to be included in the \u201ccost-of-service\u201d during rate determinations. Therefore, the order of the Commission denying Coastal\u2019s practice of accruing federal income taxes must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">As to the \u201ccost\u201d issue, the following extracts from the Commission\u2019s opinion in this case reveal the crux of its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\u201cWe think that our rule against profits to affiliates precludes allowing their [the firms] profits in the plant accounts of Houston Texas. The no-profits-to-affiliates rule goes far back in Commission history. See for example Alabama Power Co., 1 FPC 25, 39, aff\u2019d. Alabama Power Co. v. McNinch [68 App.D.C. 132], 94 F.2d 601 (CADC 1937); Louisville Hydro-Electric Company, 1 FPC 130, 133, aff\u2019d. Louisville Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. F.P.C., 129 F.2d 126 (CA6 1942), cert. den. 318 U.S. 761 [63 S.Ct. 559, 87 L.Ed. 1133]. The basis of this rule is that a profit made by an enterprise dealing with itself does not represent cost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">\u2022X<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> '$\u00a3 -X* \u25a0X* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">\u201cTo prevent the evils which have been the subject of past proceedings the rule against profits to affiliates must be sufficiently broad to cover fact as well as form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">\u201cThe purpose of the rule is to prevent insiders taking advantage of their position and creating costs which are not subject to the check of ordinary business relationships. CF., Section 10 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 20. We do not think that some particular percentage of stock or of common officers or directors can be allowed to be determinative of whether the rule should apply, although these factors are relevant to determine when a relationship exists that calls for application of the exclusionary rule. That the contractors or promoters could not have dictated policies or ordered the execution of contracts if all other interests had chosen to oppose them cannot validate a relationship which by its very nature and history precludes unhampered bargaining, especially if the contractors or promoters were, as here, clearly dominant when the original contracts were agreed upon. If control exists, sufficient to dominate the execution of the contracts in the face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>of united opposition, that makes the rule automatically applicable; but our inquiry is not at an end if we conclude that the insider\u2019s influence resulting in the contract is or became somewhat less than this degree of control.\u201d 31 FPC 1402 at 1407.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Petitioners contend. that (1) the Commission is estopped from deleting \u201creasonable profits\u201d from Houtex\u2019 cost-of-service because of its pronouncements during the previous certification proceedings to the effect that the projected costs (including profits to the firms) of the project appeared to be \u201creasonable\u201d; and (2) the \u201cno-profits-to-affiliates\u201d rule is inapplicable where, as here, neither party \u201ccontrolled\u201d the other. They seek to have the Commission\u2019s orders vacated and the case remanded with instructions to investigate the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the profits without application of any \u201cautomatic\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The majority opinion of the Commission framed the issue as to cost in the following language: In its brief filed on this petition for review, the Commission takes the position that it did not operate according to the \u201cno-profits-to-affiliates rule\u201d and that any reference thereto constituted legal shorthand for a \u201crule\u201d of law that promoters of a corporation stand in a fiduciary relationship to it and that only such utility rates should be approved which will provide the company an opportunity to realize a reasonable return. Accordingly, it is contended that the question presented can be answered without reference to any \u201crule\u201d or without use of the word \u201caffiliate.\u201d Moreover, the Commission denies the petitioners\u2019 assertion that it ruled \u201cautomatically\u201d or \u201cwithout factual inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cOn the first question there is an issue as to whether there was an <em>affiliation </em>between Houston Texas and the engineering and construction firms, and, if so, whether that part of the pipeline costs representing profits to these firms should be eliminated from the company\u2019s plant accounts. There is also a subsidiary question as to whether the profits should not be reduced by certain overhead costs of the construction firms.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Section 6(a) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717e(a), gives the Commission authority to \u201cascertain the actual legitimate cost of property of every natural-gas company\u201d when determining cost-of-service as it relates to rate-making. In the past \u2014 as indicated by the Commission opinion printed in part above \u2014 the Commission has excluded from \u201cactual legitimate cost\u201d those profits paid by a company to any other with which it is, either directly or indirectly, in a \u201ccontrol\u201d relationship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This practice has become known as the \u201cno-profits-to-affiliates\u201d rule. The rationale behind the rule is relatively simple and highly pragmatic. If the relationship between two contracting parties is so close that they lose their individual identity and are, in fact, <em>one, </em>there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>can be no \u201cactual legitimate cost\u201d involved in the payments of profits, since it would be tantamount to a company\u2019s paying <em>itself </em>a profit for interdepartmental services. See, e.g., St. Croix Falls Minnesota Improvement Co., et al., supra; Alabama Power Company, 1 FPC 25, 29, aff\u2019d Alabama Power Company v. McNinch, 68 App.D.C. 132, 94 F.2d 601 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Here, of course, it is undisputed that neither Houtex nor the engineering and construction group actually <em>controlled </em>the other. There was admittedly an interlocking directorate (four \u201cfirm\u201d men on Houtex\u2019 board of nine) and an intermingling of interests. While it may be true that the dealings between the parties involved did not meet the strictest standards required by \u201carm\u2019s length bargaining,\u201d it is not contended that they lost their true identity or that the relationship was such as to make them one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Arm\u2019s length bargaining is a general term. There is no substantial contention that the transactions in question were consummated under conditions of collusion, fraud, gross neglect or undue influence. Unquestionably, FGT will have to carry the burden of justifying the reasonableness of the claimed costs, if \u201creasonableness\u201d is a proper subject of inquiry under the facts and circumstances present. In our view, the record conclusively establishes that each of the principals involved was a clearly \u201cidentifiable\u201d and independent entity, pursuing its individual business objectives at all times. Therefore, to apply the \u201cno-profits-to-affiliates\u201d rule to this set of circumstances, the Commission had to expand its traditional meaning, if not indeed create an entirely new rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"> Control is always a vital element to consider and determine. See Western Dist. Co. v. Public Service Comm. of Kansas, 285 U.S. 119, 52 S.Ct. 283, 76 L.Ed. 655 (1932); Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Company, 282 U.S. 133, 51 S.Ct. 65, 75 L.Ed. 255 (1930); Louisville Hydro-Electric Co., 1 FPC 130 (1933), affd sub. nom. Louisville Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. FPC, 129 F.2d 126 (6 Cir. 1942), cert. den. 318 U.S. 761, 63 S.Ct. 559, 87 L.Ed. 1133. Mere influence arising out of business relationships where control is not present is not a proper standard. In any event, the Commission has the unquestioned right and power to investigate the reasonableness of the costs at issue with the usual thoroughness and expertise characteristic of its procedure and accounting methods; and undoubtedly such costs should and will be scrutinized with meticulous care.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">As to the term \u201cactual legitimate cost,\u201d the Commission interpreted the similar provisions of the Federal Water Power Act [now the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 797(b)] in Louisville HydroElectric Co., 1 FPC 130, 139 (1933), to mean that costs \u201cmust be (1) <em>\u2018actual\u2019, </em>that is, real and <em>bona fide, </em>as distinguished from fictitious or fabricated, whether by intercorporate dealings or otherwise; and (2) <em>legitimate </em>meaning not coerced, collusive, fraudulent, or unreasonable * *</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">We fail to see why the profits in the instant ease so clearly exceed the bounds of the definition the Commission itself has already set as to require automatic exclusion from cost-of-service. The profits were \u201cactual\u201d because <em>in reality </em>they flowed from one independent party to another. There was no \u201cfiction\u201d involved in their payment, as is true in case of payment to a subsidiary or parent. Furthermore, such costs were \u201clegitimate\u201d to the extent they were <em>necessary. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>It would be unrealistic to assume that the engineering and construction firms would or could have done the work for Houtex without a profit, since together they never did own more than two-fifths of that company.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether or not the profits were \u201creasonable\u201d is a decision the Commission must make without applying the \u201cno-profits-to-affiliates\u201d rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">For the reasons stated above, the Order of the Federal Power Commission excluding from Houtex\u2019 cost-of-service the profits paid to the engineering and construction firms must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In view of our decision, we deem it unnecessary to consider petitioners\u2019 contention as to the \u201cres judicata\u201d effect of the Commission\u2019s prior order relating to the \u201creasonableness\u201d of projected costs. Nor is it necessary to review the Commission\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 Motion for Rehearing or Motion to Re-Open the record to present further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Reversed and remanded to the Federal Power Commission for further consideration and proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">.

This was the maximum percentage the firms owned at any time. The figures were later substantially less. In its brief tbe Commission asserts that only three firms were involved because two of the four firms were acting jointly. However, in its opinion the Commission refers to amounts \u201cpaid to four engineering and construction firms * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-20\">. This Opinion was reviewed and affirmed in Florida Economic Advisory Council v. F. P. C., 102 U.S.App.D.C. 152, 251 F.2d 643 (1957), cert. den. 356 U.S. 959, 78 S.Ct. 996, 2 L.Ed.2d 1066 (1958). The issues now before this Court, however, were not dealt with specifically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">. The petitioner, FGT, resulted from a merger of Coastal Transmission Corporation into Houston Texas Oil and Gas Corporation in 1962. Prior thereto both companies were wholly owned subsidiaries of The Houston Corporation (now Florida Gas Company), and each operated separate segments of the Texas to Florida pipeline system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. In St. Croix Falls Minnesota Improvement Co., et al., 3 F.P.C. 13, 16 (1942) (footnote 4), the Commission stated it uses the term \u201caffiliated company\u201d synonymously with the term \u201cassociated company\u201d as defined in the Commission\u2019s uniform System of Accounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">\u201c5.A. \u2018Associated companies\u2019 means companies or persons that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, control, or are controlled by, or are under common control with, the accounting company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">\u201cB. \u2018Control\u2019 (including the terms \u2018controlling\u2019, \u2018controlled by,\u2019 and \u2018under common control with\u2019) means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to' direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company, whether such power is exercised through one or more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or pursuant to an agreement, and whether such power is established through a majority or minority ownership or voting of securities, common directors, officers, or stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, associated companies, contract or any other direct or indirect means.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. The Government speaks of the relationship in terms of a \u201cjoint venture.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. This latter alternative is substantiated by the Oommission\u2019s statement in its opinion at 31 FPC 1408 that \u201cthe purpose of the rule is to prevent insiders taking advantage of their position and creating costs which are not subject to the check of ordinary business relationships. OF., Section 10 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 20 * * * \u201d Our research fails to reveal any prior case in which this purpose was specifically expressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b389-14\">. It is significant to note that at the time when the construction and engineering firms owned 37%% of Houtex\u2019 stock that corporation was in the infant or planning stage. Later, on October 23, 1958, when the binding agreements for the engineering and construction services were signed by the parties, the interest of the engineering and construction firms had shrunk to less than 10%.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b389-15\">. On the question of discouraging the development of pipeline projects the majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-16\">\u201cIt has been suggested by the dissent that the effect of our decision here will discourage the promotion of pipeline projects by promoters pooling their interests. Of course, we have no such intention. We do not object to promoters making a profit on their investment of time, effort and financial resources in a developing pipeline enterprise. They will presumably realize this profit on the enhanced value of the shares of stock distributed to them. What we do object to is the engineering and contracting promoter profiting a second time on contracts between themselves and the organization they are promoting at the expense of the gas consumers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-18\">In his dissent Commissioner O\u2019Connor expresses the opposite view :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-20\">\u201cI conclude by noting that the majority\u2019s error of law is compounded by their error of judgment. I have serious apprehension that their decision, which negates the previous definition of affiliation and extends the no-profits rule into an undelineated area, will only have a deleterious effect on the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-21\">\u201cThis interest has often been served by projects which were the creative progeny of but a few promoters. These promoters, lacking the vertical integration of large companies, were forced to incorporate with scattered interests in order to metamorphose idea into actuality. As was only logical, representatives for these interests often became officers or members of the board of the infant corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
