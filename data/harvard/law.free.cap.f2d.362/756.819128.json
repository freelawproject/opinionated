Paschal and the informant met appellant at a restaurant located at 139th Street and Seventh Avenue in New York City. Paschal testified that the informant introduced him to appellant as a friend who wished to \u201ccop some stuff\u201d and then departed. He further testified that appellant sold him three \u201cbundles\u201d of heroin for $225 and that before they parted appellant told him that any time he needed heroin appellant could be found in that vicinity. On February 15, 1965 Paschal, this time alone, again met appellant at 139th Street and Seventh Avenue and purchased two \u201cbundles\u201d of heroin from him. On February 19, 1965 appellant while driving a car, which he had been observed driving on prior occasions, was arrested by federal narcotics agent Charles Leya. Leya testified that, although the car was not registered in appellant\u2019s name, appellant at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>his arrest admitted that he had \u201cpermanent use\u201d of the vehicle. The car was searched immediately after the arrest and a package of marihuana was found underneath the back rest section of the front seat. Then, according to Leya, he asked appellant for permission to search his apartment at 2295 Seventh Avenue and appellant, after being advised that he had a right to remain silent, stated that he had nothing to hide, consented to the search, and gave Leya the keys to the apartment. Thereafter, Leya searched the apartment and found a packet of heroin and an envelope of marihuana in a dresser drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Appellant neither took the stand nor offered any witnesses in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\"><em>Errors Asserted on </em>Appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">I. Appellant contends that the district court erred in failing to charge the jury with respect to the defense of entrapment; in failing to require the production of the informer; and that the court\u2019s instruction with respect to the Government\u2019s use of informers was erroneous. None of these contentions has merit. At trial, appellant never attempted to establish the defense of entrapment either in cross-examining the Government witnesses or in addressing the jury; nor did he request the court to charge the jury on the defense of entrapment. He argues, however, that the circumstances under which the informer was employed, i. e., the initial purchase was set up by an informer who was cooperating with the Government and the purchase was made by an undercover agent with Government money, raised the issue and that the trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>should have charged on the issue. That position, however, is unsound. Moreover, even assuming that this approach has merit, there is no evidence in the record indicating that appellant was entrapped. Mere solicitation -on the part of the Government does not by itself constitute entrapment, and that is the most that can -be considered to have occurred here. In fact, there is no evidence that the informer persuaded appellant to make the February 11th sale (his role terminated after he introduced agent Paschal to appellant). Furthermore, Paschal\u2019s testimony that appellant assured him that he could supply more heroin and the fact that appellant had narcotics in his control when arrested indicate that he was actively engaged in narcotics traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">With respect to the production of the informer, appellant\u2019s counsel elicited on cross-examination of agent Leya his name and the fact that a federal eharge was pending against him. He made no inquiry as to the informer\u2019s address or whereabouts and at no time requested that the Government produce the informer. In fact, at a bench conference following his summation, appellant\u2019s counsel agreed that his action indicated that the presence of the informant would not be necessary for the defense. The district court committed no error in failing to require production of the informer under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">With respect to the Government\u2019s use of an informer, the district court charged that the jury should not permit its feelings regarding the practice to influence its verdict since use of the services of an informer is not forbidden by law. Appellant concedes that no exception was taken to the charge and that no instruction on entrapment was submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\"> II. Count three of the indictment charged appellant with the illegal transportation and concealment of marihuana in an automobile on February 19th. A finding of \u201cpossession\u201d was essential to the Government\u2019s case to establish, through the inference contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a, that the narcotics were illegally imported into the United States and that appellant had knowledge of the illegal importation. At the close of the Government\u2019s case, appellant moved to dismiss count three on the ground that the evidence presented did not make out a prima facie case that the marihuana was in his possession. Appellant argues on appeal that denial of the motion constitutes reversible error. The evidence here clearly was sufficient to support an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>inference that the marihuana was in appellant\u2019s actual or constructive possession. As to the woman, Clara Nelson, who was with appellant in the car when he was arrested, there is no reason why appellant could not have called her in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">III. Appellant argues that the district court erred in failing to exclude the heroin and marihuana found in his apartment on February 19th as seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. At trial, appellant not only did not claim that he did not consent to the search, but he neither moved to suppress the evidence nor objected to its receipt on the ground that it had been illegally seized. Moreover, he made no post-trial motion to dismiss on that ground. Certainly under these circumstances there \u201cis nothing in the case which would dispose us to exercise our discretion to notice \u2018plain error\u2019 under Rule 52(b).\u201d United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276, 281 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
