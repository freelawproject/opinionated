The defendant was acquitted on the other two counts which charged similar offenses alleged to have occurred on December 17, 1964. The defendant was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">Defendant contends<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that his acquittal on the alleged December 17, 1964 offenses is inconsistent with his conviction of the January 11, 1965 charges and requires vacation of the judgment on all counts and the remandment of the cause for a new trial. But defendant\u2019s premise that inconsistency exists is faulty. Separate offenses on different dates are involved. The fact that the jury acquitted the defendant of the charges involving the alleged December transaction cannot be construed as effectuating a determination of the facts adverse to the government regarding the January sale and concealment etc., of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">Moreover, inconsistency in a verdict on separate counts does not entitle a defendant to reversal or vacation of a judgment of conviction. Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 393-394, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356; United States v. Russo, 7 Cir., 335 F.2d 299, 301; United States v. Margoles, 7 Cir., 294 F.2d 371, 372-373.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">The judgment order of conviction and sentence appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-14\">. The defendant also contended that the government failed to prove that the substance involved was heroin. But this contention was not pursued on oral argument The government had filed an additional appendix which reveals that defendant stipulated that a government chemist if called as a witness would testify that the government\u2019s exhibit, a brownish. \u2014 light brown powder (the substance the evidence shows the defendant delivered to an informer-purchaser), was heroin.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
