Rudnicki v. McCormack, D.Mass., 1962, 210 F.Supp. 905, appeal dismissed, 372 U.S. 226, 83 S.Ct. 679, 9 L.Ed.2d 714. This order is presently in effect.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Appellant has now sought leave to file an action against the \u201cDepartment of\u201d [sic] Attorney General of Massachusetts, the \u201cMiddlesex Superior Court,\u201d and \u201cMiddlesex District Attorney Department.\u201d The district court denied leave to file, and he appeals. The Attorney General of Massachusetts has appeared as representing the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-18\">Passing the question whether appellant has properly named any real parties, and if we disregard, as in any event we must, numerous charges made in the complaint that are not legally maintainable under any circumstances, there remain certain allegations which, if generously construed, might make out a cause of action against certain persons who are at least indirectly referred to. We do not reach the question, however, whether there are sufficient allegations in the complaint, as a matter of pleading, to withstand a motion to dismiss. The action is manifestly one within the scope of the injunction. Hence appellant was obliged to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the district court that he has a meritorious case. We need not determine what he must do to accomplish this. We do rule that mere allegations in a complaint, and the broad type of charges that appellant makes orally, are not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-14\"> The order entered was against instituting proceedings \u201cwithout prior leave of Court * * * against any State or Federal Judge, officer or employee for actions taken in the course of their official duties as such Judge, officer or employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
