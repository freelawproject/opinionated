(\u201cCanforship\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">This case was previously before us, and after holding that the grant of a stay could not be justified under Section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3, because defendants were not parties to the arbitration agreement, we remanded the case to the district court to determine whether a stay should be granted pursuant to the \u201cinherent power\u201d of the court to issue such an order. See Nederlandse Erts-Tankersmaatsehappij, N.V. v. Isbrandtsen Co., 339 F.2d 440 (2d Cir. 1964). The district court from time to time granted defendants\u2019 motions for temporary stays during the arbitration in London of the controversy between plaintiff and Canforship. Two of the orders granting such temporary stays are now before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">If a stay had been denied, many of the issues now pending in the London arbitration might have had to be litigated here. The district court properly wished to avoid \u201cfutile activity.\u201d There was no abuse of discretion in the decision to grant a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Of the two orders appealed from, one expired on December 15, 1965, and the other expires June 30, 1966. Thus, the district court will soon have to consider whether to grant a further stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Plaintiff fears that \u201cit will lose evidence by lapse of time,\u201d and that there exists a \u201cserious risk that plaintiff may lose its vessels by foreclosure of mortgage during the long prospective delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\"> We have previously set forth standards which should guide the district court in evaluating a new application for a stay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The burden of justifying a stay is on defendants; all of the relevant factors should be reassessed in light of plaintiff\u2019s claims of hardship and delay. The defendants should, if possible, be pressed to proceed promptly with this apparently interminable arbitration. If a further stay is granted, plaintiffs should at least be permitted to proceed with discovery on the issues which are not involved in the arbitration, to wit, the existence, validity and scope of the guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">. \u201cThe defendants have the burden of establishing that a stay is warranted. Without attempting to list all relevant factors, we point out that the defendants should demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that they have not taken nor will take any steps to hamper the progress of the arbitration proceeding, that the arbitration may be expected to conclude within a reasonable time, and that such delay as may occur will not work undue hardship.\u201d Nederlandse Erts-Tankersmaatsehappij, N.V. v. Isbrandt-sen Co., supra at 442.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
