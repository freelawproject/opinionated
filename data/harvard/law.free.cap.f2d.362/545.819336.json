The granting or refusal of the privilege created by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 to commence and prosecute a suit in forma pauperis is a matter within the court\u2019s discretion. This court has held that the discretion to deny state prisoners the privilege is \u201cespecially broad\u201d in civil actions against their wardens and other officials connected with the institution in which they are incarcerated. Smart v. Heinze, 347 F.2d 114, 116 (9th Cir. 1965). The basis for this additional latitude is no doubt the two policy considerations mentioned by Judge Duniway, concurring in Weller v. Dickson, 314 F.2d 598, 604 (9th Cir. 1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">\u201c(1) that it would be disruptive of prison discipline to permit such a suit to proceed while the prisoner is still in custody, whether the prisoner be a federal convict or a state convict, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">(2) that in the case of state convicts the maintenance of such suits in federal courts would produce unseemly conflict between federal courts and state authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">We think that, tested by this standard, the ruling of the district court did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">Shobe\u2019s action, so far as it sought injunctive and declaratory relief, was frivolous. He does not assert that the statutes and regulations were or are invoked by the defendants to hamper or prevent his access to the courts with respect to any criminal matter; he simply alleges that the defendants have applied them to curtail his liberty in the penitentiary. The general rule, applicable to these facts, is that a federal court has no power to control or regulate the internal discipline in state penitentiaries. Hatfield v. Bailleaux, 290 F.2d 632 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Nor do there appear \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d [Weller v. Dickson, supra, 314 F.2d p. 600] with respect to the matter of damages that would dictate immediate litigation at the expense of others. He will lose no right to sue for the statute of limitations is tolled until his release. Cal. CCP 352(3); Leeper v. Beltrami, 53 Cal.2d 195, 1 Cal.Rptr. 12, 347 P.2d 12, 77 A.L.R.2d 803 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-18\">. This order, being final, is appealable. Weller v. Dickson, 314 F.2d 598 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b598-15\">POPE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">\u25a0 I should like to add that in my view appellant, who claims- in one place in his pleadings to have $6000 owing to him, and in another place to be holder of a check for $3000, who does not assert that either the debt or the check is worthless, makes mockery of the processes of the court by demanding a free ride.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
