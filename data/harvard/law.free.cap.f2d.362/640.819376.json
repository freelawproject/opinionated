In his return for that year he showed gross receipts of $136,360, with costs and other deductions totaling.$135,255, for a taxable net income of some $1,105. In 1959, the Internal Revenue Service began an investigation of taxpayer\u2019s return and in 1961 mailed him a deficiency notice for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>year 1957 in the amount of $63,679.33 with an additional assessment for fraud in the amount of $31,839.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Prior to trial, taxpayer entered into the following stipulation:</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\u201c4. The parties herein agree that the petitioners\u2019 correct net profit from the sale of houses in 1957 was at least in the amount of $62,369.98, computed as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">Total receipts $212,313.94</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">Merchandise purchased $78,532.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">Taxes, interest and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">insurance 7,424.71</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">Depreciation 3,850.27</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">Truck, car and tool</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">expense 2,586.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-13\">Mise, building expense 11,379.56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-14\">Subcontract and labor 22,174.16</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-15\">Cost of lots sold 14,695.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-16\">Mise, rent expense 300.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-17\">Total expenses not in dispute $140,943.96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-18\">Less:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-19\">Building expenses in dispute 3.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-20\">Depreciation expenses in dispute 1.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-21\">Cost of lots in dispute 5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-26\">Total expenses in dispute 9,000.00 149,943.96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-28\">Net profit 62,369.98\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-30\">Taxpayer further stipulated that he had underestimated his taxable income by <em>at least </em>$59,891 ($62,369.98 less $1,105 originally declared, less a $2,478.12 farm loss conceded by the Commissioner). Once the stipulation had been signed, there were but four disputed issues to be decided: (1) $3,000.00 building expense; (2) $1,000.00 depreciation expense;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) $5,000.00 additional cost of lots; (4) fraud under Section 6653(a). Only (3) and (4) are pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-33\">During trial, taxpayer introduced evidence showing an expenditure of $3,-480.00 for utility improvements made on lots sold during 1957. He contended the entire amount should be allowed. The Government showed that the expenditure in question was made to improve a total of 45 lots, but that only 20 of them were <em>actually sold </em>during 1957. Therefore, it was argued, only <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>%sths of the expenditure or $1,546.67 should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-35\">Taxpayer also attempted to introduce evidence of other costs of lot development greatly in excess of the $5,000 left in dispute by the stipulation. He contended that he had signed the stipulation in ignorance and that justice required that he be allowed to repudiate that portion dealing with cost of lots. Counsel for the Commissioner protested vigorously, pointing out that taxpayer had many months during investigation and confer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>enees to come forward with such evidence and that the final stipulation was in his possession for an entire week prior to his signing it. After the stipulation was drafted, the petitioner took it home for consideration and study. It was signed by his attorney and mailed back a week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">As to the fraud issue, taxpayer contended he had used the \u201cbank deposits\u201d (cash) method of accounting and that his attorney had mistakenly included loan <em>renewals </em>along with loans outstanding in arriving at the gross receipts figure. He admitted he kept inadequate records, but contended that the error on the part of his attorney did not amount to an intentional understatement. The Government introduced evidence showing the taxpayer had attempted to conceal three bank accounts and that taxpayer and his attorney had given inconsistent statements concerning their method of preparing the return. Taxpayer testified he had turned over <em>all </em>his underlying records to his attorney, while the attorney testified taxpayer had not given him such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The Tax Court allowed 294sths of the $3,480 (or $1,546.67) paid for utility improvements to forty-five lots under the theory that such improvements were a capital investment and could only be deducted during the year of sale, it being undisputed that only 20 lots were sold during the year in question. It refused to allow the taxpayer to repudiate that portion of the stipulation limiting cost of lot development to $19,695.60 ($14,-695.60 undisputed; $5,000 disputed). The Court also found taxpayer had understated his income in his return with intent to defraud. (This case is not officially reported, but see Henry, 23 CCH TCM 1005; 33 P-H TCH 110). The taxpayer disagreed with these three determinations and filed his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">As to taxpayer\u2019s contention that the entire amount spent for utility improvements on 45 lots should be allowed when only 20 of them were actually sold during 1957, we affirm the decision of the Tax Court. Such costs are capital expenditures and are only recovered during the year of sale. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Laguna Land &amp; W. Co., 118 F.2d 112 (9 Cir. 1941). See generally, 3A Mertens, Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 21.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The record does not support taxpayer\u2019s contention that the Tax Court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him to repudiate the stipulation. Stipulations entered into freely and fairly shall not be set aside except to avoid manifest injustice. Associated Beverages Co. v. P. Ballantine &amp; Sons, 287 F.2d 261 (5 Cir. 1961); Brinson v. Tomlinson, 264 F.2d 30 (5 Cir. 1959); Rule 31, Rules of Procedure, Tax Court of the United States, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7453.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A careful review of the record and briefs convinces us that the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow taxpayer to repudiate the stipulation, since no evidence of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d is present. Taxpayer had ample time to raise the issue of added cost before trial. None of the evidence was newly discovered. Furthermore, taxpayer failed to show such evidence was pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">As to the fraud determination, we are in full agreement with the conclusion of the Tax Court. Since this is a case of \u201ccivil\u201d fraud, there is no burden on the Commissioner to prove same \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938). The Court had sufficient evidence to support a finding of intent to defraud. We consider the following four factors persuasive: (1) the amount of the understatement; (2) inadequate and poor records; (3) concealment of bank accounts; and (4) incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sistent testimony during trial. Findings of fact of the Tax Court shall not be overturned unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Boyett v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 204 F.2d 205 (5 Cir. 1953); Woodham v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 256 F.2d 201, 204 (5 Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">We have considered all of the taxpayer\u2019s other contentions and consider them so completely lacking in merit that they do not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The petition is denied and the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-16\">. Petitioners are man and wife who filed a joint return during the year in question. The wife had no significant income during that year, so the husband is referred to as the \u201ctaxpayer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b693-17\">. \u00a7 6653(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-18\">\u201c(b) <em>Fraud. </em>\u2014 If any part of any underpayment (as defined in subsection (c)') of tax required to be shown on a return is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to 50 percent of the underpayment.

The pertinent portion of the rule is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">\u201c(6) <em>No evidence received to alter or contradict. </em>The Court may set aside a stipulation in whole or in part where justice requires, but otherwise will not receive evidence tending to qualify, change, or contradict any fact properly introduced into the record by stipulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
