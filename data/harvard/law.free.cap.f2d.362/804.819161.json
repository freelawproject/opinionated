His counsel deliberately waived it as a matter of trial strategy both in the trial of the case and in his argument to the jury. That this was consciously done is established by the tenor of the argument to the jury commenting on the issue of entrapment as raised by the code-fendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-21\">We hold there was no entrapment as a matter of law, and that the defendant, by reason of his defense, was in no position to ask for an instruction on entrapment. (Cf. Garibay-Garcia v. United States, 9 Cir., 362 F.2d 509, decided May 23, 1966, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-22\">No other point raised on appeal was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
