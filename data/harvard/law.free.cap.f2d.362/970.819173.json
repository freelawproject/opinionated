C., and the northern part of Virginia. The Regional Directors agreed \u201cto assume full responsibility for appointing, training and supervising General Agents and Agents\u201d in their territory. As full payment for prescribed services, certain bonus payments were provided for by the contract. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, Costello notified appellant that he was withdrawing from the partnership on November 14, 1961. Thereafter the appellee declined to make such bonus payments to Ford, who thereupon commenced this action. This appeal is from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint insofar as its demand for relief is predicated on continuation of . the regional directors agency agreement after November 14,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">The parties agree that the contract is governed by the Uniform Partnership Act as applied in Indiana. In Indiana, as elsewhere, a \u201cchange in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated\u201d dissolves the partnership. 10 Burns, Annotated Indiana Statutes \u00a7 50-429 (1951), 7 Uniform Laws Annotated, Partnership \u00a7 29 (1949). Dissolution brings to an end the ordinary business of the partnership including insurance agency agreements except, in certain circumstances, where the agency contract has been assigned by the partnership to the surviving partner or partners and the insurance company may be said to have consented to the assignment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, since there was no assignment of the agency contract by the partnership, dissolution thereof terminated that contract. Even if the agency agreement were held to be with appellant and his partner jointly and not the partnership, the result would be the same. See Rowe v. Rand, 111 Ind. 206, 12 N.E. 377 (1887); Restatement, Second, Agency \u00a7 41(2) (1958); Mechem, Outlines of the Law of Agency \u00a7 80 (3d ed. 1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-23\">. See Knudsen v. Torrington Company, 2 Cir., 254 F.2d 283, 286-287 (1958); Egner v. States Realty Co., 223 Minn. 305, 26 N.W.2d 464, 170 A.L.R. 500 (1947). The courts of Indiana have not had occasion to pass on the question presented here under the Uniform Partnership Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
