He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">Appellant raises only one question in his appeal. He contends that the Government should have offered in evidence the cans and jars containing the whiskey, or at least samples of the liquid, which he claims was the best evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-14\">The Government did offer the testimony of its special investigator to the effect that the liquid contained in the cans and jars was whiskey. No objection was made by Barnhill to the reception of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">The whiskey was destroyed shortly after the arrest and the jars and containers were returned to Barnhill. No contention was made by Barnhill at the trial that the liquid was not whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-16\">In our judgment the evidence was adequate to support the conviction. Burney v. United States, 339 F.2d 91 (5th Cir. 1964); Chandler v. United States, 318 F.2d 356 (10th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
