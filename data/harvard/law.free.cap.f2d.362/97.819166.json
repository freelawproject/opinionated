Count I charged the transportation of the stolen motor vehicle; Count II charged a bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">At his arraignment, Rizzo waived a formal reading of the indictment and pleaded not guilty. It is not contended that Rizzo was not furnished a copy of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">At the time Rizzo\u2019s case was called for trial, the Government moved to dismiss Count II of the indictment. This motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">After a brief recess, Rizzo\u2019s counsel advised the court that Rizzo wished to withdraw his plea of not guilty to Count I of the indictment and enter a guilty plea. The following colloquy then took place between the court and Rizzo:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, Mr. Rizzo, are you satisfied with Mr. McDonald\u2019s [defense counsel\u2019s] representation of you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">\u201cThe Court: And he has consulted you, and you have talked with him regarding your plea in this case ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">\u201cThe Court: Has anybody made any promises to you of any kind as to what disposition will be made of this case upon your plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">\u201cThe Court: And you enter this plea of guilty freely and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-16\">\u201cThe Defendant: I do, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-17\">\u25a0 \u201cThe Court: Without any promises of any kind by the District Attorney, your lawyer, or anybody else, including this Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: That\u2019s right, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-20\">\u201cThe Court: All right, it is this Court\u2019s duty to advise you that under your plea of guilty \u2014 and you do desire to enter a plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-21\">\u201cThe Defendant: I do, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-22\">\u201cThe Court: It is this Court\u2019s duty to advise you that under your plea of guilty, this Court has the power to impose a sentence of not to exceed five years in the penitentiary, or a fine not to exceed $10,000, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-23\">\u201cKnowing that, do you persist in your plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-24\">\u201cThe Defendant: I do, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-25\">\u201cThe Court: Now, in fairness to you, I want to tell you that Mr. McDonald [the defendant\u2019s counsel] did, with Mr. Brown [the Assistant U. S. Attorney] discuss the disposition of this case in the event a plea were entered, and I told Mr. McDonald and I tell you, that what I will do in this case upon the disposition of the plea will depend upon the presentence investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-26\">\u201cNo promises were made as to what this Court will do. Do you understand that fully?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-27\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-28\">\u201cThe Court: All right, and knowing that, do you persist in your plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-29\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes, I do, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-30\">\u201cThe Court: All right, the plea.will be accepted. There will be a finding of guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-31\">As indicated in the colloquy, sentencing did not take place at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-32\">Following the court\u2019s acceptance of the guilty plea, Government counsel, upon the request of Rizzo\u2019s counsel, recited to the court the facts in the case. It will suffice, without repeating the recital of facts, to say that the recital did not clearly indicate the itinerary and manner of transportation of the stolen motor vehicle, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>who was responsible for the transportation. The recital itself did not make out a complete and thoroughly connected case against Rizzo.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">After the recital, Rizzo\u2019s attorney put Rizzo on the stand, and after some general questions, the following statements were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201cQ. You did take this car up to Milwaukee, is that true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201cQ. And what he read to the Court, what he recited to the Court, is true and correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">On this appeal, Rizzo contends that the trial court violated Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S. C.A., by accepting his guilty plea without determining his understanding of the guilty plea. This contention does not directly present the question whether Rizzo voluntarily and understandingly pleaded guilty, but rather whether the trial court satisfactorily determined that Rizzo had so pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">Rule 11 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of the court, <em>nolo contendere. </em>The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept \"the plea without first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge. If a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation fails to appear, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">We note at the outset that none of the federal rules are to be applied ritualistically. Rule 2, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">\u201cThese rules are intended to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding. They shall be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-16\">It is thus not necessary, in order to satisfy Rule 11, supra, that the trial court make a <em>formal </em>determination of the defendant\u2019s understanding of the guilty plea. United States v. Davis, 7 Cir., 212 F.2d 264, 267 (1954); Turner v. United States, 8 Cir., 325 F.2d 988, 989-990 (1964); Gundlach v. United States, 4 Cir., 262 F.2d 72, 76 (1958). The court, of course, must be responsibly satisfied that the defendant knew what he was doing in pleading guilty and that his plea was voluntary. Turner, supra; United States v. Swaggerty, 7 Cir., 218 F.2d 875 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">From the record and oral argument, the following facts have been made clear. Rizzo was furnished with a copy of the indictment and was free to read it. At arraignment, he waived the reading of the indictment and pleaded not guilty. At trial, after the Government moved to dismiss Count II of the indictment, and after a brief recess, Rizzo, by his counsel, advised the court that he wished to withdraw his not guilty plea and plead guilty to Count I of the indictment. Rizzo had the benefit of consultation with his lawyer respecting his ease and his plea, represented to the court that he had such consultation and that he was satisfied with it, and advised the court that no promises had been made to him in return for his plea of guilty. Rizzo was advised of the possible maximum penalty which the court could impose on him under his plea of guilty. Finally, the court did not accept the guilty plea summarily, but acted after conversation with and observation of Rizzo, which put the court in a position to make an assessment of Rizzo\u2019s demean- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">Under these facts, we hold that the trial court informally satisfied the requirements of Rule 11, supra, before accepting Rizzo\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">We observe that subsequent to the court\u2019s acceptance of Rizzo\u2019s guilty plea, Rizzo affirmed the Government\u2019s recital of facts and admitted transportation of the stolen vehicle to Milwaukee. While the Government\u2019s recital of facts did not make out a complete case against Rizzo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>it need not have done so since Rizzo had already pleaded guilty to the charge of the indictment. The recital of facts and Rizzo\u2019s statements following it did not indicate that Rizzo did not understand the charges against him. On the other hand, Rizzo\u2019s affirmance of the recital of facts buttresses the conclusion that his plea was voluntarily and understandingly made and that the trial court\u2019s determination thereof was not incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Lee B. McTurnan and Mr. Arthur Frederick Staubitz, of the Chicago Bar, who so ably and earnestly served defendant-appellant as court-appointed counsel in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The judgment of conviction appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-18\">. \u201cWhoever transports in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle or aircraft, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2312.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
