It is not correct to tell the jury, as was stated in the questions, that \u201call witnesses are entitled to the same consideration regardless of their race and position in life.\u201d The jury may give such consideration to the testimony of the several witnesses as the facts of the case may warrant. Thus, as in requests to charge, it was not in error for the trial court to refuse to pose the question containing the erroneous statement to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-13\">. The question was: \u201cIf you are selected as a juror in this case, you will be the exclusive judges as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to each of them and their testimony. However, one of the witnesses for the prosecution, in all likelihood, will be Edward A. Heath, an officer with the United States Government, and in that connection, I will state to you that all witnesses are entitled to the same consideration regardless of their race and/or position in life. In this connection, I will ask whether there is anyone on this panel who will give more credence, or, in other words, believe Officer Edward A. Heath more because of the fact that he is a peace officer with the United States Government.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-15\">. The district court might well have allowed a question requested in proper form, such as that approved in Sellers v. United States, 1959, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 271 F.2d 475, 476, \u201cwhether \u2018any of the jurors [would be] inclined to give more weight to the testimony of a police officer merely because he is a police officer than any other witness * * \u201d See also Brown v. United States, D.C.Cir. 1964, 328 F.2d 543, 544.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
