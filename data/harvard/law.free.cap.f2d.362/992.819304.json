BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AHc\">This is another fall out from the Selma, Alabama racial-voter registration crisis of the spring of 1965. The aspect here is the present appeal by Sheriff Clark from an order of the United States District Court holding him in contempt of previous orders issued by Judge Thomas. In the memorandum order of contempt the Court found that Sheriff Clark is \u201cin contempt of this Court\u2019s order\u201d and then, of decisive importance here, declared that \u201che is ordered to pay a fine in the amount of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-20\">So preoccupied have the parties been with the contentions pro and con that the fine exceeding, as it does, $300 automatically triggered the jury trial provisions of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1995 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which came into being in the 1957 Civil Rights Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the real deficiency of this record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>has been overlooked. Indeed, the prear-gument study of the case led this Court to request the United States Attorney and the Department of Justice to file a brief and appear as amicus because of this apparent deficiency. The simple fact is that no one, simply no one, is able to determine whether this was begun, tried, or ended as a case for criminal contempt, civil contempt, or both, or whether some place down the trail, begun as one it was transmuted into the other. This is, of course, one thing about which there may not be any doubt if a contempt order is to stand. Cliett v. Hammonds, 5 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The result is that the decree must be vacated and the cause remanded for further consistent proceedings. This disposition permits us to severely caps\u00falate the setting of the case and the serious legal issues presented which, for the most part, have never yet been faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The injunctive orders of January 23 and 30, 1965, were entered in a private-non-governmental, suit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> brought as a class action for three classes, (a) Negroes being harassed in their attempt to register to vote, (b) Negroes seeking to vouch for applicants for registration as then required by Alabama law, and (c) citizens being harassed, coerced, etc. \u201cin their attempt to exercise their rights of freedom of speech and assembly designed to persuade voting registrars in Dallas County, Alabama to comply with the Constitution and laws of the United States guaranteeing the right to vote to all citizens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">The orders, purposely phrased by Judge Thomas in nonlegalistic lay terms so all, he said, could understand what was required, spelled out certain procedures to be followed to give control and stability because of the large number of persons assembling near or in the courthouse. These included the formation and composition of the lines of those seeking to register, the assembly and conduct of those assisting or encouraging applicants in their efforts. It is a fair summary to say that the orders undertook to assure the right of peaceful assembly without violence from those in the assembly or the public officers with an affirmative obligation on public officers to afford legal protection to those assembled. But it was careful to make very clear that the conduct of the public officers would have to be genuine and in good faith.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">But, as the plaintiffs saw it, things did not change and, on January 28, 1965, they moved for additional relief and for an order to show cause for contempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On January 30, 1965, the District Court amended its order of January 23, 1965, to clarify the question of how many persons could remain in line for registration. But the plaintiffs, unsatisfied with the turn of events, on February 12, 1965, filed a supplemental motion for additional relief and order to show cause. This set forth in detail the events of February 10, 1965, which formed the basis of the contempt judgment later entered. In brief, this charged that on February 10, a group of Negro children and teenagers peacefully assembled before the Dallas County Courthouse carrying signs urging full and equal voting rights for Negroes. But Sheriff Clark exercising his authority as Sheriff with a group of 15 to 20 of his Deputies surrounded the teenagers and led them through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>streets of Selma and forced the demonstrators to take a march of several miles out in the country at a fast pace, walking and running.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Subsequently, on March 25,1965, Judge Thomas entered the order requiring that Sheriff Clark on April 26, 1965, \u201cshow cause why he should not be held in contempt of this court and punished therefore by fine and imprisonment or both.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">The Court thereafter, on April 26, 1965, held an extensive evidentiary hearing without ever expressly ruling on Sheriff Clark\u2019s demand for a jury trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Later, September 2, 1965, Judge Thomas announced his decision. In effect he exonerated Sheriff Clark and his Deputies of disobedience as to the several events prior to February 10. Although the finding was not categorical, he declared, as to the alleged occurrences of January 25-27 (see note 5, supra), that \u201con most occasions when confronted by the plaintiffs, Sheriff Clark and his deputies acted with propriety and restraint.\u201d But, he concluded, \u201cthe notable exception to this occurred on February 10, 1965.\u201d Of this incident the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-7\">\u201cThe demonstrators were not disorderly. About 2:30 p. m., Sheriff Clark and his deputies ordered the group to disperse. The group refused, so they were taken on a \u2018forced march.\u2019 The group was forced to either run or walk at a brisk pace for over four miles. Sheriff Clark and his deputies rode in cars, taking turns walking and conducting the march with posse men. Sheriff Clark himself was in a car at all times while the march was occurring. Several members of the group marching were struck with a cattle prod on the march.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-18\">This action, the Court continued, placed Sheriff Clark \u201cin direct contempt of the following portion of\u201d the order of January 23, 1965, and here was set out the portion appearing in note 4, supra. This was followed, in turn, by the express finding of contempt and the order to pay the fine set forth earlier.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-19\">Subsequently, the Court overruled motions by Sheriff Clark for new trial. This specifically included his renewed demand for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-20\">On brief and in argument, counsel and the amicus struggled mightily to discern from whatever bench marks were available the undisclosed characterization of this proceeding as a criminal or civil contempt in the mind of Judge Thomas. The signs point in many directions. We need not seek them out nor discuss them because, analyzed in terms of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>it is criminal or civil, on no hypothesis does the present record warrant an af-firmance. At the same time, this record, revealing in practically uncontradicted terms spectacular action by Sheriff Clark which can hardly be squared with the injunctive order, is a long way from warranting a reversal and rendition for him. Only a brief consideration of the alternatives is necessary to bear this out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">If we proceed on the assumption that what was intended was a criminal contempt, the procedure just does not begin to meet the requirements of the law. There was, first, no apparent consideration of F.R.Crim.P. 42(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">To begin with, there was no plain statement in the order or other papers showing that the proceeding was one in criminal contempt. The Rule, in requiring that \u201ca criminal contempt * * * shall be prosecuted on notice,\u201d provides that (1) \u201c[t]he notice * * * shall state the essential facts constituting the criminal contempt charged and describe it as such\u201d and (2) \u201c[t]he notice shall be given [a] orally by the judge in open court in the presence of the defendant or, [b] on application of the United States attorney or of an attorney appointed by the court for that purpose, by an order to show cause or an order of arrest.\u201d There is nothing in the record to indicate that a notice meeting these requirements (1) was given by Judge Thomas in open court (2a). Nor did the order to show cause (see note 6, supra, and accompanying text) comply with these requirements (1). Neither was it entered on application of the United States Attorney or of an attorney appointed by the Court for that purpose (2b). The record reflects no designation by the Court of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to prosecute a criminal contempt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">And in the extensive memorandum opinion order finding Sheriff Clark guilty there is nothing to indicate that these findings were made beyond a reasonable doubt rather than by a mere preponderance of the evidence. See Cliett v. Hammonds, supra, 305 F.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-12\">But even more important, until the question of the \u00a7 1995 jury trial provision came up in the motion for new trial after the order of contempt, the record shows absolutely no consideration of the serious question of jury trial for criminal contempt. Quite apart from the application of the \u00a7 1995 jury trial de novo provision \u2014 a matter on which we express no opinion \u2014 the District Court was from the beginning inescapably faced with the problem arising under \u00a7\u00a7 402<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>and 3691,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the effect of which is to grant a jury trial for criminal contempt ,in non-government actions where the actions alleged to have transgressed the order constitute a violation of Federal or State law. On this point we agree with the candid statement by the Government as amicus that if this were a criminal contempt proceeding, the conduct asserted to be contemptuous was, at least arguably, a violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 242,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 241,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> if not of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1509.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In either situation, \u00a7\u00a7 402 and 3691 assured a jury trial unless it were waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-19\">The result is really no better if we assume it was intended as a civil contempt proceeding. This hypothesis requires, of course, that we disregard as decisive the criminal connotation of the words ordering Sheriff Clark \u201cto pay a fine in the amount of\u201d $1500. This we may do, for reading them as might properly be done as an imprecise, perhaps inaccurate characterization,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it is per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>missible under some circumstances for the Court to require a civil contemnor to be required to pay a specific sum, not as a sanction to assure further compliance, but as compensation to or offset of damages of the adversary because of a past dereliction. The Supreme Court has made this clear. \u201cWe have no doubts concerning the power of the District Court to order respondents, in order to purge themselves of contempt, to pay the damages caused by their violations of the decree,\u201d for \u201c[t]he measure of the court\u2019s power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the requirements of full remedial relief\u201d which may include \u201cthe payment of money.\u201d McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 1949, 336 U.S. 187, 193-194, 69 S.Ct. 497, 500, 93 L.Ed. 599, 605. And in United States v. United Mine Workers, 1947, 330 U.S. 258, 303-304, 67 S.Ct. 677, 701, 91 L.Ed. 884, 918, the Court said: \u201cJudicial sanctions in civil contempt proceedings may, in a proper case, be employed for either or both of two purposes: to coerce the \u2022defendant into compliance with the \u2022court\u2019s order, and to compensate the \u2022complainant for losses sustained.\u201d The \u2022 controlling principle here is that \u201cWhere \u2022compensation is intended, a fine is imposed, payable to the complainant.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\"> Of course, several things are required if a compensatory \u201cpenalty\u201d is to be imposed in a civil contempt. One certainly is a clear indication of the party to whom it is to be paid. Another is a sufficient record basis for the propriety of such an award and, in a broad sense at least, the amount of it. Ordinarily, of course, the civil contempt fine \u201cmust not exceed the actual loss to the complainant caused by respondent\u2019s violation of the decree in the main cause plus complainant\u2019s reasonable expenses in the proceedings necessitated in presenting the contempt for the judgment of the court.\u201d Parker v. United States, 1 Cir., 1946, 153 F.2d 66, 71, 163 A.L.R. 379, approved Boylan v. Detrio, 5 Cir., 1951, 187 F.2d 375, 379. See, e. g., Yanish v. Barber, 9 Cir., 1956, 232 F.2d 939, 944; United States v. Montgomery, D.Mont. 1957, 155 F.Supp. 633, 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">Neither of these is here met. The order is silent as to whom the fine it to be paid. More important, if, as certainly might properly be the case, it was thought this was a means of defraying costs and expenses incurred by the private plaintiffs in working up the show cause order and the proof on the hearing thereof, there ought to have been some formal proof on these subordinate elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">It is evident therefore that the present findings, as such, cannot stand. Except to encourage to the maximum extent possible consistent with the rights of the parties the fullest use of the present record supplemented as might be necessary on the further hearings to be held below, we do not undertake to blueprint the nature and character of those proceedings on remand. If the District Court concludes that a charge for criminal contempt is to be asserted, then all of the safeguards required by F.R. Crim.P. 42 and the law must be assured. Panico v. United States, 1963, 375 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>29, 84 S.Ct. 19, 11 L.Ed.2d 1; Cliett v. Hammonds, supra. These safeguards include, as appropriate, a jury trial under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 402, 3691.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And now, by virtue of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 1966, 384 U.S. 373, 86 S.Ct. 1523, 16 L.Ed.2d 629 [June 6, 1966], a jury trial is also necessary where the penalty to be imposed for criminal contempt exceeds that provided for petty offenses.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If, on the other hand, the Court intends that this be for civil contempt, the relief must be similarly oriented with, of course, appropriate record proof. This is certainly true as to any compensatory penalty awarded to the complainants or counsel for these past alleged derelictions, especially since, at this date and the passage of intervening legislation and other developments,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> further compliance with the injunctive orders is neither needed nor facilitated by typical money sanctions to coerce compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Vacated and remanded.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1995 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-12\">\u201cIn all cases of criminal contempt arising under the provisions of this Act [Civil Rights Act of 1957, see note 2, infra], the accused, upon conviction, shall be punished by fine or imprisonment or both: <em>Provided however, </em>That in case the accused is a natural person the f\u00edne to be paid shall not exceed the sum of $1,000, nor shall imprisonment exceed the term of six months: * * * <em>Provided further, hoioever, </em>That in the event such proceeding for criminal contempt be tried before a judge without a jury and the sentence of the court upon conviction is a fine in excess of the sum 362 F.2d \u2014 63 of $300 oi- imprisonment in excess of forty-five days, the accused in said proceeding, upon demand therefor, shall be entitled to a trial de novo before a jury, which shall conform as near as may be to the practice in other criminal eases.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1045-22\">.

Until this Court on the eve of submission invited the United States Attorney to appear as amicus, the entire burden below and here of sustaining the Court\u2019s order and contempt order has been borne by counsel for the private plaintiffs. One of the strong markers pointing away from criminal contempt is the unlikelihood of Judge Thomas having appointed plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to carry this prosecutory role in view of the Government\u2019s heavy involvement in related and then pending governmental suits against Sheriff Clark and others in this very civil rights voter registration controversy.

The legislative history indicates that its primary purpose is to reach interference with school desegregation orders by individuals who are not parties against whom the orders were issued, nor acting in concert with such parties, and who are thus not usually subject to contempt sanctions.

Stating the relevant test as being \u201cwhat does the court primarily seek to accomplish by imposing sentence?\u201d, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-6\">\u201cThe fact that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals called petitioners\u2019 conduct \u2018criminal contempt\u2019 \u2022does not disturb our conclusion [that the contempt was civil].

Thus, the view \u2014 characterized as \u201cdictum\u201d \u2014 expressed by some unidentified members of the Court in footnote 12 of United States v.

Schnackenberg, supra, 384 U.S. at 380, 86 S.Ct. at 1526, 16 L.Ed.2d at 634. Relying on the classification established by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1, the Court held that sentences exceeding six months\u2019 imprisonment exceed the penalty provided for petty offenses and thus require a jury trial. Neither here nor in <em>Barnett </em>did the Court, concerned primarily with the risk of long prison terms, address itself to the problem whether the $500 fine provision of \u00a7 1 likewise becomes a maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1051-21\">.
