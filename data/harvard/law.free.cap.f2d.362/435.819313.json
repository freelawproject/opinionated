The petitions present common questions of law and substantially similar facts and therefore are considered together in this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The facts surrounding the petition of Callaway Mills Company and Callaway Mills, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Callaway) may be outlined as follows: Callaway is a Georgia corporation which manufactures a wide variety of textile products. Prior to 1950 it was engaged primarily in the manufacture of cloth goods such as towels, draperies, industrial fabrics and similar products. In the manufacture of some of those products, such as bedspreads and bathmats, it used a process known in the industry as \u201ctufting.\u201d Instead of weaving an entire piece of cloth at one time, a machine pushes a continuous loop of . yarn through a previously manufactured backing and secures it by applying a coating of latex to the underside. During 1950, Callaway successfully adapted this process to the manufacture of carpeting. This accomplishment had a pronounced effect on the carpeting industry, since the tufting process is much more rapid and thus less expensive than the standard weaving process which had been used by older carpet manufacturers for many years. Very soon Calla-way began producing tufted carpeting in competition with the \u201cold line\u201d manufacturers who also began using the tufting process along with their weaving process.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">For years prior to 1950 and continuing until these proceedings were instituted, the \u201cold line\u201d manufacturers had been granting annual graduated volume discounts to their purchasers who were mostly retail department and home furnishing stores. These discounts ranged from 1 to 5 per cent depending upon the total dollar amount a retailer purchased during a given year. They were usually granted on the total sales of all products from the manufacturer; and \u201cchains\u201d or \u201cbuying groups\u201d were allowed to \u201cpool\u201d their purchases to benefit from a higher volume. Naturally, the more a retailer purchased, the less the carpeting cost per square yard. The important effect of the discounts was that they gave a competitive advantage to those retailers who were large enough to buy in volumes which qualified for the higher discount percentages.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">This litigation brings into focus a rather unusual situation in two respects. First, the record clearly demonstrates an effort on the part of small manufacturers to enter the market and compete with large companies who have been in the carpeting business for many years. Usually, cases of this type reveal an effort on the part of large, powerful and dominant manufacturers to exert economic pressure on small ones. Secondly, the record further shows clearly that the carpet industry has been entrapped to a degree by the well established practice of granting volume discounts which they all apparently wish to discontinue. As early as 1939 there was a concerted effort by the industry to end the practice. This effort was nullified, however, when the Justice Department filed suit seeking to enjoin the manufacturers from terminating the practice on an industry-wide basis. A consent decree was obtained which forbade any agreement or conspiracy \u201cto refrain from giving volume allowances or rebates to purchasers of rugs and carpets.\u201d United States v. Institute of Carpet Manufacturers et al., 1 F.R.D. 636 (S.D.N.Y.1941). Thus, the situation has persisted, and buyers have continued to demand the discounts. No manufacturer has been able to abandon the system alone. It is obvious that all competitors must follow the system or abandon it together, but they are forbidden to do so by the above-mentioned decree. The existence of the practice, full knowledge as to the amount of the discounts, the fact that such discounts are a real and vital factor in the carpeting business, and that customers demand such discounts is a matter of common knowledge to all who are acquainted with the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Prior to 1955 Callaway had refused to give its purchasers volume discounts. However, the record reveals that the purchasers were exerting increasing pressure on it to do so. As a result, Callaway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>adopted the following schedule of discounts :</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Aggregate Annual Purchases Discount</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">$ 5,000- 7,999 1%</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">8,000-14,999 2%</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">15.000- 29,999 3%</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">30.000- 49,999 \u2018 4%</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">50,000 and over <em>5%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The <em>dollar volume levels </em>at which the discount percentage figures were set in Cal-laway\u2019s schedule were appreciably lower than those of its competitors, but the schedule of its competitors embraced woven as well as tufted carpets as hereafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">In 1959, the Federal Trade Commission filed a Complaint against Callaway (and a number of the other manufacturers ; see footnote 1) charging it with violation of Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because it had discriminated in price between purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality to the detriment of competition between them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to the hearing below, Callaway and Counsel supporting the Complaint entered into a written stipulation whereby Callaway admitted the Section 2(a) violation and agreed to limit its case to proof of a \u201cmeeting the competition\u201d defense as set out in Section 2(b) of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties also agreed to limit the scope of the inquiry to the sample trade areas of Cleveland, Ohio; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Boston, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-17\">During the hearing Callaway produced as witnesses a number of agents for purchasers who testified substantially to the following: Callaway\u2019s line of tufted carpeting was \u201ccompetitive\u201d with the tufted carpeting in the competitors\u2019 lines when sold at comparable list prices. Cal-laway\u2019s competitors had been giving annual volume discounts for a number of years prior to Callaway\u2019s entry into the market. Prior to its granting of discounts, Callaway\u2019s carpeting cost more per square yard than comparable carpeting in competitors\u2019 lines. The retailers could not pass the higher cost of Callaway\u2019s carpeting to the customer because carpeting sells at established pricing points usually 5 cents under the dollar, i. e., $4.95, $6.95, $7.95 per square yard. The retailers pressured Callaway to give discounts by warning that they would otherwise discontinue buying from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">Callaway officials testified that Calla-way had resisted giving discounts. Officers of the company spent a great deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>of time considering the proper system of discounts. They arrived at the decision to grant them only in order to maintain their present position in the market. The officials also clearly explained why they set the percentage discount figures at lower volume levels than the competition by showing that (1) Callaway makes only tufted carpeting which has never accounted for more than 40-45% of the total carpeting market, while the competition sold both tufted and woven carpeting which accounts for the remainder of the market; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) Callaway sold in the $4.95 to $13.95 price range while competitors sold carpets which retailed as high as $49.95 and more. Because of resulting smaller volume sales to each customer Callaway had to reduce its volume levels in the schedule to a point where the <em>net per unit price </em>after discounts of any given style of carpet would be approximately the same as that of comparable carpeting of the competition. Finally, Callaway produced extensive charts showing that net prices for its carpets of essentially the same style, design and other similar factors, (less discounts and early payment allowances) were substantially equal to those of the competition. <em>There was no rebuttal evidence whatsoever presented by Counsel supporting the Complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The hearing examiner found that Callaway had made out a defense under Section 2(b) and dismissed the Complaint. The Commission, with Commissioner Elman dissenting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reversed the hearing examiner on the grounds that Callaway (1) failed to carry its burden under the Section 2(b) defense because it failed to show that its products were of \u201clike grade and quality\u201d as those of the competition; (2) had adopted a \u201cformal pricing system\u201d instead of meeting each individual competitive situation as it arose; and (3) had actually <em>undercut </em>the competition by granting discounts at lower volume levels. <em>Callaway Mills, </em>Docket No. 7634,____FTC____ (1964). Callaway then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">Cabin Crafts, Inc. (CC) is also a Georgia corporation, which prior to 1950 had been in the textile business. After Callaway adapted the tufting process to the manufacture of carpeting, CC also entered the tufted carpeting field. CC\u2019s pre-Complaint experience was similar to Callaway\u2019s in most respects except that after an actual decline in sales during 1955, it offered the following lower discount schedule after Callaway: <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">Aggregate Annual Purchases Discount</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">Up to $ 9,999 0%</p>\n<p id=\"A0M\">$10,000- 19,000 1%</p>\n<p id=\"ab-dedup-0\">20,000- 34,999 iy2%</p>\n<p id=\"Adp\">35,000- 49,999 2%</p>\n<p id=\"AK5\">50,000 or more</p>\n<p id=\"AiP\">Prior to the hearing before the examiner, CC also stipulated the existence of a prima facie case under Section 2(a) and limited its proof to a Section 2(b) defense. During its hearing, CC offered the testimony of one Mr. Brenner, its Vice-President for Sales, who had a wide and varied experience in the carpeting industry both with CC and previously with its competitors. Mr. Brenner testified that purchasers had asked for discounts and its sales were \u201cthreatened\u201d because of CC\u2019s failure to give them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>He further stated that discounts were given on a smaller percentage basis than either Callaway or the other competitors because that was all CC could afford. He also testified that CC\u2019s line of carpeting was competitive and, indeed, \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with that of its competitors\u2019 products at the same price level.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\n<em>Again Counsel supporting the Complaint offered no rebuttal evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The examiner found for CC and dismissed the Complaint. Again, however, the Commission overruled the examiner and found that CC had (1) failed to show its line was of \u201clike grade and quality\u201d with that of its competitors; (2) adopted a \u201cformal pricing system\u201d; and (3) failed to produce \u201cprice lists\u201d conclusively showing it was meeting the equally low price of the competition. <em>Cabin Crafts, Inc., </em>Docket No. 7639, ____ FTC .... (1964). CC then perfected its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">I. \u201cLike Grade and Quality\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The Commission held in both its Calla-way and CC opinions that the petitioners failed to carry their burdens of showing that their price discriminations were a \u201cgood faith\u201d attempt to meet an equally low price of a competitor because each had failed to present evidence that its carpets at various price levels were \u201ccomparable in materials and construction to the products of competitors at similar price levels.\u201d In its holding in <em>Callaway </em>(and by reference in CC) the Commission stated the following at ---- FTC</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201cA discriminatory lower price set to \u2018meet\u2019 the price of inferior goods is in effect an undercutting of the latter price, and such a discriminatory price cannot be characterized as defensive, for it goes beyond the provocation which engendered it. There is no showing in this record that respondents\u2019 carpets at various price levels were comparable in materials and construction to the carpets of competitors at similar price levels. Rugs and carpets are not fungible goods of the nature of cement, oil or glucose. The quality and saleability of carpeting depend upon many variables and it offends our common sense to completely ignore all such possible differences and hold, sans affirmative evidence, as did the hearing examiner, that carpeting made by Callaway to sell at a certain price level is similar in grade and quality to all carpeting made by Calla-way\u2019s competitors to sell at approximately the same level. As a matter of fact, there is some evidence in this record that certain of the favored buyers did not consider the goods they were buying from Callaway as either \u2018competitive\u2019 or \u2018comparable\u2019 with goods they were buying from others. Respondents should have introduced proof as to the comparative quality and saleability of their goods and the competitive goods allegedly defended against. Lacking such proof the finding that Callaway was meeting the price of its competitors is speculative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">\u201cBoth the courts and the Commission have consistently denied the shelter of the defense to sellers whose products, because of intrinsic superior quality or intense public demand, normally commands a price higher than that usually received by sellers of competitive goods. For example, the defense will not lie when the price of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Lucky Strikes is dropped to the level of a \u2018poorer grade'of cigarettes,\u2019 Porto Rican American Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., 30 F.2d 234, 237 (2d Cir. 1929), cert. denied, 279 U.S. 858 [49 S.Ct. 353, 73 L.Ed. 999] (1929); when the price of Budweiser beer is dropped to match the price of \u2018non-premium\u2019 local beers, Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 54 F.T.C. 277, set aside for other reasons, 265 F.2d 677 (7th Cir. 1959), rev\u2019d. 363 U.S. 536 [80 S.Ct. 1267, 4 L.Ed.2d 1385] (1960), again set aside for other reasons 289 F.2d 835 (7th Cir. 1961); and, when the price of a \u2018premium\u2019 automatic control is set above the price of less acceptable controls, Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., 44 F.T.C. 351, rev\u2019d. on other grounds, 191 F.2d 786 (7th Cir. 1951), cert. dismissed, 344 U.S. 206 [73 S.Ct. 245, 97 L.Ed. 245] (1952).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In other words, the Commission ruled that it cannot be determined whether there had been a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to meet the equally low price of a competing product without clear proof that petitioner\u2019s products were of \u201clike grade and quality\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> with that of the competition because it is always possible that, as in the previous FTC cases cited by the Commission, the public <em>was willing to pay more </em>for their products than those of competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The Commission committed error on this point by equating \u201cgrade and quality\u201d with \u201csaleability.\u201d The two are not synonymous. It is obvious that the consuming public, being far less aware of such factors as \u201ccraftsmanship and materials\u201d than professional carpetmakers, cannot easily discern differences in quality between comparable carpeting.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, the public is greatly influenced by such intangibles as color, design, display, advertising, and similar factors. So long as petitioners conclusively show that their products at various price levels generate public demand (or \u201csaleability\u201d) substantially equivalent to that of competitors\u2019 carpeting at the same price levels, considerations of \u201cgrade and quality\u201d become unnecessary and indeed superfluous, for the most \u201cgrade and quality\u201d can do is tend to show \u201csaleability.\u201d See Balian Ice Cream Co. v. Arden Farms Co., 231 F.2d 356 (9 Cir. 1955). Moreover, the Commission completely ignored abundant unre-butted testimony in both cases which clearly demonstrated or would support the inference that petitioners\u2019 products at the various price levels possessed qualities of \u201csaleability\u201d comparable to that of its competitors\u2019 products. It also surprisingly ignored <em>substantial </em>evidence actually showing \u201clike grade and quality.\u201d For instance, Mr. Brenner in the CC hearing said its carpets were \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with those of the competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">II. \u201cFormal Pricing System\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The Commission further ruled that by granting volume discounts, petitioners simply <em>adopted </em>a \"formal pricing system\u201d instead of meeting each individual competitive situation as it ar\u00f3se. Therefore, petitioners failed to show a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to meet a competitor\u2019s price. Implicit in the rationale of the Commission\u2019s opinion is the suggestion that Cal-laway and CC should have adopted a policy of lowering their prices on carpeting in a wholly piecemeal fashion, meeting the exact price at which any given competitor sold a certain type or style of carpeting to any particular customer. It relies on FTC v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948); FTC v. A. E. Staley Mfg. Co., 324 U.S. 746, 65 S.Ct. 971, 89 L.Ed. 1338 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">We find this reasoning to be erroneous for the following three reasons. First, there is nothing wrong <em>per se </em>with <em>adopting </em>a. \u201cpricing system\u201d used by competitors. Secondly, the Commission completely disregarded the realities of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u25a0competitive conditions prevalent in the carpeting industry. Thirdly, the Commission failed to give proper consideration to the undisputed facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">It is important to examine in some detail the manner in which carpeting is sold. Each manufacturer makes a wide variety of carpeting of different quality to be sold by retailers at various \u201cpricing points\u201d which range from a low of $2.95 up to prices exceeding $49.95 per square yard in progressive increments of $1.00 per square yard. Often, there is a difference in construction, design, patterns, \u25a0colors, or materials between carpets selling at the same price level, presenting an infinite variety from which customers :may choose. All the different \u201cstyles\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2022or types of carpets taken together make up a manufacturer\u2019s \u201cline.\u201d When one multiplies the broad number of styles with the number of manufacturers (approximately fifty to sixty), the number of different types of carpeting is quite large. According to the record, with minor exceptions, a retailer shows a manufacturer\u2019s \u201cline\u201d of goods to the public .and then orders his requirements on a sale-by-sale basis. To price each style of its carpeting with specific reference to .all the different styles of every competitive line, as suggested by the Commission, would require the petitioners to \u25a0engage in <em>exhaustive </em>cost studies on the \u25a0multitude of carpets on the market <em>before they are actually sold and before any discounts are given. </em>Such a procedure would be burdensome, unreasonable, and practically unfeasible. Even assuming petitioners could successfully forecast the ;prices at which their competitors were going to sell, they could not <em>possibly </em>\u25a0determine how much each purchaser would buy during the year from each \u25a0manufacturer in order to determine the ;size of the competitor\u2019s discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"> As the Supreme Court said in FTC v. A. E. Staley IVtfg. Co., supra, \u201cthe \u25a0statute does not place an impossible burden upon sellers.\u201d In the circumstances and under the facts of this case, Callaway and CC could in \u201cgood faith\u201d attempt to meet the competition by granting similar volume discounts especially since no workable alternative is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We have found no authority which holds that in all circumstances the allowance of volume discounts according to a plan or \u201csystem\u201d as distinguished from \u201cindividual competitive\u201d responses is condemned per se. Clearly, this is not a \u201cbasing-point\u201d case. FTC v. Standard Oil Co., 355 U.S. 396, 78 S.Ct. 369, 2 L.Ed.2d 359 (1958). It is only when no \u201creasonable and prudent person\u201d would conclude that the adopted system is a reasonable method of meeting the lower price of a competitor that it is condemned. That decision must be made on a case-by-case basis. The adoption of the competitor\u2019s system in <em>Staley </em>and <em>Cement </em>had the effect of raising prices to certain purchasers through \u201cphantom\u201d freight charges and thus creating <em>greater </em>discrimination than necessary. Obviously, that was not a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort. Such is not the case here. Under the totality of the circumstances, the discount system, <em>thoughtfully tailored by both petitioners to meet their individual problems in the market, </em>was a mature and reasoned approach to a very real and difficult competitive problem; and petitioners carried their burden of showing \u201cgood faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">III. Undercutting</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In complete disagreement with the findings of the trial examiner and material, substantial and unrebutted evidence to the contrary, the Commission made the following statement in <em>Calla-way:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201cIt is no answer to contend, as do the respondents and the hearing examiner, that so-called \u2018old line\u2019 companies have a broader product line (i.e., both woven and tufted carpeting) and that respondents\u2019 qualifying purchase vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>umes must hence be lower. The plain fact is that respondents are offering lower net prices on an equivalent volume of purchases and this constitutes undercutting, not meeting, a competitor\u2019s prices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Such is simply not the case, and we reject the Commission\u2019s conclusions as arbitrary. Minneapolis-Honeywell Reg. Co. v. FTC, 191 F.2d 786 (7 Cir. 1951). The. evidence shows that Callaway sold less to its customers because it had a smaller, less expensive line; and, therefore, it had to lower its qualifying volumes so that a customer would receive the same percentage discount it would have received from a competitor from whom it would ordinarily be buying larger quantities, such additional quantities usually resulting from the fact that most competitors sold both woven and tufted lines. Furthermore, charts in the record reveal that the effect of the lower volume levels was to meet, not undercut the competition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">IV. \u201cPrice Lists\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Finally, the Commission ruled that CC failed to carry its burden under Section 2(b) because it failed to produce \u201cprice lists\u201d comparing its net prices after discounts with those of the competition. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">\u201cStated otherwise, it is necessary, for us to compare the net prices offered by respondent with the net prices of its competitors which it was purportedly meeting to determine the existence of the requisite good faith. To accomplish this result, we must relate the discounts to the prices of comparable merchandise to determine whether respondent\u2019s net price was lower than those of competitor. Such a result is impossible without the price lists of respondent and its relevant competitors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">We disagree. CC need not show its prices were <em>in fact </em>equal to those of competitors, but must only show facts which would lead a \u201creasonable and prudent person\u201d to believe that the granting of lower prices would in fact meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>equally low price of a competitor. FTC v. A. E. Staley Mfg, Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Although he was fully credited as a reliable expert witness, Complaint Counsel suggests that the testimony of Vice-President Brenner of Cabin Crafts should be rejected because it was based on hearsay testimony or that his testimony was elicited by leading questions. We disagree. This witness was shown to be widely experienced in the industry over an extended period of years and to be thoroughly familiar with the commodities, market prices, trade practices, and the competitive problems involved. His testimony clearly established that Cabin Crafts is one of the small manufacturers which has undertaken to enter the'carpet manufacturing business in recent years. For a number of years it offered no discounts but was constantly confronted with the demands of powerful purchasers to grant them in accordance with the industry-wide practice. It instituted the practice reluctantly and then only after its chief competitor, Callaway, commenced the practice. Even then Cabin Crafts did not permit chain stores to combine the purchases of all stores under common ownership as was ordinarily done. Its discounts were much less than those generally granted in the industry. In our view, the evidence sufficiently supports the 2(b) defense interposed by Cabin Crafts, and to hold otherwise would not only constitute a misinterpretation of the record but serious injustice would result. We conclude that CC had ample reason to believe that the granting of the discounts would only meet the competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">A reading of all the records and briefs convinces us the Commission erred in its decision in these two cases and that such decisions should be reversed and the respective orders vacated.

The difficulty inherent in meeting the volume discounts of competitors under the \u201cmeeting competition\u201d defense was recognized by the Report of the Attorney General\u2019s National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws, from which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-z\">\u201cAn incidental undercutting of the prices quoted by others, when in the course of genuinely meeting one particular competitor\u2019s equally low price offer, hence should not invalidate a seller\u2019s defense. At the same time, a seller responding to a rival\u2019s price should not be confined to quotations for a precisely equivalent quantity of goods.\u201d At p. 183 \u00fci \u00a1S \u00bb Sc *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">\u201cThe Committee further believes that a seller should not be forced to meet a competitor\u2019s equally low price to the last fraction of a cent. .Potent factors other than naked price determine a customer\u2019s choiee among competing offers \u2014 especially with consumer goods reflecting a broad range of quality, design, or brand. While basic homogeneous commodities such as crude oil, steel and cement normally present slight problems of consumer differentiation, electrical appliances or chemicals, for example, involve a broad range of significant competitive factors other than price. Here a mechanical test would defeat the objective of permitting a realistic equalization of an actual competitive situation. An inflexible cent-for-cent rule would enable a seller of the preferred commodity in fact to undercut the price for a less desirable product, or conversely, deprive the seller of a less popular product of the full benefit of the \u2018meeting competition\u2019 defense. We therefore urge a flexible rule which regards the nominal price of the rival product as only a presumptive boundary of a seller\u2019s permissible price reduction under the \u2018meeting competition\u2019 proviso, adjustable up or down upon satisfactory proof by the person questioning its reliability. In practical operation, such a test in some circumstances necessarily must permit a seller of a less accepted brand to cut substantially below the more popular product\u2019s price. Conversely, as the Com; mission has readily recognized, the seller of the premium commodity sometimes must not go down to the price level of the lesser product. In each case, the heart of the matter is whether actual competition, not merely a nominal price quotation, is equalized.\u201d At pp. 183-184</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
