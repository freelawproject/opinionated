In his motion, and at the hearing, petitioner contended that in the criminal proceedings:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">(1) his guilty plea was not voluntarily made but was induced by coercion and misrepresentation;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">(2) he was not represented by competent counsel;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\">(3) his admissions or confessions were illegally obtained from him;</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">(4) he was not promptly arraigned; and</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">(5) he was not mentally competent and not able to understand the nature of the proceedings against him, and to cooperate with counsel in his defense at all stages of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-17\">At the same hearing the District Court also considered as issues whether petitioner was competent at the time of the hearing on his motion, and whether he was adequately represented by competent counsel at such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">At the hearing petitioner testified as a witness, and called as witnesses his appointed counsel at the criminal proceedings, his codefendant in the criminal proceedings, and his codefendant\u2019s counsel in the criminal proceedings. Witnesses were called and testified on behalf of the respondent. Following a lengthy hearing the District Court made and entered detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and denied petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and sentence imposed upon him in the criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">We have carefully reviewed the record of the criminal proceedings and the transcript of testimony taken at the evidentiary hearing under \u00a7 2255. The findings of fact of the District Court are amply supported by the record. We are fully satisfied, as was the District Judge, that none of petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights were violated in the criminal proceedings. We are also in agreement with the findings of the District Court that petitioner was in full possession of his faculties and legally competent at all times during the hearing on his motion, and on such motion petitioner was represented by competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-20\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
