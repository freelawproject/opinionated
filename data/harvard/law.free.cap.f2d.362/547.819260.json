He points to the fact that opposite the title of the case in the caption, beneath the word \u201cIndictment\u201d and the docket number, appears in parentheses the following citation: \u201c(Title 18, Sec. 2113(a) and (b), USC)\u201d, and asserts that he was misled by the miscitation of the statute, thinking that he was pleading guilty to unarmed bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(b), rather than armed robbery under \u00a7 2113(d). But the record discloses the contrary, and reveals indeed that the trial judge, after first accepting appellant\u2019s plea of guilty, learned from appellant and his retained counsel that both were acting under the erroneous belief that appellant was being prosecuted for unarmed bank robbery under \u00a7 2113 (b), and thereupon set aside the guilty plea <em>sua sponte. </em>The District Court then postponed further proceedings to permit consultation between appellant and his attorney as to the charge of armed robbery under \u00a7 2113(d) as alleged in the body of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-22\">Later in the day, appellant returned into court with his counsel and then tendered his plea of guilty to the armed robbery charge; and the record made upon that second appearance reveals that the trial judge had the clerk again read the indictment to appellant, and metieu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>lously pointed out to him that the charge in the indictment was armed bank robbery and, before accepting appellant\u2019s plea of guilty, explained to him that the maximum period of imprisonment for that offense was twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">It is true, of course, that sub-division (c) of Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: \u201cThe indictment or information shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated.\u201d But the very next sentence declares that: \u201cError in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for * * * reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\u201d [18 U.S.C.A., Rule 7(c).]</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
