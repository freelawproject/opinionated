The Secretary does not dispute that the claimant is suffering from the effects of a fracture of the knee and a hip injury sustained in an automobile accident in 1959, but argues in support of the District Court\u2019s action that the claimant\u2019s disabilities are not of such a nature and severity as to preclude substantial gainful activity consistent with his age, education and occupational experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Simmons, now 44 years old, is entitled to benefits if he was disabled within the meaning of the Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on or before September 30, 1962, the last date of coverage. The testimony must be evaluated with this date in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">On March 9, 1961, the claimant\u2019s personal physician, Dr. L. B. Todd, was of the view that Simmons was \u201cunable to do usual work since injury in 1959 \u2014 still disabled.\u201d Simmons was referred by the West Virginia Rehabilitation Division to Dr. H. H. Kuhn, who recommended surgery, which he performed on May 4, 1961. Shortly thereafter Dr. Kuhn described Simmons\u2019 post-operative condition -as \u201cvery good.\u201d He re-examined Simmons on October 19, 1961 and again on January 26, 1962, and concluded that the \u201cpatellar (kneecap) grafting that I did is holding well and (the patient) has good quadriceps power.\u201d The doctor recommended continued exercise, as prescribed immediately after the operation, and counseled the patient to avoid \u201cheavy physical manual labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">On June 26, 1962, approximately one year after the operation and three months before the determinative date, Dr. Todd, the claimant\u2019s personal physician who before the operation had expressed the opinion that Simmons was disabled, now reported to the Social Security Administration that \u201cmy findings of this patient are such that I cannot recommend that he be classified as totally and permanently disabled.\u201d However, on January 4, 1963, three months after the determinative date, Dr. Todd declared that Simmons could not do any kind of physical labor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the medical reports do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>not definitively resolve the issue of the severity of claimant\u2019s disability, a review of the evidence relating to Simmons\u2019 vocational activities takes on special importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Although claimant\u2019s family lives in Quinwood, West Virginia, Simmons was last employed before his accident by the National Screw and Manufacturing Company in Cleveland, Ohio, where he worked for three years as a plater learner, con-cededly skilled labor. Following the accident, from April 19, 1960 until April 6, 1962, he worked as a laborer in a program conducted by West Virginia\u2019s Rehabilitation Division and received assistance from the State\u2019s program for Aid to Dependent Children. The work he performed for the Rehabilitation Division was the clearing and gathering of brush along the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Simmons testified at the hearing on September 11, 1964,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that he owned 152 acres of wood land which he had bought in 1960, and that in August, 1964, he completed cutting the wood for pulp. He further testified that from April, 1964 through August, 1964, he supervised the cutting and delivery of the pulpwood, and demonstrated to his son how to use a gasoline driven saw to cut the trees. The pulpwood had to be delivered to the buyer 65 miles away, and Simmons admitted that he drove the delivery truck part of the way. During 1963 and 1964, aside from the pulpwood operation, claimant also engaged in buying and selling cows, and occasionally milked them himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In October, 1962, and January, 1963, Simmons was refused employment as a gasoline station attendant because of his leg and hip injuries. However, it appears that the conclusions of the three service station operators that Simmons was unable to work were based primarily on statements to that effect made to them by Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">In light of the claimant\u2019s activity in connection with his pulpwood enterprise and his cows, and in light of his work for the Rehabilitation Division, we cannot say that there is a lack of substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the Hearing Examiner that Simmons \u201chas pursued many activities in the last several years quite inconsistent with the suggestion that he suffers from intractable pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">There is evidence that <em>this </em>claimant can engage and has engaged in a <em>particular </em>occupation. This concrete showing compels affirmance of the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the claimant\u2019s disabilities are not of such severity as to prevent him from engaging in substantial gainful activity, despite the fact that a contrary conclusion may also be reasonable. The case is, therefore, quite different from those where the Secretary, in denying benefits, relies on abstractions based on the Department of Labor\u2019s \u201cDictionary of Occupational Titles\u201d to support his determination that jobs are generally available to \u201caverage\u201d persons of the claimant\u2019s general class. We have reversed the Secretary in those cases, and have consistently rejected such perfunctory resort to theoretical vocational guidelines for the so-called \u201caverage\u201d man. E. g., Williams v. Celebrezze, 359 F.2d 950 (4th Cir. 1966); Wimmer v. Celebrezze, 355 F.2d 289 (4th Cir. 1966); Hall v. Cele-brezze, 347 F.2d 937 (4th Cir. 1965); Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192, 196-197 (4th Cir. 1965); Ray v. Celebrezze, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>340 F.2d 556 (4th Cir. 1965).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record here is different, for it furnishes a substantial, though debatable, factual rather than speculative basis for the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-10\">. Sections 216(1) and 223 of the Social Security Act, as amended by Act of July 30, 1965, Pub.L. 89-97. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 416 (i) and 423.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">. Other doctors also submitted reports. The two most favorable to Simmons\u2019 claim could reasonably be deemed by the fact finder entitled to less weight than the opinions of Dr. Todd and Dr. Kuhn, treating physicians who examined the patient on a number of occasions and at times closer to the crucial date, September 30, 1962. One of these physicians was Dr. J. E. Echols, who examined Simmons on May 7, 1963, and considered him unemployable. However, Dr. Echols saw Simmons only once in connection with his leg injury, and this examination was not very extensive. Accordingly this may have diminished the significance of the opinion in the judgment of the fact finder. Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192, 196 (4th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>1965). The other physician was Dr. R. L. Anderson, who after examining the claimant in August, 1964, reported that he had difficulty in getting up and walking and was handicapped by multiple arthritis of the spine, hips, and knees. Dr. Anderson\u2019s examination, though apparently more thorough than Dr. Echols\u2019, was not made till nearly two years after the determinative date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-13\">. An .earlier hearing was held on August 29, 1963, following which the Hearing Examiner denied claimant\u2019s application for benefits. Upon motion of the Secretary, however, the District Court on April 14, 1964, remanded the case for further proceedings, and the September 11, 1964 hearing ensued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-13\">. We have also reversed the denial of benefits where a regulation designed to supplement and guide in the administration of the statute was applied so dogmatically as to subvert the statute and its basic goal. Heslep v. Celebrezze, 356 F.2d 891 (4th Cir. 1966). See also Marion v. Gardner, 359 F.2d 175 (8th Cir. 1966). Reversal was similarly compelled where the denial of benefits was the product of an unwarranted disregard of subjective testimony. Mode v. Celebrezze, 359 F.2d 135 (4th Cir. 1966). See Heslep v. Celebrezze, supra; Celebrezze v. Walter, 346 F.2d 156 (5th Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
