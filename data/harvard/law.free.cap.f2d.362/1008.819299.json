The facts and applicable law are set out in our opinion rendered on the first appeal, reported at 323 F.2d 1 (1963), and we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-16\">On the first appeal, we remanded to give appellant an opportunity to substantiate its charge that appellee had violated section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, by showing (1) a contract, combination, or conspiracy among appellee and its distributors which effected a group boycott of the product of a competing manufacturer, or (2) that the appellee\u2019s semi-exclusive distributorship arrangement was \u201cso anti-competitive, in purpose or effect, or both, as to be an unreasonable restraint of trade.\u201d 323 F.2d at 7-8. On remand, discovery procedures were completed and depositions submitted to the district court. Following oral argument of appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, that court granted appellant\u2019s request for additional time to present \u201caffidavits or make any other showing he desired in opposition to the showing made in support of the motion.\u201d Such affidavits and further showing were not forthcoming, and the district court granted the summary judgment from which this appeal is taken. The evidence presented does not show any contract, combination, or conspiracy to effect a group boycott; still less does it show any \u201cunreasonableness\u201d in the restraint effected. At most, it shows a condition to dealing unilaterally laid down by appellee, and appellee\u2019s refusal to abandon that condition in various conversations between appellee and individual distributors wherein those distributors attempted to obtain relinquishment of the condition. This, as our previous opinion shows, is not enough to establish liability under section 1 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-17\">Other contentions made by appellant were either made or could have been made on the first appeal, and need not be discussed here. Calhoun v. Bernard, 9 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 400; cf. Department of Fish &amp; Game v. FPC, 9 Cir., 1966, 359 F.2d 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
