The District Court for the District of Connecticut held that \u201cthe arbitrator exceeded and abused his authority when lie attempted to read into the agreement \"this implied contractual relationship,\u201d .and it vacated and set aside the arbitrator\u2019s award. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><em>^ </em>In its company newsletter of Decem- <em>( </em>ber 1962, Torrington announced that it ) was discontinuing its twenty-year policy ) of permitting employees time off with (pay to vote on election days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This policy had been unilaterally instituted by the company and was not a part of the \u2022then-existing collective bargaining .agreement, which contained an extremely narrow arbitration provision. The Union did not attempt to arbitrate this issue. Rather, on April 9, 1963, it filed a many-faceted complaint with the National Labor Relations Board which included a charge that the unilateral change of election day policy constituted an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The Union later dropped this charge, and the Board dismissed the entire complaint on July 29, 1963. In August, the parties began negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, as the old contract was due to' expire Septem,ber 27, 1963. At the first meeting, Tor-Irington informed the Union that it did not intend to reestablish its paid time off for voting policy. The Union responded by including a contrary provision in its written demands presented at a meeting in August or early September.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">At this point, the record is somewhat unclear as to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations. We know that in the written proposals made by Torrington (September 26) and by the Union (October 25), <em>each </em>suggested that the old contract be continued with specific amendments, none of which involved the election day policy. We know that a lon'g and costly strike began when the old 'contract expired on September 27, that some employees worked during the strike, and that those employees were not given [paid time off for the November 1963 elections. AndJtisjconceded by all that the current contract, signed on January 18, 1964, contained, likeTh\u00e9 old, no men\u25a0tion of paid time off for voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">When the 1964 elections became imminent, Torrington\u2019s understanding of its rights under the new contract was revealed by a union flier to the employees dated November 2, 1964. The Union reported that, \u201cThe Torrington Company has again stated that you will <em>not </em>be allowed the one hour time off for voting 'this year.\u201d This time, however, the Union was armed with a new weapon, for the new contract contained a much less restrictive arbitration clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>on December 17, 1964, the Union filed the grievance which underlies this case. When no solution was reached by the parties, application was made to the American Arbitration Association for determination under its Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules, and the arbitrator was selected by the parties. A hearing was held on May 19, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In his written decision, the arbitrator! first held that the dispute was arbitrable under the new contract\u2019s arbitration clause even though the contract contained no express provision for paid time off for voting, a decision which is not challenged. See, e. g., United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960); Procter &amp; Gamble Independent Union of Port Ivory v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 298 F.2d 644 (2 Cir. 1962). Compare Metal Prods. Workers Union, etc. v. Torrington Co., 358 F.2d 103 (2 Cir. 1966). He then ruled that the benefit of paid time off to vote was a firmly established practice at Torring-ton, that the company therefore had the burden of changing this policy by.-negotiating with the Union, and that in ttie negotiations which culminated in the current bargaining agreement the narties did not agree to terminate this nrac-tice. Finding further that this employee benefit was not within management\u2019s prerogative under the \u201cmanagement functions\u201d clause of the contract,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the arbitrator held that employees who took time off to vote on November 3, 1964, or who worked on that day and had received an election benefit in 1962 must be paid a comparable benefit for Election Day 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The company petitioned to vacate the award. Judge Clarie agreed with the arbitrator that the practice at issue had been long established at Torrington prior to 1963. But he also found that, \u201cThroughout the negotiations [of 1963-1964], the plaintiff employer persistently reiterated its position not to grant this benefit [in the new contract].\u201d Commenting that, \u201cLabor, contracts generally affirmatively state the terms which the contracting parties agree to ; not what practices they agree tp discontinue,\u201d Judge Clarie held that the arbitrator had\" gone outside the terms of the contract and thus had exceeded his authority by reading the election day benefit into the new contract after the parties had negotiated the issue but had made no such provision in that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The essence of the Union\u2019s argument on appeal is that, in deciding that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in making this award, the District Court exceeded the scope of its authority and -improperly examined the merits of the arbitrator\u2019s award. The Union relies on the language in United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 596, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1360, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960), the third of the famous Steelworkers trilogy in which the Supreme Court outlined the proper role of the judiciary in labor arbitration cases, to the effect that the courts are not \u201cto review the merits of</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">It is now well settled that a grievance is arbitrable \u201cunless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. at 582-583, 80 S.Ct. at 1353.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A less settled question is the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>scope of judicial review of a specific arbitration award. .Although the arbitrator\u2019s decision on the merits is final as to questions of law and fact, his authority is contractual in nature and is'limited tol\u00cdLe powers, conferred in the collegtive \u2014 bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For t\u00dcis~reason, a number of courts have interpreted <em>Enterprise Wheel </em>as authorizing review of whether an arbitrator\u2019s award exceeded the limits of his contractual authority. See H. K. Porter Co. v. United Saw, File &amp; Steel Prods. Workers, 333 F.2d 596 (3 Cir. 1964); Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Union Local 784 v. Ulry-Talbert Co., 330 F.2d 562 (8 Cir. 1964); I. A. M. v. Hayes Corp., 296 F.2d 238, 242-243 (5 Cir. 1961). The precise question seems not to have arisen in this Circuit, compare Local 453, Intern. Union of Electrical, etc. v. Otis Elevator Co., 314 F.2d 25 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 949, 83 S.Ct. 1680, 10 L.Ed.2d 705 (1963), where the arbitrator\u2019s power to settle the dispute was clear, but we have plainly intimated that the arbitrator\u2019s authority to render a given award is subject to meaningful review. See Carey v. General Elec. Co., 315 F.2d 499, 508 (2 Cir. 1963). We agree with <em>Carey </em>that this is an appropriate question for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"> Torrington contends that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in this case by \u201cadding\u201d the election day bonus to the terms of the January 1964 agreement. However, the arbitrator held that such a provision was implied by the prior practice of the parties. In some cases, it may be appropriate exercise of an arbitrator\u2019s authority to resolve ambiguities in the-.seona.-of a collectiveJbargaining agreement on the basis of prior practice, since no agreement can reduce all aspects of the labor-management relationship to writing^ However, while courts should be wary of rejecting the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the implications of the parties\u2019 prior practice, the mandate that the arbitrator stay within the confines of the collective bargaining agreement, footnote 5 supra, requires a reviewing-xo.urt to pass upon whether the agreement authorizes the arbitrator to expand its express terms on the basis of the parties\u2019 prior practice. Therefore. we hold that the question of an arbitrator\u2019^ authority~is~suEjecf \u201cto' judicial review, and that the arbitrator\u2019s decision that he has authority should not be accepted whereTKe reviewing\" court can clearly perceiveTEat he has derived that authority from sources outside the collective bargainmg^agreement at issue. See Textile Workers Union of America v. American Thread Co., 291 F.2d 894 (4 Cir. 1961).<footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Unfortunately, as the dissenting opinion illustrates, agreeing upon these general principles does not make this case any easier. Certain it is that Torring-ton\u2019s policy of paid time off to vote was well established by 1962. On this basis, the arbitrator ruled that the policy must continue during the 1964 agreement because Torrington did not negotiate a contrary policy into that agreement. TOj bolster his decision, the arbitrator noted! that Torrington\u2019s written demands of: September 26, 1963, constituted the first occasion on which either party did not expressly insist that its election day position be adopted. Therefore, he concluded, it was the company which removed this question \u201cfrom the table\u201d and the company cannot complain if its policy under the old contract is now continued.</p>\n<p id=\"AYE\">We cannot accept this interpretation of the negotiations. In the first place, as Judge Clarie stated, labor contracts generally state affirmatively what conditions the parties agree to, more specifically, what restraints the parties will place on management\u2019s freedom of action. While it may be appropriate to resolve a question never raised during negotiations on the basis of prior practice in the plant or industry, it is quite another thing to assume that the contract confers a specific benefit when that benefit was discussed during negotiations but omitted from the contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">\u201c[I]n entering into a collective agreement, in the negotiations for which as much care and deliberateness were exercised in respect to the omission as to the inclusion of various restraints and obligations, neither party agreed to submit to an arbitrator the question of whether it should be subjected to the very restraint or obligation which in negotiations the parties, by omitting it from the contract, agreed the contract should <em>not </em>subject it to.\u201d Freidin, supra note 4, at p. 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad8\">The arbitrator\u2019s primary justification for reading the election day benefit into the 1964 agreement was that such a benefit corresponded to the parties\u2019 prior practice. But in this the arbitrator coxn-pletely ignored the fact that the company had revoked that policy almost ten months earlier, by newsletter to the employees in December 1962 and by formal notice to the Union in April 1963. It was within the_ employer\u2019s discretion to make such aT change since the narrow arbitration. clause in the previous collective bar-arbitration by the Union.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And there was no showing that Torrington\u2019s announcement was merely a statement of bargaining position and was not a seriously intended change in policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">In Jight of this uncontroverted fact, and bearing in mind that the arbitrator has no jurisdiction to \u201cadd to\u201d the 1964 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>agreement, we do not thinkjt was proper to place the \u201cburden\u201d of securing an express contract provision in the 1964 \"contract on the company. At the start of \"negotiations,\" Torrington announced its intent to <em>continue </em>its previous change of election day policy. This was an express invitation to the Union to bargain with respect to this matter. After the Union failed to press for and receive a change in the 1964 agreement, the company was surely justified in applying in November 1964 a policy it had rightfully established in 1962, and had applied in November 1963 (during the strike).</p>\n<p id=\"ACTM\">In our opinion, the Union by pressing this grievance has attempted to have \u201cadded\u201d to the 1964 agreement a benefit which it did not think sufficiently vital to insist upon during negotiations for the contract which ended a long and costly strike. We find this sufficiently clear from the facts as found by the arbitrator to agree with the district court that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by ruling that such a benefit was implied in the terms of that agreement. As Judge Brown has written for the Fifth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201cBut if full rein is to be given to this device as a means thought best able to achieve industrial peace, it must be enforced with an even hand. That which the parties have committed to the arbiter is for the arbiter alone, not the Court. Courts must assure that. But it is equally important to assure that neither party \u2014 through one guise or another \u2014 may obtain the intervention of an arbiter when the contract clearly excludes it from the reach of the grievance machinery.\u201d Local Union No. 787, I. U. E. v. Collins Radio Co., 317 F.2d 214, 220 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqS\">Far from having the disruptive effect upon the finality of labor arbitration which results when courts review the \u201cmerits\u201d of a particular remedy devised by an arbitrator, we think that the limited review exercised here will stimulate voluntary resort to labor arbitration and thereby strengthen this important aspect of labor-management relations by guaranteeing to the parties to a collective bargaining agreement that they will find in the arbitrator not a \u201cphilosopher king\u201d but one who will resolve their disputes within the framework of the agreement which they negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">. Torrington\u2019s brief on appeal explains that this decision was made because \u201cin the light of the extension of voting hours and the substitution of voting machines for paper ballots * * * it was no longer necessary to permit employees t\u00edme off to vote.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-7\">.

It bas been argued that this standard should be broadened to render not arbitra-ble any situation where \u201ca frivolous claim [is made] that a grievance is within the scope of the agreement.\u201d Freidin, Discussion of a paper by Sam Kagel, in Arbitration and Public Policy 10, 14 (Proceedings of the Fourteenth Annual Meeting, National Academy of Arbitrators 1961). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>However, while plausible, such a position was not adopted by the Supreme Court, primarily because there is real advantage in sending even frivolous claims to arbitration. Moreover, as a long-time labor arbitrator and member of this court has said, \u201cNo great harm is done by applying a liberal rule as to arbitrability, if the court carefully scrutinizes what the arbitrator later decides.\u201d Paul R. Hays, Labor Arbitration, A Dissenting View 80 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">. \u201c[The arbitrator] does not sit to dispense Ms own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.\u201d United Steelworkers of America v.

Of course, it can be argued that our decision authorizes an impermissible review of the \u201cmerits\u201d in a case where the principal issue was whether the arbitrator should find an implied substantive obligation in the contract, see Meltzer, The Supreme Court, Arbitrability, and Collective Bargaining, 28 U.Chi.L.Rev. 464, 484-85 (1961), but we think this position is contrary to <em>Enterprise Wheel. </em>See note 5 supra. The question of the arbitrator\u2019s authority is really one of his contractual .jurisdiction, and the courts cannot be ex-jpected to place their stamp of approval ; upon his action without making some ex-\u00c9 animation of his jurisdiction to act. As stated above, we think more exhaustive ; judicial review of this question is appropriate after the award has been made than before the award in a suit to compel arbitration; in this way, the court receives the benefit of,the arbitrator\u2019s interpretive skills as to the matter of his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tractual authority. See Livingston v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 313 F.2d 52, 59 n. 5 (2 Cir. 1963), aff\u2019d, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\">.

Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). But this inquiry is a very limited one and, so limited, should lead to reversal of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">The arbitrator in this case concluded that both parties agreed at the bargaining table to continue the prior practice of paid time off for voting. It is clear that the new contract did not by its terms deal with the time off for voting issue. But the arbitrator reasoned that it was the company, not the union, that was trying to change the twenty-year old practice. It was the company that introduced the issue into the bargaining at the first negotiation meeting in August 1963, and insisted on a change in the practice. Thereafter, according to the arbitrator, the company \u201cremoved * * * [this demand] from the table * * *. Thus * * * both parties agreed that the old contract was to be continued except for certain changes among which was <em>not </em>a change in the practice of giving time off with pay for voting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">The arbitrator assumed that a collective bargaining agreement can include terms or conditions not made explicit in the written contract. This proposition is correct. In a prior appeal involving these same parties and this same con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tract, this court said that the arbitration clause of the agreement could be applicable to a recall grievance if there were \u201csome special agreement making it applicable or * * * some custom or common understanding which has that effect.\u201d Torrington Co. v. Metal Prods. Workers, 347 F.2d 93, 95 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 940, 86 S.Ct. 394, 15 L.Ed.2d 351 (1965). This is a clear\u00cd statement of the view that it is proper! to look beyond the terms of a labor con-j tract in interpreting it. In United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 580, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1352, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960), the Supreme Court said: \u201cGaps [in the \u201cwritten document\u201d] may be left to be filled in by reference to the practices of the particular industry and of the various shops covered by the agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the difference between the earlier (1961-1963) and the new contract in this case is most significant. The arbitration article in the earlier contract contained the following limitations on the arbitrator\u2019s power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">The Company\u2019s decisions will stand and will not be over-ruled by any arbitrator unless the arbitrator can find that the Company misinterpreted or violated the express terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">No point not covered by this con- \u2022 tract shall be subject to arbitration</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">After a 16-week strike in which the scope of the arbitration clause was an important issue (which, in itself, is unusual), these limitations on the arbitr\u00e1tor\u2019s power were excluded m the new contract. This was a clear recognition by the parties that there can be \u201cimplied\u201d as well as \u201cexpress\u201d terms in the agreement. In this case, the arbitrator held that pay for time off for voting was a benefit which was such \u201can implied part of the contract.\u201d If so, then, of course, the arbitrator did not \u201cadd to, delete from, or modify, in any way, any of the provisions of this agreement\u201d in violation of the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">Thus, the arbitrator looked to prior practice, the conduct of the negotiation for the new contract and the agreement reached at the bargaining table to reach his conclusion that paid time off for voting was \u201can implied part of the contract.\u201d From all of this, I conclude that . the arbitrator\u2019s award \u201cdraws its essence I from the collective bargaining agree-71 ment\u201d and his words do not \u201cmanifest j an infidelity to this obligation.\u201d Once 1 that test is met, the inquiry ends. <em>\\ </em>cori:ect...is-irreLevanti<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the parties .agreed, .to. abide by_.it.-right or wrong.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the majority has carried the inquiry further and concerned itself with a minute examination of the merits of the award, which we are enjoined not to do.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the majority opinion states that the arbitrator \u201cignored the fact that the company had revoked [its] * * * policy almost ten months earlier.\u201d Of course, the arbitrator was aware of the company\u2019s actions in December 1962 and April 1963 and referred to them in his opinion. And I would suppose that what significance to attach to these acts \u2014 e. <em>g., </em>whether the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>could \u201crevoke\u201d its policy unilaterally- \u2014 \u25a0 and to the bargaining held thereafter is exactly the sort of question the parties left to the arbitrator to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Supreme Court decisions are quite clear that the courts should not leap into the arbitration process too quickly. I need not repeat here the reasons for this approach; they are set out in detail in the famous trilogy. United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., supra; United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., supra; United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It used to be that the attempt to obtain court review of the merits of an arbitration award was made under the guise that the issue was so clear it was not arbitrable. But the trilogy settled that old fight. This case shows the same attempt under the guise that the arbitrator has exceeded his authority, and it should meet with no greater success.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AUqs\">.
