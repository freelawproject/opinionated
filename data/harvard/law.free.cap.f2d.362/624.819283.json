During the taxable year 1962, Judge F. B. Davenport was a candidate for re-election to the office of Judge of the 116th Judicial District Court of Texas. He was successful and served until his death on June 18, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">Under the Texas Election Code, V.A. T.S., a candidate in a primary election must pay an assessment levied by the county executive committee before his name may be placed on the ballot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The assessment is basically the candidate\u2019s apportioned share of the cost of running the election as computed by the committee from an estimate of election expenses. The assessment may be used only to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>fray the expenses arising from the primary elections as provided by statute. Funds in excess of election expenses are refunded to the candidates in proportion to the amounts each paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Judge Davenport was assessed $2,-880.00 and received a refund of $921.60. The net assessment of $1,958.40 was claimed as a deduction by the taxpayer and disallowed by the Commissioner. Payment of $555.19 tax was required. Mrs. Davenport, individually and as executrix of Judge Davenport\u2019s estate, filed suit for refund, asserting that the net assessment is deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense (Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 162); as an ordinary and necessary expense incurred for the produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>tion or collection of income (Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 212); or as a deductible state tax (Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 164, 26 U.S. C. \u00a7 164 (1958)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court concluded that the assessment was deductible \u201csince the payment was a necessary and proper expenditure not only for the carrying on of the business but for the production of the business.\u201d Davenport v. Campbell, N.D.Tex.1964, 238 F. Supp. 568, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Consideration of whether the assessment is deductible as an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in carrying on a trade or business or in the production of income must begin with an analysis of McDonald v. Commissioner, 1944, 323 U.S. 57, 65 S.Ct. 96, 89 L.Ed. 68. Judge McDonald sought to deduct his campaign expenses and an \u201cassessment\u201d paid to the party organization to obtain its support. The Court found that performance of the judicial office constituted carrying on a trade or business under the terms of the Code and that the judge was entitled to deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses paid in carrying on that trade or business. The Court noted, however, that \u201chis campaign contributions were not expenses incurred <em>in being </em>a judge but <em>in trying to be </em>a judge for the next ten years.\u201d 323 U.S. at 60, 65 S.Ct. at 97, 89 L.Ed. at 72. (Emphasis added.) Thus, the Court drew a distinction between expenses incurred in performing the judicial function and those expended in an effort to secure election, and denied a deduction for expenses of the latter type. The Court also refused to allow a deduction of such campaign expenses as expenses incurred in the production of income. Although the assessment in the present case differs in some ways from that in <em>McDonald </em>the rationale of <em>McDonald </em>prevents the reaching of a different result here. Judge Davenport\u2019s assessment was incurred as an expense of attaining the office, not in performing the judicial function. For this reason, the deduction of the assessment as an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in carrying on a trade or business or in the production of income was properly denied by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">A more difficult question is presented in determining whether the assessment qualifies as a tax under Section 164 of the Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the 1964 Amendments and during the taxable year 1962, Section 164 provided that taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year were deductible with certain exceptions not applicable here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No definition of \u201ctaxes\u201d is found in the Code. As is frequently the case, the drafting of an acceptable definition has proven easier than applying the definition to a particular fact situation. Indeed, the Commissioner\u2019s attempts to classify assessments are classic examples of this proposition. In Revenue Ruling 57-345, such assessments were found to be taxes deductible under Section 164; while in Revenue Ruling 60-365, the assessment was held to be a fee rather than a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Revenue Ruling 57-345, construing a New Mexico statute, defines \u201ctax\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6o\">\u201can enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority in the exercise of taxing power, and imposed and collected for the purpose of raising revenue to be used for public or governmental purposes, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>not as a payment for some special privilege granted or service rendered. Taxes are, therefore, distinguishable from various other contributions and charges imposed for particular purposes under particular powers or functions of the Government. In view of such distinctions, the question whether a particular contribution or charge is to be regarded as a tax depends upon its real nature * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aup-dedup-0\">\u201cA charge primarily imposed for the purpose of regulation is not a tax, even though it produces revenue. On this basis, fees paid for dog licenses, automobile inspection, and automobile title registration have been held not to be deductible as taxes * * *. Similarly, amounts paid to purchase hunting and fishing licenses have been held not deductible as taxes * * *. On the other hand, the conduct of primary elections constitutes the performance of a proper State or Governmental function in the same manner as the conduct of general elections, and is not merely the regulation of a private function.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Since the purpose of the filing fee required by the New Mexico statute was \u201cto raise revenue which is to be used in defraying the expenses of the primary election,\u201d the Revenue Ruling concluded that the assessment was a tax within Section 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Commissioner considered the same question in Revenue Ruling 60-366 which involved the North Carolina primary filing fee. The Ruling notes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201can important factor in distinguishing a fee from a tax is the purpose for the imposition of the charge. Clearly, if the only or the primary purpose is the raising of revenue, the charge Is a tax, and governmental regulation arising merely as an incident will not alter the character of the exaction * * *. On the other hand, \u2018if the fee is exacted for the primary purposes of regulating and restraining an occupation or privilege deemed dangerous to the public or to be specially in need of public control, and compliance with certain conditions is required in addition to the payment of the prescribed sum, such fee is a license * * *. A charge imposed as a consideration for a privilege granted one by a governmental unit is not a \u201ctax\u201d in the sense in which the word is ordinarily used.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The Ruling then cites a North Carolina case which found the assessment to be \u201cone of the reasonable means adopted by the legislature to regulate primary elections * * * \u201d and concludes that \u201csince the North Carolina Supreme Court has held [that] this levy was to regulate the primary election and was not a revenue measure, it is a regulatory fee * * * \u201d and not a \u201ctax.\u201d Revenue Ruling 57-435 was revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Although in both Rulings the Commissioner relies on basically the same definition and finds that the purpose of the assessment determines whether it is to be classified as a tax or as a fee, he obviously has had some difficulty in applying the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">We now try our hand at classifying the assessment. We are not referred to any Texas cases which have attempted to determine the nature of the assessment. It is, however, not difficult to conclude that the assessment in Texas has both a regulatory and a revenue function. Thus, it cannot be doubted that the imposition of an assessment may have some deterrent effect on nuisance candidates. Yet, it would also seem obvious that the assessment was designed to cover the cost of the primary. The computation of the assessment is derived from an estimate of the cost of running the primary, the use of the funds is restricted solely for the purpose of defraying primary expenses, and refund of monies collected in excess of the cost of the primary must be refunded to the candidates. Indeed, these assessments constitute the only source of revenue for operating the primaries. That taxes may have multiple purposes is no longer a debatable proposition. As stated by the Supreme Court, \u201c[e]very tax is in some measure regulatory. To some extent it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>interposes an economic impediment to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed. But a tax is not any the less a tax because it has a regulatory effect * * *, and it has long been established that an Act of Congress which on its face purports to be an exercise of the taxing power is not any the less so because the tax is burdensome or tends to restrict or suppress the thing taxed.\u201d Sonzinsky v. United States, 1937, 300 U. S. 506, 513, 57 S.Ct. 554, 555-556, 81 L. Ed. 772, 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In Texas the assessment is made by the county executive committee of the political party running the primary. This fact does not alter the nature of the assessment since it is well settled that Texas has delegated its function of conducting primaries to the political parties and that in this respect \u201cthe party\u2019s action [is] the action of the state.\u201d Smith v. Allwright, 1944, 321 U.S. 649, 660, 64 S.Ct. 757, 763, 88 L.Ed. 987. Nor is it necessarily significant that the assessment is imposed only upon those wishing to participate in the primary election. The Supreme Court found that a $200 fee imposed only upon dealers in firearms was a \u201ctax.\u201d Sonzinsky v. United States, supra. A $600 a year charge on manufacturers of adulterated butter has also been upheld as a \u201ctax.\u201d Gehman v. Smith, E.D.Pa.1948, 76 F.Supp. 805. Thus, neither of these facts are of particular assistance to a determination of the purpose of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The persuasive factor in reaching our conclusion is the size of the primary assessment in Texas. A fee of $100 or even $500 might be explainable primarily in terms of regulation. But it strains our imagination to accept the Commissioner\u2019s argument that an assessment of some $2,000 is primarily for purposes of regulation. The most reasonable explanation of the size of this assessment is to raise revenue to cover the cost of the primary. This conclusion is borne out by the fact that excess funds collected must be refunded. Certainly this aspect of the assessment cannot be rationalized as a deterrent to the nuisance candidate. Rather, we conclude here, as did the Commissioner in Revenue Ruling 57-345, that the primary purpose of the assessment is to raise revenue and that, therefore, it qualifies as a \u201ctax\u201d within the provisions of Section 164 as it stood prior to the 1964 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-14\">. \u201cTex.
