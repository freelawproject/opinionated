W. in the District of Columbia. He had alleged that the owner of the property, decedent, John W. Staggers, \u201cby and through his agent and lessee, Diana Auger engaged\u201d the appellant\u2019s services in remodeling and repairing the premises for use as a restaurant \u201cknown as Colonial Inn.\u201d His complaint further alleged that the decedent Staggers \u201cby and through his agent, agreed to pay\u201d for the labor and materials. The agreement was oral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">D.C.Code \u00a7 38-111 (1961) provides that if \u201cthe right of the complainant * * * to the lien * * * shall be established, the court shall decree a sale of the land and premises or the estate and interest therein of the person who, as owner, contracted [for the work done].\u201d The District Judge found that there had been no testimony to establish that Diana Auger was the agent of the deceased; that the appellant\u2019s testimony had been inconsistent, contradictory and improbable on the issue of whether or not the deceased agreed to pay for the work. The trier refused to accept as \u201ccreditable the testimony of the plaintiff that the deceased himself promised to pay for this work and materials.\u201d Additionally, the findings are specific that \u201cthe testimony of the plaintiff that the deceased promised to pay for the labor and materials was not corroborated by the ambiguous testimony of * * * the only other witness, to the effect that the deceased would take care of the matter and see to it that Berenter got his money.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have been asked to set aside the order of dismissal on the ground that the record as a whole would demonstrate error on the part of the trial judge. Our examination leads us to conclude, however, that the trial judge did not err <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in granting the appellees\u2019 motion for involuntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AG8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">. Compare D.C.Code \u00a7 14-302 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1024-15\">.
