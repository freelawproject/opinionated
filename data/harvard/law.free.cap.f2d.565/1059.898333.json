Boberg contends that the Government failed to make a submissible case, that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to withdraw a pretrial stipulation, and that a new trial should be granted on the basis of newly discovered evidence. We have reviewed Boberg\u2019s contentions and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-16\">The charges against Boberg flow from a 1974 Internal Revenue Service investigation of the tax liability of Thomas Richardson, a former mayor of Maplewood, Missouri. Richardson\u2019s records disclosed that between 1970 and 1972 he had received several payments from Boberg, a real estate developer and contractor who had built several apartment complexes in Maplewood. An IRS agent interviewed Boberg on several occasions, and during the course of these interviews Boberg admitted a payment of $300 as an \u201cunsecured loan\u201d to Richardson and payments of $1,500 and $1,200, which he characterized as finder\u2019s fees for Richardson\u2019s help in locating property on which Boberg built apartment complexes. Boberg made his business records available to the agent and, at the agent\u2019s request, signed a statement describing the nature of the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-17\">In 1976, a federal grand jury investigating Richardson for allegedly accepting illegal payoffs in connection with his official duties called Boberg as a witness twice. In both sessions Boberg affirmed his previous signed statement that the $1,500 and $1,200 payments were finder\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-18\">Following these appearances, the grand jury indicted Boberg on three charges. Count I charged that Boberg attempted to obstruct and impede justice by presenting the grand jury with a check stub that had been altered to conceal a $300 payment. As evidence, the Government introduced can-celled check No. 1309 from Boberg\u2019s company, dated January 28,1972, and made to the order of \u201ccash,\u201d and the corresponding check stub, which contained the notations \u201cMaplewood City Hall\u201d and \u201cfor trash cash.\u201d The Government also introduced a photocopy of the same check stub made by the IRS agent during his search of Boberg\u2019s records. The language on the photocopy read \u201cMaplewood City Hall\u201d and \u201cfor T.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>cash.\u201d The Government argued that Bo-berg, prior to testifying before the grand jury, had altered the stub to erase evidence of that payment to \u201cT.R.\u201d or Thomas Richardson. The jury acquitted Boberg on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">Counts II and III charged that Boberg knew the $1,500 and $1,200 payments to Richardson were not finder\u2019s fees but nevertheless told the grand jury that they were, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. In particular, count II charged that Boberg willfully made a false declaration to the grand jury in testifying as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-6\">Q. O.K. Now the $1,500 total that was generated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-7\">A. Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-8\">Q. That was paid to Thomas Richardson for a finder\u2019s fee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-9\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-10\">Q. And that was for finding this land on Laclede Station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-11\">A. Yes. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-12\">Q. And then eventually you came to pay Richardson for telling you about this land?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-13\">A. For packaging it together, that\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-14\">Count III charged that Boberg willfully made a false declaration by testifying as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-15\">Q. Now check # 715 for $1,200, you told the agent that you believed that that was a payment to Richardson as a finder\u2019s fee for finding the land on Lohmeyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-16\">A. Yes. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-17\">Q. So this $1,200 would have gone to Richardson for the Lohmeyer land?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-18\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-19\">On these counts the Government argued that the payments were not finder\u2019s fees but were payoffs to enable Boberg to build his apartments without complying with the city\u2019s building code and zoning ordinance. As evidence that these payments were not \u201cfinder\u2019s fees,\u201d the sellers of the property testified that they had dealt solely with Boberg or his employee and not with Richardson. Indeed, one of the sellers testified that she was not approached by Boberg, but had initiated the sale of the property herself. The two payments were made in cash, not by check, and Boberg\u2019s books and records reflected payments for purposes other than a finder\u2019s fee. Although the jury acquitted Boberg on count I, the evidence introduced on that charge supported a conclusion that Boberg consistently attempted to conceal the nature of his payments to Richardson. In addition, the Government presented evidence that Boberg did not comply with a local zoning ordinance requiring one and one-half parking spaces for every apartment unit. The jury convicted Boberg on counts II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-22\">Boberg moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case and again at the close of the trial, but the court denied his motions. On appeal, he contends that the court erred in submitting counts II and III to the jury because the prosecution failed to make a submissible case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-23\">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has set forth the elements that must be proved under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-24\">Five elements must be proved to establish a case under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 for perjury: (i) the declarant must be under oath, (ii) the testimony must be given in a proceeding before a court of the United States, (iii) the witness must knowingly make, (iv) a false statement, and (v) the testimony must be material to the proof of the crime. <em>[United States v. Whimpy, </em>531 F.2d 768, 770 (5th Cir. 1976).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-25\">Boberg argues that the Government failed to prove two of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the statements alleged in the indictment were false, and (2) that Boberg knew the statements were false when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-26\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the Government introduced sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. The Government\u2019s evidence showed payments made under suspicious circumstances and a pattern of concealing the true nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>of the payments. Testimony of witnesses indicated that Richardson had played no part in finding or packaging the property purchased by Boberg, undermining Bo-berg\u2019s claim that the payments were \u201cfinder\u2019s fees.\u201d Moreover, the transcripts of testimony before the grand jury, along with testimony of the IRS agent who had interviewed Boberg, showed a pattern of inconsistent statements that could have affected the jury\u2019s assessment of Boberg\u2019s credibility. The Government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Boberg knowingly made a false statement to the grand jury when he stated that the payments were finder\u2019s fees. When there is substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, that verdict must stand. <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 124, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Lamb-ros, </em>564 F.2d 26 (8th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">Boberg contends that the trial court erred in denying his request to withdraw from a stipulation that the Government\u2019s exhibit 19 included a true and accurate copy of ordinance No. 3279 of Maplewood. Section 1 of that ordinance provided that \u201cone parking space shall be provided for each apartment dwelling unit.\u201d Above the word \u201cone\u201d the handwritten phrase \u201c&amp; Va\u201d had been inserted. All other parts of the ordinance on the copy were typewritten.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">During trial a disagreement arose as to the meaning of the stipulation, Boberg arguing that he merely stipulated that the copy of the ordinance was a true and accurate <em>copy </em>but that he did not concede that the copy communicated the true <em>requirements </em>of the ordinance. Throughout the trial and this appeal Boberg maintained the position that, either by law or by custom, the city required only one parking space per unit. When the court refused to recognize his interpretation of the stipulation, Boberg moved to withdraw the stipulation. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-7\">The record shows that the court\u2019s denial of the motion did not prejudice Boberg. The court\u2019s action neither bound Boberg to the stipulation nor allowed the Government to rely solely on the stipulation to prove its case. The court allowed Boberg to testify that he thought the city required only one parking space per unit and that other apartment complexes in the city afforded but one parking space per unit. In addition, Boberg's architect testified that he, too, thought the city required only one parking space. The Government introduced testimony by the current city engineer and the former building inspector of Maplewood that one and one-half parking spaces per unit were required. This contention of prejudicial error is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">After his conviction, Boberg discovered a compilation of city ordinances that, he claims, contain a provision requiring only one parking space per unit for his apartments. On the basis of this \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d Boberg asks this court to grant him a new trial. Affidavits by Bo-berg and his attorney state that the new compilation of ordinances was not discovered until after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-10\">Boberg raises this issue for the first time on appeal. The proper procedure for obtaining a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence is by a motion to the trial court. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. The decision whether to grant a new trial lies in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>United States v. Pope, </em>415 F.2d 685, 691 (8th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 950, 90 S.Ct. 973, 25 L.Ed.2d 132 (1970); <em>Edwards v. United States, </em>361 F.2d 732, 734 (8th Cir. 1966). We therefore decline to reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-12\">We feel compelled to comment on the nature of this prosecution. The prosecutor\u2019s interrogation of Boberg before the grand jury consisted almost entirely of leading questions. The indictments rest upon Boberg\u2019s somewhat cryptic responses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>to those questions. This kind of interrogation always creates a great risk that the witness will misunderstand the questions or that the prosecutor will put words in the witness\u2019 mouth. We think that a grand jury witness, particularly one who may be the target of a prosecution, ought to be given a fair opportunity to respond fully to questions and not be limited to the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d that typifies answers to leading questions. We intend this comment as a fair warning to prosecutors that we shall strictly scrutinize for fairness any indictment and conviction for perjury before a grand jury that rests upon a witness\u2019 responses to leading questions asked by a United States Attorney or Assistant United States Attorney. In the present case, our reading of the record of the grand jury proceedings, supplemented by certain evidence presented at the trial, convinces us that the prosecutor\u2019s leading questions did not mislead Boberg as a grand jury witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">Finding no prejudicial error, we affirm the conviction without prejudice to any motion to the district court for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence. <em>See 2 </em>C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>535 (1969).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
