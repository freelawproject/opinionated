The TTAB based its decision on the ground that the words neither identify the source of the goods nor distinguish the goods from other such goods in accordance with the definition of \u201ctrade-mark\u201d set forth in section 45 of the Lanham Act (Trademark Act of 1946).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">During the prosecution, appellant presented specimens, postal meter mailing tapes, which showed the actual use of the words in commerce. The mailing tapes are affixed to packages in which appellant\u2019s goods are mailed. The words, which appellant argues are in the nature of a slogan, are used on the packages in conjunction with appellant\u2019s trade name, Baker Industries. Appellant further argues that the slogan distinguishes the goods in accordance with requirements of section 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">In their briefs before the court, both parties cited <em>In re Walker Process Equipment, Inc., </em>43 CCPA 913, 233 F.2d 329, 110 USPQ 41 (1956) (hereinafter cited as <em>Walker). Walker </em>involved an attempt to register \u201cWalker Process Equipment Inc.\u201d as a trademark. The facts show that this phrase was used in conjunction with \u201cPro-quip,\u201d a registered trademark.' Regarding the issue of whether the company name served also as a trademark to identify and to distinguish appellant\u2019s goods, the court concluded that the company name was not so used. A significant fact which supported the conclusion was placement of appellant\u2019s address with the company name. The inclusion of the address more fully identified appellant than the goods. Further, the juxtaposition of the trademark \u201cProquip\u201d and the company name diminished any trademark significance the latter would have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-11\">A case cited in <em>Walker </em>is <em>In re Lyndale Farm, </em>38 CCPA 825,186 F.2d 723, 88 USPQ 377 (1951). In that case, appellant appealed from a TTAB decision denying registration of \u201cLyndale Farm,\u201d a trade name, which was used on crates in which appellant transported cattle. Cojoined with the trade name was appellant\u2019s address. The function of the trade name, the court concluded, was to identify appellant while the cattle were in transit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-12\">We believe that the two cases discussed above have a common thread, that the company name served to identify the applicant in each case. This function is without significance for establishing a trademark defined by the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1284-13\">The term \u201ctrade-mark\u201d includes any word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant <em>to identify his goods </em>and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others. [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1284-14\">The rationale underlying the above cases is that a trademark \u201cidentify his [applicant\u2019s] goods and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-15\">In view of the above discussion, we conclude that appellant\u2019s slogan does not identify and distinguish its goods in accordance with the statutory definition of \u201ctrademark,\u201d but, rather, serves to distinguish appellant from other companies having the name, Baker. The decision of the TTAB is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-17\">LANE, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1284-18\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
