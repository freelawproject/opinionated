The judge also held that this procedure violated the Social Security Act and relevant federal regulations, and required that plaintiff class members be notified of their right to a recomputation of medical benefits due. Because of the urgency of the matter, Judge Port dictated his opinion in open court, but stayed his order for a short period to allow a prompt appeal. We continued the stay and expedited the appeal. Because we conclude that appellants\u2019 challenges to the decision of the district court have no merit, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-15\">Appellants argue first that the district court lacked jurisdiction because plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claims did not meet the $10,-000 jurisdictional threshold of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and pendent jurisdiction over these claims was not justified. The district court accepted pendent jurisdiction on the theory that plaintiffs also presented a constitutional claim substantial enough to confer jurisdiction. That constitutional question turned on whether New York\u2019s disparate treatment of two classes of potential Medicaid recipients violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The State treats the members of the two classes differently in terms of the extent to which it disregards their work-related expenses in determining whether their available income is low enough to entitle them to medical assistance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>We agree with the district court that this question was substantial enough to confer jurisdiction under the standard set forth in <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 534-43, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974). We have recently construed closely analogous claims as sufficient to vest jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3). <em>Friedman v. Berger, </em>547 F.2d 724, 727 n.6 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 984, 97 S.Ct. 1681, 52 L.Ed.2d 328 (1977); <em>Aitchison v. Berger, </em>404 F.Supp. 1137, 1142-43 (S.D.N.Y.1975), aff\u2019d, 538 F.2d 307 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 890, 97 S.Ct. 246, 50 L.Ed.2d 172 (1976). Cf. <em>Andrews v. Maher, </em>525 F.2d 113, 116 (2d Cir. 1975). Appellants urge us to reexamine these holdings in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s determination in <em>Maher v. Roe, </em>432 U.S. 464, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977), that the provision of Medicaid for childbirth but not for elective abortions is constitutionally permissible. However, the principal state interests invoked to sustain the Medicaid-related classification at issue in <em>Maher </em>are not relevant to the instant case. Appellees\u2019 constitutional claim clearly meets the liberal standard established in <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>supra, 415 U.S. at 539, 94 S.Ct. at 1380, since \u201cwe cannot say that the equal protection issue tendered by the complaint was either frivolous or so insubstantial as to be beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court.\u201d Therefore, the district court also had jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 statutory or Supremacy Clause claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">Appellants also assert that the district court improperly certified plaintiffs\u2019 class. We find no abuse of discretion, since only class certification could avert the substantial possibility of the litigation becoming moot prior to decision. That very development, we are told, prevented an earlier adjudication of the same issues involved here<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from averting the necessity for this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">Finally, appellants argue that the district court\u2019s decision was wrong on the merits, since the challenged state procedures are in fact not in conflict with federal law. We disagree, given the requirement of subsections (10)(C)(i) and (17)(B) of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a) that the \u201cmedically needy\u201d be treated the same as AFDC applicants with respect to income disregarded for purposes of ascertaining eligibility. See also 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u25a0 448.3(c)(3)(i). The State concedes that it is currently applying different standards to the two groups, allowing individual AFDC applicants to deduct all work-related expenses while remitting the medically needy to an inflexible schedule of \u201cminimum exemptions.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court properly found this practice irreconcilable with the federal requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">Judgment affirmed. The mandate shall issue two weeks from today to allow appellants a further brief period in which to apply to the Supreme Court for a stay.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1332-11\">. As defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 448.1(a)(2)(i), \u201c[a]n individual is considered to be medically needy if he has income and resources which exceed the amount of income and resources allowed to the categorically needy but which are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical and remedial care and services.\u201d The \u201ccategorically needy\u201d are persons eligible for public assistance under the AFDC or Supplemental Security Income programs. Id. \u00a7 448.1(a)(l)(i).

However, the \u201cmedically needy\u201d are permitted no such deductions; for them, a schedule of \u201cminimum exemptions\u201d has been established. To become eligible for medical benefits, the \u201cmedically needy\u201d must exhaust, on medical expenses, the difference between their net incomes and the applicable \u201cexemption.\u201d The exemptions vary according to the size of a household.

Appellants argue, and ap-pellees vigorously deny, that these exemptions have been adjusted upward to allow for retention of amounts sufficient to provide for work-related expenses. Appellees are buttressed by two letters from HEW administrators, which advised the State that its treatment of the \u201cmedically needy\u201d did not comply with federal standards. In any event, we are satisfied that the State\u2019s use of a dual system to determine Medicaid eligibility violates the core statutory and regulatory requirement that the groups involved be treated the same in this respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
