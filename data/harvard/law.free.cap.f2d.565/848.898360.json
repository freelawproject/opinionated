(AGL) for breach of a charter agreement between the two, under which Tidewater contracted to charter the M.V. Mary from AGL, the time-charter owner of the vessel. On appeal, Tidewater makes three arguments: that there was no meeting of the minds giving rise to contractual liability; that certain conditions precedent were never fulfilled and consequently the contract never became binding; and that AGL suffered no damages from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>aborted charter agreement. We reject each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Tidewater is a subsidiary of Steelmet, Inc. In the fall of 1974, another Steelmet subsidiary, Steelmet Export Corp., contracted to sell 9,375 long tons of shredded scrap metal to Empresa Siderugica Del Peru (Sid-er), a Peruvian corporation. Under the terms of this contract, Steelmet Export undertook to secure and load the scrap at Jacksonville, Florida, for shipment to Peru; Sider agreed to pay for the unloading of the cargo in Peru. In order to fulfill its affiliate\u2019s obligations, Tidewater, acting through its broker (Antra), entered into negotiations with AGL\u2019s broker (Burbank) concerning a charter for the Mary. These negotiations culminated in a cable, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sent from Ivar Traa of Antra to Arild Pettersen of Burbank at 7:25 p. m. on November 20, 1974. In the telex, the Mary is identified as the subject of the charter, dates are specified for arrival at Jacksonville and travel to Peru, and the cargo is designated. Further, the cable plainly states that the charter agreement is subject to the receiver\u2019s (Sider\u2019s) approval of the vessel by 4:00 p. m., November 21,1974 and is governed by the terms set forth in a form contract used in the industry and known as \u201cGenjapscrap,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> subject to details.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The day following receipt of the telex (November 21), Pettersen received from Traa a copy of a Genjapscrap contract used by Tidewater on a previous charter with details included. Pettersen subsequently notified Traa that AGL had no objection to the form, although certain details were lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">When the receiver\u2019s approval was not immediately forthcoming, AGL extended the deadline by twenty-four hours to November 22 at 4:00 p. m. On November 21 and 22, two Sider representatives (Cesar Molina and Javier Zegarra Zavaleta) met with Robert Waisfisz, a vice president of Steelmet, and Andreas Avraamides, charter manager for Tidewater and export manager for Steelmet Export. During these meetings, Avraamides described the Mary to the Sider representatives, and also offered for their use an alternative ship, the Promethee. Because it had the ship on its own time charter, Tidewater could save substantial costs by using the Promethee for the Sider delivery, provided it could avoid obligation under the contract with AGL. . Although it appears that the Promethee possessed certain other advantages over the older Mary, the Sider people were primarily concerned with the comparative arrival time of the two ships. Accordingly, they expressed a preference for the Promethee, upon Av-raamides\u2019 representations that it was likely to arrive in Jacksonville before the Mary and that the Mary required a special insurance premium because of its age.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">On November 22, the preference of the Sider representative was communicated to Traa and, sometime thereafter, to Pettersen and his principal, AGL. In the meantime, however, on November 24, AGL had cabled its agents in Peru inquiring into the status of Sider\u2019s approval. On the 26th, AGL\u2019s agents replied that Sider had refused to intervene in any way in the fixture of the vessel \u2014 either to approve or disapprove its use for the contract. Also on November 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Avraamides cabled Sider asking for a written confirmation of its acceptance of the Promethee. Sider responded by cable on the 28th that under its contract with Steel-met Export it had no authority whatsoever to \u201cdecide on the vessel which will carry the material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The Promethee subsequently carried the scrap to Peru at the instruction of Tidewater, and AGL attempted to mitigate its injury by securing another charter for the Mary. These attempts were not wholly successful, however, and the court below found that AGL sustained $62,746.55 in damages from the breach of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Judge Metzner held Tidewater liable for breach of the charter party. He found that all the essential terms of the charter were set forth or referred to in the November 20 telex,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that Sider would have given its approval as required by the telex, had Tidewater asked it to do so. As he further found that Tidewater for its own reasons had deliberately failed to get Sider\u2019s approval, he concluded that Tidewater was liable for the breach. The trial court\u2019s findings of fact support these conclusions and the record shows that they are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The record shows that Sider left to Tidewater the decision as to which vessel to charter. Sider did not know that Tidewater itself was the time charterer of the Promethee and had already chartered the Promethee, on November 22, to Steelmet Export to carry the cargo of scrap.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">As Judge Metzner found, the reasons advanced by Tidewater for choosing the Pro-methee over the Mary were contrary to fact. The insurance penalty because of the Mary\u2019s age could not have mattered as that was for the account of the vessel owner, as shown by the charter form. As for the assertion that the Promethee could be loaded earlier in Jacksonville, Avraamides could not have known at the time which vessel would arrive first in Jacksonville. Moreover, Antra\u2019s notification to Burbank that Sider refused to accept the Mary because of its age was untrue. In sum, there is ample support in the record for the conclusion that Tidewater wanted the business for itself, unbeknown to Sider, and deliberately chose not to ask Sider\u2019s approval of the Mary, but instead arranged for Sider to use the Pro-methee.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">We agree, therefore, with Judge Metzner\u2019s conclusion that the condition precedent of Sider\u2019s approval was excused by Tidewater\u2019s bad faith failure to make any effort whatever to secure Sider\u2019s approval, an approval which would have been immediately forthcoming, in light of all the circumstances. See 2 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 310, at 112 (1950); 5 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 677, at 225 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">Lastly, the appellant takes issue with the district court\u2019s calculation of damages. According to Tidewater, AGL, far from losing $62,746.55 by its failure to carry the scrap to Peru, actually saved itself from a $70,907.20 loss. Judge Metzner\u2019s opinion states that he reviewed the computations in AGL\u2019s post trial brief and that the evidence supported the plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages of $62,746.55. Moreover, Judge Metzner specifically found that the contract ended with the unloading in Peru and he therefore rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that costs of the ship returning empty from Peru were properly deductible from any hypothetical profit the plaintiff would have received. The calculations referred to indicated that the net revenue AGL would have received under the contract was $263,935.55. Expenses shown in the plaintiff\u2019s post trial brief include: $147,000 which AGL paid for its time charter of the Mary for the time in question; $35,600 for fuel that would have been consumed on the voyage; $13,000 estimated port charges; and $5,589 for the extra insurance AGL would have had to pay under the terms of the charter. Thus, AGL argued, and Judge Metzner found, that $62,746.55 represents a reasonable esti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>mate of the profit AGL would have made but for Tidewater\u2019s breach. The record supports these findings of damage; we cannot say they are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-9\">.
