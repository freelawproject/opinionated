We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-25\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-26\">Schedule 3, Part 1, TSUS, covers, among other things, textile fibers. Subpart E provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-27\">Suhnart E Headnotes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-28\">3. For the purposes of this subpart\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-29\">(b) the term \u201cmonofilaments\u201d embraces single filaments (including single filaments of laminated construction or produced from two or more filaments fused or bonded together), whether solid or hollow, whether flat, oval, round, or of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>cross-sectional configuration, which are not over 0.06 inch in maximum cross-sectional dimension;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\">(e) the term \u201cgrouped filaments and strips\u201d embraces two or more filaments or strips, as defined in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this headnote, grouped together with the filaments or strips substantially parallel and not twisted, but the term does not include grouped filaments which have been subjected to processes such as twisting and untwisting, false twisting, crimping, and curling, and which are useable as yarns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">Monofilaments (in continuous form), with or without twist, whether known as monofils, artificial horsehair, artificial straw, yarns or by any other name:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">Not over 150 denier:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">309.03 Valued over 80 cents per pound .. 35% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As-\">Over 150 denier:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">309.06 Valued over 85 cents per pound . . 24% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">Grouped filaments and strips (in continuous form), whether known as tow, yarns, or by any other name:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">Wholly of grouped filaments (except laminated filaments and plexiform filaments):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">Other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">309.31 Valued over 80 cents per pound . . 14!\u00e9% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">Sarlane, the trade name for appellant\u2019s product, is a spandex<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fiber used in foundation garments, waistbands, sportswear, and sport hosiery. It is produced by extrusion of a polymeric product through a spinerette followed by passing the individual filaments through an extraction bath to remove solvent. The filaments are then gathered into bundles of eighteen and passed through a dryer maintained at 190\u00b0 to 195 \u00b0C. A slight tension is maintained on the filaments throughout the drying process. The bundle is then lubricated, wound, inspected, and shipped to customers. The finished product maintains its integrity as a coherent bundle and resists splaying. At trial, the parties concentrated on the drying step, with the Government contending that at this elevated temperature, albeit below the melting point of the polymer (about 240\u00b0 to 245 \u00b0C), fusing or bonding of the individual filaments to each other occurred; whereas, appellant argued that the filaments merely cohered at certain points along the length of the finished product. Both parties presented testimony of expert witnesses as well as photomicrographs of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-16\">\n<em>Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-17\">The Customs Court observed that the statutory definition of \u201cmonofilaments\u201d in headnote 3(b) is not limited to single filaments, but also includes \u201csingle filaments . produced from two or more filaments fused or bonded together,\u201d and concluded that, if fusing or bonding had occurred, the imported merchandise was correctly classified and the protest had to be denied. After reviewing the testimony of both parties, the court accepted that of the Government\u2019s witness, Dr. Couper, who stated that at the points of contact the filaments were \u201ccoalesced, which is to become unitary,\u201d and that \u201cbonding, very clearly, is used in this sense and fusion is used loosely in this sense. But bonding and coalesence [sic], especially, refer to this phenomenon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-18\">The court noted that appellant had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the Government\u2019s classification was incorrect; but that appellant\u2019s witnesses could not deny the existence of the phenomena that caused Dr. Couper to conclude that the filaments had \u201ccoalesced\u201d or \u201cfused,\u201d particularly their incapability of being separated without causing a \u201cwebbing\u201d or \u201ctearing.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that individual filaments in Sar-lane \u201chave been fused or bonded together in the process of its production\u201d and denied the protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-19\">\n<em>The \u201cSingle\" Filament Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-20\">Appellant initially urges that the Customs Court bypassed the threshold issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>of whether Sarlane is a <em>single </em>filament. It contends that in order to be properly classifiable as a \u201cmonofilament,\u201d the individual filaments in Sarlane would have to be fused or bonded together into a single filament.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, such a restrictive interpretation of the headnote 3 definition of \u201cmonofilament\u201d would render the \u201cbonded\u201d portion of the definition superfluous, since \u201cbonded\u201d filaments could not form a single, unitary filament. Fusing is a chemical joining to become unitary,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as opposed to bonding, in which there is a joining but not a unification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress is presumed not to have used superfluous words in a statute. <em>Platt v. Union Pacific Railroad, </em>99 U.S. 48, 58, 25 L.Ed. 424 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Such a restrictive interpretation would also be contrary to the commercially understood meaning of \u201cmonofilament\u201d; whereas, the terms in tariff acts presumably carry the meaning given them in trade and commerce. <em>Barnebey-Cheney Co. v. United States, </em>487 F.2d 553, 61 CCPA 10, C.A.D. 1110 (1973); <em>Hummel Chemical Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>29 CCPA 178, C.A.D. 189 (1941). Moreover, the <em>Tariff Classification Study, </em>Schedule 3 at 515 (1960), clearly indicates that Congress was made aware that certain spandex filaments had been produced which, although originating in production as multiple filaments, were caused to so coalesce or adhere to each other that the finished product was utilized by the textile industry as a monofilament.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">Although, as pointed out by appellant, Congress was made aware of such functional monofilaments in a proposed amendment by the Man-Made Fiber Producers Association (MFPA) to the definition of \u201cgrouped filaments\u201d to exclude such functional mono-filaments from that item, and did not adopt the amendment, we are not persuaded that this evidenced Congressional intent to include filaments such as Sarlane under the \u201cgrouped filaments\u201d item. While the MFPA proposal was not accepted, the definition of \u201cmonofilaments,\u201d which theretofore had been restricted to single, unitary filaments,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was amended to embrace \u201cfilaments fused, or bonded together,\u201d as now provided. Also, we note the similarity of the language in the MFPA proposal<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u201ccoalesce\u201d and \u201cadhere\u201d) to the headnote language of \u201cfused\u201d (equated by appellant\u2019s own witness with \u201ccoalesced\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>) and \u201cbonded\u201d (synonymous with \u201cadhere\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>). It is clear that Congress, instead of adopting the MFPA proposal to <em>exclude </em>functional mono-filaments from the \u201cgrouped filaments\u201d classification, broadened the definition of \u201cmonofilaments\u201d to embrace such products.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-17\">Appellant further argues that Sarlane is not a \u201cfunctional monofilament\u201d because \u201cit exhibits characteristics of a true multifi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>lament in that its fibers act independently.\u201d However, the issue is whether the individual filaments in Sarlane are \u201cfused, or bonded together,\u201d not whether they exhibit mul-tifilament characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\n<em>The \u201cFused or Bonded Together\u201d Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"a0m-dedup-0\">Dictionary definitions of \u201cfused\u201d and \u201cbonded,\u201d <em>supra </em>notes 3 and 4, indicate that fusing requires heating and melting, while bonding requires the presence of an adhesive substance. However, since we are concerned with the meaning of \u201cfused\u201d and \u201cbonded\u201d in the fiber industry for tariff purposes, testimony regarding the commercial usage of those terms is highly relevant. See <em>E. Dillingham, Inc. v. United States, </em>490 F.2d 967, 61 CCPA 34, C.A.D. 1114, (1974).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s witnesses, Drs. Peters and Golub, both admitted that fusing can occur below the melting point of the filaments. Dr. Golub also testified that a phenomenon known as \u201cself-bonding\u201d can occur which will result in the fusing, coalescing, or bonding of the filaments together without addition of any extra adhesive substance. Thus, it is apparent that, in commercial usage, \u201cfused\u201d does not require melting, and \u201cbonded\u201d does not require the addition of adhesive.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Turning to the process from which Sar-lane is produced, Dr. Peters admitted that \u201cflow or creep\u201d <em>(i. e., </em>\u201cmolecular movement, slippage\u201d) of spandex-type fibers could occur at the temperatures used in the drying stage. He also testified that the filaments were under slight tension as they passed through the dryer.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Appellant challenges the conclusion of the Customs Court and the testimony of Dr. Couper that there was flow or movement of material <em>between </em>Sarlane filaments during the drying stage, arguing that its witnesses were discussing only creep or flow <em>within </em>individual filaments. However, Dr. Peters testified that his own patent, which was directed to a slightly different process of producing spandex fibers, taught that fusing occurred <em>between </em>individual filaments at temperatures below the melting point of the spandex.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Golub testified that all that occurred during the Sarlane drying step was that the individual filaments \u201ccohered\u201d (/. e., touched), but that no flow occurred between filaments. However, the photomicrograph exhibits clearly show a tearing or ripping of the Sarlane filaments when separated, and Dr. Couper\u2019s testimony on the appearance of web-like material at the points of tearing on the Sarlane filaments stands largely unrebutted. If the \u201ccohesion\u201d theory of Dr. Golub were correct, separation of the filaments would not result in a ripping or tearing; rather, their surfaces would remain intact \u2014 much like the metal surfaces in Golub\u2019s \u201cJohanson block\u201d analogy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">We are satisfied that the Customs Court did not err in concluding that individual filaments in Sarlane were \u201cfused, or bonded together\u201d to the extent that such filaments were thereafter no longer independent filaments and that appellant failed to carry its burden of proving the Government\u2019s classification incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Customs Court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-14\">. <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary </em>2181 (1971) defines \u201cspandex\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL6\">any of various synthetic textile elastic fibers that are long-chain polymers composed of at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>least 85 percent of a segmented polyurethane.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">. <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary </em>1462 (1961) defines \u201cmonofilament\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">a single untwisted synthetic filament (as of nylon) made in varying diameters for use in textiles, hosiery, and screens or as bristles, fishing lines, and sutures \u2014 compare MULTI-FILAMENT.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\">. <em>Webster\u2019s, supra </em>note 2 at 925, defines \u201cfused\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">la: melted together: united by heating .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-11\">. <em>Webster\u2019s, supra </em>note 2 at 250, defines \u201cbond\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-13\">an adhesive that binds different ingredients together ... 3: to bind together or connect by or as if by bonds: as a : to cause to adhere firmly (as metal to glass or plastic).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-19\"><em>Fairchild\u2019s Dictionary of Textiles </em>246 (1967) defines and contrasts fusing and bonding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">Fusing: The chemical joining of two fabrics to become one fabric, as opposed to bonding, in which the fabrics are joined, but do not become one fabric.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-21\">. <em>Tariff Classification Study, supra </em>at 285.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b749-22\">. <em>Id. </em>at 515.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b749-23\">.
