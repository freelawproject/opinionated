We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">Opposer is the owner of registration No. 761,880 issued December 24, 1963, of the mark MONOCERAM for \u201ccapacitors\u201d without limitation. Its priority of both use and registration by at least ten years and its continuing use are uncontested. Sales of capacitors under its above mark in the period of 1970-75, as found by the board, were in excess of $35 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">The goods being identical, the sole issue is under \u00a7 2(d) of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)) which provides that registration shall be refused if MICROCERAM \u201cso resembles\u201d MONOCERAM \u201cas to be likely * * * to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">It is too well settled as an axiom of trademark law to require citation of precedent that on the statutory issue involved here doubts are to be resolved against the newcomer and in favor of the prior user.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-19\">In view of opposer\u2019s ownership of its presently existing <em>registration </em>of MONOCERAM for \u201ccapacitors\u201d broadly, the particular uses of the mark it happened to be making at the time of testimony are irrelevant, together with the particular types of purchasers assumed to be buying from op-poser. It appears to us that the TTAB gave too much weight to factual conclusions it drew on these points from opposer\u2019s exhibits in reaching its key conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Here, since the goods are capacitors that find application, <em>according to opposer\u2019s brochure, </em>in technical or sophisticated equipment, the purchasers would normally be technically trained and informed in this field and know what they want and therefore purchase with care. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Opposer\u2019s rights are not to be tied to its current business practices, which may change at any time. Its rights are as broad as its registration for \u201ccapacitors.\u201d <em>Wella Corp. </em>v. <em>California Concept Corp., </em>558 F.2d 1019, 1021-22, 194 USPQ 419, 421-22 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977); <em>Contour Chair-Lounge Co. v. Englander Co., </em>324 F.2d 186, 187-88, 51 CCPA 833, 835, 139 USPQ 285, 286-87 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Capacitors are of enormous variety in type and size, ranging from a unit of a couple of cubic feet or more to an almost invisible speck in an integrated circuit. Even the more limited class of ceramic capacitors, to which the parties here apparently presently apply their marks, is commercially available in great variety, sold to and bought by a wide variety of customers, as may be seen from standard reference works such as electronics dictionaries. Therefore, we cannot agree with the board that \u201cthe goods\u201d are necessarily \u201cin technical or sophisticated equipment\u201d the buyers being \u201ctechnically trained and informed\u201d and, by implication, selecting what they know they want from the brochures of known makers. They can as well be kids assembling educational science kits and picking them off of racks in stores selling electronic parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Application here of a \u201cdiscriminating purchaser\u201d assumption is unwarranted. Regarding the goods described in the application of appellee and the registration of opposer as what they may well be \u2014 off-the-shelf or hanging-on-the-rack items \u2014 we believe the marks are so close as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake <em>as to source </em>among a substantial group of potential customers. The statute therefore precludes registration, and, if there be doubt about it, resolution of the doubt must be in favor of sustaining the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">With respect to the many third-party registrations put into the record of marks using \u201cmono\u201d or \u201cmicro\u201d or \u201cceramic\u201d or parts thereof, there is no evidence showing that any of them are <em>in use </em>so as to have conditioned the minds of prospective purchasers. Obviously, the marks here are constructed of old linguistic elements, but they must be considered as wholes, and <em>not </em>on the basis of side-by-side comparison, and in the light of the fallibility of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The TTAB felt that since CERAM is suggestive of a ceramic material, the syllables MONO and MICRO alone \u201cgenerate the commercial impact of the marks as a whole.\u201d We wholly disagree. Each syllable of each mark generates an \u201cimpact,\u201d but the only impact to be considered is that of the whole. <em>Massey Junior College, Inc. v. Fashion Institute of Technology, </em>492 F.2d 1399,181 USPQ 272 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974). While MONO may suggest to a purchaser that a capacitor is of the monolithic type, monolithic ceramic capacitors may be very small (MICRO), as opposer\u2019s evidence shows. MONOCERAM and MICROCERAM are not sufficiently different in their total impacts to eliminate likelihood of confusion as to source.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">The decision dismissing the opposition is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\">.
