We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-27\">The mark is the stylized lettering of \u201cbalsam\u201d for hair conditioner and hair shampoo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>shown below. (Appellant has disclaimed the term \u201cbalsam\u201d itself.)</p>\n<p id=\"A0q\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"37\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGoAAAAlAQAAAACCVEGDAAABG0lEQVR4nF2QMU7DUBBEnxcrcYESt0gIhxOQEoEUO12OQoUoqcA01NwArkGFkaho6GixCDU4BqQfYf+l+ImxmW40u7Ozw6eqqupPrJFGmbwDwDd1AYiyQgUnCIwANlmeso94ThOAbSRcD5cwQAa0sd4FZgQIjfUYdRYt3BZhdWj7djKN1CQyK4qvZ1vBHfhIurO1KKpjrAuwsPH8fmFsPFetEgH8cdG6S4X4KQCZAAR5W60v2yEJb2o/+6PBGySO+kDPbrxE00b1suYrAY722lZKMFrvuhhWAa5I3L+ughTkw3usl+HBhBwDpOfkuwYzIOqbRMgu/NeeZ1bjqqpD1aU9i69N5jVFAuXTvyY7tOzSvEsfQFsYZh015BeD+HYFGRpGvQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"106\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The sole issue whether the mark is <em>capable </em>of indicating origin of appellant\u2019s goods to an ordinary purchaser and whether appellant\u2019s mark was intended primarily for that purpose. <em>In re Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., </em>335 F.2d 836, 51 CCPA 1546, 142 USPQ 366 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"pAjC\">Citing <em>In re Rubinstein, </em>410 F.2d 438, 56 CCPA 1110, 161 USPQ 606 (1969), the Solicitor argues that \u201cappellant\u2019s stylized term . . . serves to descriptively identify the nature of the goods and not their source.\u201d However, descriptiveness is irrelevant, since the term has been disclaimed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, descriptiveness alone does not necessarily preclude registration on the Supplemental Register. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"pAdz\">Although the only exhibit of the mark shows its use on a bottle in association with appellant\u2019s well-known house mark \u201cWEL-LA,\u201d this does not preclude the mark from having a capability of indicating origin of appellant\u2019s goods. Such a capability is clear from the evidence of registered marks in which the term \u201cBALSAM\u201d appears in lettering not even approaching the unique style of appellant\u2019s mark.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to appellant\u2019s primary intention that the mark indicate origin of its goods, we are satisfied that such intent is supported by the record, and the PTO has produced nothing to rebut it. See <em>In re Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that appellant\u2019s mark is capable of indicating origin of appellant\u2019s goods and that the mark was intended primarily for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The decision of the TTAB is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-23\">. The Solicitor\u2019s argument that \u201cbalsam\u201d is generic falls for the same reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-24\">. Appellant argues that various letters (of record) from competitors indicating their discontinuance of use of its mark upon threat of legal action are evidence of its distinctiveness, but we agree with the TTAB that such evidence shows a desire of competitors to avoid litigation rather than distinctiveness of the mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
