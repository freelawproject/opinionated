We find the answer obvious in the statute creating the Postal Service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress expressly provided in the Service\u2019s authorizing statute that the Service could \u201csue and be sued.\u201d There was no qualification upon the Service\u2019s amenability to process stated in the statute, as is the case in connection with the provision to \u201csue and be sued\u201d in statutes creating other governmental agencies such as \u00a7 1132c-2(b)(2), 20 U.S.C. (Commissioner of Education), and \u00a7 634(b)(1), 15 U.S.C. (Small Business Administration). Under those circumstances, the phrase \u201csue and be sued\u201d we have heretofore ruled in <em>White v. Bloomberg </em>(4th Cir. 1974) 501 F.2d 1379, 1386, is to be given its normal connotation and construction as a waiver of constitutional immunity, embracing all civil legal procedures. Under this construction, garnishment procedures would clearly be covered within the \u201csue and be sued\u201d waiver provision, and that has been the uniform conclusion of the Circuit Courts which have been faced with the issue. <em>May Dept. Stores Co. v. Williamson </em>(8th Cir. 1977) 549 F.2d 1147; <em>Standard Oil Div., American Oil Co. v. Starks </em>(7th Cir. 1975) 528 F.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the district court in No. 77-1037, in which a right of garnishment against the Service was denied, and we affirm the decision of the district court in No. 77-1240, in which the right was upheld.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-22\">. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
