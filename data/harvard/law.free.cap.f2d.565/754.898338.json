SRELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<author id=\"b827-24\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b827-25\">On December 19, 1974 the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), acting pursuant to his authority under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, determined that Rochester Quadrajet carburetors installed in 1965 Chevrolets and 1966 Chevrolets and Buicks contained a \u201cdefect which relates to motor vehicle safety\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>and that the manufacturer was therefore required to notify owners of the potential danger. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1391, 1397, 1402 (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Motors did not comply with the notice order; instead, it filed suit to have the order declared null and void. At the same time the Administrator brought suit to enforce the order and to impose a civil penalty on General Motors for its refusal to comply. The two cases were consolidated and, after substantial discovery, the District Court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and fined General Motors $400,000\u2014 the maximum statutory penalty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed. It is our conclusion that the grant of summary judgment was appropriate, but that the penalty should not have been imposed absent briefs or argument on point, or any form of hearing. We therefore remand this case to the District Court for further consideration of the penalty question.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Safety Act), manufacturers are required to notify purchasers of motor vehicles containing \u201ca defect which relates to motor vehicle safety,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(e) (1970), as determined by the Administrator of NHTSA. General Motors has conceded, both in the District Court and in this appeal, that the Government successfully established the existence of a \u201cdefect\u201d in the Rochester Quadrajet carburetors. When these carburetors were manufactured holes were drilled into them; these holes were later sealed by inserting metal plugs. One of the holes, in the fuel inlet portion of the carburetor, was sealed by a plug known as the \u201cfuel inlet plug.\u201d If this plug becomes dislodged gasoline can spill directly into the engine, resulting in a fire under the hood. According to the affidavit of one of General Motors\u2019 own employees, a number of these fuel inlet plugs were improperly inserted during the assembly process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While only figures maintained in General Motors\u2019 central \u2014 as opposed to its regional \u2014 offices have been available in this litigation, and while all incidents of carburetor failures clearly may not be reported, the record discloses <em>at least </em>665 reported incidents of engine compartment fires in vehicles equipped with the Rochester Quadrajet carburetor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As General Motors recognized, under prior case law this evidence clearly establishes as a matter of law that the vehicles in question contain a \u201cdefect\u201d within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">General Motors, however, argues that summary judgment was inappropriate be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>cause material questions of fact exist as to whether this defect \u201crelates to motor vehicle safety.\u201d \u201cMotor vehicle safety\u201d is defined in the Act to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-x\">the performance of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment in such a manner that the public is protected against unreasonable risk of accidents occurring as a result of the design, construction or performance of motor vehicles and is also protected against unreasonable risk of death or injury to persons in the event accidents do occur, and includes nonoperational safety of such vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(1) (1970). According to General Motors, the defect in the Rochester Quadrajet carburetor does not \u2014 or at least may not \u2014 pose an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d of accidents or injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In <em>United States v. General Motors Corp. (Wheels), </em>171 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 518 F.2d 420, 435 (1975), we held that a \u201ccommonsense\u201d approach must be adopted in construing the Safety Act and, particularly, the term \u201cunreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Applying such an approach, we can see no question but that engine fires, which may occur on thoroughfares where pulling over and standing outside the car is difficult or dangerous, or which may take the driver by surprise and quickly spread to the passenger compartment, are extremely dangerous for all involved and should be considered an unreasonable risk to safety. Indeed, this conclusion appears to be mandated by our recent decision in <em>United States v. General Motors Corp. (Pitman Arm), </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. 30, 561 F.2d 923 (Nos. 75-1751 &amp; 75-1752, decided June 28, 1977), where we held summary judgment to be appropriate where the evidence, as in this case, was uncontradicted as to the critical facts: that failures in the vehicles\u2019 steering pitman arms occurred in the past while the vehicles were being driven and that such failures cause the driver to lose control of the car.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">In appealing the summary judgment in this case, General Motors seeks to call into question this commonsense conclusion as to what is an unreasonable risk by relying on affidavits of two of its employees presenting predictions as to the likely number of carburetor failures and resulting injuries in the future. The party opposing a motion for summary judgment is, of course, entitled to all favorable inferences in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact has been raised. <em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962); <em>United States v. General Motors Corp. (Wheels), supra, </em>518 F.2d at 441. Therefore, we do not consider the credibility of the affidavits or the general trustworthiness of predictions offered by General Motors. Our affirmance of the District Court\u2019s summary judgment order rests on the fact that, even if the numbers contained in these affidavits were established to be accurate predictions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>this would not relieve General Motors of its obligation to inform the vehicle owners in question of the admitted defect in the cars they are operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">General Motors\u2019 first affidavit seeks to predict the number of injuries likely to be suffered in the future as a result of dislodgment of fuel inlet plugs in 1965 Chevrolets and 1966 Chevrolets and Buicks. Taking into account the number of such vehicles still on the road, and assuming 665 prior fires and between one and 15 prior injuries as a result of these fires, General Motors\u2019 manager of Analysis and Product Assurance predicts between less than one and three injuries in the future.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second affidavit is addressed not to the likely number of injuries, but rather to predictions of instances of future plug failure. In this affidavit a General Motors Staff Analysis Engineer concludes that dislodgment of the fuel inlet plugs is due in part to a process of thermal expansion known as \u201ccreep\u201d and that, given the age of the cars in question, <em>\u201cvirtually </em>all creep to which they were theoretically subject has already occurred.\u201d Thus it is his view \u201cthat the number of future plug failures will be <em>negligible.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1T\">Apparently General Motors\u2019 position is that since, given the passage of time and the reduction in the number of vehicles on the road, many or most of the failures and injuries resulting from this defective carburetor have already occurred, it is no longer required to take any action to protect against those failures that it <em>admits </em>will occur in the future. Significantly, General Motors does not even suggest that all \u201ccreep\u201d has ceased or that all failures that will occur have already occurred. Rather, it argues only that these failures should somehow be viewed as \u201cnegligible\u201d \u2014 as capable of being ignored \u2014 and that the risk posed by the certain occurrence of at least some engine fires in the future should therefore be considered not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">The basic purpose of the Safety Act is to reduce motor vehicle accidents, injuries, and property damage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In adopting the notification provisions of the Act the Senate Commerce Committee found that \u201c[d]efi-ciencies in past industry practices relating to the notification and curing of manufacturing defects necessitate the imposition of mandatory procedures to insure such notification of purchasers and correction of <em>all </em>safety-related defects.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1301, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1966), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1966, p. 2712 (emphasis added). In our view, where a defect \u2014 a term used in the sense of an \u201cerror or mistake\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 has been established in a motor vehicle, and where this defect results in hazards as potentially dangerous as a sudden engine fire, and where there is no dispute that at least some such hazards, in this case fires, can definitely be expected to occur in the future, then the defect must be viewed as one \u201crelated to motor vehicle safety,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the Act\u2019s basic purpose of protecting the public requires that notification be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>In this case it is clear, with the gift of hindsight, that this purpose would have been best served had a notification order been issued some seven years ago. At that time NHTSA, relying substantially on information provided by General Motors predicting a substantial decrease in future carburetor failures, decided not to require notification. General Motors\u2019 predictions later proved wholly inaccurate, and the order was finally issued in 1974.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Our purpose in noting this is not to assign any fault for this unfortunate delay, or to cast doubt upon the trustworthiness of General Motors\u2019 instant predictions on the basis of their past record of inaccuracy. Rather, it is only to point out that if the consumer safety would have been best served by'an order in the first instance, it would be most ill served by extending this delay based on new predictions that the number of injuries caused by the defect will diminish.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The fact remains that some of these cars continue to be driven and that, according to General Motors, some \u201cnegligible\u201d number of them will burst into flames in the future. Thus General Motors\u2019 own affidavits clearly establish that some drivers of 1965 Chevro-lets and 1966 Chevrolets and Buicks face not simply an unreasonable risk of carburetor failures \u2014 but a virtual certainty. Nor does General Motors dispute that this is a result of improper assembly of the carburetors. To be sure, General Motors does argue, based on instances of injuries reported to it in the past, that the risk of injuries resulting from these \u201cnegligible\u201d failures will be \u201cexceedingly small.\u201d <em>See </em>General Motors brief at 22. In the context of this case, however, even an \u201cexceedingly small\u201d number of injuries from this admittedly defective and clearly dangerous carburetor appears to us \u201cunreasonably large.\u201d Moreover, the fact that in past reported cases good luck and swift reactions have prevented many serious injuries does not mean that luck will continue to work in favor of passengers of burning cars. As a matter of statistics their chances may well, as General Motors suggests, appear quite favorable. The purpose of the Safety Act, however, is not to protect individuals from the risks associated with defective vehicles only after serious injuries have already occurred; it is to prevent serious injuries stemming from established defects before they occur. To now hold that General Motors, having managed to avoid issuance of an order in 1970, was not required to notify those operators who remain subject to risk since most of the failures have already occurred would be to leave this purpose permanently unfulfilled and to establish a system which encourages manufacturers to delay proceedings whenever possible \u2014 at the expense of those endangered by defective vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">This conclusion is in no way undercut, as General Motors suggests, by our view of the \u201c \u2018commonsense\u2019 balancing of safety benefits and economic cost\u201d articulated in <em>Wheels, supra, </em>518 F.2d at 435. In <em>Wheels </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">The commonsense limitation reflects an awareness that costs must be considered in determining what safety measures are required by the Act. While some margin of safety must be built-in [s/c ] to protect against failures during day-to-day operation, manufacturers are not required to design vehicles or components that never fail. It would appear economically, if not technologically, infeasible for manufacturers to use tires that do not wear out, lights that never burn out, and brakes that do not need adjusting or relining. Such parts cannot reasonably be termed defective if they fail because of age and wear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 436. Here we do not deal with a part which is subject to failure because of age and wear, or a part which drivers reasonably expect to have to check and replace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>because of the particular problem involved. Nor is there involved any question of requiring General Motors to produce perfect, accident-free vehicles at any expense. Rather, we are merely requiring General Motors to notify owners as to a carburetor which did not, from the beginning, meet the manufacturer\u2019s own standards for proper assembly and which, absent notification, will in the future cause at <em>least </em>some operators and passengers to be confronted with the clear dangers attending a sudden fire in the engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Under the Safety Act a manufacturer may be liable for a maximum civil penalty of $400,000 for failure to comply with a notification order issued by the Administrator.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While no civil penalty can attach if the manufacturer is successful in defending an enforcement action, a manufacturer who chooses not to comply with an order when issued \u2014 and who does not secure a stay of the Administrator\u2019s order or an injunction against its enforcement <em>pendente lite </em>\u2014may be penalized if the Administrator\u2019s order is upheld.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this case the District Court, after granting the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, imposed the maximum civil penalty on General Motors for its failure to comply with the Administrator\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">General Motors challenges this penalty on two grounds. First, it argues that the penalty scheme of the Act is unconstitutional. This argument we reject. The penalty provision of the Safety Act serves to encourage manufacturers promptly to obey valid orders of the Administrator, rather than to delay compliance until after judicial review at the potential risk to the' public safety.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While this legitimate purpose could not constitutionally be furthered by a penalty system which effectively blocked judicial review of reasonable claims, the penalty system of the Safety Act does not operate to do so, and its constitutionality has been recognized in the past.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A manufacturer in General Motors\u2019 position may secure preliminary injunctive relief against enforcement of the Administrator\u2019s order if its claim is a substantial and meritorious one. If such relief is not available to General Motors, as it asserts, because it could not have demonstrated sufficient injury to secure injunctive relief, <em>see </em>General Motors brief at 27, then that alone would seem to establish that, given General Motors\u2019 position, a potential penalty of up to $400,000 does not present a very serious obstacle to judicial review. As Justice Cardozo noted in <em>Life &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. v. McCray, </em>291 U.S. 566, 574-575, 54 S.Ct. 482, 486, 78 L.Ed. 987 (1934):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-12\">One who refuses to pay when the law requires that he shall, acts at his peril, in the sense that he must be held to the acceptance of any lawful consequences attached to the refusal. It is no answer in such circumstances that he has acted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>good faith. \u201cThe law is full of instances where a man\u2019s fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree.\u201d <em>Nash v. United States, </em>229 U.S. 373, 377, [33 S.Ct. 780, 57 L.Ed. 1232], * * * It is all \u201ca question of more or less.\u201d <em>Sexton v. Kessler &amp; Co.[,] </em>225 U.S. 90, 98 [32 S.Ct. 657, 56 L.Ed. 995]. The price of error may be so heavy as to erect an unfair barrier against the endeavor of an honest litigant to obtain the judgment of a court. In that event, the Constitution intervenes and keeps the court room open. * * * On the other hand, the penalty may be no more than the fair price of the adventure. * * * In that event, the litigant must pay for his experience, like others who have tried and lost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">General Motors also argues that the penalty in this case was imposed precipitously, absent argument or briefing on the Government\u2019s request for the maximum penalty. The Safety Act provides: \u201cIn determining the amount of such penalty * * the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged and the gravity of the violation shall be considered.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1398(b) (1970). As General Motors concedes, there was certainly no need for any hearing or argument in this case with respect to the \u201csize of the business\u201d criterion. Moreover, as Part I of this opinion makes clear, we see little question as to the gravity of the danger posed by General Motors\u2019 failure to notify owners about the defect in their carburetors. In <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Coleman, </em>402 F.Supp. 475, 489 (D. D.C. 1975) (three-judge court), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>425 U.S. 927, 96 S.Ct. 1656, 48 L.Ed.2d 170 (1976), however, the court, in upholding the similar penalty provisions of the amended Act against constitutional challenge, found that \u201cthe reasonableness and good faith of the manufacturer\u2019s noncompliance may properly be considered in mitigation of the statutory maximum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">This case was one of the first enforcement actions relating to defect notifications filed in this circuit, <em>see Wheels, supra, </em>518 F.2d at 425 n.1, and at that time there was some uncertainty as to the proper application of the Act. Indeed, as General Motors points out, shortly before this case was filed the Government had been denied summary judgment in the <em>Pitman Arm </em>case \u2014 a decision recently reversed by this court. <em>See United States v. General Motors Corp. (Pitman Arm), supra. </em>As a result there may\u2014 although we do not decide \u2014 be some basis for imposing <em>less </em>than the maximum fine upon General Motors on the ground that its decision to challenge the directive through the courts was a reasonable one.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the very least, we feel, General Motors ought to be heard on this issue. While there is some dispute as to whether it was afforded an opportunity to speak on the penalty question earlier and chose not to \u2014 as opposed to whether no opportunity was offered at all<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u2014we believe the best course at this time is to remand this case to the District Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the purpose of considering argument by the parties as to the appropriate penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">. The Act was amended on October 27, 1974 by Pub.L. No. 93-492, 88 Stat. 1477. The defect notification provision in \u00a7 1402 was replaced by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1411-1420, which explicitly require manufacturers to repair or replace defective parts at no charge when the notification order is issued within eight years of the first purchase. However, the definitions of \u201cdefect\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle safety,\u201d which are central to this litigation, were not altered by the 1974 amendments. Those amendments do not apply to this case, since the order here was issued prior to the effective date of the Act, <em>see </em>Pub.L.

The case was first opened in November 1967 on the basis of a single consumer complaint, and was closed shortly thereafter. It was reactivated in September 1969 after receipt of three additional complaint letters and publication of an article in <em>Product Engineering </em>relating to inlet plug failures. <em>See </em>JA 93. At that time General Motors predicted a total of 43 carburetor failures in the vehicles in question during 1970 and 1971; it later reported that 167 failures had in fact occurred during this period. <em>See </em>JA 103, 134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\">.

On appeal the Government also claims, apparently for the first time, that General Motors should be and has been penalized not only for its refusal to comply with the Administrator\u2019s notification order, but also for its failure independently to recall the vehicles in question pri- or to the NHTSA directive. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(a) (1970). Such a violation, however, is not explicitly mentioned in the proposed findings submitted by the Government to the District Court or in the order actually entered. Moreover, absent some showing of bad faith on the part of General Motors in withholding documents from or submitting false information to NHTSA, there would appear to be little basis for concluding that prior to 1974 General Motors, by relying on the same information accepted by NHTSA as sufficient to justify its failure to order notification, was in violation of the Act for failing independently to notify owners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b833-11\">. In response to the Government\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, including its request for the maximum penalty, General Motors asserted: \u201cThe penalty question was neither briefed nor argued. General Motors is entitled to further proceedings, including an evidentiary hearing and further discovery of the Government, before the Court makes any determination on that issue.\u201d JA 209. The Government responded by claiming that there were no \u201cmitigating factors\u201d in the case, given General Motors\u2019 continued refusal to notify. JA 210-212.
