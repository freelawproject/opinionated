They seek either reversal of the finding of deportability or an evidentiary hearing to determine whether either the arrest or the search was illegal and whether evidence taken during either the arrest or search was improperly introduced into their deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The facts preceding their hearing were sketchily set forth in their affidavits supporting their motion to suppress any evidence taken during the arrest and search. They assert that Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) investigators entered a Chinese restaurant in Raynham, Massachusetts, handcuffed them, took them to their apartment, and entered it without consent and without a warrant; that petitioners were \u201cin fear\u201d; and that certain entry forms and other documentation \u201cmay have been taken from [them]\u201d. Petitioners had little or no understanding of English, and required the services of an interpreter at their hearing. The motions to suppress were summarily denied without hearing or argument. All of the documentary evidence introduced, with one exception, came from INS files or had been given to INS by vessel agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">The one exception was a Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit, which indicated that petitioner Wong Pui Tong was an alien crewman (allowed to stay in the United States for a period of 29 days after arrival) and that his last arrival date was February 21, 1974. There is nothing to indicate where this permit, normally in the possession of an alien crewman, came from. When petitioner Wong Chung Che, who testified first, was asked on direct examination what documentation had been taken from him, the immigration judge prevented an answer, it being clear that no documentation other than that from INS files or the vessel\u2019s agent had been introduced as to him. The question was not repeated to Wong Pui Tong.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">The immigration judge disposed of the allegations in the affidavits by noting that they were \u201cmost inconclusive\u201d and that petitioners were \u201ccertainly aware\u201d whether anything had been taken from them. As to petitioner Wong Chung Che, he found clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence of de-portability from a Report of Deserting Crewmen form received from the vessel and a report of investigation from INS files, together with a Seaman\u2019s Identity Book and photographs of the petitioner. As to Wong Pui Tong, the immigration judge found sufficient evidence in the Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit, which showed petitioner\u2019s name, status as a crewman, date of last arrival, but no evidence of an extension of time beyond 29 days thereafter. The immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>gration judge dealt with the objection to the permit by observing that (a) it is required by law to be in a crewman\u2019s possession and to be shown to an immigration officer on request, and (b) the circumstances of petitioner\u2019s arrest were irrelevant. He did not deal with the issue of a possibly illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The board affirmed the ' immigration judge\u2019s conclusion as to deportability. It observed that Wong Pui Tong\u2019s Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit, as well as petitioner\u2019s burden to show time, place, and manner of entry into the United States constituted clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence of deportability. It dealt with the objection to the permit by noting that it was admissible as an official document produced in the regular course of INS operations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that it was no less admissible although petitioner\u2019s presence had been discovered through an improper arrest. The Board did not consider the issue of a possibly illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">We first affirm the Board\u2019s action as to Wong Chung Che. Any challenge to either his arrest or search of his premises is irrelevant. There is no indication or even contention that anything introduced in evidence against him was tainted by any illegality. The only question of taint relates to the Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit introduced against Wong Pui Tong.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Our threshold question is whether petitioner Wong Pui Tong has done enough to raise the issues of illegal arrest and search. \u201cThe cases hold that a mere demand for a suppression hearing is not enough to cause one to be held. Statements in a motion for suppression must be specific and detailed. They should not be general, conclusory or based on conjecture. They must be based on personal knowledge. They [sic] must set forth a prima facie case. The articles to be suppressed must be enumerated.\u201d <em>Matter of Wong, </em>13 I &amp; N Dec. 820, 822 (BIA 1971) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">It seems to us that petitioner has met that burden. Petitioner\u2019s knowledge of the English language was sharply limited. If, as alleged, he was handcuffed at a restaurant and taken to his apartment, had not given consent, and was in fear, and if agents did rummage around, it is not wildly unlikely that he did not know what was actually taken. While we might suppose that normally an alien crewman would know where his landing permit was, we now know that petitioner left his ship on February 21, 1974, and was not apprehended until September 2, 1976, over two and one half years later. Had petitioner affirmatively alleged that his Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit had been taken in the search, there would be no question but that he had met his burden. <em>Matter of Tang, </em>13 I &amp; N Dec. 691, 692 (BIA 1971); <em>Matter of Wong, supra. </em>That petitioner, if confused, chose to be scrupulously honest should not be held against him so long as the specific circumstances alleged raise the realistic possibility of an illegal search. In the absence of an explanation or disclaimer of illegal acquisition by the government, we hold that the allegations and circumstances here were sufficient to have required an evidentiary hearing, if illegality of the arrest or search could have a bearing on the legality of the deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Insofar as petitioner\u2019s challenge rests on an allegedly illegal arrest, the law seems to be well established that an illegal arrest which results in identifying a person for deportation proceedings does not invalidate the proceedings. <em>Huerta-Cabrera v. INS, </em>466 F.2d 759 (7th Cir. 1972). Nor does such an arrest in which statements are obtained that would be suppressed, for lack of warnings, in a criminal trial render The statements inadmissible in a deportation proceeding. <em>United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, </em>263 U.S. 149, 44 S.Ct. 54, 68 L.Ed. 221 (1923); <em>Chavez-Raya v. INS, </em>519 F.2d 397 (7th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">The more troublesome question is one addressed by neither the immigration judge nor the Board \u2014 whether evidence secured by an illegal search is admissible in a depor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tation hearing. Unfortunately, we have not been greatly assisted by counsel. Petitioner\u2019s brief struggles with marginal authorities and analogies. The government advances the broad proposition that \u201ceven if material had been introduced at the deportation hearing that had been improperly obtained for the purposes of a criminal proceeding, it would still have been admissible at the deportation hearing.\u201d For this proposition, which must have been intended to respond to petitioner\u2019s illegal search claim as well as his illegal arrest claim, the government cites only cases involving statements made by aliens in the absence of warnings or counsel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a case in which we noted the wide scope of the Board in discretionary matters,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <em>United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, supra. </em>The only case among these which is relevant to the issue of illegal search points against the government. In <em>Bilokumsky </em>the Court said, \u201cIt may be assumed that evidence obtained by the Department through an illegal search and seizure cannot be made the basis of a finding in deportation proceedings.\u201d 263 U.S. at 155, 44 S.Ct. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Gordon and Rosenfield in their treatise, Immigration Law and Procedure, \u00a7 5.2c, p. 5-31, state: \u201cIt is undisputed that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in deportation proceedings and that evidence obtained as the result of an unlawful search cannot be used.\u201d See also <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5.10a, p. 5-116; \u00a7 5.10f, p. 5-141. In <em>Huerta-Cabrera v. INS, supra, </em>the court, after noting that an illegal arrest resulting in obtaining the \u201cbody\u201d of the arrestee did not render a subsequent deportation proceeding the fruit of the poisonous tree, said, \u201cThis would not be a case of the use of evidence seized during the course of an illegal arrest.\u201d 466 F.2d at 761 n.5. <em>See also United States v. Villella, </em>459 F.2d 1028 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>Vlissidis v. Anadell, </em>262 F.2d 398 (7th Cir. 1959). <em>Cf. Katris v. INS, </em>562 F.2d 866, at 869 (2d Cir. 1977) (\u201cAlthough Katris seeks \u2018suppression,\u2019 there is no evidence to suppress. . . . [N]o evidence was seized at or after the time of arrest.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">If petitioner\u2019s Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit was obtained through an illegal search, there is no authority of which we are aware that would make it admissible. Such authority as we have found, however, assumes that it is inadmissible. While wide latitude is permitted the government in introducing statements of arrested suspects, whether or not they might be suppressed in a criminal proceeding, we can think of no justification by necessity for encouraging illegal searches of premises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no doubt that, if the landing permit was obtained through an illegal search, its admission into evidence infected the deportation proceeding. Both the immigration judge and the Board relied on the permit to supply a critical missing link in the evidence. <em>See Au Yi Lau v. INS, </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. 147, 445 F.2d 217, 224 n.11 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">\n<em>We accordingly vacate the order of deportation as to Wong Pui Tong and remand to the Board for an evidentiary hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress insofar as it concerns the legality of any search made of his premises. We affirm the order of deportation as to Wong Chung Che.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-11\">.
