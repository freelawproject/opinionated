All appellants were convicted of two counts of conspiracy to distribute Schedule II controlled substances, one count each of cocaine and methamphetamine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Additionally, McCormick and Carter were convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 by aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances, one count each for cocaine and methamphetamine hydrochloride. The three were tried together, Wein-stein before a jury, while Carter and McCormick were tried to the district court. They present numerous issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">On July 13, 1976, special agent Richard Broughton of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and a confidential informant met with defendant Louis Wein-stein at a delicatessen, the Delly, in Hampton, Virginia. The informant introduced Broughton to Weinstein as the man who wanted \u201cto cop the oz.,\u201d meaning to purchase an ounce of narcotics. Weinstein informed Broughton that defendant Percy Carter had been at the Delly, but now was at his residence waiting for Broughton and the informant. Broughton and the informant then went to Carter\u2019s residence, but soon all three returned to the Delly and met with Weinstein. Weinstein stated that he had been trying to reach \u201chis man,\u201d but that so far he had been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">After a short stop at a pool hall near the Delly, all four men went to the informant\u2019s residence. Weinstein continued efforts to contact \u201chis man,\u201d and during this time began to refer to him as \u201cJim.\u201d Carter assisted in the search by making telephone calls at Weinstein\u2019s direction. During this time, Weinstein suggested that Carter try a particular telephone number, stating that Jim sometimes could be found at that number. Testimony indicated that this telephone number belonged to defendant James McCormick\u2019s brother Jay. During the remainder of the evening\u2019s futile efforts to contact Weinstein\u2019s \u201cman,\u201d Carter also began to refer to him as \u201cJim,\u201d and commented that Jim\u2019s mother ran a ceramic shop in the Tidewater Virginia area. McCormick\u2019s father owns a ceramic shop in Newport News. The purchase price of the cocaine was set (apparently with Carter) at $1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The next day, July 14, Broughton and the informant arranged to meet with Weinstein at a restaurant, but on arriving found Carter there instead. \u201cJim\u201d still had not been talked to, and the three passed the time playing pool and listening to Carter\u2019s accounts of previous marihuana and cocaine transactions. Broughton, Carter, and the informant later met with Weinstein, and then returned to the informant\u2019s residence to wait for Weinstein to contact \u201cJim.\u201d Weinstein finally was successful, and early that evening Broughton, Carter, and the informant met with Weinstein at a pool hall near the delicatessen. Broughton and Weinstein went into a back room, where Broughton paid Weinstein $1400. Wein-stein took the money, left the pool hall, and came under the surveillance of agent Stanley Burroughs of the DEA. Burroughs watched Weinstein enter an automobile parked immediately in front of the poolroom, and identified the driver of the auto as defendant James McCormick. McCormick and Weinstein drove to a nearby shopping center, where Burroughs observed Weinstein \u201chandling something.\u201d After parking for about ten minutes, McCormick drove Weinstein back to the pool hall, and when Weinstein exited the car, Burroughs observed a \u201cwhite object\u201d in Weinstein\u2019s left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">While Weinstein and McCormick were together, Broughton became apprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>that Weinstein might have stolen $1400. Carter, however, provided reassurance, and stated that he and Weinstein had been doing business with \u201cJim\u201d for a long time, and that the dope would be good. On Weinstein\u2019s return, he gave a plastic bag containing white powder to Broughton, and provided advice on how the powder, which Weinstein said was cocaine and which chemical analysis later proved to be cocaine, could be cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Agent Broughton executed a second purchase on August 12, 1976. He met with Weinstein and Carter at the delicatessen, and at approximately 8:15 p. m., all three left for \u201cJim\u2019s house.\u201d They arrived at 2113 Cunningham Drive, part of an apartment complex in Norfolk. Broughton gave Weinstein $2700 for the purchase of two ounces of cocaine, and Weinstein entered the complex at No. 2113. After some delay, Broughton became worried that Weinstein had stolen the money, and despite assurances from Carter that business had been done this way for years, Broughton and Carter conducted an unsuccessful search. Carter stated that Jim lived with his girl friend in the complex, but that he could not remember which apartment because the only time he had been there he had been drunk. Broughton later saw Weinstein returning through the foyer of 2113 Cunningham.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Carter, Weinstein, and Broughton then returned to the car, where Weinstein gave Broughton a package of tan powder and $100 in change. At this time, Carter asked for \u201csome cash for my time in setting up the deal,\u201d and Broughton gave him twenty dollars. Later that night, Broughton and other DEA agents field-tested the purchase. They discovered that the drug was not cocaine, but possibly an amphetamine,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that Weinstein had shortchanged Brough-ton by selling only an ounce and a half, not the two ounces bargained for.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The next day, Broughton confronted Weinstein with these discrepancies. Wein-stein responded that the drug was a combination of cocaine and amphetamine,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that a half-ounce had been kept out of the package for the informant. At Broughton\u2019s insistence, he and Weinstein retrieved the missing quantity of drugs from Carter\u2019s residence. Weinstein reported that Carter had picked up the drug at \u201cJim\u2019s\u201d apartment, but gave no reason for his failure to tell Broughton about the missing half-ounce.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The final drug transaction occurred on September 30, 1976. Pursuant to previous arrangements Broughton had made with Weinstein, the two men met at the Delly to consummate the sale. The terms of the purchase were three ounces of cocaine for $4000. Weinstein demanded the money \u201cup front,\u201d as in the previous two transactions, but Broughton demurred because of the missing half-ounce from the previous transaction. Weinstein argued, but eventually agreed \u201cto see if he could work it out with his man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">McCormick arrived at the Delly, and met with Weinstein. The two went to McCormick\u2019s car, and then Weinstein returned to the Delly. A short time later, Weinstein and Broughton left the Delly for Broughton\u2019s auto. As they passed McCormick\u2019s car, Weinstein pointed to it and said \u201cThat\u2019s my man sitting in the brown Dodge over there.\u201d After Broughton took the cocaine from Weinstein, the agents arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>all three defendants. A search incident to Weinstein\u2019s arrest produced another package of cocaine and a marihuana cigarette, and while he and McCormick were being transported to the Portsmouth City Jail, McCormick volunteered the statement that \u201cI know I did wrong. I\u2019m just going to serve my time.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">All three defendants object to the length of the prison sentences imposed by the district court for conspiracy to sell methamphetamine hydrochloride. McCormick and Weinstein received fifteen-year sentences on this count, while Carter was sentenced to nine years. Their objection is well taken. The statutory maximum for a non-narcotic Schedule II drug, which includes methamphetamine hydrochloride, is five years, plus a fine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1), 846; 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1308.12(d). Their sentences on this account are vacated and the case remanded to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Weinstein contests only the constitutionality of Congress\u2019 action, in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802, in declaring cocaine to be a narcotic drug, in light of evidence that pharmacologically cocaine is a stimulant. We are of opinion this assertion is without merit. E. g., <em>United States v. Harper, </em>530 F.2d 828 (9th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">McCormick\u2019s principal assignment of error is that the trial court erroneously admitted declarations by his co-conspirators, made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy, because there was no independent evidence of his role in the conspiracy. McCormick is correct in stating that there must be independent evidence of his participation in and the conspiracy itself to permit admission into evidence against him of declarations made by co-conspirators. E. g., <em>United States v. Stroupe, </em>538 F.2d 1063 (4th Cir. 1976). Without independent evidence, the conspiracy exception of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) is not applicable. See <em>Joyner v. United States, </em>547 F.2d 1199, 1203 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">There is, however, adequate independent evidence of McCormick\u2019s role in the conspiracy. As earlier related, at the time of the first drug transaction agent Burroughs observed Weinstein leave the pool hall and enter an automobile driven by McCormick. He further observed the two drive to a nearby shopping center, spend approximately ten minutes during which McCormick watched Weinstein \u201chandling something,\u201d and then return to the pool hall. The drugs in the second transaction came through the normal entrance to McCormick\u2019s abode. During the final transaction, Burroughs observed Weinstein again meet with McCormick and go to McCormick\u2019s car immediately before the exchange with Broughton. This direct evidence, contemporaneous with the drug transactions, suffices to establish the requisite independent evidence, and the declarations of McCormick\u2019s co-conspirators were thus admissible against him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">McCormick further complains that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of statements by co-conspirators to prove the substantive offenses of aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine and methamphetamine hydrochloride. This contention is without merit. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>542 F.2d 186, 202, n. 31 (4th Cir. 1976). We have considered McCormick\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>maining assignments of error and conclude that they also are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Carter\u2019s assignments of error relate to the admissibility of co-conspirator\u2019s statements, and the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and aiding and abetting their distribution. As with McCormick, we consider whether the government provided the requisite independent evidence of Carter\u2019s role in the conspiracy and hold that it did. Agent Broughton testified that Carter made telephone calls at Weinstein\u2019s direction during the initial attempts to contact \u201cJim.\u201d Broughton, on request, also paid Carter $20 at the time of the second transaction for Carter\u2019s \u201ctime in setting up the deal.\u201d Finally, Carter continually encouraged Broughton during the less certain aspects of the transactions by assuring him that all was well, that business had been done that way for years, and the dope would be good. This evidence not only established Carter\u2019s role in the conspiracy, but, together with the remainder of the evidence, permitted the district court to find him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of both the conspiracy and substantive offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We thus affirm the convictions of all appellants, vacating and remanding for re-sentencing only, as previously stated, the sentences for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine hydrochloride in cases Nos. 77-1334, 1335, and 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">. The shortest and easiest access to 2115 Cunningham was through the foyer of 2113 Cunningham. The two buildings were part of the same apartment complex, and McCormick lived in 2115 with his girl friend, Jane Majew-ski. The automobile driven by McCormick during the July 14 transaction was a rental car leased to a \u201cJ. McCormick,\u201d payment for which was guaranteed by a credit card belonging to Jane Majewski. In addition, when McCormick was arrested, he was driving an automobile registered to Jane Majewski of 2115 Cunningham Drive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-12\">.

Weinstein referred to the amphetamine as \u201cspeed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">. McCormick\u2019s statement was clearly admissible. He made the statement after he had been apprised of his rights and during a conversation between agent Burroughs and defendant Weinstein. The government agent did not solicit McCormick\u2019s statement. Accordingly, McCormick\u2019s objection to the admissibility of his statement is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\">. A district court may, in its discretion, admit the statements of co-conspirators prior to proof of the conspiracy, \u201csince the judge may, in his discretion, permit the introduction of evidence as to things said and done by an alleged co-conspirator subject to being connected up and followed by evidence of the existence of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Vaught, </em>485 F.2d 320, 323 (4th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
