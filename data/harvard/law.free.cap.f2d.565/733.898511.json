With exceptions not pertinent here,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> both applications had as their goal the same direct operating authority, but each took a different procedural course. The Commission granted one of the applications, which sought what is known as \u201cletter-notice\u201d authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>type of authority is available merely upon a showing that the \u201cmost direct highway distance between the points to be served is not less than 80 percent of the highway distance between such points over the carrier\u2019s authorized routing through the gateway.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The other application was made on a form designated OP-OR-9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s rules contemplate that OP-OR-9 filings will be made only for gateway eliminations on routes that do not qualify under the 80-percent rule,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that they are to be put to the more rigorous <em>Childress </em>test.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And while the rules recite that the Commission reserves \u201cthe right to require that a carrier terminate operations\u201d under its letter-notice authority if it is later discovered that the superseded operations through the gateway did not in fact meet the 80-percent rule,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Commission implicitly recognizes that applications satisfying the <em>Childress </em>standard do not stand in similar jeopardy, as they in no way depend on compliance with the 80-percent rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finding that petitioner\u2019s OP-OR-9 application fell short of <em>Childress\u2019 </em>prerequisites,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Commission took the position that letter-notice authority, with the drawback mentioned, was all that petitioner deserved, and denied the OP-OR-9 application in its entirety.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-17\">Petitioner does not contest the Commission\u2019s conclusion that its OP-OR-9 application did not survive <em>Childress\u2019 </em>demands. It does claim that the Commission had earlier granted OP-OR-9 applications that demonstrated no more than compliance with the 80-percent rule,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and asserts that such treatment is inconsistent with that which it received. This position presupposes that while the Commission regards authority predicated solely on such a showing as susceptible to \u201ccollateral attack\u201d if obtained by letter-notice,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the agency deems it impregnable if obtained by OP-OR-9 application. That view would seem quite arbitrary, and absent demonstration we would be unwilling to attribute to the Commission so peculiar an exaltation of form over substance. As very shortly it will develop, however, the Commission\u2019s view on the relative vulnerability of its grants of operating authority hardly leaves room for the distinction that petitioner en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>deavors to draw.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject petitioner\u2019s first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Petitioner further argues that insofar as its letter-notice authority is prey to revocation if the Commission later finds that its prior operations through gateways violated the 80-percent rule,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it does attain the stature of authority conferred by a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Petitioner urges that the authority which it secured in its gateway elimination proceeding ought to rise to that stature. Commission counsel represents to us that letter-notice authority is commensurate with authority granted by a certificate of public convenience and necessity, but takes the position that noncompliance with the 80-percent rule is a debility of the sort that would support revocation of a certificate as well as a letter-notice.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the Commission has heretofore made no other distinction between the two kinds of operating rights,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> this definitional jousting boils down to the question whether the Commission really has power to revoke letter-notice authority \u2014 as by regulation it purports to reserve<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u2014upon a later finding that the operations through the gateway violated the 80-per-cent rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">For obvious reasons, petitioner declines to force this issue by alleging that any of its letter-notice authority has actually run afoul of the 80-percent rule, and the Commission has evinced no intent to require termination of any of petitioner\u2019s operations on that ground. Nor does it appear that uncertainty over the permanence of petitioner\u2019s letter-notice authority presently casts any pall over its day-to-day operations. All that we can fairly say is that at the moment petitioner\u2019s letter-notice authority stands in no more jeopardy than any other authority predicated exclusively upon satisfaction of the 80-percent rule. Thus the validity and legal effect of the Commission\u2019s reservation of a purported right to revoke<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> are questions not properly before us at this juncture, and it will be time enough to address them if and when the Commission undertakes to invoke that power. As no showing is made that petitioner has, at least as yet, received any disparate treatment, the Commission\u2019s order under review is</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">. Until 1974, motor carriers could combine two certificates of public convenience and necessity that shared a common terminus in order to provide through service between the non-common points via the common terminus, which is known as a \u201cgateway.\u201d In <em>Motor Common Carriers of Property, Routes and Service, </em>116 M.C.C. 530 (1974), the Commission promulgated rules, now codified as 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1065 (1975), forbidding \u201ctacking\u201d of certificates save in limited circumstances. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1065.1(b) (1975). When tacking was thus prohibited, such through service as had theretofore been provided by tacking could be continued only by qualifying for \u201cgateway elimination\u201d authority, which would, as the name implies, relieve the carrier of the necessity of moving through the gateway and thereby allow it to travel the more direct route.
