Counsel for Pincione objected generally, stating: \u201cI incorporate all the objections made by other defense counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">On the separate appeal of Maselli, this court held that the foregoing charge, to which a timely objection was made, was reversible error and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>United States v. Maselli, </em>534 F.2d 1197 (6th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">In <em>Maselli, </em>we recognized that the above-quoted charge was not plain error, and that reversal would not be required in the absence of a timely objection. This holding was reiterated in <em>United States v. LaRiche, </em>549 F.2d 1088, 1093 (6th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 987, 97 S.Ct. 1687, 52 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">The Government contends that the general objection made by counsel for appellant in the present case is not sufficient to meet the requirements of <em>Maselli. </em>We disagree. <em>Freije v. United States, </em>386 F.2d 408, 411 (1st Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 859, 90 S.Ct. 129, 24 L.Ed.2d 111 (1969); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lefkowitz, </em>284 F.2d 310, 312-13 (2d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"AhQm\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
