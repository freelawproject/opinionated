Burke, <em>Judge, </em>denying without hearings appellant Edward W. Newfield\u2019s \u201cnext friend\u201d and <em>pro se </em>motions made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to vacate his bank robbery conviction on the ground that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial. Appellant Newfield also contends that the district court erred in failing to order <em>sua </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>sponte, </em>as provided for in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a psychiatric examination at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Edward W. Newfield was indicted on June 16, 1972, for the December 1, 1971, robbery of $9,606.00 from the Security Trust Company of Rochester, New York. After a five-day jury trial, on May 28,1974, he was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). On June 8, 1974, Newfield was sentenced to five years imprisonment, the sentence to run concurrently with a sentence for bank robbery that Newfield was serving after his parole had been revoked. Prior to sentencing, two psychiatric evaluations were submitted to the trial court. One of the evaluations, by Edward Kaufman, M.D., dated October 17,1973, reported that Newfield\u2019s \u201cpresent anxiety, impairment of associative thought processes and paranoid thinking support a diagnosis of chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia.\u201d He also characterized Newfield as suffering from \u201csevere mental illness.\u201d The other evaluation, by Morris Herman, M.D., dated September 13,1973, reported that Newfield had \u201cimportant personality deficits\u201d but it was \u201cnot clear that these deficits reached the intensity to be considered a psychosis.\u201d He concluded: \u201cI cannot find sufficient symptoms at this time to diagnose schizophrenia but I can say that his personality and character structure are that [sic] of a schizoid person.\u201d Both evaluations were addressed to, and submitted by, Newfield\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">On January 14, 1976, a \u201cnext friend\u201d \u00a7 2255 motion was filed on Newfield\u2019s behalf alleging that Newfield was incompetent at the time of trial and that the bank robbery conviction and sentence should be set aside and vacated. Judge Burke denied the motion without a hearing on the ground that \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief.\u201d Nine days after this denial, Newfield filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, again alleging legal incompetence at the time of trial and asking that the judgment and sentence be set aside and vacated. This motion was accompanied by Dr. Kaufman\u2019s 1973 evaluation as well as an evaluation authored by Dr. Kaufman in 1966 entitled \u201cReport of Psychiatric Board of Examiners.\u201d The 1966 report was prepared by three professionals to support a \u00a7 2255 motion on Newfield\u2019s behalf to vacate a guilty plea to a prior bank robbery. This report stated that Newfield was a \u201crelatively disturbed individual who made some attempt to appear sicker than he actually is by exaggeration of symptoms.\u201d The report also noted that Newfield had been addicted to heroin for 20 years, had a history of hospitalization and psychiatric care, exhibited some \u201canxiety and depression\u201d and viewed the world in a \u201cparanoid manner.\u201d The report diagnosed him as having \u201cschizophrenic reaction, chronic undifferentiated type with some sociopathic trends,\u201d but concluded that he was \u201ccompetent at the time of his crime and at the time of his trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Newfield\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion did not include the evaluation submitted by Dr. Herman. This motion was also denied by Judge Burke without a hearing, again on the ground that \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief.\u201d Newfield appeals both denials,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claiming again that he was incompetent by reason of mental disorder to stand trial. He also claims that, given the facts available at trial, the district court erred in not ordering <em>sua sponte </em>an inquiry into his competency to stand trial as provided for in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">I. <em>The \u00a7 4244 Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Whenever a trial court has \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that a defendant is \u201cpresently insane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense,\u201d a psychiatric examination must be ordered. If the examination indicates that the accused may be insane or incompetent, a hearing must be ordered. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244. This Court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">No part of a criminal proceeding may be proceeded with against a defendant who is at the time \u201cinsane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense <em>tt</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\"><em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>406 F.2d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 1969); <em>see United States v. Marshall, </em>458 F.2d 446, 449 (2d Cir. 1972). The test under the statute is stated in <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">[T]he \u201ctest must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Whether \u201creasonable cause\u201d exists under particular circumstances is a question left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>523 F.2d 665, 667 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>see United States v. Vowteras, </em>500 F.2d 1210, 1212 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1069, 95 S.Ct. 656, 42 L.Ed.2d 665 (1974); <em>United States v. Marshall, supra, </em>458 F.2d at 450; <em>Zovluck v. United States, </em>448 F.2d 339, 342 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. <em>denied, </em>405 U.S. 1043, 92 S.Ct. 1327, 31 L.Ed.2d 585 (1972). The court may consider a defendant\u2019s history of psychiatric treatment in making such a decision, but awareness of such a history does not automatically require a finding of incompetency. \u201cIt does not follow that because a person is mentally ill he is not competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>297 F.Supp. 596, 597 (S.D.N.Y.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Here, the psychiatric evaluations by Dr. Kaufman and Dr. Herman were in the possession of Newfield\u2019s trial counsel well before the trial began, yet counsel made no suggestion that competence was a factor in the case. Even had the evaluations been made available to the trial court during the trial, their conclusions were inconsistent as to the severity of Newfield\u2019s psychiatric problems and were intended to aid not in the determination of Newfield\u2019s competence to stand trial but in the determination of an appropriate sentence in the event of a conviction. His competence to stand trial was apparently assumed by both the examiners and counsel. There is no indication in the record that Newfield was unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his defense. In addition, Judge Burke had five days of trial proceedings during which he observed Newfield\u2019s behavior, giving him ample opportunity to evaluate Newfield\u2019s competence. <em>See United States v. Hall, supra, </em>523 F.2d at 668; <em>United States v. Vowteras, supra, </em>500 F.2d at 1212; <em>United States v. Sullivan, supra, </em>406 F.2d at 185; <em>United States v. Adams, supra, </em>297 F.Supp. at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">There did not exist a trial evidence that Newfield was unable to understand the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ceedings against him or properly to assist in his defense sufficient to require Judge Burke <em>sua sponte </em>to order a \u00a7 4244 examination or hearing into Newfield\u2019s competence. Similarly, there was no \u201cflurry of warning flags\u201d at the time of sentencing sufficient to alert Judge Burke to the need for a \u00a7 4244 inquiry into Newfield\u2019s competence. <em>See Saddler v. United States, </em>531 F.2d 83, 87 (2d Cir. 1976). Accordingly, we affirm with regard to the \u00a7 4244 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">II. <em>The \u00a7 2255 Claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Section 2255 provides a statutory remedy with which prisoners in federal custody may attack their sentence as being in violation of the Constitution or the various laws of the United States. Such a collateral challenge under \u00a7 2255 may result in the trial court setting aside, vacating or altering the sentence or granting a new trial. The statute provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Appellant Newfield moved, pursuant to \u00a7 2255, to have his sentence vacated or altered, based upon the claim that he had been legally incompetent to stand trial. This motion is properly brought for the first time in a collateral proceeding, for it would be \u201ccontradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet knowingly or intelligently \u2018waive\u2019 his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial.\u201d <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 384, 86 S.Ct. 836, 841, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). However, the motion does not entitle petitioner automatically to a hearing. \u201c[T]his court takes a dim view of any summary rejection of a petition for postconviction relief when supported by a <em>\u2018sufficient </em>affidavit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dalli v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 758, 760 (2d Cir. 1974) (emphasis in original), <em>quoting, Taylor v. United States, </em>487 F.2d 307, 308 (2d Cir. 1973). Apart from such circumstances, however, the matter is left to judicial discretion. <em>See Dalli v. United States, supra; Mirra v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 782 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 1022, 88 S.Ct. 593, 19 L.Ed.2d 667 (1967); <em>Accardi v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 312, 313 (2d Cir. 1967). \u201cThe language of [\u00a7 2255] does not strip the district courts of all discretion to exercise their common sense.\u201d <em>Machibroda v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 495, 82 S.Ct. 510, 514, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">In <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>437 F.2d 1255 (2d Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 874, 93 S.Ct. 207, 34 L.Ed.2d 126 (1972), this Court considered the circumstances under which a district court would be required to hold an evidentiary hearing in response to a claim of mental incompetency raised pursuant to \u00a7 2255. We held that, \u201cwhere no evidentiary facts are alleged to support a bald allegation of mental incompetence, a hearing may not be required. ... On the other hand, where the movant has raised detailed and controverted issues of fact, a hearing will be required.\u201d 437 F.2d at 1258 (citations omitted); see <em>O\u2019Neil v. United States, </em>486 F.2d 1034 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Falu, </em>421 F.2d 687 (2d Cir. 1969). Subsequently, in <em>Dalli v. United States, supra, </em>this Court noted that \u00a7 2255 requires a hearing unless the motion, files and records \u201cconclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief,\u201d but determined that the petitioner must be responsible for setting forth specific facts which he or she is in a position to establish by competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 760; <em>see Zovluck v. United States, supra, </em>448 F.2d at 341. More recently, in <em>Wojtowicz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 F.2d 786 (2d Cir. 1977), this Court reaffirmed the requirement of a hearing when a \u00a7 2255 motion presents \u201cdetailed and controverted issues of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790. The Court also determined that \u201c[t]he apparent regularity of the proceedings cannot \u2018conclusively show\u2019 that appellant\u2019s claim, which is based on facts outside the record,. is without merit.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Miranda, supra, </em>437 F.2d at 1257-58; <em>United States v. Malcolm, </em>432 F.2d 809, 813 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>While we affirm Judge Burke\u2019s conclusions that the \u201cfiles and records of the case conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief,\u201d we urge the district courts to include in their orders denying \u00a7 2255 motions more than a conclusion which merely recites the wording of the statute. A memorandum setting forth the reasons for denying a \u00a7 2255 motion and not holding a hearing would aid this Court in its deliberation, and would inform petitioners more fully as to the nature of the disposition of their claims and assist them in determining whether, and on what grounds, to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Nevertheless, where, as here, the \u00a7 2255 motion is supported solely by documents long in the possession of the appellant or the trial court, where there is no assertion whatsoever of new information,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> let alone no setting forth of \u201cdetailed and controverted issues of fact,\u201d and where the trial court had ample opportunity to observe the appellant\u2019s demeanor and behavior in the courtroom, we cannot agree that the trial court abused its discretion by denying without a hearing two \u00a7 2255 motions based upon substantially the same claim. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963); <em>Mirra v. United States, supra, </em>379 F.2d at 787; <em>Yanni v. United States, </em>420 F.Supp. 990, 992 (S.D.N.Y.1976); <em>Palmieri v. United States, </em>286 F.Supp. 520, 522 (S.D.N.Y.1968). Given the rather sparse nature of appellant New-field\u2019s assertions and supportive information, a \u00a7 2255 hearing is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-14\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">A motion for such relief may be made at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-23\">Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-24\">An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Whenever after arrest and prior to the imposition of sentence or prior to the expiration of any period of probation the United States Attorney has reasonable cause to believe that a person charged with an offense against the United States may be presently insane or otherwise so mentally incompetent as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense, he shall file a motion for a judicial determination of such mental competency of the accused, setting forth the ground for such belief with the trial court in which proceedings are pending. Upon such a motion or upon a similar motion in behalf of the accused, or upon its own motion, the court shall cause the accused, whether or not previously admitted to bail, to be examined as to his mental condition by at least one qualified psychiatrist, who shall report to the court. For the purpose of the examination the court may order the accused committed for such reasonable period as the court may determine to a suitable hospital or other facility to be designated by the court. If the report of the psychiatrist indicates a state of present insanity or such mental incompetency in the accused, the court shall hold a hearing, upon due notice, at which evidence as to the mental condition of the accused may be submitted, including that of the reporting psychiatrist, and make a finding with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-11\">. The government alleges that Newfield\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal to this Court was untimely filed, and that this Court must therefore dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

While it is true that the second petition by appellant Newfield pursuant to \u00a7 2255 included for the first time the evaluation written by Dr. Kaufman in 1966, we do not believe that such an evaluation, both out of date and equivocal, provides us with the required \u201cdetailed and controverted issues of fact\u201d \u2014 particularly in light of the prior submission of the more recent evaluations authored by Dr. Kaufman and Dr. Herman.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
