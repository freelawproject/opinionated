He was sentenced to serve three years in the state prison. On June 22, 1955 the governor and cabinet of Florida pursuant to their authority under the state constitution granted Matassini \u201ca full and complete pardon of the above offense, thereby restoring to him full and complete civil rights.\u201d Twenty-one years later, on May 12, 1976, Matassini was- indicted by a federal grand jury for receipt, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for possession, 18 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of a firearm by a convicted felon. Defendant-appellee Robert E. Rodriguez was charged in the same indictment with aiding and abetting Matassini in the receipt offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2(a) and 922(h). In his pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment and now on appeal, Matassini contends that his \u201cfull and complete pardon\u201d established an absolute defense to the offenses charged. The government does not dispute that the pardon was granted but contends that the pardon is insufficient as a matter of law to remove Matassini from the proscription of \u00a7\u00a7 922(h)(1) and 1202(a)(1). In particular, the government argues that the pardon does not remove Matassini from the class of convicted felons reached by these provisions, that the exclusive avenues of relief from those proscriptions are those provided by the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 925(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>1203(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that Matassini fails to come within the purview of those exemptions. In an order dated August 18,1976, the District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, dismissed the indictment as to both defendants. The government appeals, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment and hold that \u201cfull and complete\u201d Florida pardons granted prior to the enactment of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 exempt recipients from criminal liability under \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 1202(a). As defendant Rodriguez is charged only with aiding and abetting, the dismissal as to Matassini necessarily disposes of the indictment as to Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">It is necessary initially to unravel, at least in part, the web of statutory prohibitions and exemptions regulating the receipt and possession of firearms. The provisions under which Matassini was indicted were enacted as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 197 (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cOmnibus Act\u201d), as amended by the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213. The Omnibus Act, hurriedly considered and passed by Congress in the wake of the tragic assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, contained two titles addressing the problem of control of firearms. Title IV, entitled \u201cState Firearms Control Assistance,\u201d primarily concerned federal licensure of \u201cpersons engaging in the businesses of importing, manufacturing, or dealing\u201d in firearms and was the subject of consideration by a Senate committee. Section 922, comprising a lengthy set of regulations governing activity by importers, manufacturers, and dealers, is found in this title. Title VII, entitled \u201cUnlawful Possession or Receipt of Firearms,\u201d was added as a floor amendment and enacted without committee consideration. Its operative provision, \u00a7 1202, was specifically addressed to the receipt, possession, or transportation in commerce of firearms by persons deemed to present special dangers to public safety. Both \u00a7 922 and \u00a7 1202 contain language proscribing the receipt of firearms by convicted felons; \u00a7 1202 reaches possession as well. Title VII contains a provision, \u00a7 1203(2), exempting convicted felons who have received pardons meeting specified conditions from criminal liability under \u00a7 1202. Title IV contains no parallel provision respecting pardons, but does provide for administrative relief from certain disabilities in \u00a7 925(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">Defendant Matassini has abandoned any claim that the application of \u00a7\u00a7 922 and 1202 to him raises issues of constitutional dimension. The issue before us, then, is one of statutory construction; we must decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>whether these provisions of the Omnibus Act are properly construed to proscribe the receipt or possession of a firearm by a convicted felon who had received a full and complete pardon under state law prior to the enactment of the Omnibus Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">We begin with an analysis of Title VII, for it is in this title that Congress spoke most directly to the effect of a state pardon on criminal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">The proscription of \u00a7 1202(a)(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> extends to \u201c[a]ny person who . . . has been convicted by a court of the United States or of a State or any political subdivision thereof of a felony . . .\u201d The statute defines \u201cfelony\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-12\">any offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, but does not include any offense (other than one involving a firearm or explosive) classified as a misdemeanor under the laws of a State and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>\u00a7 1202(c)(2). The statute also contains an explicit exemption, in \u00a7 1203(2), from the operation of \u00a7 1202(a) for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aos-dedup-1\">any person who has been pardoned by . the chief executive of a State and has expressly been authorized . to receive, possess, or transport in commerce a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">The statute does not provide us with a glossary to determine when a particular pardon \u201cexpressly\u201d authorizes the receipt, possession, or transport of a firearm. With respect to pardons granted after the enactment of the Omnibus Act and in contemplation of its terms, such a glossary would not seem necessary; state pardoning authorities may simply adopt the language of the federal provision more or less <em>in haec verba. </em>But with respect to pardons granted prior to the enactment of the Omnibus Act, the meaning of express authorization is considerably more problematic. Our examination of the statutory language and legislative history<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of Title VII does not suggest any determinative congressional intent or provide any universal resolution as to the effect of pre-enactment pardons. Accordingly, our analysis and conclusions focus rather closely on the terms and legal setting of Matassini\u2019s 1955 pardon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">At the time of Matassini\u2019s pardon, Title VII had not been enacted and no provision of federal law addressed the effect of a state pardon on the lawfulness of receipt or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>possession of firearms. Obviously, no federally-approved \u201cexpress terms\u201d were available to the Florida pardoning authorities for inclusion in Matassini\u2019s pardon. But as we shall discuss, the state pardon granted to Matassini did contemplate the removal of virtually all collateral disabilities flowing from Matassini\u2019s 1950 conviction. In particular, the pardon both contemplated and had the effect, under state law, of restoring to Matassini the right to receive and possess firearms. We must determine whether this pardon is sufficiently \u201cexpress\u201d to bring Matassini within the \u00a7 1203(2) exemption. We do so in light of the effect that the pardon was intended to have under Florida law, the language and legislative history of Title VII, and the applicable canons of statutory construction. We come to the following conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-4\">(1) That Matassini\u2019s Florida pardon was premised on an assessment of Matassini as an individual and was intended to restore to him full and complete civil rights, specifically including the right to receive and possess a firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-5\">(2) That Congress, in requiring express authorization for convicted felons to receive and possess firearms, intended that pardoning authorities consider the effect on public safety of permitting any given pardonee to receive and possess firearms;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-6\">(3) That where this legislative purpose is satisfied, Congress did not intend the absurd requirement that talismanic words be employed prior to the time those words were specified; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1374-7\">(4) That the 1955 pardon granted to Ma-tassini satisfied the federal legislative purpose, came as close to \u201cexpress authorization\u201d as was reasonably possible under the circumstances, and thus satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 1203(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-9\">The language of \u00a7 1203(2) provides an unmistakable indication of one fact: that Congress believed the federal interests underlying Title VII could and would be adequately safeguarded by actions of state governors. Congress placed trust in governors to determine, in the exercise of their pardoning powers, whether the collateral consequence that a pardonee be permitted to receive and possess a firearm should follow from any given grant of pardon. A central inquiry for us, therefore, is whether Governor Collins and the Florida Pardon Board considered this issue and intended, in granting Matassini his 1955 pardon under Florida law, to permit him to receive and possess a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-11\">We begin by noting that the 1968 Florida Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 8(a) confers power on the governor, with the approval of three members of the cabinet, to \u201cgrant full or conditional pardons\u201d and to \u201crestore civil rights;\u201d <em>compare </em>Art. IV, \u00a7 12 of the 1885 Constitution which conferred similar power on a Pardon Board composed of the governor and four members of the cabinet. The Florida courts have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abf8\">[U]nder a constitutional provision like this, the pardoning power may, in granting a pardon after conviction, impose any condition, limitation, or restriction that is not illegal, immoral, or impossible of performance, and that the acceptance of the pardon binds the person accepting it to all such conditions, limitations, and restrictions contained therein that <em>are </em>legal, moral, and possible of performance. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1374-12\"><em>State v. Horne, </em>52 Fla. 125, 42 So. 388, 392 (1906), <em>reaffirmed and applied in State ex rel. Bailey v. Mayo, </em>65 So.2d 721 (Fla.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-13\">There can be no doubt that the pardoning authorities might have chosen to grant defendant Matassini a conditional pardon in 1955, nor that the \u201cfull and complete pardon\u201d actually granted represented the exercise of the full pardoning power available under Florida law. The effect of such a pardon has been carefully and consistently delineated by the Florida courts over the past century. In an 1872 Advisory Opinion to the Governor, Opinion of Justices, 14 Fla. 318, 319 (1872), the Florida Supreme Court adopted, for state purposes, the expansive language of the United States Supreme Court in the celebrated case of <em>Ex Parte Garland, </em>4 Wall. (71 U.S.) 333, 380, 18 L.Ed. 366 (1867), to the effect that a pardon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxOj\">reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offense, and the guilt of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>fender. When the pardon is full, it remits the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">This language was reaffirmed in <em>Singleton v. State, </em>38 Fla. 297, 21 So. 21 (1896), which went on to declare</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZrZ\">It is settled law that the pardon of an offense not only blots out the crime committed, but removes all disabilities resulting from the conviction . . . [and] \u201cgives to the person in whose favor it is granted a new character, and makes of him a new man.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">21 So. at 22, <em>quoting State v. Baptiste, </em>26 La.Ann. 134. <em>Singleton </em>was recently reaffirmed in <em>In re Advisory Opinion of Governor Civil Rights, </em>306 So.2d 520, 523 (Fla. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\">Despite the scholarly criticism to which this expansive concept of the effect of a pardon had been subjected,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Supreme Court of Florida held firm to its approach in <em>Marsh v. Garwood, </em>65 So.2d 15, 19 (Fla. 1953) (en banc), stating (in dicta) that a pardon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-16\">reaches both the punishment prescribed and the guilt of the offender. . [W]hen granted after [the convict\u2019s] time of imprisonment has expired, it [re]moves all that is left of the consequences of conviction \u2014 his disabilities, and restores him to his customary civil rights, which are generally recognized as the right to hold office, to vote, to render jury service, and to be a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-18\">The <em>Marsh </em>case provided the most recent judicial statement of Florida law at the time Matassini\u2019s pardon was granted. Subsequent development of Florida law, both statutory and judicial, has further reinforced this broad reading of the effect of a pardon.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>With respect to the precise question here at issue, possession of firearms by convicted felons, the Florida Legislature has spoken with considerable specificity. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 790.23(1) proscribes possession of firearms by \u201cany person who has been convicted of a felony.\" Subsection (2) of that provision states explicitly that \u201c[t]his section shall not apply to a person convicted of a felony whose civil rights have been restored.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> What makes Florida\u2019s felon-in-possession statute particularly significant as it applies to the defendant in this case is the fact that the statute dates almost precisely to the time of Matassini\u2019s pardon. The act, in-eluding the original text of subsection (2),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was approved by the governor of Florida on June 2, 1955; 1955 Fla.Laws, c. 29766. Only three weeks later, on June 22, 1955, the governor, with the concurrence of three members of the Florida cabinet, granted Matassini \u201ca full and complete pardon . thereby restoring to him full and complete civil rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-13\">This recitation of Florida statutory and decisional law leads inexorably to several conclusions. At the time Matassini\u2019s pardon was granted and subsequently, the effect of that pardon was to erase, for all purposes under Florida law save possibly occupational qualification and licensing,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>the collateral disabilities flowing from Ma-tassini\u2019s earlier felony conviction. We believe the governor and cabinet of Florida may be presumed to have considered the implications of granting Matassini a full pardon rather than some more limited or conditional degree of forgiveness. In particular, the pardoning authorities might have limited Matassini\u2019s right to possess a firearm. Instead, acting against the background of a legislative determination (in which the governor had personally concurred three weeks previously) that pardoned individuals, unlike other convicted felons, could be permitted to possess firearms, and a recent judicial determination that a pardon removes all that is left of the consequences of conviction, Governor Collins and three members of the cabinet chose to grant \u201ca full and complete pardon.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">The pardoning authorities made specific findings that Matassini was worthy of a full pardon; his certificate of pardon states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asr-dedup-0\">that applicant was granted a parole . ; that several reputable citizens of Hillsborough County recommend a full pardon be granted at this time; and that the Florida Parole Commission states his adjustment on parole has been excellent and that he is entitled thereby to restoration of his civil rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\">Nothing in the record before us suggests that had the governor and cabinet had the opportunity to address in specific terms the national concerns underlying subsequently enacted federal gun control legislation, they would have hesitated to grant Matassini a full and complete pardon.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">We have carefully examined the conditions under which Matassini was pardoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>and returned to normal society as a citizen with all his civil rights restored. Under Florida law, Matassini clearly had the right to possess a firearm. Yet twenty-one years later, Matassini was indicted for receipt and possession of a firearm \u2014 which receipt and possession would have been perfectly legal for most of Matassini\u2019s fellow citizens with full civil rights. With these facts in mind, we now consider whether Matassini is, within the intendment of the Congress, properly regarded as subject to the proscription of \u00a7 1202(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">As we have noted,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> neither the statutory language nor the legislative history of Title VII presents any clear indication of the intent of Congress with respect to the narrow issue before us. Nevertheless, it is our duty to construe the statutory provision and apply it to Matassini. We are guided in this task by the repeated injunctions of the Supreme Court with respect to the construction of criminal statutes. In order to implement the congressional directive that cannons be taken off the street, we must wheel these canons of construction into the judicial chambers. While a criminal statute is \u201cnot to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature,\u201d <em>Barrett v. United States, </em>423 U.S. 212, 218, 96 S.Ct. 498, 502, 46 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), <em>quoting American Fur Co. v. United States, </em>2 Pet. (27 U.S.) 348, 367, 7 L.Ed. 450 (1829), the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed that \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), <em>quoting Rewis v. United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971). <em>See generally Bass, </em>404 U.S. at 347-50, 92 S.Ct. 515.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These principles of lenity have also been applied in recent cases in this circuit.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-11\">In addition to these general principles governing construction of criminal laws, yet another dimension is implicated in this case. We do not believe that Title VII <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>is a retroactive law in the ex post facto sense, <em>United States v. Donofrio, </em>450 F.2d 1054 (5th Cir. 1971), disapproved on other grounds, <em>Bass, supra. </em>However, we are sensitive to the fact that if applied to make Matassini\u2019s 1955 pardon less than \u201cfull and complete,\u201d the federal statute will retrospectively impair the effect of that pardon. The Supreme Court has counselled us that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjW\">a retrospective operation will not be given to a statute which interferes with antecedent rights . ... unless such be \u201cthe unequivocal and inflexible import of the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\"><em>Greene v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 149, 160, 84 S.Ct. 615, 621-22, 11 L.Ed.2d 576 (1964), <em>quoting Union Pac. R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., </em>231 U.S. 190, 199, 34 S.Ct. 101, 102, 58 L.Ed. 179 (1913) [footnote omitted]. This principle has recently been adverted to by this court as well.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">Applying these principles of construction to Title VIPs statutory language, legislative history, and the legislative purpose they evidence, we conclude that Congress did not intend, and did not provide, that a person in Matassini\u2019s position was liable to prosecution for violation of \u00a7 1202(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">We believe it is clear that Congress, in enacting Title VII, intended the proscriptions of \u00a7 1202(a)(1) to reach persons convicted of felonies prior to 1968. We also believe that Congress intended that with respect to convicted felons pardoned after the enactment of the Omnibus Act, only those felons whose pardons contained a clear indication of express authorization would be permitted to receive, possess, or transport in commerce any firearm. Finally, we are prepared to believe that with respect to convicted felons pardoned prior to 1968,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Congress intended to permit receipt or possession of firearms only following a determination that the individual involved did not present a threat to public safety. Congress unmistakably confided power upon state governors to make such a determination. The critical question here is whether Congress also intended to require that pardons granted prior to 1968 include <em>words </em>of express authorization to evidence that such individualized consideration of the pardonee did take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-14\">Throughout this opinion, we have stressed that Matassini\u2019s pardon was granted prior to the enactment of the Omnibus Act in 1968. At the time the pardon was granted, only a crystal ball gazer of the most exquisite sensitivity could have divined that words of express authorization concerning firearms, or the absence of such words, would acquire talismanic significance thirteen, or twenty-one, years later, and retrospectively become necessary to effectuate the intent of the governor to grant a full and complete pardon. The Supreme Court has counselled us that one \u201cis not to be subjected to a penalty unless the words of the statute plainly impose it,\u201d <em>Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, </em>197 U.S. 356, 362, 25 S.Ct. 443, 445, 49 L.Ed. 790 (1905), and that \u201c[W]hen choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.\u201d <em>United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., </em>344 U.S. 218, 221-22, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229, 97 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>260 (1952). As we ourselves have stated, \u201cWhere freedom is at stake, ambiguities and doubts as to statutory application . . must be resolved in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>United States v. Insco, </em>496 F.2d 204, 209 (5th Cir. 1974). Given that the legislative purpose has been substantially satisfied by Matassini\u2019s full and complete Florida pardon and that the statute does not \u201cplainly impose\u201d the requirement of <em>words </em>of <em>express </em>authorization with respect to pre-1968 pardons, we refuse to attribute to Congress the anomalous intent that pardoning authorities acting prior to 1968 foresee the necessitous significance of words of express authorization. While \u00a7 1203(2) may require that authorization to receive, possess, or transport in commerce a firearm be expressed <em>in haec verba, </em>more or less, with respect to state pardons granted subsequent to the effective date of the Omnibus Act, we hold that the full and complete Florida pardon granted to Matassini in 1955 was sufficiently express to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1203(2) and thus to exempt Matassini from the proscriptions of \u00a7 1202(a). Any other result would require of the pardoning authorities a degree of clairvoyance that would out-Merlin Merlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">Having determined that Matassini\u2019s indictment under \u00a7 1202(a) was properly dismissed, we turn now to an examination of the \u00a7 922(h) receipt offense. In order to understand the statutory function contemplated for \u00a7 922(h), it is necessary to recognize that unlike the narrowly focused Title VII, Title IV enacted a rather comprehensive federal regulatory scheme governing interstate and foreign commerce in firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-11\">Examination of the statutory framework established by Title IV<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> makes clear that the title is primarily addressed, as stated by the Senate Committee Report,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amc-dedup-0\">the licensing standards and the issuing of licenses to persons as federally licensed dealers, manufacturers, and importers in firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">Section 922(a) makes it unlawful for any unlicensed person \u201cto engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition . . . .\u201d Section 923 establishes a procedure for federal licensing of importers, manufacturers, and dealers under the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate (\u201cSecretary\u201d; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(18)). Applications for licenses are to be approved by the Secretary if, among other conditions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ary-dedup-0\">the applicant ... is not prohibited from transporting, shipping, or receiving firearms or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce under section 922(g) and (h) of this chapter,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1380-14\">\u00a7 923(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-15\">Section 922(g) makes it unlawful for certain persons \u201cto ship or transport any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d Section 922(h), the provision under which Matassini was indicted, makes it unlawful for certain persons \u201cto receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Among the persons whose activities in interstate commerce are restricted by \u00a7 922(g) and (h) is any person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>(1) who is under indictment for, or who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">Relief from these disabilities is made available through an administrative proceeding under the authority of the Secretary, \u00a7 925(c).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Title IV, unlike Title VII, does not explicitly address the effect of a pardon.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The issue for decision here is whether the defendant\u2019s Florida pardon removes him from the statutory prohibition. We hold that it does. In so holding, we follow the lead established in this circuit by <em>United States v. Dameron, </em>460 F.2d 294 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 882, 93 S.Ct. 168, 34 L.Ed.2d 137 (1972) <em>(\u201cDameron </em>I\u201d); <em>judgment reversed on habeas, </em>488 F.2d 724 (5th Cir. 1974) <em>(\u201cDameron II\u201d). </em>In <em>Dameron I, </em>an appeal from a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) for interstate transportation of a firearm, the appellant argued that he was not guilty of the transporting offense \u201cas he had been pardoned by the Governor of Arkansas [for the underlying felony convictions] before the indictment was returned,\u201d 460 F.2d at 294-95. The court rejected this argument, noting that the pardon was obtained <em>after </em>Dameron had been arrested on the weapons charge, though before he was indicted. The court held that \u201c[t]he subsequent pardon does not . free appellant from the legal consequences of his prior actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295. The court continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1381-11\">The statutory prohibition was triggered by his status as a convicted felon, a status which did not change until the pardon was received. <em>The pardon simply came too late </em>to save appellant from this charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">M<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied). This statement, of course, implies that a timely pardon would exempt its recipient from prosecution under \u00a7 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-13\">One of the government\u2019s contentions is that a convicted felon who has received a state pardon expressly authorizing him to receive and possess firearms, thus satisfying the requirements of \u00a7 1203(2) for exemption from the proscriptions of \u00a7 1202(a), would nevertheless be subject to indictment under \u00a7 922(h). While cognizant \u201cthat Title VII was not carefully molded to complement Title IV,\u201d <em>Bass, supra, </em>404 U.S. at 343-44, 92 S.Ct. at 520, and that conclusions cannot be drawn from one title concerning the correct interpretation of the other, <em>id. </em>at 344, 92 S.Ct. 515<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we refuse to attribute to Congress an intention in Title \u00cdV so thoroughly at war with the express provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>sions of Title VII. Before concluding that Congress intended that a convicted felon must be both pardoned under \u00a7 1203(2) and granted administrative relief under \u00a7 925(c) in order to be protected from prosecution, we must require a far more clear and definite manifestation of that intent than Congress has here provided. <em>See </em>text accompanying notes 16 and 17 <em>supra. </em>In the absence of such clear intent, we believe that a pardon meeting the requirements of \u00a7 1203(2) and therefore precluding indictment for receipt and possession of firearms under \u00a7 1202(a) must also preclude prosecution for identical conduct under \u00a7 922(h).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Any other conclusion would, in our view, be unreasonable if not absurd.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">We are aware that at least one of our sister circuits has reached a different conclusion on the effect of pardons under Title IV in <em>Thrall v. Wolfe, </em>503 F.2d 313 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied </em>420 U.S. 972, 95 S.Ct. 1392, 43 L.Ed.2d 652 (1975). We have carefully considered the reasoning in that case, but continue to believe that our approach in <em>Dameron I, </em>as further elucidated here, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>more consistent with the language, policy and legislative history of Title IV, at least with respect to the receipt offense, \u00a7 922(h), here at issue.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">The <em>Thrall </em>court\u2019s most telling argument, given in response to the contention that Congress intended \u201cthat one holding a state pardon no longer be regarded as convicted within the meaning of \u00a7 922(g) and (h),\u201d 503 F.2d at 316, concerned Title IV\u2019s provision for administrative relief. The court quoted \u00a7 925(c)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and went on to state</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOG\">It is unlikely that Congress intended, in effect, to confer an even broader power on the 50 state governors, free of the standards and limitations placed on the Treasury Secretary. If a state pardon were an alternative to relief under \u00a7 925(c), the exception for crimes involving a firearm would have little vitality. Further, Congress would have to have assumed that a state pardoning authority would always make a satisfactory investigation of the individual\u2019s record and reputation to determine his propensity for future violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\"><em>Id. </em>That, of course, is precisely what this same Congress not only assumed but explicitly provided for in \u00a7 1203(2), in a title specifically and exclusively targeted at the possession and receipt of firearms by those deemed a danger to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-11\">That point apart, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s argument is considerably more persuasive in the <em>Thrall </em>context that it is here. <em>Thrall </em>was not a criminal prosecution, but an action for review of an administrative determination denying Thrall\u2019s application for a license as a dealer and manufacturer of firearms. As we have seen, \u00a7 922(g) and (h) serve a dual function in the framework of Title IV; not only do they prohibit the receipt of firearms by persons deemed to be dangerous to public safety, but they define one of several criteria relevant to the Secretary\u2019s licensing functions under \u00a7 923(d). Thus, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s determination that gubernatorial pardons might be inconsistent with the \u201cstandards and limitations placed upon the Treasury Secretary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 316, may be perfectly correct with respect to the licensing decision at issue in <em>Thrall. </em>But that is not the issue before us.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Where Congress spoke directly to the issue of receipt and possession in Title VII, outside the licensing context, it determined that a proper state pardon would exempt a convicted felon from the operation of the statute, \u00a7 1203(2). <em>See United States v. One Lot of Eighteen Firearms, </em>325 F.Supp. 1326 (D.N.H.1971). Any other reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>would lead to absurd results; a convicted felon who received a state pardon expressly authorizing him to receive and possess a firearm, in full compliance with \u00a7 1203(2), would, under the <em>Thrall </em>rationale if extended to this case, be susceptible to conviction under \u00a7 922(h). We cannot believe that Congress intended so to entrap unwary recipients of state pardons, and, being neither bound nor enthralled by the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Thrall v. Wolfe, </em>decline to apply its lupine logic to the case before us.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">In view of the length of our discussion, we reiterate briefly our principal conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">In considering applications for pardons subsequent to 1968, state pardoning authorities are on notice of the requirements of federal legislation and may so articulate their grants of pardon (consistent with state constitutional and statutory authority) as to make explicit the intended consequences with respect to receipt and possession of firearms.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But this was not true prior to 1968. While \u00a7 1203(2) may require that authorization to receive, possess, or transport in commerce a firearm be stated in explicit and unmistakable terms with respect to state pardons granted subsequent to the effective date of the Omnibus Act, we hold that the full and complete Florida pardon granted to Matassini in 1955 was sufficiently express to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1203(2) and thus to exempt Matassini from the proscriptions of \u00a7 1202(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">We further hold that any defendant, including Matassini, who can bring himself within the requirements of \u00a7 1203(2) is also exempt from liability for the receipt offense under \u00a7 922(h), although not exempt from the administrative procedures established by Title IV for licensing purposes. In so holding, we are being true to what we perceive to be the intent of Congress. We do not question the proposition that it is within the power of Congress, speaking clearly, to create an explicit federal rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>pursuant to the supremacy clause defining the effect to be accorded a state pardon with respect to federal disabilities. We simply do not believe Congress has done so here. Retroactivity and prospectivity are not congressional novelties; had Congress intended that Matassini-type pardons be disregarded, it could have employed clear and definite language to that end. Statutory exclusion of this pardon should require luminous rather than opaque words. We believe the redemptive factors underlying Matassini\u2019s full and complete Florida pardon did have contemporary currency at the time the Omnibus Act was enacted. The wisdom of the Biblical injunction to \u201crepent that your sins may be blotted out\u201d was recognized and given secular effect in Matassini\u2019s Florida pardon: once a felon, not always a felon. Let it be said that we construed the statutes as saying once a pardon, always a pardon \u2014 unless Congress chooses, in clear and definite language, to express a more niggardly concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">Having disposed of both counts of the indictment against defendant Matassini, we return to the aiding and abetting count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 2(a) against defendant Rodriguez.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The test for aiding and abetting was stated by this circuit in <em>Hendrix </em>v. <em>United States, </em>327 F.2d 971, 975 (5th Cir. 1964), <em>quoted </em>in <em>United States v. Blewitt, </em>538 F.2d 1099, 1100-01 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. </em>denied 429 U.S. 1026, 97 S.Ct. 650, 50 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-6\">In order to sustain the conviction of a defendant who has been charged as an aider or abetter, it is necessary that there be evidence showing an offense to have been committed by a principal and that the principal was aided or abetted by the accused, although it is not necessary that the principal be convicted or even that the identity of the principal be established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-8\">Our disposition as to defendant Matassini negates the existence of the offense; thus, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment as to Rodriguez was also correct.

We believe it appropriate to state at the outset that the issue is neither whether Congress has the power to utilize prior state convictions to identify potentially dangerous persons, nor whether Congress can constitutionally attribute to a state pardon an effect with respect to federal disabilities different from that which the state chooses to accord its own pardon. We note that the Supreme Court has never been squarely confronted with the issue of the effect of a state pardon on federal disabilities. In a converse case, <em>Carlesi v. New York, </em>233 U.S. 51, 34 S.Ct. 576, 58 L.Ed. 843 (1914), the Court considered constitutional limitations on a state\u2019s use, for purposes of its habitual offender statute, of an offender\u2019s federal conviction which had been Presidentially pardoned. In that case, the New York appellate courts had determined \u201cthat the [state] statute directed the consideration of the prior conviction despite the pardon,\u201d 233 U.S. at 56, 34 S.Ct. at 577, thus precluding an alternative statutory construction and leaving only the constitutional issue for the Supreme Court. The Court saw the issue before it as \u201ca narrow one,\u201d involving</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATP\">not the determination of the operation and effect of a pardon within the jurisdiction of the sovereignty granting it, but simply requiring] it to be decided how far a pardon granted as to an offense committed against the United States operates, so to speak, ex-traterritorially as a limitation upon the states, excluding them from considering the conviction of a prior and pardoned offense against the United States in a prosecution for a subsequent state offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 57, 34 S.Ct. at 577. The Court was careful to note that if any action taken by a state in considering a prior offense which had been pardoned \u201cwas in any just sense a punishment for such prior crime,\u201d then that act \u201cwould be void because destroying or circumscribing the effect of the pardon granted under the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">Once the issue was thus framed, the <em>Carlesi </em>Court found its solution \u201cfree from difficulty\u201d and simply reaffirmed its decision in <em>McDonald v. Massachusetts, </em>180 U.S. 311, 21 S.Ct. 389, 45 L.Ed. 542 (1901), upholding a state habitual offender law against an ex post facto attack. The <em>McDonald </em>Court had held that the application of a habitual offender law does not impose an additional punishment on crimes for which an offender has already been convicted; rather, \u201c[t]he punishment is for the new crime only, but is the heavier if he is an habitual criminal,\u201d 180 U.S. at 312, 21 S.Ct. at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-14\">Thus, crucial for the Court in <em>Carlesi </em>was the fact that the pardoned conviction was merely a circumstance of aggravation; its use was \u201cnot in any degree a punishment for the prior crime,\u201d 233 U.S. at 57, 34 S.Ct. at 577. The Court\u2019s statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-15\">we must not be understood as in the slightest degree intimating that a pardon would operate to limit the power of the United States in punishing crimes against its authority to provide for taking into consideration past offenses committed by the accused . . . even although for such past offenses there had been a pardon granted _</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-16\">was explicitly limited to consideration of a pardoned offense \u201cas a circumstance of aggravation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 34 S.Ct. at 578. In this respect, the gun control legislation in the case at bar is quite different from a habitual offender provision; here, receipt or possession of a firearm would not constitute a crime but for the existence of a prior conviction. The prior conviction is a substantive element of the crime rather than a circumstance of aggravation. Thus, there is an argument under <em>Carlesi </em>that using a pardoned conviction as a predicate for prosecution would result in impermissible additional punishment for the pardoned offense. A counter-argument might view a restriction on the right to possess firearms as a permissible regulatory measure rather than as an impermissible punishment. In any event, we do not believe that <em>Carlesi </em>is dispositive of the case before us. <em>See generally </em>Note, \u201cPrior Convictions and the Gun Control Act of 1968,\u201d 76 Columbia L.Rev. 326, 339-42 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1372-17\">. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra </em>for a full citation of the statutory provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">. The legislative history of Title VII is, to say the least, rather sparse and ambiguous, and is hardly decisive in divining congressional intent on the narrow issue before us. Indeed, the Supreme Court, in <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), a case considering the interstate nexus required for conviction under \u00a7 1202, noted that the entire Title VII \u201cwas a last minute Senate amendment . . . hastily passed, with little discussion, no hearings, and no report,\u201d 404 U.S. at 344, 92 S.Ct. at 520, and concluded that \u201cthe legislative history of [the] Act hardly speaks with that clarity of purpose which Congress supposedly furnishes courts in order to enable them to enforce its true will,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 346, 92 S.Ct. at 522, <em>quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 483, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Furthermore, the Court observed, \u201cthe various remarks by legislators \u2018are sufficiently ambiguous, insofar as this narrow issue is concerned ... to invite mutually destructive dialectic,\u2019 and not much more,\u201d <em>id., quoting FCC v. Columbia Broadcasting System, </em>311 U.S. 132, 136, 61 S.Ct. 152, 85 L.Ed. 87 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-8\">The complete legislative history of Title VII is reproduced as an Appendix to <em>Stevens v. United States, </em>440 F.2d 144, 152-66 (6th Cir. 1971). Our own review of that history convinces us that the Supreme Court\u2019s observations in <em>Bass </em>are equally applicable to the narrow issue before us, the effect of a pardon granted prior to the effective date of the federal legislation on federally created disabilities. The government contends that the determinative passage is a colloquy between Senator Long, the sponsor of the amendment, and Senator McClellan during the floor debate:</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">Sen. McClellan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-10\">The thought that occurred to me, as the Senator explained it, is that if a man had been in the penitentiary, had been a felon, and had been pardoned, without any condition in his pardon to which the able Senator referred, granting him the right to bear arms, could that man own a shotgun for the purpose of hunting?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-14\">440 F.2d at 163. Senator Long responded in the negative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-15\">As we read this interchange, we cannot be certain that either or both Senators here specifically directed attention to the time at which the pardon was granted. When this issue did arise later in the colloquy, Senator Long stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aes-dedup-0\">there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that, applied purely prospectively to people who are convicted of crimes in the future, the amendment could not be subject to any challenge whatever. It is likely that one might argue that by applying this amendment to people who have been convicted of crimes prior to this date and pardoned by the pardoning authority, their rights might be violated. That is something that can be studied in conference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">440 F.2d at 164. Even here, Senator Long might have been addressing the situation of felons convicted prior to the enactment date but pardoned after that date. <em>See </em>the discussion of <em>Carlesi v. New York </em>at note 5 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-17\">No conference was held on Title VII and we have found no further legislative history bearing directly on this question. We cannot be certain from these passages even of Senator Long\u2019s intention as to how the provision would apply to prior-pardoned felons. As to the intent of other members of Congress, we believe the words of the Supreme Court with respect to another aspect of Title VII are also apposite here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1373-18\">But even if Senator Long\u2019s remarks were crystal clear to us, they were apparently not crystal clear to his congressional colleagues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOS4\"><em>Bass, supra, </em>404 U.S. at 346, 92 S.Ct. at 521.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1375-9\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Williston, \u201cDoes a Pardon Blot Out Guilt?\u201d 28 Harvard L.Rev. 647 (1915).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">. In <em>Fields v. State, </em>85 So.2d 609, 611 (Fla.1956), the court squarely held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-11\">that a felony conviction for which the offender has received a full and unconditional pardon cannot be counted as a prior felony conviction under the provisions of our habitual offender laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-12\">The <em>Fields </em>court, in reaching this conclusion, noted contrary authority to the effect that habitual offender laws \u201care not regarded as imposing any additional penalty for the former conviction, so as to collide with the rule against double jeopardy or ex post facto laws,\u201d but cited <em>Marsh </em>and <em>Singleton </em>in concluding that \u201cto permit proof of a conviction under such circumstances, without regard to a pardon granted the offender therefor, violates the rule of penal law repeatedly expressed in opinions of this Court that a full and unconditional pardon \u2018removes all that is left of consequences of conviction,\u2019 \u201d 85 So.2d at 610. The court was careful to note, however, that its opinion did not preclude the legislature from making pardoned convictions the basis for punishment under habitual offender statutes. Rather, the court stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-13\">that inasmuch as the Legislature did not expressly include pardoned convictions in the Act, it is taken as evidencing an intention on the part of the Legislature of this State that pardoned convictions not be counted as prior \u201clive\u201d felony convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 611. It is worth nothing that the statute construed in <em>Fields </em>defined a convicted felon, using terms virtually identical to those employed in Titles IV and VII of the Federal Omnibus Act, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-20\">[a] person who [has] been convicted within this state of a felony or an attempt to commit a felony, or under the laws of any other state, government, or country, of a crime which, if committed within this state, would be a felony . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-21\">Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 775.09, repealed by Fla.Laws 1971, c. 71-136, \u00a7 6, effective January 1, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-22\">The principle stated in <em>Fields, </em>that a pardoned offense does not constitute a prior \u201clive\u201d conviction, is firmly embedded in Florida\u2019s statutory as well as decisional law. Florida\u2019s current habitual offender provision, enacted after the decision in <em>Fields, </em>explicitly excludes from its operation individuals who have \u201creceived a pardon for any felony or other qualified offense,\u201d Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 775.084. A second statute, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 775.13, which requires persons convicted of a felony to register with the county sheriff upon entering any county in the state, exempts, among others, \u201cany person who [h]as received a full pardon for the offense for which convicted,\u201d \u00a7 775.13(5)(b). Florida\u2019s continuing dedication to the full rehabilitation and restoration to the community of pardoned offenders is most recently manifested by the new Florida Evidence Code, Fla.Laws 1976, c. 76-237, approved June 23, 1976 and effective July 1, 1977, \u00a7 90.610(l)(b) of which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxO9\">Evidence of a prior conviction, which evidence would be otherwise admissible, is inadmissible if the witness has been the subject of a pardon.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">. Section \u00a7 790.23 was examined by the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Nelson v. State, </em>195 So.2d 853 (Fla. 1967). The court analogized the purpose <em>of </em>the statute to that of the Federal Firearms Act (upheld in <em>Cases v. United States, </em>131 F.2d 916 (1st Cir. 1942), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 U.S. 770, 63 S.Ct. 1431, 87 L.Ed. 1718 (1943)), namely, protecting \u201cthe public by preventing the possession of firearms by persons convicted of certain crimes or who are fugitives from justice,\u201d 195 So.2d at 855. The court distinguished an Ohio case, <em>City of Akron v. Williams, </em>172 N.E.2d 28 (Ohio Mun.1960), and specifically noted that the ordinance struck down in the Ohio case \u201cprohibited the possession of pistols by all convicted felons, whether or not civil rights had been restored,\u201d 195 So.2d at 855, thus suggesting that the validity of the Florida statute might be tied to its exemption provision. The Florida court\u2019s penultimate statement precisely delineated the scope of its own holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-5\">The statutory prohibition of possession of a pistol by one convicted of a felony, civil rights not restored, is a reasonable public safeguard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\"><em>Id., </em>at 855-856.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">Subsequent cases, while invalidating as unconstitutionally vague another provision of \u00a7 790.23, have specifically upheld the exemption of persons whose civil rights have been restored as \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d <em>Driver v. Van Cott, </em>257 So.2d 541, 543 (Fla.1971); <em>Crossley v. State, </em>334 So.2d 17, 19 (Fla.1976). The constitutionality of this section has also been upheld by this court in <em>Ransom v. Wainwright, </em>553 F.2d 900 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014U.S. \u2014, 98 S.Ct. 206, 54 L.Ed.2d 145 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">The significance of the required underlying conviction and the reach of the exemption provision have also been examined by the courts. In <em>State v. Davis, </em>203 So.2d 160 (Fla.1967), the Florida Supreme Court stated that the felon-in-possession offense</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-11\">cannot be committed unless the individual charged is an ex-felon. His prior conviction is a substantive element of the crime charged. Its relevancy is not restricted solely to a determination of the extent of sentence to be served as it would be in a true recidivist proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 162. <em>Compare Davis </em>with <em>Carlesi v. New York, </em>discussed at note 5 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-16\">In <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>289 So.2d 16 (Fla. App., 3rd Dist. 1974), the court affirmed a conviction in a case in which defendant\u2019s application for a pardon had been denied and no documentary evidence of a restoration of civil rights was produced. Implicit in the proceedings was the understanding that had a pardon been granted for the underlying offense, the felon-in-possession conviction could not have stood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1376-17\">. This act shall not apply to a person having been convicted of a felony whose civil rights have been restored.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1376-18\">. The Florida courts, like those of other states, at one time recognized licensing of the professions as a limitation on the effect of a pardon. In <em>Page v. Watson, </em>140 Fla. 536, 192 So. 205 (1938), the court held that a pardon granted to a medical doctor was not a complete defense to proceedings filed before the Board of Medical Examiners. The court stressed the action of the Florida Legislature, pursuant to the police power, requiring a showing of \u201chonor and moral character\u201d as a condition to the right to practice medicine in Florida, 192 So. at 208, and quoted language from <em>Hawker </em>v. <em>New York, </em>170 U.S. 189, 18 S.Ct. 573, 42 L.Ed. 1002 (1898),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1376-19\">that such legislation is not to be regarded as a mere imposition of additional penalty, but as prescribing the qualifications for the duties to be discharged and the position to be filled,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1376-20\">192 So. at 210. On petition for rehearing, <em>id. </em>at 211, the court found no evidence of legislative intent \u201cto eliminate entirely the absence of good moral character as a ground for revoking a license to practice medicine\u201d and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>the felonies of which petitioner was convicted involved moral turpitude and affect his character and qualities as a practitioner of medicine, even though his rights of citizenship have been restored by a full pardon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGC\"><em>See State v. Snyder, </em>136 Fla. 875, 187 So. 381 (1939); <em>cf. Henderson v. State, </em>55 Fla. 36, 46 So. 151 (1908). The court explicitly considered these precedents in <em>Fields, supra, </em>and found them not to be controlling in a criminal case \u201cin which the fact of a prior conviction is given an absolute and conclusive effect in determining the sentence to be imposed upon one thus characterized as an \u2018habitual\u2019 offender.\u201d 85 So.2d at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">The Florida Legislature has recently addressed some of these issues. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 112.01 l(l)(b) provides that \u201c[a] person whose civil rights have been restored shall not be disqualified to practice, pursue or engage in any occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which a license, permit, or certificate is required to be issued by the state . solely because of prior conviction for a crime\u201d, unless the crime was \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the specific occupation or employment position for which the license is sought. In a series of recent decisions, the Florida Supreme Court, in its supervisory capacity over admission to the state bar, has held that a full pardon and restoration of civil rights permits a prior felon to be considered for admission to the Florida Bar while a conditional pardon does not. <em>In re Florida Board of Bar Examiners, </em>183 So.2d 688, 690 (Fla.1966); <em>In re Florida Board of Bar Examiners, </em>341 So.2d 503 (Fla.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1377-7\">. We need not be puzzled by the underlying rationale for such a decision; implicit in the lengthy and consistent development of Florida law, in all three branches, is a steadfast belief in the possibility and desirability of rehabilitation of former offenders. The ideal was perhaps best stated in its early judicial formulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-12\">to rehabilitate a former offender, return him to normal life in society and \u201c[make] of him a new man.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1377-13\"><em>Singleton, supra, </em>21 So. at 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1377-14\">. In <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>521 F.2d 1385 (7th Cir. 1975), the Seventh Circuit found that certain national concerns \u201capply equally whether the pardon in question was granted before or after the statute\u2019s enactment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1390, and held that a pre-1968 \u201ccertificate of restoration\u201d which \u201cunderstandably contained] no such express authorization [to possess firearms],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1389, failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1203(2). The <em>Sutton </em>court expressed support for the government\u2019s argument that the certificate of restoration at issue \u201cwas designed to provide only a limited and semi-automatic return of statutorily denied rights of citizenship ... as opposed to a full pardon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1388. Nevertheless, the court purported to treat the certificate as a full pardon. To the extent the <em>Sutton </em>holding would extend to the full and complete Florida pardon here at issue, we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-15\">We have also considered the decision of the district court in <em>United States v. Castellana, </em>433 F.Supp. 1309 (M.D.Fla.1977). Without passing on the merits of that case, we note that it, like other cases relied on by the government, concerned a pardon granted subsequent to the enactment of the Omnibus Act. We do not view such cases as determinative of the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">. <em>See </em>[text at pp. 1300-1301] and note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">.

The <em>Dam-eron II </em>court concluded that it need not reach the constitutional issue; instead, it grounded its decision \u201con the meaning of the words of the statute which we hold do not cover a person whose felony conviction is unconstitutional,\u201d 488 F.2d at 727. \u201cThe statute should explicitly set forth application to unconstitutional convictions, if it is so intended,\u201d <em>id. </em>The same may be said with respect to pre-enactment pardons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1381-15\">. If the strictures against reasoning from Title VII to Title IV were indeed absolute, we would be inclined to affirm the dismissal of the \u00a7 922(h) indictment on another ground, that Matassini was not a convicted felon for purposes of Title IV. In rejecting this argument in the Title VII context, see note 19 <em>supra, </em>we .stressed that by expressly providing for the effect of a state pardon in \u00a7 1203(2), Congress negated the possibility that a state pardon not meeting the requirements of that section could remove a convicted felon from the proscription <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>of \u00a7 1202(a). If that conclusion cannot be carried over to Title IV, which does not explicitly address the effect of a state pardon, a more thorough analysis is required to determine whether Congress intended to include recipients of full and complete state pardons in its definition of convicted felons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">We have no doubt that Congress is free, within constitutional limits, to choose its own indicia of dangerousness in constructing a regulatory scheme. It is not slavishly bound to follow the characterizations adopted by the states. But in Title IV, by identifying those subject to the proscription of \u00a7 922(h)(1) as \u201cany person . . . who has been convicted in any court . . .,\u201d Congress chose to rely, at least in part, on state criminal law. We see no reason, in either the language or legislative history of Title IV, to doubt that Congress adopted the states\u2019 own definitions of conviction, including the effects of a pardon thereon. While</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-5\">we must generally assume, in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary, that Congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-6\"><em>Jerome v.

With respect to Title IV, \u00a7 927 clearly indicates congressional intent that the federal statute be interpreted harmoniously with state law \u201cunless there is a direct and positive conflict . . so that the two cannot be reconciled . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-8\">Our interpretation of the interplay of federal and state law is reinforced by careful examination of <em>Jerome </em>and the Supreme Court cases following it. In <em>Jerome, </em>a criminal case, the Court interpreted \u00a7 2(a) of the Federal Bank Robbery Act, 48 Stat. 783, 50 Stat. 749, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 588(b), as not incorporating state law, first, so as to avoid creating dual state and federal criminal liability for the same act and second, to respect the tradition that administration of criminal justice under the federal system has generally rested with the states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHYa\">where Congress is creating offenses which duplicate or build upon state law, courts should be reluctant to expand the defined offenses beyond the clear requirements of the terms of the statute,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">318 U.S. at 105, 63 S.Ct. at 486. Effectuation of these policies in the context of the case at bar may require, rather than negate, the incorporation of a state\u2019s definition of the effect of a pardon. And this result is hardly foreclosed by decisions of the Supreme Court. <em>Jerome </em>itself recognized that Congress is perfectly capable of making the application of a federal statute dependent on state law. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 63 S.Ct. 483. <em>See also United States v.

A </em>full and complete pardon under Florida law removes virtually all collateral consequences of the pardoned conviction: in addition to being restored to full and complete civil rights, a pardonee need not register as a felon, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 775.13, cannot be prosecuted as a habitual offender, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 775.084, cannot be impeached with evidence of his prior conviction, Fla. Evidence Code \u00a7 90.610(l)(b), and, not least, is entitled to possess a firearm, Fla. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 790.23(1). <em>See </em>notes 9, 10 and 11 <em>supra. </em>Under Florida law, and therefore under federal law for purposes of \u00a7 922(h), Matassini is not a convicted felon. And, since Florida law does provide, in Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 112.011(b), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1382-13\">a person who has had his civil rights restored may be denied a license, permit, or certification to pursue, practice, or engage in an occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business by reason of the prior conviction for a crime if the crime was a felony . . and directly related to the specific occupation, trade, vocation, profession, or business for which the license, permit, or certificate is sought,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-15\">harmonization of Florida with federal law would carry no danger of frustrating the federal licensing scheme at the heart of Title IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-16\">We note the approach of the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Hoctor, </em>487 F.2d 270 (9th Cir. 1973), and <em>United States v. Potts, </em>528 F.2d 883 (9th Cir. 1975) (en banc), overruling <em>Hoctor. </em>In <em>Hoctor, </em>the issue was whether a Washington expungement statute, Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 995.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>240 (1957), removed the defendant from the class of persons subject to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(i), which prohibits convicted felons from transporting or receiving explosives in interstate commerce. The court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-5\">concluded that the defendant was no longer a person who had been convicted of a felony, the reason being that his former \u2018conviction was absolutely erased from his record [and that he] was entitled to the same rights, and held the same status, as any citizen.\u2019 487 F.2d at 271.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\"><em>Potts, supra, </em>528 F.2d at 884. In overruling <em>Hoctor, </em>the <em>Potts </em>court reviewed the Washington statute and the state case law interpreting it, found that \u201cexpunged\u201d convictions could \u201ccount as a conviction in any subsequent prosecution\u201d and could be shown to impeach credibility in subsequent criminal prosecutions (thus effecting only a \u201cpartial erasure\u201d), and concluded \u201ca <em>fortiori </em>\u201d that such a conviction could form the predicate for \u00a7 1202(a)(1) liability. In each of the specific respects considered by the Ninth Circuit, the expungement effected by the Washington statute fell short of the Florida pardon granted to Matassini. Six members of the en banc court, however, joined a concurring opinion viewing the state expunction statute as irrelevant to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-7\">At least one circuit has determined that certain expungement statutes do remove those whose convictions were expunged from the class of persons subject to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1202 and 922, <em>United States v. Fryer, </em>545 F.2d 11 (6th Cir. 1976) (Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(a), 5021(b)), <em>but see United States </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>519 F.2d 794 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>423 U.S. 926, 96 S.Ct. 272, 46 L.Ed.2d 254 (1975); <em>United States v.

We are pleased to note that the government, at oral argument, did not press its position that a state pardon is utterly without effect in the Title IV context. Rather, the able Assistant U. S.

There is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes. Often these words are sufficient in and of themselves to determine the purpose of the legislation. In such cases we have followed their plain meaning. When that meaning has led to absurd or futile results, however, this Court has looked beyond the words to the purpose of the act. Frequently, however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one \u2018plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole\u2019 this Court has followed that purpose, rather than the literal words.

The basic argument in <em>Thrall </em>runs as follows: (1) \u201cThere is nothing inherent in a state pardon which compels the federal government to disregard the pardoned offense.\u201d 503 F.2d at 315. (2) \u201cCongress has the power to accord a state pardon differing effects in differing contexts, depending on its objectives in creating the disqualification. Neither the inherent nature of a pardon nor full faith and credit require that a state pardon automatically relieve federal disabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316. (3) \u201cWe cannot conclude that Congress desired a gubernatorial pardon to have [the] effect\u201d, \u201cthat one holding a state pardon no longer be regarded as convicted within the meaning of \u00a7 922(g) and (h).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">In reaching its third conclusion as to congressional intent, the <em>Thrall </em>court notes that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFMQ\">Where Congress did intend that a state pardon exempt an individual from a portion of the federal gun control laws, it had no difficulty expressing that intention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1384-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 317, referring to \u00a7 1203(2) of Title VII. That court thought</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-9\">that the absence of any comparable provision in Title IV (and the presence there of a provision for limited administrative relief) signifies that Congress did not intend that a state pardon affect the disabilities in that title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"am_-dedup-0\"><em>Id., </em>at 317-18. We have already noted that we do not believe contentions (1) and (2) are at issue in this case. The question presented here is not congressional power but congressional intent. <em>See generally </em>Note, 53 Texas L.Rev. 1332 (1975), for a cogent discussion of the <em>Thrall </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1384-13\">. <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra </em>for a full citation of the statutory provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">. Our holding, that <em>criminal </em>liability for receipt of a firearm under \u00a7 922(h) does not attach to the recipient of a state pardon meeting \u00a7 1203(2) standards, does nothing to impede the Secretary in administering the federal licensing regime established by Title IV. Since the licensing aspects of Title IV are not duplicated in Title VII, our logic does not extend to the conclusion that a \u00a7 1203(2) pardon has any necessary effect with respect to applications for federal licenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">. Our approach also finds support in several reported decisions. In <em>United States v. One Lot of Eighteen Firearms, </em>325 F.Supp. 1326 (D.N.H.1971), a forfeiture action under \u00a7 924(d) of Title IV, the court held \u201c[a] full [state] pardon can only be construed to restore to [defendant] all his rights, including the right to possess firearms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. \u201cTo order forfeiture would be to impose a penalty for the offense which the pardon has effectively eliminated, and the basic purpose of a pardon is to prevent the imposition of penalties subsequent to its granting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSince the pardon has the practical effect of excusing a violation of [Title IV], I am of the opinion that it operates to prevent forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">The Sixth Circuit, in <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>504 F.2d 629 (6th Cir. 1974), <em>aff\u2019d </em>on other grounds, 423 U.S. 212, 96 S.Ct. 498, 46 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), a \u00a7 922(h) case, while noting \u201cthat Section 922(h) contains no exemption for anyone who has been pardoned,\u201d and initially expressing doubt about the applicability of \u00a7 1203 to Title IV, 504 F.2d at 632, went on to a full discussion of the effect of Barrett\u2019s Kentucky pardon under Kentucky law and concluded, \u201c[t]he present case involvefs] a question of Kentucky law relating to pardons, and appellant is bound by Kentucky law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634. The Sixth Circuit determined \u201cthat the pardon in the present case was not a full pardon, but only a partial pardon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In each crucial respect examined by the court, the Kentucky pardon granted to Barrett fell short of the Florida pardon granted to Matassini. In its review of <em>Barrett </em>on the question of the interstate commerce nexus required by \u00a7 922(h), the Supreme Court noted that the pardon issue \u201cis not presented here,\u201d 96 S.Ct. at 500 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1385-12\">. We note, for example, that Florida has adopted Rules of Executive Clemency, September 10, 1975, revised September 14, 1977, which specifically define the effects of various degrees of executive clemency. Under Rule 5A, a full pardon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-13\">unconditionally releases from punishment, forgives guilt and entitles an applicant to all of the rights of citizenship enjoyed by him before his conviction. It freely and unconditionally absolves the offender from all legal consequences of the conviction of an offense under Florida law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-14\">Rule 6, governing the restoration of civil and residence rights short of a full pardon, explicitly provides that the \u201crights restored under this provision shall exclude the right to own, possess, use or transport in commerce a firearm.\u201d Rule 5E, however, provides for a grant of \u201cSpecific Authority to Own, Possess, or Use Firearms,\u201d which \u201crestores to the applicant the right to own, possess or use firearms after the applicant\u2019s civil rights or residence rights have been restored.\u201d Rule 5E also cautions recipients of restoration of civil rights with \u201cspecific authority\u201d of the existence of federal requirements relating to firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">. <em>See United States v.
