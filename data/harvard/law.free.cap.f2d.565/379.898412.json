The Board found that Sumter violated section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1970), by threatening permanently to replace unfair labor practice strikers if they continued to strike rather than return to work and that Sumter violated section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3) and (1) (1970), by refusing to reinstate unfair labor practice striker Pearline Foster. In addition, the Board found a second violation of section 8(a)(3) and (1) in Sumter\u2019s discharge of employee Barbara Ward because of her union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">We find that the Board\u2019s order rests upon substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole and, accordingly, the order must be enforced. <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 489-91, 71 S.Ct. 456, 463-66, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1957). Sumter questions the breadth of the Board\u2019s order which requires Sumter to refrain from \u201cin any other manner interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the Act.\u201d This provision is appropriate and entitled to enforcement, particularly in light of Sumter\u2019s demonstrated hostility to the union and its commission of similar violations of the NLRA in the past. See <em>NLRB v. Florida Steel Corp., </em>544 F.2d 896, 898 (5th Cir. 1977).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-12\">. Sumter has been before this court on charges of NLRA violations on two other occasions. In 1975, we enforced a Board order based on a finding that Sumter had violated section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA by interrogating employee Ward and that it had violated section 8(a)(3) and (1) by discharging Ward and two other employees because of their union activities. <em>NLRB v. Sumter Plywood Corp., </em>509 F.2d 574 (5th Cir. 1975). A year later, we enforced a Board order based on a finding that Sumter had violated section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) and (1) (1970), by refusing to bargain with the union. <em>NLRB v. Sumter Plywood Corp., </em>535 F.2d 917 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
