In light of these unfair labor practices, the NLRB ordered Craw to bargain with the union, which had obtained signatures of a majority of Craw\u2019s employees on their authorization cards prior to the dispute with the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">The questions we must decide are, first, whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the findings of unfair labor practices on the part of the employer and, second, whether the bargaining order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-16\">In the early part of August 1974, seven of Craw\u2019s ten employees signed cards authorizing the union to act as their collective bargaining representative. On August 21, the union representative, Richard L. Steward, Jr., visited the company and asked that it commence negotiations with the union. Vernon E. (Mike) Craw refused to do so, or to look at the authorization cards. After the union\u2019s demand for recognition on August 21, Craw retained counsel and declined to meet further with the union representative. At a meeting of all employees that was called by the company on September 3, Mike Craw delivered some \u2022 prepared remarks and answered questions from the employees. He declared, <em>inter alia, </em>that he could \u201cdrag out\u201d the negotiations for \u201cas many years as possible\u201d until he achieved \u201ca contract which suited him,\u201d and that during this interval there would be no pay raises. In addition, he stated that if the union were successful, \u201cthere would be a lot more layoffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-17\">At a meeting on September 4, attended by eight of Craw\u2019s nine production employees and the union representative, the employees voted to strike.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Five of the production workers subsequently went on strike and picketed the shop. A sixth employee joined the strike after about a week and picketed the shop for about two weeks before returning to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-18\">In the course of the strike, Mike Craw took photographs of the striking employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the second or third day of the strike, Craw spoke with some of the strikers and asserted that they were \u201cdoing Dick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>Steward\u2019s dirty work.\u201d He also commented that, while he did not wish to be quoted on the matter, if Steward had been there and if he himself had a club, he \u201cwould use the club on Dick Steward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">Four replacements for the striking employees were hired by Craw between September 10 and September 25. The company sent letters to the strikers notifying them that they had been permanently replaced and that their health and accident insurance carrier had been informed of the termination of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">The strike ended on October 3, and on the next day the five employees who had remained on strike throughout its duration informed Craw that they were ready to return to work. Only one of them, William Victor Davis, was reinstated; the others were instructed to complete employment applications, and were then informed that they would be recalled only if they were needed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although two of the replacements did not continue to work for Craw after November 1, 1974, and a third had a heart attack on December 31,1974, rendering him substantially unable to work, none of the four strikers was reinstated by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">A Board-ordered election conducted on October 25, 1974, resulted in one vote for the union and five against it. Eight ballots were challenged \u2014 those cast by the four strikers who had not been reinstated and those cast by the four replacements who had been hired in September.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">In an opinion dated October 22, 1975, the Administrative Law Judge determined that Craw\u2019s statement, that if the Union came into the shop there would be layoffs, was not a prediction based on \u201cdemonstrably probable consequences beyond his control\u201d or one \u201cbased on available facts,\u201d but rather constituted \u201ca threat of retaliation based on . coercion . . . .\u201d <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., Inc., </em>395 U.S. 575, 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). It thus violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the NLRA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the ALJ concluded that the threat by Craw to \u201cdrag out\u201d negotiations with the union, and Craw\u2019s comment that during the labor controversy wages would be frozen, violated \u00a7 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">The ALJ further stated that the justifications advanced by Craw for photographing the striking employees \u2014 namely, that the photos would be helpful in the event of violence and would accurately record the date of the picketing \u2014 were specious. Therefore, the photographing was held to violate \u00a7 8(a)(1). Moreover, the ALJ determined that Craw\u2019s threat regarding the infliction of physical harm on the union representative amounted to unlawful coercion of an employee\u2019s rights under the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-15\">Finally, the Administrative Law Judge found that the strike was motivated at least in part by the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices and, consequently, that the strike was an unfair labor practice strike. The ALJ supported this conclusion by noting that the vote for a strike occurred at a meeting on the day after Craw\u2019s anti-union speech and discussion with the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-16\">Since the strikers were participating in an unfair labor practice strike, the ALJ declared that they were entitled to reinstatement upon their unconditional application for reemployment, even if reemployment would require the discharge of their replacements. <em>See, e. g., KPRS Broadcasting Corporation, </em>181 NLRB 535, 536 n.4. By failing to reinstate the strikers after their unconditional application for reinstatement, asserted the ALJ, Craw violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>As remedial measures, it was recommended that the NLRB order the employer to cease and desist from its unfair practices, and to recognize and bargain with the union.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After noting the precipitous drop in the union\u2019s strength during the organizational struggle from seven votes to one, the ALJ wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1342-4\">In the light of the Respondent\u2019s extensive and pervasive unfair labor practices which were calculated to destroy the Union\u2019s majority status, and included the termination of four of the Union\u2019s five staunchest supporters, I am persuaded that the application of traditional remedies cannot eliminate their lingering coercive effects to permit the holding of a fair and reliable rerun election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">The employees\u2019 signed authorization cards were \u201ca more reliable measure\u201d of their desire for union representation than the vote at the Board election, the ALJ concluded, and in these circumstances, a bargaining order was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">In a decision dated December 28, 1976, the NLRB determined that it would \u201caffirm the rulings, findings, and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge and . adopt his recommended order.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APf\">On this appeal, Craw urges that there was no substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Board\u2019s conclusions regarding the charges of unfair labor practices, and that the bargaining order was improper. In response, the NLRB contends that its findings regarding the employers\u2019 unfair labor practices were supported by substantial evidence, and that the bargaining order was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-14\">In resolving the first issue in the case \u2014 whether there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of violations of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014this Court is limited in the scope of its review by the rule of <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The Supreme Court there announced that a court of appeals must take into account the record as a whole, including any evidence detracting from the Board\u2019s view, in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-15\">Moreover, this Court must respect the role of the NLRB as an agency \u201cpresumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We cannot displace the Board\u2019s selection between two conflicting views of the evidence, \u201ceven though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de </em>novo.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-16\">After applying this standard of review and considering the record as a whole, it is our conclusion that the findings of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>Board regarding the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices may not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">The issue regarding the affirmative relief granted by the NLRB \u2014 specifically, the order that the employer bargain with the union \u2014 is more troublesome. As the Board conceded at oral argument, the decision that included the bargaining order did not discuss the particular reasons for this remedy. Instead, the Board merely adopted <em>en toto </em>the ALJ\u2019s \u201crulings, findings, and conclusions\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and did not engage in any independent analysis. Such a format contravenes our directions in <em>NLRB v. Armcor Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239 (3d Cir. 1976), and <em>Hedstrom Co. v. NLRB, </em>558 F.2d 1137, No. 76-1700 (July 5, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">As the Court wrote in <em>Armcor:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-8\">In light of the general and highly desirable practice in industrial relations of selecting bargaining representatives through traditional election processes, a rule requiring the Board to set forth a reasoned analysis justifying a bargaining order under <em>Gissel </em>is salutary. For the reasons set forth hereinafter, we adopt it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">The <em>Armcor </em>rule was said to promote the three aims of insuring informed judicial review of the Board\u2019s bargaining orders, contributing to the \u201cpredictability of this important area of labor law,\u201d and providing a \u201cprophylaxis against arbitrary exercise of the Board\u2019s power.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Armcor </em>concluded that the NLRB \u201cmust make \u2018specific findings\u2019 as to the impact of the unfair labor practices on the election process,\u201d and that it must \u201cclearly explicate the basis for its decision to issue a bargaining order.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYm\">The <em>Armcor </em>Court further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-10\">What we ask of the Board should not be a great burden, nor should our require-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akl-dedup-0\">ment limit the issuance of bargaining orders whenever necessary. Of course, we do not expect the Board to determine the number of employees who abandoned the union because of the employer\u2019s unfair labor practices. Rather the Board should:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-16\">estimate the impact (of the unfair labor practices), taking into account the factors in the particular case which are indicative of actual effect or which plausibly, in the light of existing knowledge, would contribute to or detract from an actual impact . Similarly the \u2018detailed analysis\u2019 of the likelihood of recurring misconduct and of the potential curative effect of ordinary remedies only requires an appraisal of those facts which might reasonably have a bearing, such as whether the employer has a history of anti-union animus and Labor Act violations, whether the employer has taken affirmative rectifying measures or otherwise indicated his cooperativeness in assuring a fair election, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-17\"><em>Peerless of America v. NLRB, </em>484 F.2d 1108, 1118 n.16 (7th Cir. 1973).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayb-dedup-1\">In <em>Hedstrom, </em>a case in which the Board did not accept the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s recommendation, we reaffirmed the <em>Armcor </em>ruling that the Board should make specific findings in support of the bargaining order, and should not, for example, merely characterize the unfair labor practices as \u201cextensive\u201d and \u201cfar-reaching\u201d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The <em>Hedstrom </em>panel also noted that the Board did not properly indicate why customary relief \u2014 for example, a cease and desist order, mailing notices to employees, posting notices at the plant \u2014 would not remedy the unfair labor practices found to exist.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>At oral argument in this case, counsel for the NLRB maintained that the necessity of setting forth discrete reasons, specified in both <em>Armcor </em>and <em>Hedstrom, </em>was diluted in <em>NLRB v. Eagle Material Handling, Inc., </em>558 F.2d 160, Nos. 76-2256 and 77-1186 (June 22, 1977), and that on the basis of <em>Eagle </em>the bargaining order in the circumstances presented here is proper. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">First, it must be recalled that the affirmative relief provided by a bargaining order is not a traditional remedy under federal labor law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is appropriate, as the Supreme Court stressed in <em>Gissel, </em>only in cases in which the unfair labor practices are so \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d that their coercive effects could not be eliminated by customary remedies; or in which \u201cless pervasive\u201d practices \u201cnonetheless still have the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The rationale undergirding the <em>Armcor </em>ruling is that because these effects must exist in order for the bargaining order to be an appropriate remedy, the Board should be required to explain with specificity the results of the unfair labor practices and, in particular, the unlikelihood of a fair election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">The Court in <em>Eagle </em>did not diverge from this basic reasoning. Indeed, in <em>Eagle, </em>the Court noted that the bargaining order had been entered by the Board before <em>Armcor </em>was decided. This fact was said in <em>Eagle </em>to explain \u201cwhy the Board\u2019s findings and analysis are not more complete.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Eagle </em>stressed that the actions of the Board constituted what it considered to be <em>\u201cminimally </em>sufficient compliance with Armcor<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">In addition, the Board\u2019s order in <em>Eagle </em>was not based upon a naked adoption of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s rulings, findings and conclusions. Rather, the Board\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-11\">. <em>detailed </em>the unfair labor practices that it believed had undermined the possibility of \u2018holding a fair election in the near future, even after application of the Board\u2019s traditional remedies therefore.\u2019 (emphasis added)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-12\">No such detail can be found in the Board\u2019s decision in this case. Thus, even if the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Eagle </em>had not depended on the fact that the Board\u2019s order was issued prior to the <em>Armcor </em>decision, <em>Eagle </em>is also distinguishable from the present situation on the ground of a total lack of any independent explanation by the Board for the bargaining order in question. Accordingly, although there is sufficient evidence to support the findings by the Board of unfair labor practices, the application of the National Labor Relations Board for enforcement of the bargaining order against Craw will be denied.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-14\">Accordingly, the findings of unfair labor practices will be affirmed. However, the application of the NLRB for enforcement of its bargaining order against Craw will be denied and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1340-11\">. The respondents in this action are Leroy W. Craw, Jr., Vernon E. (Mike) Craw, and Daniel G. Leonard, who do business under the name Craw &amp; Son, a company engaged in the fabrication, installation and nonretail sale of heating and ventilation systems.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1340-12\">. On the Friday before the planned Monday strike, Mike Craw assembled his employees and told them that they had \u201ca perfect right\u201d to strike and to \u201clapse their health insurance,\u201d and that the company had a right to replace employees who failed to report for work. <em>See </em>Appendix at 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1340-20\">. There was evidence that one of the employees walked away from the camera when his picture was taken, and that Craw followed him, saying \u201cThat\u2019s all right, we can identify you anyway.\u201d Appendix at TO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">. None of the employees had been required to fill out an application for employment when he had been first hired by the company. Moreover, Davis was not asked to complete such an application before he was reinstated. <em>See </em>Appendix at 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">. <em>See </em>Appendix at 13. The ALJ also held that the employer violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) when he told his employees that if the union were successful, the welding and painting work that they performed would have to be done by outside union welders and painters; and that they would likely have to be laid off if there was no other work for them to perform. <em>See </em>Appendix at 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1341-18\">. The ALJ also determined that notifying the striking employees of their permanent replacement was a violation of 8(a)(1). <em>See </em>Appendix at 18. The ALJ went on to say that even if the strike were an economic strike, not an unfair labor practices strike, the employers\u2019 actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>were still violative of the NLRA. The reason for this was that the burden of proving that economic strikers have been permanently replaced at the time they apply for reinstatement falls on the employer, <em>see Trinity Valley Iron and Steel Co., </em>158 NLRB 890, 896 (1966), <em>enforced in relevant part, </em>410 F.2d 1161, 1170-1171 (5th Cir. 1969). The ALJ concluded that the employer failed to carry its burden of proving that the replacements were permanent replacements, for two of them worked for Craw for less than two months and terminated their employment less than one week after the Board election on October 25, 1974. A third worked only until December, 1974, when he suffered a heart attack; he has worked only sporadically for Craw since then. <em>See </em>Appendix at 18-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">.
