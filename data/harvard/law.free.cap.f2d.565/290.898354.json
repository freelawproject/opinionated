Upon consideration of the briefs and oral argument, Judge Butzner and Judge Hall affirm the commission\u2019s order for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Clark in the opinion that he wrote for the original panel of the court. <em>Motor Carriers Traffic Association, Inc. v. United States, </em>559 F.2d 1251, 1254-55 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">Additionally, Judge Butzner and Judge Hall hold that the commission\u2019s order did not violate the carriers\u2019 first amendment rights. The order is a proper exercise of the power that the commerce clause confers on Congress and the commission to prohibit anticompetitive conduct. <em>Cf. California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">WIDENER, Circuit Judge, dissents for the reasons he previously stated. <em>See Motor Carriers Traffic Association v. United States, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 1256-57.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
