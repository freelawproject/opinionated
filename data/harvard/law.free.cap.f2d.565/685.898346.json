Atomic Energy Commission, </em>502 F.2d 1393, 183 USPQ 235 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974) [hereinafter cited as <em>Piper]. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-13\">\n<em>The Invention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">The patent is to be issued upon the application of Westland, serial No. 185,437, filed September 30,1971, entitled \u201cNew Pyridine Compounds and Methods for Their Production.\u201d The application claims certain thia-zolidinyl alkoxy pyridine compounds stated to be useful as antiradiation agents, the disclosed utility being as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-15\">The compounds of the invention are new chemical compounds that are useful as pharmacological agents, especially as antiradiation agents that are active in protecting against the effects of exposure to X-ray or gamma ray radiation. Their activity in this regard can be demonstrated and quantitatively measured in a standard test in experimental animals (mice) that is carried out essentially as described in a number of published reports; see, for example, R. D. Westland, <em>et al, J. Med. Chem., 11, </em>1190 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">The invention was developed in the course of a contract between appellant\u2019s employer and assignee, Parke, Davis &amp; Company, and the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command. The contract contains a patent rights clause, which states that the contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>tor agrees that ERDA shall have the sole and conclusive power to determine the disposition of the title to and the rights under any patent application or patent that may issue on any subject invention made by employees of the contractor which <em>relates to the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy within the purview of the Act. </em>Thus, the issue for resolution on this appeal is whether these antiradiation compounds are \u201cuseful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy\u201d under section 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\n<em>The Board Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The board reviewed the facts of this proceeding and those of <em>Piper </em>and found \u201cno significant difference\u201d between them. Further, the board did not find convincing ERDA\u2019s argument that the proceeding .was distinguishable from <em>Piper </em>in that the latter was decided on a motion for summary judgment whereas this proceeding contained the testimony of various persons providing \u201cexpert opinion evidence.\u201d Finding the facts and issues to be parallel with <em>Piper, </em>the board followed the holding in that case under the doctrine of stare decisis. Accordingly, the board held that ERDA was not entitled to the direction under section 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Both parties acknowledge there is a similarity of facts between <em>Piper </em>and the instant appeal. The threshold issue in this appeal is whether the facts are so similar as to require following our precedent in <em>Piper. </em>In <em>Piper, </em>this court held that certain chemical compounds useful as antiradiation agents were \u201cnot \u2018useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy,\u2019 within the meaning of section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.\u201d <em>Piper, supra </em>at 1398, 183 USPQ at 238-39. Thus, unless there are factual differences between this appeal and <em>Piper, </em>or unless this court concludes it erred in <em>Piper, </em>we will follow our prior decision. Each of the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the factual and legal similarities and differences between the two cases is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">\n<em>I. Piper Was Decided on Motion for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Appellant contends since <em>Piper </em>was decided on a Motion for Summary Judgment, the record before this court contained no evidence on the contract, the subject matter and scientific terms involved, or the legislative intent of section 152. However, the AEC in <em>Piper </em>waived its opportunity for a plenary proceeding and agreed that \u201cit was not necessary for the AEC to introduce any evidence whatsoever to show that the subject contract was for its benefit because all necessary pertinent evidence was already of record and <em>admitted </em>by both sides.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 25, <em>Piper, supra. See also Piper, supra </em>at 1395, 183 USPQ at 237, where this court indicated that the sole unresolved issue involved the \u201csingle question of statutory construction.\u201d Since AEC argued that there was \u201cno issue as to any fact\u201d and, in fact, filed its own motion for summary judgment, it cannot now argue that <em>Piper </em>was decided upon an inadequate record and that it did not have a chance to introduce evidence on the merits of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">\n<em>II. Factual Similarities Between Piper and This Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">The board incorporated a comparison of these cases which was prepared by appellee Westland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The important similar factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>involved in both cases are the same type of claimed invention, the same described usefulness, similar methods of administration, the same procedure for evaluation as radiation protective agents, and the same research sponsor.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">ERDA contends that the instant application expressly states that the antiradiation drugs are useful in protecting against gamma radiation whereas the Piper application did not \u201cprecisely\u201d so state. ERDA argues that if this court had been aware that the Piper application was useful in connection with gamma radiation, it would have reached a different conclusion. This distinction is without merit. The relevant portion of the Piper application indicates that the chemicals involved there would provide protection against X-ray and other harmful radiation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">Thus, for example, in X-ray therapy it is desirable to provide a drug which can be administered to a subject and which will then provide protection against the harmful effects of X-ray radiation. Antiradiation agents may also be useful in providing protection against other sources of harmful radiation such as may be encountered by personnel in the fringe areas of a nuclear explosion or by space travelers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\"><em>Piper, supra </em>at 1394, 183 USPQ at 236. Moreover, the screening procedure used in Piper\u2019s application, evaluated effectiveness by exposure to both X-rays or gamma rays. See <em>id. </em>Furthermore, the AEC in <em>Piper </em>acknowledged that those chemicals were tested by exposure to gamma radiation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since it is clear that the Piper application encompassed a use with gamma radiation and the opinion in <em>Piper </em>specifically recognized this fact, there is no basis for appellant\u2019s contention that this court was misled by the statement of utility in <em>Piper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Since the facts are virtually identical, this appeal, as was <em>Piper, </em>is dependent upon the interpretation of the language of the appropriate statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">\n<em>III. The Doctrine of Stare Decisis and the Piper Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The doctrine of stare decisis basically stated is that where \u201ca court has in one case decided a question of law it will in subsequent cases in which the same question of law arises ordinarily decide it in the same way. The doctrine ... is applicable although the parties in the later action are different from those in the prior actions.\u201d Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 70, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Comment a (1942). A court may overrule a prior decision, in the interest of uniformity, stability, and certainty in the law. The relevant rule of law which it has established will customarily be followed by the court unless it is clearly convinced that the legal rule was originally erroneous or is no longer sound because of changed conditions and that more good than harm would come by departing from the precedent. IB Moore\u2019s Federal Practice H 0.404[1] at 401 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The position of this court on the role of stare decisis is clear and consistent with that of the other appellate courts. A readjudication of issues previously determined demands a clear and convincing showing of error; this requirement is not satisfied by reargument of former issues. <em>John C. Rodgers &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>524 F.2d 1220 (1975), 63 CCPA 10, C.A.D. 1158; <em>United Merchants, Inc. v. United States, </em>468 F.2d 208, 60 CCPA 11, C.A.D. 1073 (1972); <em>R. J. Saunders &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>54 CCPA 29, C.A.D. 898 (1966); <em>United States v. Dodge &amp; Olcott, Inc., </em>47 CCPA 100, C.A.D. 737 (1960). As this court said in <em>Dodge &amp; Olcott, supra </em>at 103:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">It is unfair both to the courts and to the parties litigant that there be a re-adjudication of issues previously determined except upon a clear and convincing showing of error. . . .We are unwilling to find error in a prior decision where, as here, the only reason advanced is that the party asserting the error does not agree with our prior decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In this appeal, appellant argues that this court was wrong (1) in concluding section 152 was an effort to liberalize the patent provisions of the Act; (2) in construing the terms of section 152 in light of other sections of the Act, <em>e. g., </em>sections 153 and 158 and section 11(c) of the 1946 Act; (3) in requiring an essential or fundamental relationship between the invention and the utilization in atomic energy. These are the very same arguments this court previously considered and rejected in the AEC\u2019s Petition for Rehearing <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in <em>Piper.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The opinion of <em>Piper </em>cogently and in detail examined the statute, and appellant is here merely in disagreement with that case\u2019s rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Appellant has submitted in this appeal the testimony of various persons to provide \u201cexpert opinion\u201d testimony. This evidence is intended to establish (1) that the antiradi-ation drugs of this application are related to and/or are useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy within the purview of the Act, (2) that the intent of the contract was to include these materials, and (3) that the intent of the Act was to include compounds such as these in issue. We find nothing in this evidence of which this court was not cognizant in <em>Piper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">ERDA introduced the testimony of former Congressman Holifield (a draftsman of the legislation) to demonstrate that this court\u2019s decision misinterpreted the statute; however, courts have observed that no member of the legislature is empowered to speak with authority for that body. <em>Selman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 F.2d 1354, 1358\u201459, 204 Ct.Cl. 675 (1974); <em>Gardner &amp; North Roofing &amp; Siding Corp. v. Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System, </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 329, 464 F.2d 838, 842 (1972); <em>National School of Aeronautics, Inc. v. United States, </em>142 F.Supp. 933, 938, 135 Ct.Cl. 343 (1956); see <em>United States v. United Mine Workers of America, </em>330 U.S. 258, 281-82, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). Such a policy would appear to be the only sound approach to statutory analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>At first blush it might seem that this would be the ideal way to learn the intent of a legislative body, to get it straight from the mouth of a responsible member of the legislature. Second thought leads to the conclusion that the practice would be intolerable. A legislature speaks through statutes, and, in cases where the statutes require interpretation, through committee reports and debates. No member of a legislature, outside the legislature, is empowered to speak with authority for the body. If he may testify voluntarily, other members of his legislative body with different views or different recollections may be summoned to give their differing versions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><em>National School of Aeronautics, Inc. v. United States, supra </em>at 938, 135 Ct.Cl. at 351. In view of the foregoing, the testimony of Congressman Holifield is of little value in the interpretation of the statute. There appears to be no additional evidence demonstrating that this court was in error on any factual or legal issue in <em>Piper </em>(clearly and convincingly in error, or otherwise).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">It is clear from the record that ERDA had an opportunity during <em>Piper </em>to present all of the arguments respecting the issues here presented. The readjudication of issues tends to create nonuniformity of the law, and affect stability and certainty in the application of the law in question. There has been no clear and convincing showing of error. We accordingly are constrained to follow our previous holding in <em>Piper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Therefore, the decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">RICH, Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The Honorable Morgan Ford of the United States Customs Court sitting by designation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 293(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-10\">. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) filed the original proceeding before the PTO, but its name was changed during the proceeding before the board to the Energy Research and Development Administration.

We also note that the parties, during the proceeding below, recognized the similarity of the facts and issues presented in the two cases. On January 22, 1974, the parties filed a stipulation for an extension of time. The reason for the request was that since the <em>Piper </em>case (then on appeal to this court) \u201cpresents essentially the same facts and issues as the instant case the Court\u2019s [CCPA] decision may be dispositive of the issue raised\u201d in the present proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">.
