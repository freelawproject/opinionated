Headid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>was convicted on all three counts in a joint jury trial with co-defendants Daniel Runge, Delores Gregg and Milo Headid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposed a $5,000 fine on Head-id for each count and sentenced him to three concurrent five-year terms of imprisonment, which are to be suspended upon the service of six months imprisonment in a \u201cjail type or treatment institution.\u201d Upon his release from confinement, he is to be placed upon probation for a period of three years. Headid appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">The following facts underlie Headid\u2019s conviction. On the evening of April 12, 1976, Daniel Runge, David Garritsen and Danvers Jansen stole a Case Uniloader tractor from an equipment dealer in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and transported it to a farm in Minnesota for safekeeping.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They also formulated a plan to return and steal a second tractor from the same dealer. Unable to arrange a deal with the buyer they had originally contemplated, they decided to contact Mahlon Headid. Garritsen, a former employee at Headid\u2019s Sioux City, Iowa, salvage yard, telephoned Headid and asked if he knew anyone who \u201ccould use a couple of loaders.\u201d Garritsen apprised Headid that the tractors involved were stolen. Headid agreed to buy the tractors, and a price was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">On the evening of April 14, 1976, Garrit-sen, Runge and Jansen stole a second tractor in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. They transported this tractor directly to Sioux City, Iowa, where they met Headid and Delores Gregg at a truck stop. Headid and Gregg led them to Headid\u2019s son\u2019s farm near Sergeant Bluff, Iowa. The stolen tractor was unloaded there during the early morning hours of April 15. Headid gave $200 in expense money to Garritsen, Runge and Danvers, who then left to pick up the other tractor which had been stored in Minnesota. They transported this tractor to Sioux City, Iowa, where they once again met Headid at a truck stop and proceeded with him to his son\u2019s farm. The second tractor was unloaded there during the daylight hours of April 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Garritsen then removed the serial number from the first tractor they had delivered. He had already performed the same operation on the tractor that had been stored in Minnesota. At Headid\u2019s direction, the casting numbers were also ground off both tractors. Headid furnished Garritsen with blank bills of sale and with serial number plates off two Wisconsin motors, which were to be used in filling out the bills of sale. Finally, he gave Garritsen an additional $1,800 in cash for the tractors. Following this transaction, Headid made numerous telephone calls to Jansen, Garritsen and Runge to ascertain how they were progressing with the fabrication of phony bills of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">The foregoing facts support the three-count indictment under which Headid was charged and convicted. Headid attacks the validity of his convictions on several evidentiary grounds. First, he challenges the trial court\u2019s handling of the examination of the accomplices Garritsen and Jansen. The trial court sustained the Government\u2019s objections to attempts by defense attorneys on cross-examination of Garritsen and Jansen to elicit testimony about specific instances of criminally related conduct that had not resulted in felony convictions. The trial court also refused to allow the defense to circumvent these rulings through the direct examination of a jailmate of Jansen\u2019s. Headid contends that these restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>tive rulings constituted an abuse of discretion and were prejudicial to him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">The scope and extent of cross-examination are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Although it is vital that a searching cross-examination be permitted where the credibility of an important witness is being challenged, <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>344 U.S. 414, 417, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447 (1953), once the right of cross-examination has been substantially and thoroughly exercised, the allowance of further cross-examination lies wholly within the discretion of the trial court. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bly, </em>464 F.2d 1235, 1237 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Garritsen and Jansen, admitted accomplices, testified on direct examination to numerous prior felony convictions and to having pled guilty to charges arising from the instant case in exchange for prosecutorial promises relating to sentencing recommendations. Both were subjected to extensive cross-examination by four separate defense attorneys.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A review of the record discloses that Garritsen\u2019s and Jansen\u2019s questionable credibility was emphasized throughout their testimony and that they were subjected to substantial and extensive cross-examination and impeachment. The facts that Garritsen and Jansen had led lives of crime and had motives of self-interest in testifying for the Government were openly admitted from the outset of their testimony, and, in light of the extensive cross-examination which was allowed, further cross-examination of an impeaching nature would merely have been cumulative and repetitious. <em>United States v. Bly, supra </em>at 1237. Headid has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s handling of the cross-examination of Gar-ritsen and Jansen, and we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">Headid\u2019s second allegation of trial error also involves accomplice testimony. On cross-examination by the attorney for defendant Gregg, Garritsen alluded briefly to prior dealings in stolen property with Headid. On redirect examination, the Government attempted to elicit further testimony on this subject. The defense immediately objected to this line of questioning. The trial court expressed concern with the potentially prejudicial impact of this type of testimony, sustained the objection to the testimony and instructed the jury to disregard it. Headid characterizes the trial court\u2019s handling of this matter as erroneous. Assuming the evidence in question to have been properly excluded under Fed.R. Evid. 403, we consider the trial court\u2019s response to have been entirely appropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Aaron, </em>553 F.2d 43, 46 (8th Cir. 1977). Headid was protected by the trial court\u2019s rulings and no error occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-15\">It is Headid\u2019s final contention that the trial court erred in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal for two reasons: the Government\u2019s witnesses were not credible and the value of the stolen tractors was not shown to be over $5,000. Headid\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>argument may be answered by simple reference to the axiom that the jury is the judge of the credibility of witnesses. Insofar as the valuation of the stolen tractors is concerned, the evidence presented by the Government established that each tractor had a value of more than $5,000, and, thus, the value requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2314 and 2315 were met and proved. Finally, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we find the jury\u2019s verdicts of guilty to be supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">. Daniel Runge was charged with and convicted of Counts I (transportation) and II (conspiracy). Delores Gregg was charged with Counts II and III (receiving). The jury acquitted her on Count II and convicted her on Count III. The trial court set aside her conviction on Count III. Milo Headid was charged with and acquitted by the jury on Count III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">. The Honorable Edward J. McManus, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">. Garritsen and Jansen, who both testified at trial, pled guilty to federal charges arising from the events described here. At the time of trial, they had not yet been sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">. Headid also urges that even if the limitations be deemed nonprejudicial, they abridged his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We consider this contention to be wholly without merit. Headid was confronted with the witnesses against him and given ample opportunity to cross-examine them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">. The trial court refused to allow the defense, either on cross-examination or through extrinsic evidence, to explore certain specific conduct of the accomplices which had not resulted in felony convictions. These restrictions appear to have been wholly consonant with Fed.R. Evid. 608 and well within the trial court\u2019s considerable discretion to control cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1103-16\">. We note that under Fed.R.Evid. 404, evidence of crimes, wrongs or acts may be admissible to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge or absence of mistake or accident. Ostensibly, Headid\u2019s receipt and consideration of Garritsen\u2019s previous offers of stolen property would have been probative of Head-id\u2019s knowledge and absence of mistake concerning the stolen nature of the goods in the present case. The trial court\u2019s exclusion of this evidence was, however, apparently based upon an assessment of potential prejudice under Fed. R.Evid. 403, which authorizes the exclusion of evidence otherwise admissible under Rule 404 where probative value is substantially outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
