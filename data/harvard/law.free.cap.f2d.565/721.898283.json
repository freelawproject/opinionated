Instead of producing the documents after determining that the Act required production, appel-lee Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) notified intervenors of their intention to do so. Whereupon intervenors filed injunction proceedings against the CPSC in various District Courts, including the District of Delaware, seeking to prevent production. Subsequently, the District Court in Delaware issued a preliminary injunction precluding production. Later that court ordered the case closed with the preliminary injunction still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-24\">This appeal is from the dismissal of appellants\u2019 FOIA case by the District Court here on the ground that no case or contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>versy existed since the CPSC agrees with appellants that the documents should be produced but is prevented from doing so by the preliminary injunction in the \u201cclosed\u201d Delaware case. We reversed, holding that a case or controversy did indeed exist because CPSC continues to refuse to produce the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Since our ruling we are advised that the Delaware case was marked \u201cclosed\u201d for statistical reasons in that the case had been inactive for some time. Also, within a few days after our ruling, the Delaware case suddenly became active with a hearing in court, at which a date for trial on the merits was set. Appellants here, however, who have been attempting since 1974 to obtain production of the documents under FOIA, and against whom the Delaware litigation is directed, are not parties to the Delaware litigation. <em>See </em>Rule 19, Fed.R. Civ.P. Since all necessary parties are before the District Court here, there appears no reason why the litigation should not proceed here, particularly since this is the venue authorized by the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (S\u00fcpp. IV 1974).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Since the Act also provides that actions under it should be expedited, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(D) (Supp. IV 1974), at long last so be it.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-23\"> It is noteworthy that the Department of Justice has moved to transfer the Delaware case to the District of Columbia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
