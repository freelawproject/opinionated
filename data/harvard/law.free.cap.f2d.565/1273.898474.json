On May 25, 1976, the defendant pled guilty to Count I of the indictment, pursuant to a plea bargain providing that the Government would dismiss Count II of the indictment at the time of sentencing. The Government also agreed that it would make no recommendation \u201cas to the sentence to be imposed\u201d but would reserve the right to inform the court whether the defendant had cooperated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-26\">Sentencing was scheduled originally for June 30,1976, but was continued on several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>occasions, the last of which was a consequence of Miller fleeing the jurisdiction. Miller was apprehended and brought before the district court for imposition of a sentence on September 10,1976. At that hearing defense counsel attempted to persuade the court that leniency was appropriate. Among other things counsel argued that the defendant\u2019s initial drug involvement had been induced by a police officer and that in any event, defendant had cooperated with law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">Counsel for the Government responded to those remarks: first, indicating that a year and a half had elapsed from the time that Miller had been \u201cinduced\u201d and the time of the commission of the crime, thus undermining any excuse defense,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and second, that Miller had not in fact cooperated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">Following the arguments of counsel, the court imposed a sentence of seven years imprisonment to be followed by a three year special parole term on Count I of the indictment. Pursuant to the plea bargain, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Count II of the indictment was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">On January 10,1977, Miller filed a motion to reduce or vacate his sentence. His basic claim was that the Government had violated its bargain not to make any recommendation as to sentence by its remarks during the sentencing hearing. The defendant asserts that our decision in <em>United States v. Crusco, </em>536 F.2d 21 (3d Cir. 1976), and the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Santo-bello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971), require that we vacate the sentence. The district court denied this motion. We affirm, finding that <em>Crusco </em>and <em>Santobello </em>are distinguishable from the facts of this ease and that the Government has upheld its promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-13\">When a plea rests in any significant degree upon a promise of a prosecutor, justice requires that the promise must be kept. This is the basic teaching of <em>Santobello v. New York, supra, </em>in which the Court remanded to the state court the duty to fashion an appropriate remedy for the defendant based on the failure of a new prosecutor to fulfill the agreement by his predecessor not to make any recommendation as to defendant\u2019s sentence. 404 U.S. at 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-14\">This court applied the <em>Santobello </em>rule in <em>United States v. Crusco, supra, </em>and it is the rule of this Circuit that the Government must adhere strictly to the terms of the bargains it strikes with defendants. In <em>Crusco, </em>the Government agreed to \u201ctake no position on sentencing\u201d as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. 536 F.2d at 25. At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel pled for leniency based on the needs of the defendant\u2019s family and the fact that the defendant was not a major crime figure. <em>Id. </em>In response to those remarks, the Government stated that the defendant was a dealer of drugs in large quantities and that it \u201cshow[ed] the [defendant\u2019s] importance in organized crime . . and also show[ed] the danger to the community that [defendant] ha[d] by being out in the street.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant, relying on <em>Santobello </em>claimed that the Government\u2019s comments breached the promise to take no position on sentencing. The Government claimed that its remarks literally were no recommendation, but were only rebuttal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s arguments. <em>Id. </em>We held that the Government\u2019s characterization of its remarks was nothing more than a \u201ctransparent effort to influence the severity\u201d of defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26. We then admonished the Government to be careful in its future bargains and to faithfully fulfill its promises. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">Miller contends here that the Government, as in <em>Crusco, </em>has breached the terms of its plea bargain. He contends that the cases are indistinguishable. We disagree. In <em>Crusco, </em>the Government attempted to characterize its promise <em>to take no position </em>as to sentencing as equivalent to a promise to make no <em>recommendation </em>as to the terms of the sentence. We recognized that the two promises are different, and held that the unqualified promise of a prosecutor to take no position on sentencing requires strict adherence, an obligation which might require the prosecutor to stand mute in face of defendant\u2019s mitigating arguments. 536 F.2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">In this case, however, the Government has only promised to make no recommendation as to sentence and has expressly reserved the right to comment on defendant\u2019s cooperation. The defendant challenges two distinct statements by the prosecutor as violative of the bargain: (1) the remarks concerning excuse and (2) the remarks concerning defendant\u2019s cooperation. Calling the defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation a \u201ctravesty\u201d is not a violation of any promise the Government has made; it is fair rebuttal comment on the failure of the defendant to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">More troubling is the prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical remark that defendant\u2019s actions were not excusable in spite of alleged coercion by a police officer. The remark does not appear to be directed toward defendant\u2019s cooperation or lack of it, which was expressly reserved for Government comment. Defendant thus asserts that the words violated the non-recommendation promise. This argument misapprehends the crucial holding of <em>Crusco </em>\u2014 that the Government will be held only to what it has promised. In <em>Crus-co </em>the Government made a broad unqualified promise to take no position whatsoever as to sentencing and thus gave up its right to fair comment as to the severity of the sentence and whether the defendant should undergo imprisonment. Here, the Government has specifically promised only not to make recommendation as to the sentence. The difference between the two terms is elementary, for the promise not to recommend is narrow, speaking only as to the sentence to be imposed, whereas a promise to take no position speaks to no attempt at all to influence the defendant\u2019s sentence. Moreover, the remarks here were merely a rhetorical response to some of defendant\u2019s arguments that his conduct was \u201cexcusable,\u201d unlike the prosecutor\u2019s slightly veiled comments in <em>Crusco </em>which suggested the imprisonment of the defendant in the face of his broad commitment to take no position whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-9\">Although we hold that on the facts of this case there is no breach of any promise made by the Government, we again must remind the Government of the semantic pitfalls inherent in plea bargaining. Promises made must be fulfilled, not only in fairness to the accused and the public interests, but also to fulfill the requirements of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">. The Government\u2019s exact words in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument were as follows: How does it make it excusable? Did he hold a gun to his head for a year and a half? How does that make it excusable?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">. Mr. Scutti, the Assistant U. S. Attorney arguing for the Government made the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">Your Honor, I think to call Mr. Miller\u2019s role in this case cooperation is one of the all time travesties I have ever heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-16\">Number one, the fact he spoke for five minutes with a couple of people this morning is not cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-17\">Mr. Miller knew from the beginning and as far as this alleged episode where he brought the heroin and called the courthouse and everything else, he understood if he was going to cooperate it would have to be the way we said it was to be done, to make a surveillance, to make it easier on him. He has not cooperated at all and I don\u2019t see how you can even begin to say he has.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1347-11\">STERN, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AzyM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">Because I can discern no distinction between a promise \u201cto take no position\u201d on sentence and a promise \u201cto make no recommendation\u201d as to sentence, when each is made by a prosecutor to a defendant, I am unable to join the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">I simply do not agree that \u201c[T]he difference between the two terms is elementary, for the promise not to recommend is narrow, speaking only as to the sentence to be imposed, whereas a promise to take no position speaks to no attempt at all to influence the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d [Ante 1275] I do not believe that any defendant could appreciate such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-14\">In <em>United States v. Crusco, </em>536 F.2d 21 (3rd Cir. 1976), this Court construed a prose-cutorial promise to \u201ctake no position as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>sentence\u201d to mean that the government had undertaken to refrain from <em>any </em>allocution at sentence, even one directed solely at correcting what were claimed to be factual misstatements to the Court by the defense. The majority, and in my view correctly, in summing up <em>Crusco </em>says, \u201cWe held that the Government\u2019s characterization of its remarks [as no recommendation of the terms of the sentence] was nothing more than a transparent effort to influence the severity of the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d [Ante 1275] As to Miller, however, the majority characterizes the government\u2019s remarks against mitigation for him as merely \u201crhetorical\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">In <em>Crusco </em>the prosecutor did not recommend a specific term of years; he spoke only to contradict the mitigating factors urged by the defense. So too here. I cannot construe the prosecutor\u2019s remarks here as rhetorical. He spoke at the moment of sentencing, with the intent to disparage a claim for mitigation made on behalf of one about to be sentenced, and to the very judge who would shortly pronounce that sentence. The government\u2019s rhetoric was not rhetorical. It was uttered to influence the sentence. It could have been uttered for no other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">It is well to remember the full text of the words written by Judge Rosenn in Crusco:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW1\">We see the Government\u2019s characterization as a transparent effort to influence the severity of Cimmino\u2019s sentence. Only a stubbornly literal mind would refuse to regard the Government\u2019s commentary as communicating a position on sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">536 F.2d 21, 26 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">I fully concur in the Court\u2019s determination that the government violated no promise to the defendant when it apprised the sentencing court of the extent or lack of this defendant\u2019s cooperation. The government had bargained away no such right at the time of plea; indeed, it had specifically reserved the area for comment. The very reservation demonstrates the bargain to be silent on the rest.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
