(Hoskins). The trial court denied the government\u2019s motion for reconsideration on April 6, 1995, adhering to its earlier conclusion that it \u201cdid not have reliable testimony sufficient to understand how defendant was damaged, much less to guess an amount.\u201d The appeal was submitted for decision after oral argument on April 4,1996. Because the \u201cno resale\u201d clause at issue requires Hoskins to pay damages according to a set formula incorporating values derived from an appraisal that \u201cshall be made with the standard Forest Service method in use at [the] time of termination,\u201d and there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that the government failed to make its appraisal according to the standard Forest Service method, we reverse and remand the case to the trial court with the instruction that it enter judgment in favor of the government in the amount of $229,577.37 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-19\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b898-20\">The case is before us a second time in as many years. In 1994, we reversed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the government could not recover damages against Hoskins according to the formula set out in standard timber contract section B9.4, the operative contract provision. <em>Hoskins Lumber Co. v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>States, </em>20 F.3d 1144 (Fed.Cir.1994).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Having concluded that the instant case was factually indistinguishable from that presented by <em>Madigan v. Hobin Dumber Co., </em>986 F.2d 1401 (Fed.Cir.1993), we held that the government was \u201centitled to damages under the formula in the contract\u201d and thus remanded \u201cthe issue of damages to the Court of Federal Claims for application of the contract section setting forth a measure of damages in the event of no resale.\u201d <em>Hoskins, </em>20 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">On remand, over the government\u2019s objection, the trial court granted Hoskins\u2019 request to hold a hearing \u201cto determine damages.\u201d After the trial, which included testimony from relevant government witnesses indicating that the Forest Service correctly conducted the appraisal required by section B9.4 and correctly calculated damages according to the formula in section B9.4, the court granted Hoskins\u2019 motion for directed verdict, treating it as a motion to dismiss. According to the trial court, Hoskins had \u201cdemonstrated through cross-examination of defendant\u2019s witnesses that defendant\u2019s appraisal was deficient,\u201d and the government had not \u201cmade the showing necessary for the court to make \u2018a determination of the damages under the contract\u2019 as required by the remand order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The government appeals, contending that the trial court erred in allowing Hoskins to mount any challenge to the validity of the appraisal, and that, even if Hoskins should be permitted to challenge the appraisal\u2019s validity, only the Forest Service\u2019s compliance <em>vel non </em>with its standard appraisal method is open to challenge under the express terms of section B9.4. Although, given the complexity and long life of the case, we are not persuaded that the trial court erred in providing Hoskins an opportunity to try the question of whether the government complied with its standard appraisal method, we agree with the government that that is the <em>only </em>question on which Hoskins was entitled to a trial. The questions of whether or how the government was damaged by the absence of a resale were not properly before the trial court, having been resolved in the government\u2019s favor by our mandate in the first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">The terms of section B9.4 make it clear that the only appraisal to which Hoskins was entitled was one that complied in all material respects \u201cwith the standard Forest Service method in use at [the] time of the termination\u201d of the timber contract. Hoskins was emphatically <em>not </em>entitled to a \u201cfair\u201d appraisal, an \u201caccurate\u201d appraisal, a \u201creasonable\u201d appraisal, or any manner of appraisal other than the one indicated in section B9.4. Under section B9.4, compliance with the standard appraisal method is the sole measure of its accuracy and reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">The government established at the hearing that it conducted the appraisal according to its standard method. Unlike the trial court, we can discern nothing in what was revealed by Hoskins\u2019 cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses that undermines their testimony on this basic \u2014 indeed, the only relevant \u2014 point. On this record, the trial court thus clearly erred in finding that the government\u2019s appraisal was \u201cdeficient.\u201d As a result, the government is entitled to judgment in the amount of $229,577.37 ($234,347.32 from the CO\u2019s decision, less the $4,769.95 adjustment for downpayment and midpoint payment changes), plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Costs in favor of the government.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">We assume familiarity with the more detailed statement of background facts contained in this earlier opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
