Brown and Wheeler H. Plotts, plaintiff:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">\u201c An agreement, made this 18th day of April, 1896, between Isaac K. Brown, of the first part, and Wheeler H. Plotts, of the second part, witnesseth: That for the consideration hereinafter mentioned, the party of the first part agrees to cut and deliver on the bank of the Loyalsock creek or some other locality mutually agreed upon by the parties, such an amount of timber from the Conrad Bates tract, in Hillsgrove township, Sullivan county,, as shall, at the current market rate of such timber at the time of its delivery, be worth, clear of all incumbrance, the sum of $710, and such additional sum as shall be necessary to compensate the said party of the second part, at the rate of $1.50 and necessary expenses per diem, for the time necessarily spent by him in looking after the selling and collecting the pay for said timber, the delivery to be completed on or before the first day of January, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">\u201c In payment for such cutting and delivery, the party of the second part hereby sells to the said party of the first part all the hemlock bark on said tract not exceeding twenty-five cords, to be removed by said party of the first part at his convenience; and, furthermore, agrees to sell to the said party of the first part, in full payment for the delivery of the timber as above</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">\u25a0 recited, all the residue of timber and bark upon said tract; but no part of said residue is to be cut, sold or removed from said tract until the full amount of timber required by this agreement to be delivered shall have been so delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">\u201c The party of the first part hereby agrees to take said bark and residue of timber in full payment for cutting and delivering said amount of timber for the said party of the second part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-10\">\u25a0 And said party of the first part hereby specifically agrees not to cut, sell, remove or in any way dispose of said residue of timber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and bark (except the twenty-five cords above mentioned) until the complete fulfillment of his part of this agreement to the satisfaction of the said party of the second part.

Plotts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-8\">Brown did some of the work under the contract, employing to assist him the defendants Warburton and Durkes. When Brown ceased operations he owed Warburton and Durkes for labor. They recovered a judgment against Brown for their. claim, and sold his interest in the timber at a constable\u2019s sale at which they became the purchasers. There was evidence that at and subsequent to the constable\u2019s sale, Plotts told defendants that the cut timber was sufficient to protect his claim, and that they should cut and take the standing timber, and make their claim against Brown out of that. The defendants acting on this representation proceeded to cut the standing timber. Subsequently plaintiff issued a writ of replevin and took what they had cut. ^</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-9\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-10\">[The agreement is in writing and is for the consideration of the court, if that is the agreement between them, if it has not been changed or altered by some parol agreement. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>But it appears by some agreement, which seems to have been entered into between these parties since then \u2014 the terms of which have not been clearly detailed to you so that we could tell what the agreement actually was \u2014 that instead of Mr. Brown actually banking these logs, that he put up a sawmill somewhere, and that these logs were delivered at that sawmill and manufactured into lumber, but when or where is not very clear .... the evidence in this case showing that the original contract must have been changed by a verbal agreement of the parties, we think it makes it of such a nature, such a verbal contract, as we shall have to leave to the jury for their consideration, instead of construing this written contract absolutely ourselves.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-4\">[Mr. Warburton has testified that at one time after Mr. Plotts had commenced taking away the timber \u2014 I think that was after Mr. Brown had stopped sawing, but whether or not it was is for you, and I desire to leave it to you \u2014 that he met Mr. Plotts there upon the mill yard, and he said to him, before you take away this timber I wish you would arrange to pay me. Mr. Brown owes me some, and I want you, before taking away this lumber to secure me. Mr. Plotts replied, according to Mr. Warburton\u2019s testimony, that he couldn\u2019t do that. He said, I don\u2019t owe you, it is not claim against me. I want to get my pay out of this lumber, and I believe I have enough lumber here to secure me if I can get it. I cannot pay you out of this, but why don\u2019t you get your pay out of the standing timber. Mr. Warbuton says he replied to Mr. Plotts by paying, Pm afraid if I do that you will come and take it the same as you are taking away this lumber; that Mr. Plotts replied, no, I will not disturb you if you go on and take it from that, and you can have it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">If Mr. Plotts did say this to Mr. Warburton, and after having said it Mr. Warburton went on and made costs for himself by getting a confession of judgment, bringing a suit against Mr. Brown, which he would not otherwise have done, and levied upon this timber and sold it at constable\u2019s sale, then Mr. Plotts would be estopped from setting up that that was his timber.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">[If I say to one of you gentlemen, go to that neighbor of mine, he has a horse there and you can buy it, and you do go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>and buy that horse and pay that.neighbor for it, I can\u2019t after-wards turn around and say that was my horse, because I have induced you by my act to spend your money upon something which otherwise you would not have done. So that if Mr. Plotts said to Mr. Warburton and Mr. Durkes that they should go on and get their pay from Mr. Brown out of the standing \u25a0timber, and that he would not set up a claim to it, he cannot turn around now and invoke the authority of the court to secure to him that timber which he induced the defendants to levy upon and sell.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-4\">[One party cannot induce another by his acts or words, either by lying idly by when it is his duty to speak, or by his information, which, perhaps, is wrong \u2014 to expend money, incur costs, or perform labor upon property upon the strength of its belonging to some one else, and then turn around and say that property was mine all the while, you have performed this labor, you have been to this expense, but I will take it now. Because the principle of law is that where one of two parties must suffer a loss, he by whom the loss was occasioned must suffer it. So that in this case, if Mr. Plotts did say these things and by reason of his assertions these defendants went on and incurred costs, and expended their money and labor upon this property, Mr. Plotts is estopped from now setting up that the property belonged to him.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">[Now, gentlemen, if you find that this property at the time this writ of replevin was issued belonged to Mr. Plotts under his agreement with Mr. Brown, and find that it is not true that these representations were made as testified to, then you should find for the plaintiff; because under this written agreement Mr. Plotts had a right to all that timber until he had actually gotten his pay, and it was for him to say when he had received his pay, and until he had received it Mr. Brown had no right to take any of the lumber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">But if you find that he has made these declarations and these inducements to these defendants, although the timber at the time may have actually belonged to him, yet between him \u25a0and these defendants he would not now have the right under such circumstances to set up a claim of ownership to it. He could be estopped from so doing if he made these allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that have been testified to by the defendants, and the defend- \u2022 ants would be entitled to recover.] [7]</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ahb\">July 10, 1902:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-4\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

There is ample evidence in the record to warrant the verdict in defendants\u2019 favor. The plaintiff\u2019s own evidence shows that he knew that it was necessary to expend money and time in order to make a marketable product of the logs and timber in the woods, and this the defendants de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>dined to do until they were assured by him that he had enough property in his possession to satisfy his claim agaiiist Brown. At the time of this conversation the plaintiff had it within his power to know definitely, after counting his part of the lumber and estimating the balance, whether his claim, which was at that time reduced to a precise sum, was covered, and he should not be permitted to visit the result of his reckless judgment on innocent parties who made due inquiry before expending their money and labor. He had the undoubted right to claim all the timber and logs in order to protect his own claim, he was not in duty bound at that time to withdraw any part of it; and, having spoken under such circumstances, he must be held to have told the truth: Smith v. McNeal, 68 Pa. 164; Huff v. McCauley, 53 Pa. <em>206; </em>Kline v. McCandless, 139 Pa. 223; Sensinger v. Boyer, 153 Pa. 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The interest of Brown in the standing timber depended entirely on the extent of Plotts\u2019s claim against it; and if, as testified to by several witnesses and as found by the jury, he did withdraw his claim from the logs and timber in the woods and induced the defendants by his acts and words, at and subsequent to the constable\u2019s sale, to believe that his claim was satisfied in full, then the position of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the transaction at the time made it a case for the jury and not for the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The written contract between Brown and Plotts did not of itself determine the rights of the parties in this action. Even if the construction placed upon it be as contended for by the appellant, yet, if Plotts stated to the defendant, \u201c I will not disturb you iE you go in and take the standing timber and make your claim against Brown out of that,\u201d he is, under the testimony, estopped from setting up his claim to that property, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
