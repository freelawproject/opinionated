We have the testimony of Mr. Carter and Judge Stewart, who are not residents of that place, but who have extensive interests in the paper mill, and in the power company, and who go there frequently, both of whom stop at the company\u2019s house, it is true, and not at the hotel; but Mr. Carter and Judge Stewart, going there every week, their testimony is that the second hotel is not necessary. The testimony of Judge Stewart is that there are at least four or five trains going north each day, and five coming south; and their testimony is that people come on one train, transact their business, and go off in the next. Business people do not transact business as they may have done forty or fifty years ago; they just spend enough time to transact their business. A business man does not desire to spend the night at York Haven, unless he has some business that could not be transacted during the day; and in the .transaction of business at York Haven a hotel could not expect many such persons as guests. Business men go there to spend an hour\u2019s time, transact their business, and go off on the next train either north or south. They prefer better hotels than could be expected at York Haven. It would seem that the present hotel is as good as could be expected there now. The only wonder is that Mr. Me Grady has been able to keep that hotel as well ar.d as respectably as he has, \u2014 a hotel so well kept as is shown by the testimony here to-day, \u2014 and we do not think it could be kept better with another hotel, under the circumstances; or that another hotel would be better kept than the house of Mr. McGrady; and we are satisfied of this from the evidence, from the character of the house, and our personal knowledge of it. [Taking the testimony in this case, and everything into consideration, we reach the conclusion that the granting of the license is not necessary in our opinion and we refuse to grant it.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order refusing a license.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1jp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>April 21, 1902:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-4\"><em>J.

But where the complaint is that the court has arbitrarily exercised its discretion, or has put its decision on other than legal grounds, the appellate court will consider all the evidence: Kelminski\u2019s License, 164 Pa. 231; Johnson\u2019s License, 166 Pa. 322.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-6\"><em>H.

L. 158. It does not bring up the evidence nor the rulings of the court upon questions of evidence. There is no mode provided by law for bringing them upon the record. The discretionary power to grant or refuse liquor license applications is vested exclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>in tbe court of quarter sessions. When the legislature shall deem it wise, if it ever shall, to invest the appellate courts with power to review such proceedings upon their merits, they will undoubtedly provide a mode whereby the evidence and rulings made on the hearing may be brought upon the record. Until such mode is provided our investigation upon appeal must necessarily be confined to the record. Finding no error or irregularity in the record and no abuse of discretion being apparent, it is our plain duty to affirm the order. We have held in numerous cases that the court need not set -forth in the order its reasons for refusing the license; if it does not set them forth it will be presumed that the license was refused for a legal reason and not arbitrarily. See Netter\u2019s License, 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 566, and cases there cited, and Hilleman\u2019s License, 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 567. Bub here the order quoted in the first assignment shows affirmatively that the license was refused for a legal reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">All the assignments are overruled and the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
