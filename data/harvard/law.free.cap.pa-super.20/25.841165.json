Same day summons in ejectment for the land described in the praecipe, issued to the sheriff. Returnable the second Monday of September, 1875.

Kirkendall, sheriff, for $4.00 jury fee, and thereupon judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">Mr. Price: What is the purpose of this offer?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">Mr. Newcomb: To rebut the defendant\u2019s claim of title by uninterrupted and adverse possession, this record being offered in connection with the lease last offered for that purpose. Also as persuasive evidence in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s title, the judgment in that case having been rendered in an action between the respective grantors of the parties here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">Mr. Price: This exemplification is objected to; no possession was taken under it, nor is there any offer to prove possession taken under it. A judgment in ejectment does not toll the statute or interrupt possession unless possession was taken under it, or an entry made by reason of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-11\">The Court: It is distinctly ruled in Brolaskey v. McClain, 61 Pa. 146, that a recovery in an action of ejectment stops the running of the statute. The question is not discussed at large, but that is an express decision. I will overrule the objection and allow the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-12\">Exception noted for defendant, at whose request a bill is sealed.

It is.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">Mr. Price: We desire to add a further objection to the lease. This case was tried once before and no such lease was put in evidence or produced; the plaintiff in this case was asked to file an abstract of title, and the abstract of title as filed contains no reference to a paper of this kind ; we therefore object to it because we have had no notice and are not prepared to meet any title outside of the abstract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-9\">The Court: I will overrule the additional objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-10\">Exception noted for defendant, at whose request a bill is sealed.

Among the authorities cited as contra is the one upon which the court below and the appellee here rely as determining the question : Brolaskey v. McClain, 61 Pa. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Where there is such an apparent contravention of the general rule and a seeming contradiction of many of the Pennsylvania authorities, it behooves us to make a careful examination of the case upon which such a contention is based. It is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that in Brolaskey v. McClain, supra, Mr. Justice Williams says: \u201cIf Wester and his heirs had the continued and adverse possession of the lot during all this time, it would be sufficient to give them a title under the statute ; but, as we have already seen, Richard Peters brought an action of ejectment against Henry Wester in 1818 and recovered a verdict and judgment therein in 1825. This recovery stopped the running of the statute and, even if the Westers held adverse possession of the lot thereafter until the house was torn down in 1838, they acquired no title, under the statute of limitations.\u201d If there were nothing else in this case and it stood alone in Pennsylvania, it would, of course, be conclusive upon us as to that question, but it was said with reference to all the facts of the case, which included the issuing of a hab. fa. pos. and a return by the sheriff, \u201clevied and sheriff received costs in a judgment in ejectment involving the same premises although against a different defendant.\u201d It is, therefore, to be presumed that the sheriff did his duty and delivered the possession, as required by his writ, to the plaintiff in the ejectment and, if so, the case itself, whatever the language of the opinion judge may be, cannot be relied upon as authority for the contention of the appellee. With this single exception, the authorities in Pennsylvania seems to be in entire harmony with the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In Pederick v. Searle, 5 S. &amp; R. 236, the case of Jackson v. Haviland, 13 Johns. 229, is cited with approval, in which it was held: A having obtained judgment by default in an ejectment against B, but did not take possession, and having suffered the term laid in the declaration to expire and the possession of the defendant being continued without interruption, so that the whole time, including that which elapsed after the judgment\u2019 amounted to twenty years, B might defend himself under the statute of limitations against a second ejectment, although A\u2019s right of entry was established by the judgment, and he might lawfully have entered without a writ of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">That a judgment in ejectment does not change the relation between the plaintiff and defendant, so far as the possession is concerned, is further shown by Rambler v. Tryon, 7 S. &amp; R. 90, and Ross v. Pleasants, 19 Pa. 157, in which it was held that a plaintiff, in whose favor a verdict in ejectment has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>rendered, may maintain a second ejectment for the same land, without taking possession or issuing process for that purpose under his first ejectment. If a mere judgment in ejectment gave him the possession of the land in dispute, he could not, of course, maintain a second ejectment for the foundation of the action is the actual possession by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In Powell v. Smith, 2 Watts, 126, which was replevin for a chattel which became such by a severance from the freehold, it was held that replevin would not lie, on the ground, as stated by Chief Justice Gibson, that \u201c the property laid in the declaration was taken by the defendant, while he was yet in actual possession, though after a recovery of the mill of which it was essentially a part; and the only thing like a question in the cause is whether the naked recovery, which preceded the asportation, distinguishes the case from those cited; but nothing is clearer than that such a recovery is not equivalent to an entry, even to bar the statute of limitations, and, therefore, not equivalent to actual possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In Caldwell v. Walters, 22 Pa. 378, which was an action of trespass for mesne profits, Mr. Chief Justice Black, in delivering the opinion, says: \u201c Does a judgment in ejectment put an end to the disseisin? Certainly not. It may settle the title in favor of the plaintiff but the all-important fact of an adverse possession remains just as it was before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">It is said that these cases all precede Brolaskey v. McClain, and that we are, therefore, bound by the latter. This would be true, if there were no facts in it to distinguish it from the cases in which the emphatic language above quoted is used, and, if there was nothing following it in harmony with the earlier cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In Craft v. Yeaney, 66 Pa. 210, which was an action of trespass brought by a plaintiff who had recovered in ejectment but who had not secured possession through a writ of hab. fa. pos., Mr. Chief Justice Thompson said: \u201cThe plaintiffs in error now claim that this action of trespass cannot be maintained, because no habere facias possessionem ever issued to give them legal seisin of what they admitted themselves dispossessed in bringing their ejectment, and which the ejectment also admitted the defendants to be in possession of. The testimony is uncontradicted that actual possession of this land was ever in any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>body, taking the line of subdivision No. 7 as excluding it, which the jury have found, consequently an habere facias would have been idle. There was nobody to turn out and nobody to hinder the plaintiffs from going in. This being so, the constructive possession incident to title still existed, there being no actual possession to challenge it; so that the plaintiffs\u2019 title being unchallenged in this respect drew the constructive possession of the land to it and the right to sue was not affected by this technical claim of possession, contradicted as it was by the fact as shown by all the testimony on the point.\u201d The case of Caldwell v. Walters, 22 Pa. 378, was cited, and the difference between the two cases pointed out, and it was said: <em>\u201c </em>There an actual possession existed and it was held that an action for mesne profits would not lie, because possession had not been delivered to the plaintiffs in ejectment.\u201d This was a distinct acknowledgment of the doctrine in that case and is subsequent to Brolaskey v. McClain.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">There is also the later case of Bennett v. Morrison, 120 Pa. 390, in which Mr. Justice Paxson says: \u201cThe judgment was by default. The ejectment was to enforce the article of agreement, and, therefore, in affirmance of it. No subsequent proceedings were ever had upon this judgment. No habere was issued, nor was possession delivered to the plaintiff. Such a recovery is not equivalent to an entry, even to bar the statute of limitations, and, therefore, not equivalent to actual possession : Powell v. Smith, 2 Watts, 126 ; Workman v. Guthrie, 29 Pa. 495.\u201d This is a distinct acknowledgment of the general doctrine, as herein laid down, and, if it were not for the essentially different facts in Brolaskey v. McClain, would be in direct conflict with it. In view of the general current of authority, which seems to us to be consonant to reason, we, therefore, sustain the second and third assignments of error and also the first, so far as the offer was received for the purpose of rebutting the defendant\u2019s claim of title by uninterrupted and adverse possession. We think the offer was good, so far as it was to be used \u201c as persuasive evidence in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">2. Whether or not the lease offered by the plaintiff with the grantor of the defendant was sufficiently identified was, under all the circumstances, for the jury. The subscribing witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>contradicts himself to some extent in his cross-examination, but we think that his testimony sufficiently identified, the person who signed the lease and the property covered by it, and that the court could not say, as a matter of law, that the execution of the lease was not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">3. The lease was not part of the plaintiff\u2019s title. It was offered for the purpose of rebutting the claim which the defendant set up by virtue of the adverse possession of her grantor. It does not seem to us that it was the duty of the plaintiff to anticipate the defendant\u2019s defense. She could not determine in advance whether it would be necessary to use the lease or not, and was, therefore, not bound to set it out in her original abstract of title. The fourth, fifth and sixth assignments of error are overruled. Judgment reversed and a new venire awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
