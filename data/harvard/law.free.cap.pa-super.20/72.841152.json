Where the plaintiff asserts a material fact in his pleadings, and it is not denied by the person charged with the nonobservance of the stated duty, it is not extravagant to assume that he believes in the justice of his demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-5\">Furthermore, an averment of a sale of a designated article at a fixed price, a delivery of it, a promise by the purchaser to pay for it \u2014 which becomes enforceable upon delivery in the absence of a specified time for payment \u2014 and a failure on his part to do so, comprises about every material element which constitutes a brief or concise statement of a claim. For instance, the plaintiff declares that he sold and delivered on May 22,1900, \u201c 24,000 No. 1W. Pine Shingles, 18.90 \u2014 1213.60 \u201d unto the defendant, and that the latter promised to pay the plaintiff that price for that kind and quantity of shingles. It is not stated that 18.90 means that much per thousand shingles, but the total leaves no doubt about that meaning, as the simplest effort in arithmetic demonstrates.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-6\">The same is true of every article in the \u201citemized statement.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-7\">It is quite likely that the items in the schedule were copied from books kept by the plaintiff, and it is just as probable that the contract was oral. If the plaintiff had sold and delivered unto the defendant a lot of cattle, it is reasonable to believe that he would have made an entry in a book, setting forth the number, date, weight, price per hundred or pound weight, and the product of the muitiplication of the total avoirdupois by the price per hundred or per pound weight; and it is inerrant that those same items embodied in a statement, without reference to the memorandum, would exhibit brevity, conciseness and completeness, and embrace all matters of substance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-8\">To plead a sale and delivery of a specified article, or articles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>with the date, kind, quantity and price, a promise by the purchaser to pay and a failure to fulfill that promise, constitutes a substantive statement of a claim or demand, and indeed an attempt at elucidation is apt to degenerate into perplexity and mystification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-3\">Being of opinion that this statement embraces all the essential requisites, there remains only the duty to overrule the motion to strike off the judgment, and to authorize such further proceedings as are warranted by law, which is accordingly done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-5\"><em>C.

Fechter, 2 W. N. C. 261; Wall v. Dovey, 60 Pa. 212; Moore v. Humphreys, 1 W. N. C. 157; Kahn v. Marquis, 1 W. N. C. 221; Carr v. Mountjoy, 1 W. N. C. 360; Becker v. Loucheim, 1 W. N.

Hagemann, 21 W. N. C. 556; McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 159 Pa. 489; Murphy v.

The plaintiff\u2019s action was not upon a book account but upon a contract of the defendant to pay a stipulated price for lumber sold and delivered. The price, the date when the same was sold and delivered, the kind and amount of lumber, the defendant\u2019s promise to pay the price specified and his failure to pay were set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement with sufficient precision to secure to the defendant clear and exact information of what was claimed of him. The case is plainly distinguishable from the cases relied on by Iris counsel. The learned judge below well says: \u201cTo plead a sale and delivery of a specified article, or articles, with the date, kind, quantity and price, a promise by the purchaser to pay and a failure to fulfill that promise, constitutes a substantive statement of a claim or demand, and indeed an attempt at elucidation is apt to degenerate into perplexity and mystification.\u201d All that need be said in vindication of the action of the court is contained in his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The order is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
