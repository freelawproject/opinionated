This agreement is dated October 27, 1897. According to the testimony of the defendant, this arrangement continued until the month of April, 1898, when, in consequence of the failure to rent the rooms in her building, she made a verbal agreement by which plaintiff was to receive $55.00 for the month of May, 1898, and $45.00 per month thereafter, and that in the month of December she employed him as engineer, agreeing to pay him $40.00 per month, which he accepted, because of the difficulty to secure work in the winter time. All of these several verbal agreements or understandings are specifically denied by the plaintiff and, if there were nothing else in the case, it would be clearly one for a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The defendant is corroborated by the fact that, after the several dates referred to by her, bills were made out by her agents for the plaintiff, in which his wages at the rates mentioned by the defendant in her testimony are separately set forth and those of elevator boy and scrub-women separately. Each one of these bills for eleven months is receipted by the plaintiff, four of them containing on the margin the words \u201cservices in full to date,\u201d and all the others containing in the body of the receipts the words <em>\u201c </em>in full for services to date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">It is clear from the testimony of the plaintiff himself that he understood what he was doing, when he signed these several receipts. True he claims that at the time of signing, he said he receipted only on account but \u201c had to have money to live on \u201d and, therefore, signed the receipt. Assuming this as true, the case is no stronger than Flynn v. Hurlock, 194 Pa. 462, in which the plaintiff gave a receipt in full of all demands, stating when he did so that he waived no rights, wherein it is said: \u201c He gave the receipt because the defendants refused to pay any more money without it. He must be assumed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>received the money upon the express condition that it was in full of all demands. He signed it with his eyes open, without any fraud, artifice, mistake or imposition practised upon him, and he. is, consequently, bound by it.\u201d This is the doctrine of all our later cases \u2014 Crawford v. Forest Oil Co., 189 Pa. 415; Rhoads\u2019s Est., 189 Pa. 460 ; MacDonald v. Piper, 193 Pa. 312; Benseman v. Prudential Ins. Co., 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 363 \u2014 and must prevail here.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">It follows that there was no error either in the charge of the court or answers to points for charge. The assignments of error are all overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
