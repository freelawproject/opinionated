The defendant claimed that the notes were given on condition that a transfer of liquor license should be made to him, and that as this transfer had not been made that there had been a failure of consideration. The plaintiff offered in evidence a suit on another note in the series bought at No. 113, May term, 1901, in which a judgment originally entered by default had been confirmed by the court. This offer was objected to:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-7\">1. As incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-8\">2. Because under the pleadings in this case there is no reference in any Avay to this suit at No. 113, May term, 1901, and the same was not pleaded in any way, and the defendant had no notice whatever of said record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-9\">3. For the reason that the said record shows that the judgment was obtained by default, and that an application was made to open the same on April 4, 1901, an affidavit of defense then filed, which Avas treated by the court and counsel as a rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-10\">4.

The judgment in that case was not strictly one by default. The defendant, in his objections to the admission of the record in evidence here, urges, \u201c Third. For the reason that the said record shows that the judgment was obtained by default and that an application was made to open tbe same on April 4,1901, an affidavit of defense then filed which was treated by the court and the counsel as a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>It is apparent from an examination of the affidavit of defense filed that the alleged failure of consideration was set out in full as follows: \u201c That the note sued on, together with three others, were executed and delivered by affiant to the plaintiff on the day of their date, on the express stipulation and condition that affiant was to receive a transfer of said license and that the consideration for said notes was the transfer of said license and that in the event of a refusal of said transfer the note sued on, as well as the other three for like amounts, were void for want of consideration.\u201d We have, therefore, the same question in a suit between the same parties determined on its merits bjr a court of competent jurisdiction \u2014 the same court in fact. The conditions of res ad judicata are all met. The judgment there binds here.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
