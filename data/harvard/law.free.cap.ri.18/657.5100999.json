Under the agreement in writing upon which the bill rests, the respondent stipulated that whatever improvement or inventions he should make relating in any way to any machine, tool, or other mechanism manufactured by the complainant corporation, should be by him properly transferred to and become the property of said corporation. The bill shows that the respondent has made several such improvements and inventions and obtained letters patent of the United States therefor, but that he declines and refuses to transfer the same to the corporation as agreed. In support of his demurrer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>respondent relies upon a clause in said agreement which, provides that in case the p\u00e1rties disagree on any matter 'therein set forth, then and in each and every such case the whole matter whereon the parties disagree shall he referred to arbitration in the usual manner, and that the award of the arbitrators shall be binding upon the parties and shall be strictly carried out by them.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASX\"><em>Edwin </em>Aldrich, for complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AgCM\"><em>Charles A. Wilson &amp; Thomas A. Jenckes, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b698-3\">But the bill does not show that any disagreement or controversy exists between the said parties in the premises, and hence there is nothing to arbitrate. It simply shows that the respondent has refused to carry out his agreement in regard to said transfer, and prays that specific performance thereof be decreed. The case is not, therefore, one in which something remains to be done as a condition precedent to the right to maintain a suit on the contract, but one where the respondent is clearly and confessedly in default. It is only matters that are inherently doubtful, and where a decision must be arrived at by the exercise of discretion and judgment, which can constitute the material for a submission to arbitration.
