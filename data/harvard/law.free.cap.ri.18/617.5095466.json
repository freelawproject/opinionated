Richard <em>et ux.</em></parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b657-11\">A final decree in an equity cause cannot be amended on motion or petition, after tlie expiration of a year from the entry of the decree.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b657-12\"><em>Query, </em>whether a bill of review would lie.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-13\">Bill in Equity for an injunction. On motion to amend a final decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-14\">A decree was entered granting relief, December 10, 1892. The complainant filed a motion in the cause to amend the decree June 4, 1894.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b657-15\"><em>June </em>16, 1894.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AbO\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AL91\">More than one year having elapsed since the entry of the decree which the complainant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>seeks to amend, it is too late to obtain the alteration of it on simple motion or petition, or even on a petition for rehearing. <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>New England Screw Co., </em>3 R. I. 9; <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>11 R. I. 386; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Peckham, </em>ib. 600, 605.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AlVU\"><em>Herbert B. Wood &amp; William Fitch, </em>for complainant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AUf\"><em>Edward D. Bassett, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"A83v\">The only means by which the decree can be amended would seem to be a bill of review, if, indeed, a bill of review, under our practice, can be filed more than a year after the entry of final decree. See cases cited above. 2 Daniel\u2019s Ch. Pl. &amp; Pr. * 1576.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The case-of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hall, 7 </em>Paige, 382, is not in point, since in that case the decree had been kept open by the defendant\u2019s appeal and so had not passed out of the control of the court, the parties being still in court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
