Armstrong who, on the twenty-eighth day of February, 1894, made an assignment for the benefit of his creditor\u2019s to his eldest son, John R. Armstrong, and that a short time prior to the date of such assignment Charles H. Armstrong conveyed a considerable portion of his real estate to said John R. Armstrong for the purpose of defrauding his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-4\">Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 237, \u00a7 3, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">\u201cSec. 3. The supreme court shall, upon the petition of any creditor interested in any deed of assignment made by a debtor for the benefit of creditors, upon due. notice and for cause shown, remove any assignee named in such deed of assignment, who shall neglect to render an inventory and schedule as required by this chapter or shall neglect to give a bond as required by said court, and may, upon the petition of a majority in interest of the creditors interested in any such deed of assignment, upon due notice and for cause shown remove the assignee named therein from his office and trust. \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AIIz\"><em>George J.

Armstrong alleged to he fraudulent, is an unsuitable person for the office of assignee, since his interest as a grantee is necessarily. in conflict with his duty as assignee. The prayer of the petition for his removal is, therefore, granted. The petition will stand for further hearing on the question of the appointment of a receiver, or assignee, in the place of the said John R. Armstrong.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
