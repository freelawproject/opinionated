The subsequent partition deed, dated October 6, 1883, between Bessie O. Bowen, William A. Tucker and Holden B. Bowen trustees, and the said Isabella Chambers Margaret Chambers trustee, was duly executed by Isabella, though from the form in which the certificate of acknowledgment is written it is impossible to determine whether it was acknowledged by her or by Margaret Chambers, trustee, who also executed the deed. This being the condition of the title as disclosed by the record, all that is necessary to cure the defect is the acknowledgment or reacknowledgment of the partition deed by said Isabella. This can be obtained by the complainants, if she refuses to make it voluntarily, under the provisions of Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 173, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We see no occasion, therefore, for the relief prayed by the bill.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqpZ\"><em>James Tillinghast, Frank 8. </em>Arnold, <em>Edioin D.
