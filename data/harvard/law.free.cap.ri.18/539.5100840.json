The only witnesses were the plaintiff\u2019s daughter who swore positively and circumslantially -to the defendant\u2019s guilt, and the defendant himself who swore as positively and circumstantially in denial of the charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-8\"><em>Held, </em>that the court would not disturb the verdict on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain it, the case being peculiarly one for the determination of the jury who, having the witnesses before them, may have seen that in their conduct and appearance which entitled the plaintiff\u2019s witness to belief rather than the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-9\">When, in a civil suit, a criminal offence is charged in the pleadings, the offence need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

The plaintiff\u2019s daughter testifies with much positiveness as to her seduction by the defendant, giving the time and place of the occurrence, together with the unfortunate condition in which she subsequently found herself; that she personally charged the defendant with being the father of her child, and asked him to assist her, which he did by giving her ten dollars and promising her more, together with other facts and circumstances tending to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s allegation. The defendant as positively denies the charge made against him, together with the said alleged assistance and promise of assistance, and produces evidence tending to sustain his denial. The case is therefore, one which it is peculiarly the province of the jury to determine. The witnesses were before them, and, as said by this court in <em>Kelley </em>v. Brennan, ante, <em>p. </em>41, \u201cThere may have been that in the conduct or appearance of the plaintiff, or of the defendant, which in their judgment entitled her to belief leather than the defendant.\u201d' And while there are circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>stances connected with the case which might raise a probability that another man than the defendant was the guilty party, yet they are not. so strong and conclusive as to warrant the court in interfering with the verdict.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ae_\"><em>George J. West, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOP\"><em>Willarcl B. Tanner &amp; Edward L. Gannon, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b580-3\">The point made by defendant\u2019s counsel that, c c When in a civil suit a criminal offence is charged in the pleading, such offence must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d is not in accordance with the uniform practice in this State, <em>(State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>14 R. I. 165,) nor with the well settled rule of evidence generally. Eor while there are cases which uphold this doctrine, (see <em>Germania Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Klewer, </em>129 Ill. 599, and cases cited,) yet the overwhelming weight of the authorities is to the effect that all issues of fact in a civil case are to be determined in accordance with the preponderance. or weight of the evidence. 3 G-reenleaf on Evidence, 13tlred. \u00a7 29; 1 Rice on Evidence, <em>\u00a789 a; </em>2 lb. \u00a7 321 <em>i.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b580-4\">Matteson, O.
