The language is so plain that it is difficult to understand how there can arise any doubt- as to its construction. It is, however suggested in argument that the jurisdiction is to be limited to actions for the recovery of possession of tenements or estates let. In support of this view, <em>Champlin </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>12 R. I. 123, is cited. In that case the court construed a paragraph of Gen. Stat. R. I. cap. 184, \u00a7 2, conferring jurisdiction on Special Courts of Common Pleas. The paragraph was as follows: \u201cOf all actions brought for the possession of tenements or estates let, against tenants and others who have broken the terms or conditions of the lease or agreement under which they hold, or who hold or occupy tenements or estates by wrongful entry or detainer, or as tenants at will or by sufferance.\u201d The court held that grammatically the first clause of the paragraph qualified ail that followed it, and, hence, that the jurisdiction was confined to actions for the possession of tenements or estates let. That paragraph was very different from the clause of the statute under consideration. In the former, the words which conferred the. jurisdiction were the first twelve words, to wit: \u2018 \u2018 Of all actions brought for the possession of tenements or estates let,\u201d the remainder of the paragraph simply enumerating the classes of persons against whom such actions could be maintained. The jurisdiction is expressly limited to actions for the possession of tenements or estates <em>let. </em>In chapter 8, \u00a7 25, of the Judiciary Act, on the other hand, there is added to the clause conferring jurisdiction over ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tions for the possession of tenements or estates l'et, the further clause, \u201cor held at will or by sufferance.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ArqO\"><em>Dennis J.
