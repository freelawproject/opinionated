Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 237, \u00a7 13, provides for a petition in equity and \u00a3\u00a3 notice to the debtor.\u201d The citation was served by leaving a copy at the last and usual place of abode of the debtor, who it appears had absconded. In the absence of any rule or statutory provision for service of citations, we think that the notice required is personal notice and consequently that there has been no \u00a3 \u00a3 notice to. the debtor \u201d in this case.-</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">Another citation was then issued of which personal service was made upon the debtor, and the matter again came before the court.</p>\n<author id=\"Ayr\">Matteson, O. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApX\">This is a petition under Pub. Stat. R. I. cap. 237, \u00a7 13, for the appointment of a receiver of the estate of William C. Ashkettle, an insolvent debtor. The testimony shows that the respondent\u2019s indebtedness, which is unsecured, amounts to $2,598, of which there is due to the petitioners $551. The residue of the respondent\u2019s indebtedness, which is unsecured, is a judgment for $2,047 in favor of Alexander Grant, who is also the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>holder of a note of the respondent for $6,000, secured by mortgage of a house and lot. The house and lot cost about $0,500. The writ in the suit in which the judgment in favor of Grant was obtained was served by attachment of the mortgaged house and lot. The purpose of the present proceeding is to vacate this attachment, to the end that the debtor\u2019s property, outside of the mortgage, may be equally distributed among his creditors. The statute requires, in order to maintain the petition, that it shall be filed by one or more of the creditors of the debtor, holding not less than one fifth of the debts in amount. The aggregate of the debts held by the petitioners exceeds one fifth of the unsecured indebtedness of the debtor, but is much less than one fifth of his indebtedness if the mortgage note for $6,000 is to be reckoned. The question presented is, whether the $6,000 is tobe reckoned as a part of the respondent\u2019s indebtedness in computing\u2019 the one fifth of the debts necessary to sustain the petition. We are of the opinion that the $6,000 must be reckoned. The statute does not except from the creditors entitled to file a petition a creditor whose debt is secured. We cannot hold that the claim of such a creditor is to be excluded from the computation without legislating into the statute an exception which it does not contain. To the extent that a creditor holds security for his claim it is virtually paid. We can see no reason why, to that extent, he should be permitted to' interfere with, or control the interests of other creditors whose claims are unsecured. On the contrary, we think the interests of justice and the policy of the statute would be best subserved if a creditor whose claim is secured were excluded from those entitled to maintain the petition. But we do not feel warranted by these considerations in interpolating into the statute a provision to that effect.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AME\"><em>Herbert B. Wood &amp; William Fitch, </em>for petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad_t\"><em>Joseph C. Fly &amp; Herbert Almy, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">It follows, as the $6,000 is to be reckoned and as the claims held by the petitioners do not amount to one fifth of the respondent\u2019s indebtedness, that the petition must be denied and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
