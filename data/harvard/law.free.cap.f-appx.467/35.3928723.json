In March of 2009, pursuant to a plea agreement, Schwamborn pled guilty to one count of securities fraud stemming from his involvement in a scheme to manipulate the stock price of a publicly-traded company he controlled called World Cyberlinks. On April 26, 2010, the district court sentenced Schwamborn principally to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered him to pay a forfeiture in the amount of $2,100,000. The district court\u2019s judgment specified that restitution was \u201c[t]o be determined.\u201d App. 119. On January 28, 2011, following various proceedings regarding the restitution award, the district court entered an order amending the April 26, 2010 judgment and requiring Schwamborn to pay restitution in the amount of $413,450.08. On appeal, Schwamborn argues that the restitution order should be vacated because it was \u201cbased on insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>cient proof of loss causation and loss estimates, lacked any findings of fact relative to an appropriate payment schedule, and was the product of unduly prolonged sentencing proceedings.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 3. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d), codified largely at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A and 3664, \u201crequires sentencing courts to order restitution for certain crimes, such as \u2018an offense against property under this title ... including any offense committed by fraud or deceit,\u2019 and where an identifiable victim has suffered pecuniary loss.\u201d <em>United States v. Marino, </em>654 F.3d 310, 316 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l); \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)). \u201cThe goal of restitution, in the criminal context, is to restore a victim, to the extent money can do so, to the position he occupied before sustaining injury.\u201d <em>United States v. Battista, </em>575 F.3d 226, 229 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The statute defines \u201cvictim\u201d broadly as any \u201cperson directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Section 3664, which specifies the procedures to be followed in ordering restitution, places responsibility for identifying the victims of the defendant\u2019s offense on the government. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(e); <em>United States v. Reifler, </em>446 F.3d 65, 121 (2d Cir.2006). The sentencing court is required to \u201corder the probation officer to obtain and include in its presentence report, or in a separate report, as the court may direct, information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in fashioning a restitution order,\u201d including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cto the extent practicable, a complete accounting of the losses to each victim.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(a). The probation officer, in turn, is to obtain victim information from the government\u2019s attorney, who is required to \u201cconsult[ ], to the extent practicable, with all identified victims\u201d and \u201cpromptly provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(d)(1). If victim losses cannot be ascertained by ten days before sentencing, \u201cthe attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(d)(5). The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating his financial resources and the financial needs of his dependents, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3664(e), and Section 3664(f) provides that \u201cthe court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). We review a district court\u2019s order of restitution under the MVRA for abuse of discretion. <em>Marino, </em>654 F.3d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">We turn first to Schwamborn\u2019s argument that the restitution order should be vacated because it was the product of unduly prolonged sentencing proceedings. This contention is unavailing. While the MVRA provides that \u201cthe court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5), the Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe statute seeks primarily to assure that victims of a crime receive full restitution,\u201d and not \u201cto provide defendants with certainty as to the amount of their liability.\u201d <em>Dolan v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2533, 2539-40, 177 L.Ed.2d 108 (2010). Accordingly, \u201ca sentencing court that misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless retains the power to order restitution ... where ... the sentencing court made clear prior to the deadline\u2019s expiration that it would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 2587; <em>see also United States v. Pickett, </em>612 F.3d 147, 149 (2d Cir.2010) (per curiam) (relying on <em>Dolan </em>to conclude that the district court acted within its authority in ordering restitution ninety-eight days after the sentencing hearing). In this ease, the district court\u2019s April 26, 2010 judgment specified that restitution was \u201c[t]o be determined,\u201d thereby making clear that it would order restitution and leaving open only the amount. App. 119. Additionally, Schwamborn has failed to show that he was prejudiced by any delay. <em>See United States v. Catoggio, </em>326 F.3d 323, 330 (2d Cir.2003). Thus, the length of time between Schwamborn\u2019s sentencing and the entry of the district court\u2019s restitution order does not alone warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Schwamborn\u2019s remaining arguments, however, are more compelling, particularly those concerning the quantification of loss in this case. On July 23, 2010, the government submitted a letter to the district court requesting $1,278,350.11 in restitution. Finding the government\u2019s evidence supporting this request to be inadequate, the court requested affidavits of loss from the victims. The government thereafter submitted affidavits from thirty victims, and, on the basis of those affidavits, reduced its original restitution request to $415,450.08. Twenty of the affidavits submitted by the government lacked any information regarding the dates on which the securities were purchased and sold, and at what prices. Those reporting the five largest losses, in the amounts of $118,000, $53,000, $52,555, $44,000, and $38,541.69, included no dates of purchase or sale. One affidavit claiming a $2,000 loss indicated that the victim could search for documentation verifying the loss, and, as a result, the court found the affidavit was based on a rough estimate and excluded it from the calculation of loss. The district court accepted the remaining affidavits, however, and ordered restitution in the amount of $413,450.08. On Schwamborn\u2019s request, the court ordered that he not be required to pay any restitution until 30 days after his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We review an order of restitution deferentially because determining the appropriate amount of restitution \u201crequires a delicate balancing of diverse, sometimes incomparable factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Ismail, </em>219 F.3d 76, 78 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>788 F.2d 900, 902 (2d Cir.1986)). Nonetheless, the MVRA requires the district court to order restitution \u201cin the <em>full amount </em>of each victim\u2019s losses.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we held in <em>United States v. Reifler </em>that the district court\u2019s acceptance of the government\u2019s rough estimate of the restitution amount \u201cplainly contravene[d] the MVRA\u2019s requirement that any restitution order compensate the victims in \u2018full.\u2019 \u201d 446 F.3d at 133; <em>see also Catoggio, </em>326 F.3d at 329 (noting that the MVRA requires courts to order restitution in the full amount of the victims\u2019 losses, and disapproving of the district court\u2019s failure to determine precisely the \u201cactual losses for restitution purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">In this case, the government\u2019s decision to abandon its original request for $1,278,350.11 and to instead request only $413,450.08 suggests that this latter amount does not represent the \u201cactual loss\u201d to the victims as required by the statute. Moreover, it is impossible to determine from the affidavits submitted by the government whether the losses alleged represent anything more than rough estimates, or whether the individuals claiming to be victims of the scheme actually received a return on their investment but based their estimates of loss on the idea that they would have received a greater return by investing in other stock, the value of which was not based on fraud. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>The government\u2019s proof of the restitution amount is therefore insufficient under <em>Reifler, </em>and we must vacate the restitution award for this reason alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On remand, we direct the district court to consider in the first instance whether \u201cdetermining complex issues of fact related to the cause or amount of the victim\u2019s losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(3)(B); <em>see also United States v. Amato, </em>540 F.3d 153, 162 (2d Cir.2008). Although we suggested in <em>Reifler </em>that issues concerning loss causation in the context of a \u201cpump and dump\u201d securities fraud scheme, like the one at issue here, may indeed prove unduly complicated, 446 F.3d at 135, we observe that there are important distinctions between this case and <em>Reifler. </em>First, in <em>Reifler, </em>the government never specifically alleged that the stock had no value aside from the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct. Indeed, one of the causation issues in <em>Reifler </em>was that the government included in its loss exhibits the accounts of individuals who purchased stock before the conspiracy began. <em>See id. </em>at 130. In this case, on the other hand, the government alleges that World Cyberlinks stock had no inherent value independent of Schwamborn\u2019s fraud. Gov\u2019t Br. 6. Second, the government here, unlike in <em>Reifler, </em>specifically alleges that Schwamborn\u2019s conduct had an inflationary effect on the market price of World Cyberlinks stock. Gov\u2019t Br. 5. Thus, although there are multiple victims whose trading histories may reflect losses as well as partially offsetting gains, we discern no complex causation or loss quantification issues that would prevent the district court from fashioning a revised order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">On remand, we further instruct the district court to consider any argument Schwamborn may wish to raise with respect to the amount of restitution and an appropriate payment schedule, and, \u201c[i]n view of the time that has elapsed since [Schwamborn\u2019s] initial sentencing, ... direct the district court to schedule a sentencing hearing on restitution forthwith.\u201d <em>Catoggio, </em>326 F.3d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We have considered the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated herein, the restitution order of the district court is VACATED and the case REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
