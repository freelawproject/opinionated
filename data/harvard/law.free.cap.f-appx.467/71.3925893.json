Rivera, </em>662 F.3d 166, 168 (2d Cir.2011) (discussing retroactivity of crack cocaine Guidelines amendments). We review sentencing reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Borden, </em>564 F.3d 100, 101 (2d Cir.2009). We assume familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Vargas\u2019s only contention on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on whether Vargas\u2019s prison term should be reduced below 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)\u2019s 120-month mandatory minimum because of his own and his family\u2019s alleged cooperation with the government before and after his original sentencing. This contention is meritless. Vargas moved for a reduced sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which does not authorize \u201cplenary resentencing proceedings.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>accord United States v. Rivera, </em>662 F.3d 166, 171 (2d Cir.2011). Rather, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, a district court is not authorized to \u201creduce [the defendant\u2019s] term of imprisonment below the minimum of [the] amended sentencing range except to the extent the original term of imprisonment was below the range then applicable.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2687.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Here, Vargas\u2019s original 121-month term of imprisonment was undisputedly within the then-applicable Guidelines range. Thus, the district court had no authority in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) resentencing to impose a revised sentence below that provided for in the amended Guidelines. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2687. The district court found that Vargas\u2019s post-amendment Guidelines range provided for a 97- to 121-month prison term, and Vargas does not dispute that finding. In light of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2), these amended Guidelines did not permit the district court to impose a sentence lower than the 120-month mandatory minimum prison term provided for in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). See <em>United States v. Williams, </em>551 F.3d 182, 185-86 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
