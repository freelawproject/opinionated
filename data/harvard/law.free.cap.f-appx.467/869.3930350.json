Barbati argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-25\">Barbati is a serial hoaxer. He pleaded guilty to filing 20 false federal tax returns seeking refunds of more than $100,000 for prostitutes that he allegedly employed in an internet escort service; misrepresenting himself as an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard in making a false threat about the space shuttle 45 minutes before its scheduled launch; and reporting falsely to the Coast Guard that he was on a yacht that was \u201ctaking on water\u201d off the coast of an island. Barbati\u2019s latter two crimes cost the Coast Guard more than $110,000, but that amount does not account for the cost and inconvenience created by Barbati\u2019s 584 other false reports to the Coast Guard, including a bomb threat, or his telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>calls to emergency operators in which he reported plans to \u201ckill his baby\u201d and \u201crecreate the Virginia Tech massacre.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. The district court considered Barbati\u2019s request for a sentence at the low end of the advisory range because of childhood abuse and his cooperation with the government. But the district court reasonably determined that an upward variance to 48 months of imprisonment was required because a sentence within Barbati\u2019s advisory guideline range of 24 to 30 months \u201cwould not provide just punishment or an adequate deterrence\u201d given the amount of time, money, and manpower expended to resolve his false reports. Barbati argues that the district court failed to account for his cooperation or the prompt disposition of his charges, but Barbati received a three-level reduction of his adjusted offense level for accepting responsibility and providing assistance to law enforcement. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1 (Nov.2010). Barbati\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Barbati\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
