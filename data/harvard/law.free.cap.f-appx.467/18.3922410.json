Munford challenges his state conviction based on certain evidence he alleges to be the fruit of an unlawful arrest and the improper introduction of a nontestifying co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal, and we discuss these only where necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Recognizing that his Fourth Amendment claim must be analyzed under <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), Munford argues that an \u201cunconscionable breakdown\u201d occurred, <em>Capellan v. Riley, </em>975 F.2d 67, 70 (2d Cir.1992), in New York\u2019s trial and appellate courts that deprived him of an \u201can opportunity for full and fair litigation of [his] Fourth Amendment\u201d claims. <em>Stone, </em>428 U.S. at 482, 96 S.Ct. 3037. Specifically, he argues that the trial court irrationally refused to view a surveillance video and arrest photo or allow cross-examination of Detective Joseph Monahan about the quality of the video. The Appellate Division, he claims, further compounded the error by affirming the probable cause determination on the basis of a factual theory the prosecution advanced for the first time on appeal. Munford\u2019s arguments are rejected. These allegations cannot constitute an \u201cunconscionable breakdown\u201d in New York\u2019s procedures because, under New York law, a trial court acts within its discretion in deciding not to view a surveillance video when the record before it was more than adequate to establish probable cause. <em>See People v. Clarkson, </em>292 A.D.2d 207, 208, 738 N.Y.S.2d 570 (1st Dep\u2019t 2002); <em>see also People v. Sioba, </em>187 A.D.2d 317, 317, 589 N.Y.S.2d 164 (1st Dep\u2019t 1992). Here, probable cause was adequately demonstrated by the other information available to Detective Monahan. This included an informant\u2019s identification of Munford, Reberto Grant, and others as the robbers and his statement that he had held the gun taken during the robbery; another tipster\u2019s claim that Grant was on parole, confessed to the robbery, and showed him the booty of the heist; and finally the independent police investigation which revealed that Grant and Munford were known associates who had been arrested for a similar robbery together six years earlier. There is no basis to hold that Munford\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not adequately protected. The judgement of the district court in this regard is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The parties are in agreement that the admission of Grant\u2019s certificate of conviction violated Munford\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. In analyzing this issue, however, we may \u201coverturn a state conviction only when the constitutional violation \u2018had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wood v. Ercole, </em>644 F.3d 83, 94 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)). \u201cIn assessing wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>er the erroneous admission of evidence had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s decision, we consider the importance of the ... wrongly admitted evidence, and the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. The importance of wrongly admitted evidence is determined by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct with respect to the ... evidence, whether the evidence bore on an issue plainly critical to the jury\u2019s decision, and whether it was material to the establishment of the critical fact, or whether it was instead corroborated and cumulatively\u201d <em>Wood, </em>644 F.3d at 94 (internal citations, brackets, and quotation marks omitted). Evidence is not cumulative or corroborative if the \u201cerroneously admitted evidence \u2018filled ... a missing link\u2019 in the government\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98 (quoting <em>Zappulla v. New York, </em>391 F.3d 462, 472 (2d Cir. 2004)). \u201cThe strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, absent the erroneously admitted evidence, is probably the single most critical factor in determining whether the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">The first factor, the strength of the prosecutor\u2019s case, favors the government. Not counting the improperly admitted evidence, the prosecutor introduced more than sufficient evidence to prove Mun-ford\u2019s participation in the charged robbery. The case included an eye witness, Jack Prunty, who identified Munford and Grant as the men he encountered the morning of the robbery. Both Prunty and another witness identified the clothing found in Munford\u2019s apartment as the clothing worn by one of the assailants. The prosecution played the surveillance video to let the jury determine if the clothing found in Munford\u2019s apartment matched that worn by one the robbers. The prosecution\u2019s case consisted of additional circumstantial evidence, including cell phone records from which the jury could infer that Munford communicated with Grant in close proximity to the jewelry store minutes before the robbery and evidence of their past commission of a similar robbery in 1998. None of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses were impeached in any meaningful way. We have no reason to believe, therefore, that the jury would not credit their testimony. Having conducted an independent review of the record, we cannot say that the prosecution\u2019s case was \u201cweak\u201d without the improperly admitted evidence. <em>See Zappulla, </em>391 F.3d at 468-69 (concluding that a case is weak in light of contradictory and conflicting testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Turning to the importance of the evidence, we have little difficulty concluding that Grant\u2019s guilt, admitted to be \u201chighly probative\u201d of Munford\u2019s identity, bore on an issue critical to the jury\u2019s determination of Munford\u2019s guilt. We also note that the prosecutor did not shy away from using Grant\u2019s guilt to bolster other evidence. We hold, however, that Grant\u2019s conviction did not provide the \u201cmissing link\u201d to a critical fact \u2014 Munford\u2019s identity; rather it was cumulative or corroborative. <em>See Wood, </em>644 F.3d at 98. The security guard, Prunty, had already identified both Grant and Munford as among the men who robbed the jewelry store. As noted, the prosecution also introduced evidence from cell phone records linking the men to the robbery and evidence that they had committed a similar-styled robbery together. Evidence of Grant\u2019s conviction based on his guilty plea served at most to corroborate the evidence that proved Munford\u2019s identity as one of the perpetrators of the robbery. Given the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, we do not find ourselves \u201cin virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error,\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 435, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995), of introducing Grant\u2019s conviction for the robbery at issue. We conclude, therefore, that the error did not have the substantial and injurious effect or influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ence on the jury\u2019s verdict that would require us to vacate Munford\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We have considered Munford\u2019s remaining argument and find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
