An administrative law judge disbelieved Smith\u2019s description of the severity of her condition and denied her claim. The district court upheld that determination, and Smith appeals. Because the ALJ failed to explain why she did not believe Smith had to elevate her leg to reduce swelling or why she found Smith not credible, we reverse the judgment and remand the case with instructions that it be returned to the agency for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-20\">Smith, 57, suffers from a chronic arteriovenous malformation (\u201cAVM\u201d) in her right leg, rheumatoid arthritis, and carpel tunnel syndrome. AVMs are defects in the circulatory system made up of \u201csnarled tangles of arteries and veins.\u201d National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, <em>Arteriovenous Malformations and Other Vascular Lesions of the Central Nervous System Fact Sheet, </em>http://www. ninds.nih.gov/disorders/avms/detaiLavms. htm# 176723052 (last updated Feb. 28, 2012); <em>see also </em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary 1147 (28th ed.2006). Smith\u2019s leg problems dated back to 1979, though she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>reported that they worsened substantially in 2008 following a 16-hour car ride to Georgia. In May 2008 she spent three days in the hospital and was advised to elevate her leg when sitting to relieve swelling. Her leg swelling decreased over the next two weeks, according to a progress note, but there was still \u201cmoderate\u201d edema and Smith tried to elevate her leg \u201cwhen possible.\u201d A month after her hospital visit, Smith\u2019s condition had again improved, but her edema was still described as \u201csevere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In August 2008 Smith applied for disability benefits, contending that she had been disabled since December 31, 2007, her last day of work as a water tester at the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. In a report filled out shortly after her application, she wrote that she tried to keep her feet up \u201cas much as possible to keep swelling down.\u201d Her husband Marc wrote that she \u201cspends most of the day w/leg elevated to keep swelling and pain under control\u201d and that her AVM \u201cnecessitates constant elevation of the leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Dr. Mahesh Shah, a state-agency physician, examined Smith in September 2008 in connection with her application for benefits. He noted that she had \u201cmild discomfort in the right lower leg\u201d but that she could move around his office \u201cwithout problems.\u201d Regarding Smith\u2019s AVM, he concluded that she was \u201calmost asymptomatic.\u201d Around the same time, a different state-agency doctor prepared a Physical Residual Functional Capacity Assessment form and concluded \u2014 based on a review of Smith\u2019s medical records \u2014 that she could perform light work, meaning, among other things, that she could stand and/or walk for about six hours in an eight-hour workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">After Smith\u2019s application was denied initially and on reconsideration, she had a hearing in front of an ALJ, where she appeared pro se. She testified that her leg swelled \u201cevery day, all day\u201d and that she could walk only \u201ca couple of blocks\u201d before her leg started hurting. She told the ALJ that she elevated her leg as often as possible and could sit through an hour-long television show only if her leg was elevated.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">A vocational expert then testified. Responding to a hypothetical posed by the ALJ, the VE reported that a person with Smith\u2019s age, education, and work experience who was limited to the exertional requirements of light work could not perform Smith\u2019s previous position as a water tester. But such a person, the VE told the ALJ, could work as a cashier or information clerk or in \u201cassembly type of positions,\u201d all of which existed in significant number in the Chicago area. When asked if her analysis would change if the claimant needed to sit or stand at will, the VE responded that the cashier jobs would be eliminated, but that there would still be information-clerk and assembly positions. She added that the claimant could perform hand-packaging jobs, about 1,500 of which existed locally.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">In rejecting Smith\u2019s claim of disability, the ALJ concluded that her various ailments did not preclude -her from doing light work, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b), so long as she had a job where she could sit or stand at will. Navigating through the required five-step analysis, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4), the ALJ determined that Smith had not worked since her alleged onset date (step one); her rheumatoid arthritis constituted a severe impairment (step two); her impairments did not meet or equal a listed impairment (step three); she had a residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform light work so long as she could sit or stand at will, though she could no longer be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>water tester (step four); but, based on the VE\u2019s response to the second hypothetical, there existed jobs in the economy that she could do given her RFC (step five). In evaluating Smith\u2019s RFC, the ALJ wrote that she found Smith\u2019s testimony regarding the extent of her symptoms \u201cnot credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the above residual functional capacity assessment.\u201d The ALJ then listed some of the medical evidence, including the results of Dr. Shah\u2019s evaluation and the subsequent RFC assessment prepared by the non-examining state-agency doctor, and followed with a one-sentence paragraph in which she concluded that Smith did not need to elevate her leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In the district court, Smith, by now represented by counsel, argued that the ALJ had not addressed adequately her need to elevate her right leg. The magistrate judge, presiding with the parties\u2019 consent, rejected that argument as \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d and added that \u201cthe record lacks evidence that Claimant needed to continue elevating the leg\u201d after the hospital stay. The magistrate judge also rejected a challenge to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination, acknowledging that the ALJ\u2019s discussion was \u201cnot perfect\u201d but concluding that it nevertheless was \u201cclear enough to permit meaningful review\u201d and not patently wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">On appeal Smith challenges four aspects of the ALJ\u2019s decision, which we review as the final word of the Commissioner because the Appeals Council declined review. <em>Scott v. Astrue, </em>647 F.3d 734, 739 (7th Cir.2011). We limit our review to the reasoning set forth in the ALJ\u2019s written decision, <em>see Jelinek v. Astrue, </em>662 F.3d 805, 811 (7th Cir.2011), assessing whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>O\u2019Connor-Spinner v. Astrue, </em>627 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir.2010). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Skinner v. Astrue, </em>478 F.3d 836, 841 (7th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Richardson, </em>402 U.S. at 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">First we address Smith\u2019s two arguments attacking the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination. Smith contends that in evaluating her RFC, the ALJ failed to explain both' why she rejected Smith\u2019s assertion that she must elevate her leg and why she found Smith not credible. Regarding leg elevation, Smith notes that the ALJ made only a cursory comment on this point: \u201cThe medical records do not support the limitations alleged by the claimant that she is medically required to elevate her legs.\u201d The ALJ failed to link any of the evidence to her conclusion regarding leg elevation, Smith asserts, and she accuses the Commissioner of trying to salvage the ALJ\u2019s conclusion through \u201cpost hoc rationalization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Given the perfunctory nature of the ALJ\u2019s discussion of leg elevation, we agree with Smith. An ALJ must explain her reasoning, building a so-called \u201clogical bridge\u201d that connects the evidence and her decision. <em>See Scott, </em>647 F.3d at 740; <em>O\u2019Connor-Spinner, </em>627 F.3d at 618; <em>Stewart v. Astrue, </em>561 F.3d 679, 684 (7th Cir. 2009); <em>Craft v. Astrue, </em>539 F.3d 668, 677-78 (7th Cir.2008). The ALJ here did cite to some medical records (mostly from Dr. Shah\u2019s review) but did not explain <em>how </em>the records undermined Smith\u2019s testimony that she needed to elevate her leg. Contrary to the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion, there was evidence in the record that Smith had to elevate her leg, including her hearing testimony; the reports she and her husband filled out for the agency shortly after she filed her application; records from her hospital stay, which included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>instructions to keep the leg elevated after discharge; and records from the two follow-up appointments, at which the edema in her leg was characterized as either \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201csevere.\u201d The ALJ did not explain why she disregarded this evidence and instead credited Dr. Shah\u2019s evaluation. This error cannot be deemed harmless because we cannot say \u201cwith great confidence\u201d that the result would be the same on remand. <em>See McKinzey v. Astrue, </em>641 F.3d 884, 892 (7th Cir.2011); <em>Spiva v. </em>As<em>true, </em>628 F.3d 346, 353 (7th Cir.2010). The ALJ never considered Smith\u2019s RFC in light of her alleged need to elevate her leg or asked the YE how a leg-elevation requirement would affect Smith\u2019s job prospects.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Commissioner tries to bolster the ALJ\u2019s limited analysis by arguing that Smith\u2019s continued need for leg elevation is not well documented by her treating doctors. The Commissioner notes that Smith sought only minimal care after her three-day hospitalization in 2008, that her treating doctor did not mention leg elevation during the second follow-up visit, and that Dr. Shah also said nothing about leg elevation in his report. But whatever the strength of this evidence, the ALJ did not rely on any of it in reaching her conclusion, and under <em>SEC v. Chenery Corporation, </em>318 U.S. 80, 87-88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), \u201cwhat matters are the reasons articulated <em>by the ALJ,\u201d </em>not the rationale advanced by the government on appeal. <em>Jelinek, </em>662 F.3d at 812 (emphasis in original); <em>see also Parker v. Astrue, </em>597 F.3d 920, 922 (7th Cir.2010). And while the record on this issue is relatively sparse, to the extent the ALJ needed a fuller record to make her decision, she had a duty to develop it, particularly because Smith appeared pro se. <em>See Nelms v. Astrue, </em>553 F.3d 1093, 1098 (7th Cir.2009); <em>Nelson v. Apfel, </em>131 F.3d 1228, 1235 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Smith argues further that the ALJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is similarly cursory and unsupported. She urges that the ALJ failed to explain how the record evidence supported the decision to discredit her statements about the debilitating effects of her symptoms. And Smith contests the ALJ\u2019s use of the boilerplate statement that \u201cthe claimant\u2019s statements concerning the intensity persistence and limiting effects\u201d of her symptoms \u201care not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the above residual functional capacity assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Smith\u2019s argument on this point is well-taken. We have derided repeatedly this sort of boilerplate as meaningless and unhelpful to a reviewing court. <em>See Bjomson v. Astrue, </em>671 F.3d 640, 644-45 (7th Cir.2012); <em>Martinez v. Astrue, </em>630 F.3d 693, 696 (7th Cir.2011); <em>Parker, </em>597 F.3d at 921-22. This boilerplate is especially unhelpful because it \u201cimplies that the ability to work is determined first and is then used to determine the cl\u00e1imant\u2019s credibility. That gets things backwards.\u201d <em>Bjomson, </em>671 F.3d at 645-46. Often, as here, the assessment of the claimant\u2019s ability to work depends at least in part on the credibility of the claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the intensity of her symptoms. <em>See id. </em>And while the subsequent paragraphs of the ALJ\u2019s opinion tick off certain medical evidence, this account does not specify how the evidence undermines Smith\u2019s credibility or which statements the ALJ found not credible. Some of the evidence cited, such as Dr. Shah\u2019s conclusion that Smith was \u201calmost asymptomatic,\u201d appear to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion; other cited evidence, such as Smith\u2019s height (64 inches) and weight (179 pounds), bears no clear relevance to the adverse credibility determination. Because the ALJ did not support her credibility determination with refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ence to specific record evidence, we cannot assess whether the credibility determination was \u201cpatently <em>wrong.\u201d See Schaaf v. Astrue, </em>602 F.3d 869, 875 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In light of the foregoing discussion, we need not address Smith\u2019s other two arguments, which assail the ALJ\u2019s step-five conclusion regarding the availability of jobs she could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED with instructions that it be returned to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
