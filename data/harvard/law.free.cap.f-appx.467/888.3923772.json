Shinseki, </em>2011 WL 3863292 (Vet.App.2011). He argues that the Department of Veterans Affairs incorrectly denied him an increased rate of special monthly compensation. As this court has already explained \u2014 in an appeal brought by Mr. El Malik \u2014 \u201c[t]he remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.\u201d <em>El Malik v. Shinseki, </em>464 Fed.Appx. 889, 892 (Fed.Cir. 2012); <em>see also Lamb v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1378, 1382 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201cTo obtain mandamus, the petitioner must show (1) that he has a \u2018clear and indisputable right\u2019 to the writ and (2) that he has no alternative way to obtain the relief sought.\u201d (citation omitted)). We have also explained \u2014 indeed in yet another appeal brought by Mr. El Malik \u2014 that \u201c[m]andamus is not a substitute for proper appeal and must be denied when the remedy sought is available after entry of a final ... decision....\u201d <em>In re El Malik, </em>No.2010-M937, 2010 WL 2076990, at *1 (Fed.Cir. May 19, 2010); <em>see also In re El Malik, </em>322 Fed.Appx. 976 (Fed.Cir.2008) (unpublished order) (converting Mr. El Malik\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus to a regular appeal). Here, Mr. El Malik does not offer any persuasive explanation for why his grievance cannot be addressed through a regular appeal. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Veterans Court denying Mr. El Malik\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
