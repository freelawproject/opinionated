GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b832-19\">Paul Tilley filed this suit against a private attorney, a municipal judge, and his clerk. He alleges the defendants intimidated him during a court appearance. In a thorough four-page order, the district court granted Mr. Tilley\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), which governs proceedings <em>in forma pauperis </em>and provides that \u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action ... fails to state a claim on which relief may be grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>ed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Mr. Tilley appeals this decision. After careful review of his pleadings, we discern no error and so affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1259 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe generally review a district court\u2019s dismissal for frivolousness under \u00a7 1915 for abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
