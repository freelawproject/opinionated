We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Milstein v. Cooley, </em>257 F.3d 1004, 1007 (9th Cir.2001). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Thompson v. Paul, </em>547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The district court properly dismissed Mataele\u2019s claims against defendant Nunn for failure to train and supervise defendant Allen-Prescott because Nunn and Allen-Prescott worked for different state entities. <em>See Jeffers v. Gomez, </em>267 F.3d 895, 915 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (a supervisor may be liable under \u00a7 1983 only if there is a sufficient causal connection between the supervisor\u2019s wrongful conduct and the constitutional violation, or she is personally involved in the constitutional deprivation). Moreover, Mataele could not obtain any relief from Nunn in her official capacity. <em>See Bank of Lake Tahoe v. Bank of Am., </em>318 F.3d 914, 918 (9th Cir. 2003) (the Eleventh Amendment bars \u00a7 1983 actions for damages or retrospective injunctive relief against state officials in their official capacities; prospective injunctive relief is not barred, but requires a credible threat of future injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">The district court properly dismissed Mataele\u2019s federal claims against Allen-Prescott in her individual capacity on the basis of quasi-judicial immunity. <em>See Curry v. Castillo (In re Castillo), </em>297 F.3d 940, 948 (9th Cir.2002) (quasi-judicial immunity protects nonjudicial officers who \u201cperform official duties that are functionally comparable to those of judges\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The district court did not address Mataele\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against Allen-Prescott in her official capacity, but dismissal was proper as to this claim based on sovereign immunity. <em>See Bank of Lake Tahoe, </em>318 F.3d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">We do not consider other issues, including Mataele\u2019s ADA and Title VI claims against Allen-Prescott in her official capacity, because they were not specifically and distinctly raised and argued in the opening brief. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
