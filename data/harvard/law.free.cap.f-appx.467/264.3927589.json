California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ramos has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s briefs and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-22\">Our review did reveal an error that requires correction of the final judgment of conviction and sentence. Ramos was notified via indictment that his property was subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853. He signed a consent decree of forfeiture, and the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture in his case. The district court verified at sentencing that Ramos had agreed to forfeit his property. However, it did not comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(b)(4)(B)\u2019s requirement that it include the order of forfeiture in the final judgment. The court\u2019s failure to include the order of forfeiture in the final judgment \u201cmay be corrected at any time under [Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure] 36.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. P. 32.2(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-23\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motions for leave to withdraw are GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The case is REMANDED for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to correct the judgment of conviction and sentence to include the order of forfeiture.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
