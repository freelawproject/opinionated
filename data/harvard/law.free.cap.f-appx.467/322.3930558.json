The district court dismissed Smith\u2019s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), reasoning that they were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and, alternatively, the defendants were not legally liable for the claims under \u00a7 1983. For the same reasons, the district court denied Smith\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Smith is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">Smith asserts that the district court erred by failing to give written reasons for its certification decision beyond those contained in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which was adopted by the district court. This assertion is unavailing, as the district court\u2019s certification decision expressly incorporated by reference the reasoning of the report and recommendation. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 21. Smith\u2019s remaining assertions do not present any challenge to the grounds of the district court\u2019s certification decision. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Smith has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>rect. and his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Howard, v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We caution Smith that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Smith is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
