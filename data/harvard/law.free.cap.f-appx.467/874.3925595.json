He argues that, because the Guidelines are merely advisory, the district court should have reduced his sentence pursuant to Amendment 750, even though he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Amendment 750, which has been made retroactive, revised the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), and reduced the base offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.GApp. C, amends. 750, 759. Nevertheless, a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the relevant amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range due to the operation of another guideline. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.l). Thus, a retroactive amendment to \u00a7 2D 1.1 does not alter the guideline range of a defendant sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Furthermore, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable guideline policy statements in \u00a7 1B1.10 still bind a district court\u2019s discretion, regardless of the advisory nature of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">Here, the District Court did not err when it denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion requesting relief under Amendment 750 because Scott was originally sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, not under \u00a7 2D1.1. Thus, Amendment 750 has no effect on Scott\u2019s applicable guideline range, and he is ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief on that basis. Furthermore, contrary to Scott\u2019s argument, the District Court was bound by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements contained in \u00a7 1B1.10, regardless of the advisory nature of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
