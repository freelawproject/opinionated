The district court ruled that genuine issues of material fact barred summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-20\">Salazar complained that Walters lacked probable cause to arrest him for delivering drug paraphernalia. Salazar alleged that Walters arrested him after Walters ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>served various liquid fertilizers in the open bed of Salazar\u2019s truck. Walters moved for summary judgment on the ground that he had observed in the bed of Salazar\u2019s truck \u201cequipment\u201d and brands of fertilizers, like \u201cSensi Grow\u201d and \u201cSensizym,\u201d used commonly to cultivate marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The district court did not err when it ruled that Walters was not entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity. To be guilty of delivering drug paraphernalia, a person must \u201cdeliver [or] possess with intent to deliver ... drug paraphernalia, knowing, or under circumstances where [he] reasonably should know, that it will be used ... [t]o plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, ... produce, process, prepare, ... or conceal a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.147(2)(a). The record reveals genuine issues of material fact about whether Walters had arguable probable cause to arrest Salazar for transporting fertilizer \u2014 an otherwise legal substance\u2014 for an illegal purpose. In a supplemental report about the arrest, Walters stated that he had observed in the bed of Salazar\u2019s truck \u201cseveral gallons of liquid chemicals, boxes of powder chemicals, and electronic devices\u201d that were \u201cknown to [him] through [his] training and experience as items typically used for illegal hydroponic marijuana cultivation operations.\u201d One of Salazar\u2019s passengers, Roberto Marquez, testified that he had observed \u201ca couple [of] boxes\u201d of fertilizer in the bed of truck and \u201csome of them had said right on the box\u201d what they contained. Salazar testified that the bed of his truck contained only \u201cbottles and bottles\u201d of liquid fertilizer. If we accept Salazar\u2019s testimony as true, which we must, at this stage, a reasonable jury could find that Walters violated Salazar\u2019s right under the Fourth Amendment not to be arrested without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The denial of Walters\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
