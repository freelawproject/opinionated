Having carefully reviewed the district court\u2019s rulings, we find no basis for reversal. <em>See Mason v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., </em>559 F.3d 880, 884-85 (8th Cir.2009) (grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo); <em>Hartsfield v. Nichols, </em>511 F.3d 826, 831-32 (8th Cir.2008) (to prove violation of right of access to courts, prisoner must establish actual injury, i.e., hindrance of nonfrivolous and arguably meritorious underlying legal claim; affirming dismissal of claim deemed to be speculative); <em>Zar v. S.D. Bd. of Exam\u2019rs of Psychologists, </em>976 F.2d 459, 465 (8th Cir.1992) (deprivation of constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property is not due process violation and not actionable under \u00a7 1983 unless and until state fails to provide due process; no actionable due process violation occurred where adequate post-deprivation remedy existed); <em>see also Ray v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>609 F.3d 917, 922-23 (8th Cir.2010) (to obtain continuance under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, party opposing summary judgment must file affidavit affirmatively demonstrating how postponement will enable him to rebut movant\u2019s showing of absence of genuine issue of fact; court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for continuance where plaintiff failed to articulate how facts sought to be discovered were relevant to rebut defendant\u2019s showing of absence of genuine issue of fact); <em>see Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec.
