We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on both the omission of He\u2019s mother\u2019s arrest and detention from his asylum application, and on his inconsistent testimony regarding the length of her detention. <em>See id. </em>at 1045-48 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the Real ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard). The record does not compel acceptance of He\u2019s explanations. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011) (acceptance of plausible explanation not compelled \u201cin light of the importance of the omitted incident to [petitioner\u2019s] asylum claim\u201d). In the absence of credible testimony, He\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
