We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>In re Corrinet, </em>645 F.3d 1141, 1145 (9th Cir. 2011), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing reciprocal discipline against Holcomb because he failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he was deprived of due process; that there was insufficient proof of the misconduct that resulted in his stipulated suspension from the state bar; or that grave injustice would result from the imposition of reciprocal discipline. <em>See In re Kramer, </em>282 F.3d 721, 724 (9th Cir.2002) (listing limited grounds for an attorney subject to discipline by another court to avoid a federal court\u2019s imposition of reciprocal discipline, and setting forth attorney\u2019s burden); <em>see also In re Rosenthal, </em>854 F.2d 1187, 1188 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (state court disciplinary findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness absent a showing of error).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Holcomb\u2019s remaining contentions, including those concerning reciprocal discipline being barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
