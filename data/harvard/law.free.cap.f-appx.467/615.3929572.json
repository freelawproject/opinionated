We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration, <em>Sch. Dist. No. U, Multnomah Cnty., Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir.1993), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-25\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Synclair\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the clerk\u2019s cost award because Synclair identified no proper ground for such relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1263 (setting forth grounds for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1) (requiring that a party file a motion challenging the clerk\u2019s cost award within seven days); <em>Walker v. California, </em>200 F.3d 624, 625-26 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (a party waives the right to challenge a cost award if the party does not file a motion for review of the award within the time period specified in Rule 54(d)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-26\">We are not persuaded by Synclair\u2019s contention that he, rather than his attorney of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>record, should have been served with the clerk\u2019s cost award, because neither a substitution of attorney nor a change of address was filed before the award. <em>See </em>E.D. Cal. R. 182(d), (f) (attorney withdrawals and address changes).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Synclair\u2019s \u201cMotion to Include Addendum to Informal Opening Brief,\u201d filed on January 4, 2011, is denied because the proposed addendum is irrelevant to the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
