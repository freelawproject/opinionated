MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">After examining Appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The court therefore orders the case submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Frederick Banks, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas corpus petition he filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Invoking the Administrative Procedures Act, three repealed statutes, and his own gross misinterpretation of the Indian canon of construction, Banks argues the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) failed to properly calculate his earned credits and the United States Parole Commission failed to consider him for parole. The district court dismissed with prejudice all Banks\u2019s claims against all Defendants, concluding the habeas action was successive because Banks has previously raised the claims in prior \u00a7 2241 actions. <em>See Stanko v. Davis, </em>617 F.3d 1262, 1269-70 (10th Cir.2010) (holding that the bar on second or successive habeas petitions and the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine apply to \u00a7 2241 petitions when petitioner is attempting to raise issues that were or could have been decided in prior habeas actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">Our jurisdiction over Banks\u2019s appeal arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Having reviewed Banks\u2019s appellate brief, the magistrate judge\u2019s Reports and Recommendations, the district court\u2019s Order, and the entire record on appeal, we affirm the dismissal of Banks\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas petition for substantially the reasons stated by the district court. We deny Banks\u2019s request to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
