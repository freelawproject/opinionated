Jackson was placed into restricted housing and was transferred to SCI Huntingdon the following day. Upon learning that some of his property \u2014 including personal and religious items \u2014 had been destroyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>as contraband prior to being shipped to Huntingdon, Jackson attempted to right this perceived wrong by pursuing administrative grievances; having failed to obtain administrative relief, Jackson filed suit, alleging that the defendants (employees of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections) had violated his constitutional rights by improperly disposing of his property. Jackson invoked 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1988, 1985, and 1986, as well as the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and Pennsylvania state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Following a protracted discovery period, the defendants moved for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Magistrate Judge recommended that the suit be dismissed in part pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A and that summary judgment be granted for the defendants on the remaining claims. Overruling Jackson\u2019s objections, the District Court adopted the recommendations, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cOur scope of review over the district court\u2019s order dismissing parts of the complaint and granting summary judgment is plenary.\u201d <em>Berger v. Edgewater Steel Co., </em>911 F.2d 911, 916 (3d Cir.1990). \u2018We may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied on by the District Court.\u201d <em>Otto v. Pa. State Educ. Ass\u2019n-NEA, </em>330 F.3d 125, 140 n. 17 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">In their summary judgment motion, the defendants argued that Jackson had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit, as is required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. Jackson\u2019s final grievance appeal, they noted, was initially rejected on July 13, 2009, as he had failed to provide copies of relevant documents from earlier in the grievance process. <em>See, e.g., </em>Am. Compl. Ex. E, ECF No. 10. On August 11, 2009, the grievance appeal was dismissed, apparently because Jackson had \u201cnot provided th[e] Office with required documentation for proper review although [he] was reminded to do so.\u201d Am. Compl. Ex. D. In her affidavit, Assistant Chief Grievance Officer Tracy Williams confirmed that the grievance was dismissed due to Jackson\u2019s failure to correctly file supplementary material, and that the Secretary\u2019s Office of Grievances and Appeals received no other grievances from Jackson in either 2009 or 2010. <em>See </em>Williams Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, ECF No. 69-7. In response, Jackson argued that he attempted to submit the documents, but implied that they were not received and/or were ignored. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 3, ECF No. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">It is well established that a prisoner\u2019s failure to properly comply with the prison\u2019s grievance process can lead to procedural default of his claims. <em>See Spruill v. Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 222 (3d Cir.2004). The regulations in place at the time required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">[a]n inmate appealing a grievance to final review [to be] responsible for providing the Secretary\u2019s Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals with all required documentation relevant to the appeal. A proper appeal to final review shall include photocopies of the initial grievance, initial review response, the inmate appeal to the Facility Manager, and the Facility Manager\u2019s decision. <em>Failure to provide the proper documentation may result in the appeal being dismissed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">DC-ADM 804 \u00a7 VI(D)(l)(g) (2004), ECF No. 69-2 (emphasis added). While Jackson claimed that he <em>did </em>forward the requested material, he did not go beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>pleadings and point to evidence supporting his argument, as he was required to do to survive a summary-judgment motion. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 817, 828-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>see also Nisenbaum v. Milwaukee Cnty., </em>338 F.3d 804, 810 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cAllegations in a complaint are not evidence.\u201d). The affidavit he provided was conclusory, stating only that he \u201cexhausted [his] grievance to Camp Hill but to no avail.\u201d Jackson Decl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 83. And while he attached a May 28, 2010 letter from one David Close in support of his argument that he submitted the requested documents again following the dismissal of his grievance, <em>see Jackson </em>Decl. Ex. 24, his attempts to comply with facility instructions <em>after </em>his appeal had been dismissed are of no moment. In sum, that Jackson failed to properly exhaust his administrative remedies prior to initiating his lawsuit is not genuinely in dispute, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a), and the defendants were thus properly entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the suit therefore lacked merit, the District Court correctly denied Jackson\u2019s request for counsel. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155-56 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">For the foregoing reasons, and as this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court. ' <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 248 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam); <em>see also </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">. We have simplified the somewhat unusual procedural history of the case in the District Court, as it is not germane to the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">. We understand the District Court to have dismissed Jackson's property-deprivation due-process claim while granting summary judgment on all other claims. We agree with the District Court's disposition of the property-deprivation claim, as Jackson was provided a meaningful post-deprivation remedy. <em>Monroe v. Beard, </em>536 F.3d 198, 210 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
