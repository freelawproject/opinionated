The district court found that Celestine\u2019s complaint did not meet the requisite $75,000 jurisdictional amount required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Celestine began work with TransWood, Inc. as an independent contractor prior to 2008. In September 2009, Celestine leased a truck from TransWood, which paid Celestine to obtain a transponder \u2014 a GeauxPass for Louisiana\u2019s statewide toll system. A GeauxPass is an electronic transponder connected to a prepaid account which allows the user to use tollways without stopping to pay the toll on roads such as the LA 1 Expressway, the Crescent City Connection, and toll roads to Grand Isle or Port Fourchon.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">After TransWood paid for the transponder, TransWood and Celestine arranged to evenly divide the costs of any tolls. On December 17, 2009, Celestine ended his independent contractor relationship with TransWood. Celestine returned the TransWood truck with the GeauxPass inside. TransWood attempted to reassign the GeauxPass to another TransWood driver. During the transfer process, TransWood signed Celestine\u2019s name to paperwork in order to transfer the GeauxPass. Upon being contacted by the GeauxPass system administrators, Celestine directed the administrators to leave the GeauxPass in his name. Celestine then contacted TransWood, and TransWood returned the GeauxPass to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Celestine filed his complaint in federal district court against TransWood. Celestine claimed damages for identity theft as a result of the attempted transfer of the GeauxPass and alleged falsification of two driver daily logs. TransWood filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Celestine could not satisfy the jurisdictional amount-in-controversy. The district court granted Trans-Wood\u2019s motion to dismiss. Celestine appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. LeClerc v. Webb, </em>419 F.3d 405, 413 (5th Cir.2005). Federal courts have limited jurisdiction, and therefore, the power to adjudicate claims only when jurisdiction is conferred by statute and the constitution. <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994); <em>Stockman v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n, </em>138 F.3d 144, 151 (5th Cir.1998). A federal court properly dismisses a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when it lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case. <em>Home Builders Assn. of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, </em>143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe burden of proof for a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss is on the party asserting jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cAccordingly, the plaintiff constantly bears the burden of proof that jurisdiction does in fact exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A pleading stating a claim for relief must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the grounds for the court\u2019s jurisdiction!;.]\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">1. Jurisdictional Amount</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">Diversity jurisdiction exists when: (1) there is diversity of citizenship between the parties, and (2) the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.00. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; <em>In re 1991 Exxon Chemical Fire, </em>558 F.3d 378, 387 (5th Cir.2009). Celes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tine and TransWood do not dispute diversity of citizenship, so we turn to the jurisdictional amount in controversy. The amount in controversy for jurisdictional purposes is determined by the amount of damages or the value of the property that is the subject of the action. <em>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 347, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). Where, as here, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint makes only a conclusory statement concerning jurisdiction and the amount in controversy is indeterminate, we ask \u201cwhether it is \u2018facially apparent\u2019 that the claims exceed the jurisdictional amount.\u201d <em>St. Paul Reinsurance Co., Ltd. v. Greenberg, </em>134 F.3d 1250, 1253 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Here, Celestine bore the burden of demonstrating that his claim met the requirements of federal diversity jurisdiction. Celestine did not and cannot satisfy that burden. First, TransWood, not Celestine, paid to obtain the GeauxPass. Second, the GeauxPass system administrators never transferred the GeauxPass out of Celestine\u2019s name. Third, the GeauxPass itself, including prepaid charges, had a value of less than $300. Fourth, TransWood returned the GeauxPass to Celestine.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">2. Punitive Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The amount in controversy may include punitive damages if they are recoverable as a matter of state law. <em>Id. </em>at 1254. \u201cIn Louisiana, there is a general public policy against punitive damages; thus a fundamental tenet of our law is that punitive or other penalty damages are not allowable unless expressly authorized by statute.\u201d <em>Romero v. Clarendon Am. Ins. Co., </em>54 So.3d 789, 791 (La.App.2010). Celestine\u2019s complaint demanded compensatory and punitive damages. However, Celestine has not set forth any facts that would justify an award of such damages in any amount. The amount in controversy remains unaffected by such a prayer by Celestine, because punitive damages are not recoverable based on the allegations in Celestine\u2019s complaint. Although Celestine prays for emotional distress damages, he does not allege any facts indicating he actually suffered emotional distress. Additionally, Celestine has not alleged how Transwood\u2019s alleged forgery on its driver\u2019s daily logs has damaged him. Celestine\u2019s punitive damages prayer alone cannot help him meet the required amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">3. Attorney\u2019s Fees &amp; Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Likewise, Celestine\u2019s prayer for attorney\u2019s fees cannot satisfy the jurisdictional amount. Attorney\u2019s fees are included in the computation of the jurisdictional amount only when they are expressly authorized under applicable state law. <em>Grant v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., </em>309 F.3d 864, 874 (5th Cir.2002). Celestine, who bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction, does not identify any state law that entitles him to attorney\u2019s fees here.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">In sum, Celestine does not allege how he has been damaged. Celestine\u2019s complaint does not remotely approach the required jurisdictional amount of greater than $75,000.00.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">While a federal court must of course give due credit to the good faith claims of the plaintiff, a court would be remiss in its obligations if it accepted every claim of damages at face value, no matter how trivial the underlying injury. This is especially so when, after jurisdiction has been challenged, a party has failed to specify the factual basis of his claims. Jurisdiction is not conferred by the stroke of a lawyer\u2019s pen. When challenged, it must be adequately founded in fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Diefenthal v. C.A. B., </em>681 F.2d 1039, 1052 (5th Cir.1982). Neither Celestine\u2019s prayer for punitive damages nor his claim for attorney\u2019s fees are sufficient for inclusion in the computation of the required amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this court affirms the district court\u2019s granting of TransWood\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
