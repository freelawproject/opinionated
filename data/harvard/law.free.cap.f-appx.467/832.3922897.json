Magalski appeals from an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of his employer, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Magalski filed suit against DHS, arguing that an Administrative Judge erred in finding that his demotion was supported by substantial evidence and in concluding that his retaliation claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), failed as a matter of law. The district court concluded that the misconduct charges upon which DHS based Magalski\u2019s demotion were, in fact, supported by substantial evidence, and that Magalski could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. Magalski appeals these determinations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">After a <em>de novo </em>review of the record<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the parties\u2019 briefs, and with the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons set forth in its thorough order dated September 29, 2010.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-18\">. Days before oral argument, Magalski asserted for the first time that he was not required to have a reasonable belief that he was engaging in statutorily protected activity to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. This argument is waived. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>340 F.3d 1219, 1228 n. 8 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-35\">. <em>Wilson v.
