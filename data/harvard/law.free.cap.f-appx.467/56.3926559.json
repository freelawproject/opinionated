Straus, denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal, and granting deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Nderere, </em>No. A029 853 242 (B.I.A. Aug. 14, 2009), <em>aff'g </em>No. A029 853 242 (Immig. Ct.Hartford, Conn. Mar. 12, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). Although we lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal entered against an alien, like Nderere, who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (relating to convictions for aggravated felonies), <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(c), we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law raised in petitions for review filed by such aliens, <em>Luna v. Holder, </em>637 F.3d 85, 102 (2d Cir.2011); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). As discussed below, Nderere\u2019s arguments invoke our jurisdiction because they present questions of law regarding whether the agency properly construed statutory language and applied the correct legal standard. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. BIA, </em>465 F.3d 497, 502 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that a statutory interpretation question raises a question of law); <em>see also Nethagani v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 150, 154-55 (2d Cir.2008) (finding that this Court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s finding that an alien committed a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d because such a determination is not solely within the discretion of the Attorney General).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">The BIA was not required to make a separate determination of whether Nderere constituted a danger to the community. An alien is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal \u201cif the Attorney General determines that-the alien, having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158 (b)(2) (A) (ii), 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The asylum statute also provides that convictions for aggravated felonies will be deemed \u201cparticularly serious crimes,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Attorney General may designate by regulation offenses that will be considered to be a [\u2018particularly serious crime\u2019].\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), (ii), (b)(2)(A)(ii). The BIA has held that the determination of whether an alien poses a danger to the community is subsumed in the analysis of whether the alien has committed a particularly serious crime. <em>See Matter of N-A-M- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 336, 342 (BIA 2007); <em>see also Matter of Carballe, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 357, 360 (BIA 1986). We have deferred to this interpretation. <em>See Nethagani </em>532 F.3d at 154, n. 1 (noting that this Court has accepted the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statute) (citing <em>Ahmetovic v. INS, </em>62 F.3d 48, 52-53 (2d Cir.1995) (acknowledging that the statutory clause regarding \u201cdanger to the community\u201d seemed superfluous unless a separate inquiry is made into an alien\u2019s \u201cdangerousness,\u201d but that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the statute was not unreasonable)).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Although Nderere correctly points out that this Court has not reviewed the \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d provision as it relates to the current asylum statute, we have found reasonable the BIA\u2019s interpretation of that clause as it relates to identical provisions contained in the withholding of removal statute and a previous administrative regulation. <em>See Ahmetovic, </em>62 F.3d at 52-53; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.14(c)(1) (1995); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii). Because the \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d bar at issue in this case is identical to those previously addressed, we find that the BIA reasonably interpreted the current asylum statute and that the agency was not required to make a separate finding that Nderere constituted \u201ca danger to the community.\u201d Accordingly, because Nderere was convicted of an aggravated felony, her conviction was automatically classified as a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d under the asylum statute, and the BIA did not err in denying her application for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">II. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The BIA erred, however, when it failed to consider whether coercion and duress were relevant factors in determining whether Nderere\u2019s conviction was a \u201cparticularly serious crime\u201d for purposes of determining her eligibility for withholding of removal. The withholding statute explicitly provides that, \u201cnotwithstanding the length of a sentence imposed,\u201d the Attorney General may find that an alien has been convicted of a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B); <em>see also Ahmetovic, </em>62 F.3d at 51. The agency relied on <em>Matter of Y-L-, A-G-, and R-S-R-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 270 (A.G.2002), to find that Nderere\u2019s conviction was a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d However, none of the cases before the Attorney General in <em>Matter of Y-L- A-G-, and R-S-R- </em>involved circumstances of coercion or duress; rather, they involved voluntary acts by the petitioners. <em>See id. </em>at 271. Furthermore, Courts have long recognized that the presence of coercion and duress vastly reduces the culpability of a person\u2019s conduct, and have therefore applied a presumption that legislators must have contemplated mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ing allowance for conduct motivated by coercion and duress, even if such exceptions are not explicitly stated in the statutes. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bailey, </em>444 U.S. 394, 415 n. 11, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (criminal statutes). In the context of immigration laws, the Supreme Court held in <em>Negusie v. Holder, </em>that the circumstance of duress was significant in determining the applicability of a withholding bar under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(i), and remanded the case to the BIA to determine the issue in the first instance. 555 U.S. 511, 129 S.Ct. 1159, 1164-66, 173 L.Ed.2d 20 (2009) (addressing the relevance of duress in the application of the persecutor bar). Because it is unclear whether <em>Matter of YL-, A-G-, and R-S-R- </em>applies to Nderere\u2019s case, and because the BIA has not yet determined whether it is reasonable to exclude factors of coercion and duress in determining whether a crime is \u201cparticularly serious,\u201d we remand to the BIA for it to address the matter in the first instance. <em>See I.N.S. v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (holding that \u201cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED to the extent it denied withholding of removal, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this Order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">. The wording of \u00a7 1231 is slightly different: \"if the Attorney General decides that-the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime is a danger to the community of the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 (b)(3)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
