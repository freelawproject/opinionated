We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Gutierrez-Pineda contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to appreciate its discretion, under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), to deviate from the advisory sentencing Guidelines based on policy differences with the Guidelines, and by failing to adequately address Gutierrez-Pineda\u2019s objections to the sixteen-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). These contentions are belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">Gutierrez-Pineda also contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable under <em>United States v. Amezcua-Vasquez, </em>567 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir.2009), because the sentence does not adequately account for the age of his prior convictions, his individual circumstances, and an amendment to the Guidelines that had not yet been adopted. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the section 3553(a) sentencing factors, the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Ruiz-Apolonio, </em>657 F.3d 907, 917-18 (9th Cir.2011) (district court not required to consider Guidelines amendment that has been promulgated but not yet adopted).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
