We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings and review de novo its legal conclusions. <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008). The court reviews for abuse of discretion a denial of a motion to remand, <em>de Jesus Melendez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1019, 1023 (9th Cir.2007). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Matute-Sanchez does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive determination that Matute-Sanchez\u2019s crimes were \u201cparticularly serious crimes,\u201d which statutorily excluded him from asylum and withholding of removal relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir. 1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned). Accordingly, Matute-Sanchez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-17\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because MatuteSanchez failed to establish it is more likely than not he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of a government official if returned to Honduras. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir. 2007). For the same reasons, the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying Matute-Sanchez\u2019s motion to remand because the additional evidence did not warrant a remand. <em>See Shin v. Mukasey, </em>547 F.3d 1019, 1025 (9th Cir.2008) (internal citation omitted) (\u201cAliens who seek to remand or reopen proceedings to pursue relief bear a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of proving that, if proceedings were reopened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-18\">Finally, we reject Matute-Sanchez\u2019s contention the agency did not fully consider the submitted evidence, explain its reasoning, or engage in improper fact-finding. <em>See Lata v. I.N.S., </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice to prevail on due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and except as provided by 9th Cir.
