In 2004, defendant-appellant Eric Willis (\u2018Willis\u201d) pleaded guilty to several charges stemming from a 2003 robbery of a U-Haul store in Philadelphia. His sentence included a consecutive ten-year term of incarceration \u2014 a mandatory minimum imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(i)\u2014 derived from a coconspirator\u2019s possession of a shotgun during the robbery. Willis has unsuccessfully challenged his sentence on both direct and collateral review. <em>See generally United States v. Willis, </em>C.A. No. 10-3585 (3d Cir., order entered Dec. 6, 2010); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 198 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>In June of 2011, Willis commenced a new attack on his sentence, filing a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8582(c)(2). He claimed that \u201cAmendment 599\u201d had lowered his Guideline range, thereby justifying relief under \u00a7 3582.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court disagreed and denied the motion, observing that the relevant \u201csentencing guideline range [was] unaffected\u201d by Amendment 599. Willis filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. While we review the District Court\u2019s order primarily for abuse of discretion, our review of legal questions is plenary. <em>See United States v. Mateo, </em>560 F.3d 152, 154 &amp; n. 2 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">We agree with the Government that Willis cannot obtain relief under \u00a7 3582(c). Even if Amendment 599, which <em>antedated </em>Willis\u2019s sentencing by several years, applied in the fashion he claims, it is clear from the pre-sentence report that Willis never received a firearms enhancement; rather, the lengthy sentence imposed by the District Court derived, in part, from the mandatory minimum required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(i). A mandatory-minimum term of imprisonment required by statute is not an element of the Guidelines, and Willis therefore cannot challenge that portion of his sentence via \u00a7 3582. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010) (\u201c[Section 3582(c)(2) ] applies only to a limited class of prisoners \u2014 namely, those whose sentence was based on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the Commission.\u201d). Rather, a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is the proper mechanism for challenging a federal conviction or sentence. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Carter, </em>500 F.3d 486, 490 (6th Cir.2007) (distinguishing between motions brought under \u00a7 3582(c) and those brought under \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">\u201cBecause this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 248 (3d Cir.2011); <em>see also </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\">. Amendment 599 expanded the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 on the use of a firearm during or in relation to certain crimes, and clarified under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the Guidelines for those other offenses. <em>See </em>3 U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>C-572-74 (2010), <em>available at </em>http://www.ussc.gov/ Guidelines/201 l_Guidelines/ManuaL PDF/Appendix_C_Vol_II.pdf (2011 edition with identical textual content). Amendment 599 went into effect on November 1, 2000, and was made retroactive pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10. For a discussion of Amendment 599, see <em>United States v. Goines, </em>357 F.3d 469 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
