Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Sowe v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1281, 1285 (9th Cir. 2008). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal based upon changed country conditions because, even if Kabba were credible and established past persecution, the record reflects that country conditions in Sierra Leone have changed such that Kabba no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution by members of the Revolutionary United Front. <em>See id. </em>at 1285-86, 1288. Accordingly, Kabba\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See id. </em>at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">We lack jurisdiction to address Kabba\u2019s unexhausted challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b785-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
