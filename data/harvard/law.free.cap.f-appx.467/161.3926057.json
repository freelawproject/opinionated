For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">The Appellants first argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for a mistrial based on a Government witness\u2019 testimony regarding evidence that the district court had ruled inadmissible under Fed.R.Evid. 403. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>587 F.3d 625, 631 (4th Cir.2009). \u201cAn abuse of discretion exists if the defendant can show prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>515 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Appellants\u2019 motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">The Appellants next argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing arguments. \u201cWhether improper argument by the government has prejudiced the trial process to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>such a degree as to require reversal depends on the facts of each trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>498 F.3d 278, 293 (4th Cir.2007), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Fowler v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2045, 179 L.Ed.2d 1099 (2011). In making this determination, we consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL6\">(1) the degree to which the prosecutor\u2019s remarks have a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the accused; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) absent the remarks, the strength of the competent proof introduced to establish the guilt of the accused; and (4) whether the comments were deliberately placed before the jury to divert attention to extraneous matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Based on these factors, we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in denying the Appellants\u2019 motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Finally, the Appellants argue that the district court erred in denying their motion for a new trial because the court failed to ensure that the jury began deliberations anew when the court replaced a juror with an alternate after deliberations were in progress. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006). Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(3), a district court \u201cmay retain alternate jurors after the jury retires to deliberate. The court must ensure that a retained alternate does not discuss the case with anyone until that alternate replaces a juror or is discharged.\u201d Moreover, the rule explicitly provides that \u201c[i]f an alternate replaces a juror after deliberations have begun, the court must instruct the jury to begin deliberations anew.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Here, when the court excused a juror after deliberations had begun, the court ensured that the alternate had not discussed the case with anyone and instructed the jury that it was required to begin deliberations anew. Therefore, the court complied with the requirements of Rule 24(c)(3). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. As Nwaehiri is represented by counsel, we also deny his motion to file a pro se supplemental brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-12\">. The court granted the Appellants' motion for judgment of acquittal on a charge of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a), (c) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\">. Even were we to grant the motion to file a pro se supplemental brief, our review of the proposed brief persuades us that Nwaehiri fails to articulate claims that would warrant relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
