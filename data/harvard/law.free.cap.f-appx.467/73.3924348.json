Mar. 22, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A097 958 474 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 6, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">As an initial matter, Zheng has waived any challenge to the agency\u2019s determination that he failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution or his eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Therefore, we consider only whether Zheng demonstrated past persecution based on \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy as required to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Zheng\u2019s argument that he suffered persecution based on his wife\u2019s forced abortion is unavailing, as \u201capplicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). Zheng further asserts that he was persecuted on account of \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy, contending that his actions of conceiving a second child without government authorization and arguing with family planning officials amount to \u201cother resistance.\u201d Although individuals whose spouses were forcibly aborted may be entitled to relief where they demonstrate persecution based on their \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program,\u201d <em>Shao Yan Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303, 304 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted), merely impregnating one\u2019s spouse is not an act of \u201cresistance,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313 <em>(citing Ru Jian Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 531, 532 (5th Cir.2004)); <em>Matter of S-L-L-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 11 (2006). As to Zheng\u2019s assertion that his argument with the family planning officials constituted \u201cother resistance,\u201d Zheng testified repeatedly that the officials would have arrested him even if he had not argued with them. Accordingly, the record does not compel the conclusion that the argument constituted \u201cother resistance\u201d precipitating any subsequent mistreatment. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313 (indicating that, to be eligible for asylum, the spouse of a woman who was forcibly aborted must \u201cprove past persecution or a fear of future persecution for \u2018resistance\u2019 that is <em>directly related to his </em>... <em>own opposition </em>to a coercive family planning policy\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the agency reasonably concluded that Zheng failed to demonstrate other resistance, and that finding is dispositive, we need not reach Zheng\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s finding that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>detention did not rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
