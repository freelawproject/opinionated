(\u201cSixteen\u201d). The district court ruled that Brown\u2019s trademark infringement action was barred by the defense of laches. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-16\">Although we have not yet settled on the appropriate standard to review a grant of summary judgment based on the defense of laches, <em>compare Hermes Int\u2019l v. Lederer de Paris Fifth Ave., Inc., </em>219 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir.2000) (applying <em>de novo </em>review), <em>with Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GMBH v. Nat\u2019l Sci. Supply Co., </em>14 Fed.Appx. 102, 105 (2d Cir.2001) (summary order) (applying abuse of discretion review (citing <em>Conopco, Inc. v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>95 F.3d 187, 193 (2d Cir.1996))), the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201c[wjhether laches bars an action in a given case ... \u2018is a question primarily addressed to the discretion of the trial court.\u2019\u201d <em>Burnett v. N.Y. Cent. R.R. Co., </em>380 U.S. 424, 435, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 13 L.Ed.2d 941 (1965) (quoting <em>Gardner v. Panama R.R. Co., </em>342 U.S. 29, 30, 72 S.Ct. 12, 96 L.Ed. 31 (1951)). It is unnecessary to decide whether prior case law in this Circuit applying the <em>de novo </em>standard of review to a district court\u2019s laches ruling is good law, as the precise standard is immaterial in this case. Under either a <em>de novo </em>review or a review for abuse of discretion, Brown\u2019s action against Sixteen was barred by the defense of laches for the reasons articulated by the district court in its well-reasoned decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Brown v. Sixteen, Inc., </em>02-cv-4630, 2009 WL 1159161 (S.D.N.Y. Apr.28, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-17\">Additionally, \u201c[w]e review the denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Green v. Mattingly, </em>585 F.3d 97, 104 (2d Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In seeking to re-add two defendants to this action, as well as to expand upon the allegations in her original complaint and add new claims, Brown waited three years from the dismissal of her claims against those defendants (based on insufficient service of process) and four years from the time she filed her complaint. The district court thus acted well within its discretion in ruling that amendment at such a late stage of the litigation would have been improper where she gave no reasonable explanation for the delay. <em>See Jin </em>u <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>310 F.3d 84, 101 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cLeave to amend should be freely granted, but the district court has the discretion to deny leave if there is a good reason for it, such as futility, bad faith, undue delay, or undue prejudice to the opposing party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We have given careful consideration to each of Brown\u2019s arguments on appeal, and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED and Appellees\u2019 motion to strike is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-14\">. We decline to consider the arguments and evidence that Brown presents for the first time on appeal, as well as the factual assertions she makes without any reference to the record. See Fed. R.App. P. 10(a), 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Katir v. Columbia Univ., </em>15 F.3d 23, 25 (2d Cir.1994) (per curiam); <em>Aslanidis v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>7 F.3d 1067, 1077 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
