Cox appeals from a denial of her petition for review by the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) affirming the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM\u2019s) decision denying her application for disability retirement because it was untimely filed. <em>Cox v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. CH831E11-319-I-1, slip op. at 1 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 6, 2011). For the reasons set forth below, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-23\">Ms. Cox was separated from the U.S. Postal Service on October 19, 2007. The OPM received Ms. Cox\u2019s application for disability retirement on June 28, 2010. Disability retirement applications must be filed within one year after an employee separates from service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(b). Ms. Cox contended that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>chronic depression and post-traumatic stress disorder prevented her from timely filing her application within one-year after her separation. The OPM, however, rejected this argument and found that Ms. Cox was sufficiently competent to have filed an application for disability retirement within one-year of her separation from the U.S. Postal Service. The Board affirmed, and Ms. Cox timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">We affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>McEntee v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>404 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). The relevant question is not what we would decide <em>de novo, </em>but whether the determination on appeal is supported by substantial evidence on the record. <em>Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>819 F.2d 1113, 1115 (Fed.Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">A claim for retirement disability is allowed \u201conly if\u2019 it is filed before the employee \u201cis separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(b). The \u201ctime limitation may be waived\u201d if the applicant is \u201cmentally incompetent\u201d during the filing period. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8337(b). Mental incompetence may be established even if the applicant is \u201c \u2018one having some minimal capacity to manage his own affairs, and not needing to be committed. The [applicant] is not required to have been a raving lunatic continuously5 during the relevant period.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>353 F.3d 1363, 1368 (Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting <em>French v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed.Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Ms. Cox asserts that the medical evidence shows that her mental illness prevented her from timely filing the application. In particular, Ms. Cox cites to medical evidence from 2005 until present, including the notes of a psychiatric nurse practitioner who met with Ms. Cox in 2007 and 2008 (the relevant period). The Board recognized that Ms. Cox suffered from mental health issues between October 2007 and October 2008, but found that the evidence did not establish that Ms. Cox was mentally incompetent during this period. <em>Cox, </em>slip op. at 3, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The psychiatric nurse practitioner\u2019s notes during this period support the Board\u2019s decision that Ms. Cox was not mentally incompetent. The notes indicate that Ms. Cox engaged in a variety of activities during the year after she was separated from the Postal Service. For example, Ms. Cox helped a neighbor prepare for her daughter\u2019s wedding, went out with friends, sought employment, joined a women\u2019s group in her neighborhood for socialization, and began building close friendships. In February 2008, the notes describe Ms. Cox\u2019s mood as \u201cstable and euthymic,\u201d and her affect as bright and reactive. In March 2008, the notes again describe Ms. Cox\u2019s mood as \u201ceuthymic\u201d and her affect as bright and reactive. The notes also show that Ms. Cox was following her case against the Postal Service for wrongful termination, that she took \u201cin stride\u201d the news that she lost her case, and that she planned to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">In light of this evidence, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that Ms. Cox was not incompetent during this period. We have considered Ms. Cox\u2019s additional arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>on appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
