For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s decision. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">On October 2, 1988, Middleton was involved in an automobile accident while driving under the influence of alcohol. The police found guns and ammunition in his car. Because Middleton\u2019s prior criminal record included several felony convictions, he was indicted on one count of being a felon in possession of firearms. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). In 1990, a jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida found Middleton guilty. At sentencing, the District Court classified Middleton as a career offender under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e), based on the following four Florida state court convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">(1) Battery of a law enforcement officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">(2) Attempted second degree murder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">(3) Armed robbery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-16\">(4) Breaking and entering with the intent to commit a felony</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">Middleton\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Middleton, </em>978 F.2d 719 (11th Cir.1992). In December 1993, Middleton filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the Northern District of Florida. The District Court denied the motion and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. <em>Middleton v. United States, </em>110 F.3d 797 (11th Cir. 1997). Middleton then filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The District Court dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denied a certificate of appealability, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Middleton v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 863, 126 S.Ct. 149, 163 L.Ed.2d 147 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">In 2005, Middleton filed in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals an application under 28 U.S.C.- \u00a7 2244 to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. In the application, Middleton argued that it was improper to use his armed robbery conviction to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. In support of this assertion, Middleton relied on <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>166 F.3d 1360 (11th Cir.1999), wherein the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that, under the ACCA, \u201ca conviction is \u2018previous\u2019 to a \u00a7 922(g) offense only if the conviction occurred before the violation of \u00a7 922(g), not simply prior to conviction or sentencing for that violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1361. Middleton committed the armed robbery in April 1989. Therefore, the armed robbery conviction necessarily occurred after the \u201cfelon in possession\u201d violation, which occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>in October 1988. The Eleventh Circuit denied Middleton\u2019s \u00a7 2244 application, holding that <em>Richardson </em>\u201cdoes not constitute a new rule of law within the meaning of the statute because it was not decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In 2007, Middleton filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. He again argued that, under <em>Richardson, </em>his armed robbery conviction could not qualify as a predicate offense because it occurred after the \u00a7 922(g) violation. The District Court denied the petition, holding that \u201c \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply to this case.\u201d After Middleton\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. <em>Middleton v. Schult, </em>299 Fed.Appx. 94, 96 (2d Cir.2008) (holding that \u201cMiddleton\u2019s sentencing enhancement claim could have been pursued earlier and his \u00a7 2241 petition should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Middleton filed the present \u00a7 2241 petition in 2010, arguing that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of being a career offender. Relying again on <em>Richardson, </em>Middleton claimed that his armed robbery conviction could not serve as a predicate for the ACCA sentence enhancement because that conviction occurred after the \u00a7 922(g) conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, rejecting Middleton\u2019s assertion that a \u00a7 2255 motion was an inadequate or ineffective remedy. Middleton appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">A motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A petitioner can seek relief under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997). A \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner cannot meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120, or because the sentencing court does not grant relief, <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, the \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal by an intervening change in law. <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 (citing <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251). For example, in <em>Dorsainvil, </em>we allowed a petitioner to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because an intervening change in the law decriminalized conduct for which he had been convicted, and he had no earlier opportunity to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>that conviction. <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Middleton\u2019s challenge to his sentence under <em>Richardson </em>is not the rare situation rendering \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. In <em>Richardson, </em>the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals considered the meaning of the phrase \u201cprevious convictions\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). <em>Richardson, </em>166 F.3d at 1361. Section 924(e)(1) provides for an enhanced sentence \u201c[i]n the case of a person who violates [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) ] and has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Richardson, who was convicted in 1997 for being a felon in possession of a firearm, was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 924(e)(1), based in part on a 1996 drug conviction that occurred after his arrest but before his conviction on the \u00a7 922(g) violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1361. On direct appeal, the Eleventh Circuit vacated Richardson\u2019s sentence, holding that \u201cthe only reasonable interpretation\u201d of the relevant language in \u00a7 924(e)(1) is that \u201ca conviction is \u2018previous\u2019 to a \u00a7 922(g) offense only if the conviction occurred before the violation of \u00a7 922(g), not simply prior to conviction or sentencing for that violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Importantly, <em>Richardson\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u201cprevious convictions\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(1) did not render non-criminal any of Middleton\u2019s conduct and did not make him \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the career offender sentence enhancement. Moreover, we note that this interpretation of \u201cprevious convictions\u201d existed prior to Middleton\u2019s \u00a7 2255 proceedings. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Balascsak, </em>873 F.2d 673, 679 (3d Cir.1989) (interpreting the predecessor to \u00a7 924(e) and stating that \u201cthe only reading of the statute which gives meaning to all the terms used by Congress is that the three prior convictions ... must have occurred prior to the time the defendant received the firearm.\u201d). Thus, we conclude that the exception identified in <em>In re Dorsainvil </em>is inapplicable here, and Middleton may not evade the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255 by seeking relief under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">. Middleton also alleged that his conviction for battery of a law enforcement officer does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA because the Florida offense of battery does not have as an element the use of physical force. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (holding that a conviction for battery in Florida does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA). We need not address this argument, however. As discussed below, Middleton has failed to establish that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to challenge the sentencing court's determination that his armed robbery conviction qualified as the third requisite violent felony necessary for career offender status under the ACCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
