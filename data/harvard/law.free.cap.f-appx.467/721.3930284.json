Reviewing both the dismissal and summary judgment de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Ward\u2019s retaliation claim fails because he did not allege that Carr or Stewart took any action against him because of his grievances. <em>See Rhodes v. Robinson, </em>408 F.3d 559, 567-68 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cWithin the prison context, a viable claim of First Amendment retaliation entails five basic elements: (1) An assertion that a state actor took some adverse action against an inmate (2) because of (3) that prisoner\u2019s protected conduct, and that such action (4) chilled the inmate\u2019s exercise of his First Amendment rights, and (5) the action did not reasonably advance a legitimate correctional goal\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Ward\u2019s due process claim fails because he did not show that his transfer within the Rynning Unit and his transfer to the Meadows Complex Detention Unit imposed an \u201catypical and significant hardship on [Ward] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>see also Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976) (transfer to different prison does not require due process solely because \u201clife in one prison is much more disagreeable than in another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Ward\u2019s equal protection claim fails because he did not submit sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that he was intentionally discriminated against because of his homosexuality. <em>See Flores v. Morgan Hill Unified Sch. Dist., </em>324 F.3d 1130, 1134 (9th Cir.2003). There is no evidence that Carr had control over whether Ward or his cellmate would be moved within the Rynning Unit. In addition, Ward\u2019s declaration that Carr stated that she \u201cdid not like gays\u201d does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Carr later fabricated confidential informants against Ward for that reason. <em>See Oltarzewski v. Ruggiero, </em>830 F.2d 136, 139 (9th Cir.1987) (verbal harassment is not sufficient to sustain a section 1983 claim). Finally, there is insufficient evidence to find that Stewart knew that Ward was a homosexual until the filing of this lawsuit, or that Stewart\u2019s decision to believe Carr\u2019s report of a threat was discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
