He contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove his knowing participation in the crimes because the Government\u2019s cooperating witnesses were unworthy of belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">Castaneda properly moved for acquittal, so we review the sufficiency of the evidence by considering the evidence and all inferences reasonably drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict and by determining whether a rational jury could have found all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>567 F.3d 721, 731 (5th Cir.2009). Unless the testimony of a witness, \u201ceven an accomplice cooperating with the Government,\u201d is wholly implausible, such as concerning \u201can event that could not have occurred under the laws of nature,\u201d we may not discredit that testimony, because the question of such a witnesses\u2019 credibility is for the jury to decide. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-22\">The elements of Castaneda\u2019s crimes can be summarized as the knowing possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute it, the knowing participation in bringing marijuana into the United States from another country, and a voluntarily agreement with others to commit those crimes. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 599 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 559 (5th Cir.2002). Castaneda attempts to analogize his case to cases where evidence merely placed the defendant in the company or vicinity of conspirators. No analogy is warranted because the testimony in the instant case directly established Castaneda\u2019s knowledge of and active involvement in a conspiracy to import marijuana into the United States for distribution. Castaneda\u2019s arguments that the witnesses were unworthy of credibility is itself unworthy of consideration, because the credibility of the witnesses was a matter for the jury alone to decide. <em>See Garcia, </em>567 F.3d at 731. Because the evidence was sufficient to convict on all counts, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
