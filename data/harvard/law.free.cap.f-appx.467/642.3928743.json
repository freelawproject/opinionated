We have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>diction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. So<em>we v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1281, 1285 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if credible, and even if Samasa established past persecution on account of a protected ground, the DHS had rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution based on changed country conditions in Sierra Leone. <em>See id. </em>at 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Additionally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying humanitarian asylum where Samasa failed to show sufficiently severe past persecution or a reasonable possibility of other serious harm upon removal to Sierra Leone. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1 )(iii); <em>see also Belayneh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 488, 491 (9th Cir.2000). Therefore, Samasa\u2019s asylum claims fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Because Samasa failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily fails to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Lastly, Samasa has not raised any arguments challenging the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
