Videla denying Li\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>In re Zuo Peng Li, </em>No. A070 889 568 (B.I.A. June 16, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A070 889 568 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 2, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have considered both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions. <em>See Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 157 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider Li\u2019s new evidence, because it was adjudicating an appeal from the IJ\u2019s order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iv) (\u201cExcept for taking administrative notice of commonly known facts such as current events or the contents of official documents, the Board will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA properly determined whether remand was appropriate. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA party asserting that the Board cannot properly resolve an appeal without further factfinding must file a motion for remand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in declining to remand Li\u2019s case based on the new evidence. The BIA determined that Li\u2019s brother\u2019s letter was unreliable because it was an unnotarized, unsworn copy that was not corroborated by any other documents from a reliable source. We defer to that ruling. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that the weight afforded to evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the agency). Additionally, the other evidence Li submitted was not \u201cpreviously unavailable\u201d and could have been submitted or summarized with his original motion to reopen. <em>See Li Yong Cao, </em>421 F.3d at 156 (explaining that the BIA may decline to remand where the movant has failed to \u201ccomply with the requirement of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(1) [now found at \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) ] that his motion articulate material, previously unavailable evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">Nor did the agency abuse its discretion by denying Li\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely, as it was filed more than ten years after his final order of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7). The time limits on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>motions to reopen may be excused when the movant demonstrates changed country conditions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). But, as the BIA concluded, Li\u2019s claim, based on the fact that he joined the China Democracy Party in 2007, reflected no more than a change in personal circumstances. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[AJpparent gaming of the system in an effort to avoid [removal] is not tolerated by the existing regulatory scheme .... \u201d); <em>see also Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 151-56 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Moreover, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Li failed to establish that conditions in China had materially changed. The evidence he submitted to the agency documenting the persecution of pro-democracy activists in China did not indicate that there had been any change in that persecution between Li\u2019s 1998 removal hearing and 2008 when he filed his motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
