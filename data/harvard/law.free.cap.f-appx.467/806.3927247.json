BCA also argues that the district court erred in rejecting BCA\u2019s bona fide error defense as to each of these three claims. Finally, BCA argues that the district court\u2019s award of the maximum statutory damages of $1000 is too high given the <em>de minimus </em>acts for which it was found liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. FindWhat Investor Group v. FindWhat.com, </em>658 F.3d 1282, 1307 (11th Cir.2011). We will affirm \u201cwhen the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of fact and compels judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Swisher Intern., Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir.2008) (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a)). We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">The FDCPA requires that a debt collector must \u201c[wjithin five days after the initial communication with a consumer ... send the consumer a written notice\u201d containing specified information unless that information was already included in the initial communication. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). The district court concluded that Moreno\u2019s September 23, 2009 telephone call to Ponce was BCA\u2019s \u201cinitial communication\u201d under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). The court rejected BCA\u2019s argument that the letter BCA mailed to Ponce on November 18, 2008 constituted its \u201cinitial communication\u201d because it was sent to an address at which Ponce had not lived for over eight months. While the plain language of the statute might not require the debt collector to ensure actual receipt of the written notice, the plain language does require the debt collector to send the written notice to a valid and proper address where the consumer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>actually receive it. We cannot say the district court erred in determining that the September 2009 telephone call, and not the November 18 letter, was the initial communication. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Ponce\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1692g is not barred by the statute of limitations nor its conclusion that BCA violated \u00a7 1692g by not sending written notice in accordance with \u00a7 1692g(a) within five days of Moreno\u2019s telephone call to Ponce.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Next, the district court concluded that during her telephone call with Ponce\u2019s ex-wife, Moreno failed to comply with FDCPA\u2019s mandatory requirement that as a \u201cdebt collector communicating with any person other than [Ponce] for the purpose of acquiring location information about [Ponce],\u201d that she state that she \u201cis confirming or correcting location information concerning [Ponce].\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692b. The district court rejected BCA\u2019s argument that because Moreno was not contacting a third-party in an attempt to track down Ponce that her telephone call with Ponce\u2019s ex-wife did not trigger \u00a7 1692b(l)\u2019s requirements. The district court noted that the undisputed transcript of the telephone call indicated that Moreno asked Ponce\u2019s ex-wife numerous times if she had a number where Moreno could reach Ponce and that Moreno admitted that she never stated that she was confirming or correcting Ponce\u2019s location information. Accordingly, we see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that BCA violated \u00a7 1692b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The district court also concluded that Moreno\u2019s statement to Ponce that \u201csir, your insurance company will not go ahead and take care of this now,\u201d in response to Ponce\u2019s question about why his health insurance did not pay the bill violated\u2019s FDCPA\u2019s prohibition against the use of \u201cfalse, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10). The district court rejected BCA\u2019s argument that because it is not disputed that no insurance company has paid the medical bill despite attempts by the medical provider to obtain payment, Moreno\u2019s statement was indeed true, and therefore, cannot be deemed to have been false or misleading. The district court noted that our circuit has evaluated FDCPA\u2019s claims under the \u201cleast sophisticated consumer\u201d standard. <em>See Jeter v. Credit Bureau, Inc., </em>760 F.2d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.1985) (adopting the same standard for the FDCPA as that of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which was meant to protect the public, including the \u201cignorant, the unthinking, and the credulous\u201d). Here, although Moreno based her statement on her general experience about insurance claims, she had no particular information to support her statement about Ponce\u2019s insurance, and therefore, the district court concluded that she based her statement on an assumption which was meant to coax Ponce into paying the bill. We see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that this statement would have been misleading to the least sophisticated consumer and therefore violated \u00a7 1692e(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The district court also rejected BCA\u2019s invocation of the bona fide error defense on each of these three claims. To maintain the bona fide error defense, a debt collector must show by a preponderance of the evidence that its violation \u201c(1) was not intentional; (2) was a bona fide error; and (3) occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Niagara Credit Solutions, Inc., </em>584 F.3d 1350, 1352-53 (11th Cir.2009). All three elements must be satisfied or the defense fails. <em>Id. </em>at 1353. Here, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that BCA failed to meet its burden by relying solely on its internal policies with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>out any specific explanation of how its errors were unintentional or how the policies were meant to protect against such errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Finally, BCA argues that the district court erred in awarding Ponce the maximum statutory damages of $1000 for its three violations of the FDCPA. \u201cAvailable remedies under the FDCPA include actual damages, the potential for additional damages up to $1,000 subject to the Court\u2019s discretion, and reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>LeBlanc v. Unifund CCR Partners, </em>601 F.3d 1185, 1190 (11th Cir. 2010). In determining the amount of damages to award, the FDCPA instructs the district court to consider, \u201camong other relevant factors \u2014 , ... the frequency and persistence of noncompliance by the debt collector, the nature of such noncompliance, and the extent to which such noncompliance was intentional.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(b)(l). Here, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
