Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 182 S.Ct. 476, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011). In <em>Judulang </em>the Court considered the BIA\u2019s \u201ccomparable-grounds\u201d rule for determining whether an alien is eligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c). The Court held that the comparable-grounds rule is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). <em>Judulang, </em>132 S.Ct. at 483-84. The Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]n rejecting th[e] rule, we do not preclude the BIA from trying to devise another, equally economical policy respecting eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, so long as it comports with everything held in both this decision and <em>[I.N.S. v.] St. Cyr </em>[,] [533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. Accordingly, it is proper to remand this case to the BIA to reconsider its decision regarding whether Ceron-Silva is eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">We GRANT Ceron-Silva\u2019s petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s judgment, and REMAND the case to the BIA for reconsideration in light of <em>Judulang.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
