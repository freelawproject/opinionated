The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced her to three years of probation and imposed a $500 fine and a $100 mandatory special assessment. The court waived Johnson\u2019s obligation to pay interest on the fine and ordered that Johnson be permitted to pay the fine in monthly installments of not less than $25 or ten percent of her net monthly household income, whichever was greater.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Johnson argues that the court erred in imposing the $500 fine because the court did not consider her ability to pay. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a) (requiring a sentencing court to consider several factors before imposing a fine, including the defendant\u2019s ability to pay); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5E1.2(a) (providing that a sentencing court \u201cshall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine\u201d). We review for clear error the District Court\u2019s \u201cimposition of a fine and its determination of the amount of a fine.\u201d <em>United States v. Herron, </em>539 F.3d 881, 888 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in imposing the fine or in calculating the amount of the fine. Although Johnson\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) estimated that her \u201cnet monthly cash flow\u201d is negative $13, Johnson failed to establish that each of her estimated monthly expenditures is essential. Nor did she establish that her monthly expenditures could not be adjusted to accommodate a partial payment of at least $25 on the $500 fine. <em>Cf. United States v. Martinez, </em>409 Fed.Appx. 973, 974 (8th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (affirming the imposition of a fine and suggesting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>defendant\u2019s assets might be sold to pay the f\u00edne). While the court did not make specific findings regarding Johnson\u2019s ability to pay the f\u00edne, the record indicates that the court \u201creviewed [Johnson\u2019s] file in some detail\u201d; considered the information in the unobjected-to PSR; and accommodated Johnson\u2019s financial situation by imposing a fine at the bottom of the Guidelines range, waiving the accrual of interest on the fine, and permitting payment of the fine in monthly installments over the term of Johnson\u2019s supervised release. Sent. Tr. at 9. Johnson did not establish that she is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay the $500 fine assessed by the District Court. <em>See Herron </em>539 F.3d at 889 (burden of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-11\">. The Honorable Robert T. Dawson, United States District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-12\">. At the sentencing hearing, the District Court described the required monthly payment as \"not less than $25 per month or 10 percent of your monthly income, household income, whichever is greater.\" Sent. Tr. at 10. In the written judgment, however, the court described the required monthly payment as \"not less than 10% of the defendant's net monthly household income, but in no case less than $25 per month.\" Judgment at 4. First, we are confident that the court \"simply misspoke during its oral pronouncement\u201d and that it intended the percentage-of-income calculation to be based on Johnson\u2019s net monthly household income as stated in the written judgment. <em>See United States v. Buck, </em>661 F.3d 364, 374 (8th Cir.2011). Second, in view of Johnson's limited assets and minimal potential cash flow, we construe \"net monthly household income\u201d in this judgment to mean the balance of Johnson\u2019s monthly household income remaining after deduction of her reasonable and necessary monthly household expenses. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1520 (2002) (defining \"net income\"); <em>see also, </em>The Fitzroy Dearborn Encyclopedia of Banking &amp; Finance 838 (10th ed.1994) (\u201cNet income = Revenues-Expenses + Gains-Losses\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Lowe, </em>220 Fed.Appx. 831, 833 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting an order on payment of fines that defined \"net income\" as \u201ctake home pay\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
