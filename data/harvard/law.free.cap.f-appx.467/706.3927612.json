Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we repeat only those facts necessary to resolve the issues raised on appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny Ortega\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-16\">Ortega first argues that the BIA erred in relying on the document entitled, \u201cDisposition of Arrest and Court Action,\u201d to establish that Ortega was convicted of pos- \u2022 session of cocaine base for sale. In relying on the Disposition of Arrest and Court Action, the BIA cited to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.41(d), which provides that in a proceeding before an immigration judge, \u201c[a]ny other evidence that reasonably indicates the existence of a criminal conviction may be admissible as evidence thereof.\u201d The Disposition of Arrest and Court Action reasonably indicated that Ortega was convicted of violating \u00a7 11351.5, and Ortega did not present any evidence contradicting or discrediting this evidence. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 823 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that the sole test for admission of evidence in immigration proceedings is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair). Thus, it was not error for the BIA to consider the Disposition of Arrest and Court Action as evidence of Ortega\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>conviction for possession of cocaine base for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The cases cited by Ortega do not compel a contrary result; instead, they establish that certain documents may be insufficient to demonstrate that a particular conviction constitutes an aggravated felony when using the \u201cmodified categorical\u201d approach. See <em>Penuliar v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 961, 968-69 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Martinez-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 1022, 1028-29 (9th Cir. 2005); <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 892, 898 (9th Cir.2004). A modified categorical analysis is not required here because the full range of conduct covered by \u00a7 11351.5 falls within the meaning of an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Morales-Perez, </em>467 F.3d 1219, 1223 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that the federal crime of attempted possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell encompasses the California-defined crime of purchasing cocaine base for purposes of sale). No addi-' tional documentation was required to establish that Ortega\u2019s conviction constituted an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Ortega\u2019s second challenge \u2014 that relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) should extend to his 2004 offense, which was committed after the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110 Stat. 3009-546 \u2014 is belied by the plain language of the statute. <em>See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 </em>U.S. 289, 297, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (IIRI-RA, <em>\u201cinter alia, </em>repealed \u00a7 212(c), see \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-597, and replaced it with a new section that gives the Attorney General the authority to cancel removal for a narrow class of inadmissible or deportable aliens, see <em>id., </em>at 3009-594 (creating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b (1994 ed., Supp. V))\u201d). Even if Ortega could have obtained a \u00a7 212(c) waiver for his 1992 conviction, his 2004 conviction post-dates IIRIRA, thus making him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Consequently, the BIA did not err when it concluded that Ortega remained removable as charged based upon his 1992 and 2004 controlled substance convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b735-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
