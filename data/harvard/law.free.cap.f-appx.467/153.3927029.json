We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">As the parties are familiar with the history of this case, and as the arguments raised on appeal lack merit, our discussion will be brief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1) and conduct plenary review of the Tax Court\u2019s order granting the IRS\u2019s summary judgment motion, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Marcinek. <em>Hartmann v. Comm\u2019r, </em>638 F.3d 248, 249 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam); <em>Nestle Purina Petcare Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>594 F.3d 968, 970 (8th Cir.2010). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Estate of Thompson v. Comm\u2019r, </em>382 F.3d 367, 374 n. 12 (3d Cir.2004). While we are under an obligation to liberally construe the submissions of a pro se litigant, <em>see Wheeler v. Comm\u2019r, </em>528 F.3d 773, 781 (10th Cir.2008), issues not briefed on appeal \u2014 even by parties proceeding pro se \u2014 are deemed waived or abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-19\">Marcinek argues first that the agency abused its discretion in trying to deprive him of certain rights during a two-year period, such as his right to a face-to-face hearing and his right to make an audio recording of the proceedings. The IRS rejects Marcinek\u2019s narrative of events. Even if Marcinek\u2019s story were true, however, the delay would not entitle him to any independent relief. As Marcinek concedes, the IRS (eventually) granted his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>requests, and Marcinek does not explain how he was prejudiced by any delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Second, Marcinek challenges the validity of the Notices of Deficiency that were sent in response to his failure to file returns for a number of years. For example, he claims that the Notices were faulty because they were not signed. He does not argue that he failed to receive the Notices, nor does he contest the information contained in them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Marcinek also attacks the procedures used in the preparation of substitutes for returns, and cites passages from various training manuals that purportedly show procedural deficiencies in his ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">These claims, to which the IRS responded in good faith, are by and large \u201clegal arguments typical of those asserted by \u2018tax protestors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sauers v. Comm\u2019r, </em>771 F.2d 64, 66 (3d Cir.1985). It is well established, for instance, that Notices of Deficiency serve \u201conly to advise the person who is to pay the deficiency that the Commissioner means to assess him.\u201d <em>Geiselman v. United States, </em>961 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992) (citing <em>Olsen v. Helvering, </em>88 F.2d 650, 651 (2d Cir.1937)). The Internal Revenue Code \u201cdoes not expressly require a notice of deficiency to be signed,\u201d <em>Tavano v. Comm\u2019r, </em>986 F.2d 1389, 1390 (11th Cir. 1993) (per curiam); therefore, \u201cno signature is required to render a deficiency notice valid,\u201d <em>Selgas v. Comm\u2019r, </em>475 F.3d 697, 700 (5th Cir.2007). Marcinek complains at great length about this state of circumstances, but does not explain how a lack of signatures affected his ability to challenge the truth of the claims against him in Tax Court or elsewhere. Rather, he implies that signatures would allow him to \u201cknow to whom a civil lawsuit for the violation of constitutional rights may be addressed\u201d under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). <em>But see Shreiber v. Mastrogiovanni, </em>214 F.3d 148, 152 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[A] <em>Bivens </em>action should not be inferred to permit suits against IRS agents accused of violating a taxpayer\u2019s constitutional rights in the course of making a tax assessment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">We need not address Marcinek\u2019s remaining claims at length. Some of them are included on the IRS\u2019s \u201cThe Truth About Frivolous Tax Arguments,\u201d <em>available at </em>http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/friv_ tax.pdf. Others, such as those relating to the identity and authority of a Mr. Dennis Parizek, are of dubious value in resolving the appeal, and were in any event addressed to our satisfaction by the Tax Court. Far from representing \u201can unshakable legal position ... that the IRS is collecting the income tax illegally,\u201d Inf. Br. 23-24, the majority of Marcinek\u2019s claims have been rejected by all courts to have considered them. We add our voice to that chorus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We have examined the rest of Marcinek\u2019s brief and detect no arguments giving cause for disturbing the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion, and we will not reach outside of the four corners of the brief to address claims that were not raised. We will therefore affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-14\">. Our previous opinion in this matter arose out of near-identical circumstances. <em>See generally Marcinek v. Comm\u2019r, </em>422 Fed.Appx. 132 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">. We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of this matter. Marcinek admitted on various occasions his contemporaneous receipt of documents that he believed to be \u201cfraudulent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">. We have not considered the arguments raised in Marcinek's lengthy affidavit/manifesto, which he included below but attempted to incorporate into the record on appeal only by reference to an external source. His reply brief, which raises other tax-protestor claims discussed in the IRS resource referenced above the margin \u2014 for example, that the Fifth Amendment is in conflict with tax-filing requirements, or that the Sixteenth Amendment was intended to be an excise tax \u2014 does not suffice to preserve them for our review; \u201d[a]s a general matter, the courts of appeals will not consider arguments raised on appeal for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., </em>903 F.2d 186, 204 n. 29 (3d Cir. 1990). In any case, the arguments adopted in those submissions reflect a reliance on a patchwork of out-of-context quotations from judicial opinions, policy state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ments, internal regulations, and the like, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the well-settled state of the law. In fact, raising these arguments can be cause for additional penalties. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6702, 6673; <em>Coleman v. Comm'r, </em>791 F.2d 68, 69 (7th Cir.1986) (\"The government may not prohibit the holding of these beliefs, but it may penalize people who act on them.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
