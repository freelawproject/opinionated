We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Crawford v. Astrue, </em>586 F.3d 1142, 1147 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by reducing the fees from the amount specified in the fee agreement based on the court\u2019s assessment of what was reasonable given the risk and complexity involved in this case. <em>See Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, </em>535 U.S. 789, 808, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002) (stating that \u201c[i]f the benefits are large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case, a downward adjustment is ... in order\u201d); <em>Cranford, </em>586 F.3d at 1152-53 (explaining that courts should assess the complexity and risk involved in the specific case at issue, rather than social security cases in general, when analyzing the reasonableness of the requested fees); <em>see also Clark v. Astrue, </em>529 F.3d 1211, 1214 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe district court abuses its discretion if it does not apply the correct legal standard or rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
