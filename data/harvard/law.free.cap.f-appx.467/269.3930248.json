They argue that the district court erred in failing to retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, thereby adversely affecting the mandatory minimum sentences to which they were exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Tickles, </em>661 F.3d 212, 215 (5th Cir.2011), <em>petitions for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 15, 2011) (No. 11-8023) <em>and </em>(Dec. 27, 2011) (No. 11-8268), which held \u201cthat the penalties prescribed by the FSA do not apply to federal criminal sentencing for illegal conduct that preceded the FSA\u2019s enactment.\u201d Although the Supreme Court has recently granted certiorari in two Seventh Circuit cases that held that the FSA does not apply retroactively, our precedent is nevertheless binding. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
