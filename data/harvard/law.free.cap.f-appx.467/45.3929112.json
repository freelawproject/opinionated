Drown, both employees of the New York State Department of Correctional Services (\u201cDOCS\u201d), for alleged violations of his due process rights in connection with a prison disciplinary hearing resulting in Ayers\u2019 confinement in the Special Housing Unit for 140 days. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, with \u201c[a]ll evidence submitted on the motion ... construed in the manner most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Horvath v. Westport Library Ass\u2019n, </em>362 F.3d 147, 151 (2d Cir. 2004). Summary judgment is appropriate only if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Due process requires that an inmate charged with a disciplinary offense receive written notice of the charges against him prior to the hearing \u201cto inform the inmate of what he is accused of doing so that he can prepare a defense to those charges.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Rodriguez, </em>238 F.3d 188, 192 (2d Cir.2001); <em>see also Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). The notice must provide, <em>inter alia^ </em>\u201cat least some \u2018specific facts\u2019 underlying the accusation.\u201d <em>Sira v. Morton, </em>380 F.3d 57, 70 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>238 F.3d at 193).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Ayers argues that the Misbehavior Report which served as his notice stated only that he submitted a \u201ccallout list\u201d of inmates t\u00f3 be allowed to attend Nation of Islam (\u201cN.O.I.\u201d) religious classes, replacing the previously approved list of attendees, and that he was not a DOCS-approved N.O.I. facilitator when he did so. Ayers contends that the Misbehavior Report did not give him notice that at the hearing prison officials intended to introduce evidence that Ayers intended to use N.O.I. meetings for gang or other unauthorized purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">We hold that the notice was constitutionally sufficient. Ayers was charged with violating DOCS Rule 104.12, providing that \u201c[a]n inmate shall not lead, organize, participate, or urge other inmates to participate, in ... actions which may be detrimental to the order of [the] facility.\u201d <em>See </em>N.Y. Comp.Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 7, \u00a7 270.2(5)(iii). The hearing officer concluded that Ayers had violated Rule 104.12 because he was \u201cattempting to improperly affect [sic] change in ... an authorized religious group,\u201d which \u201cwould have had the effect of preventing others from practicing their professed religion,\u201d and because Ayers had admitted that he was not the approved N.O.I. facilitator. Additional evidence presented at the hearing that Ayers was attempting to use N.O.I. gatherings as gang meetings. or that he was introducing a \u201cradical edge\u201d into the N.O.I. went to Ayers\u2019 motive or state of mind, but was not specific offense conduct. The additional evidence may have also been relevant to the charge against Ayers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>under a different DOCS rule prohibiting gang activity, but the charge under that rule was dismissed through the administrative process and is not relevant to this appeal. Ayers was not deprived of due process of law because he was given both (1) notice of the fact that his submission of the callout list formed the basis for the charge, and ultimately for the penalty imposed, under DOCS Rule 104.12, and (2) some specific facts underlying that accusation, namely that he was not an approved N.O.I. facilitator and submitted a callout list which removed the names of twenty-two inmates previously permitted to attend meetings \u201cin an attempt to subvert\u201d N.O.I. meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Finally, we note that it was error for the Misbehavior Report to give the \u201cdate of incident\u201d as the date the Report was filed, instead of the date of the events giving rise to the charge (ie., the date Ayers submitted the callout list). However, that error was harmless because Ayers\u2019 written submissions demonstrated that he suffered from no actual confusion that the incident in question was the submission of the callout list, or as to the date that incident took place. <em>Cf. Sira, </em>380 F.3d at 71-72 (holding that error in date of incident deprives the prisoner of due process where it caused actual confusion as to which events formed the basis of the charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
