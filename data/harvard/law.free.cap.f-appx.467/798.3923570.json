RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">This is a direct appeal by Everett Lee Suniga following his plea of guilty to one count of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine, in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>tion of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). The sole issue raised by Suniga on appeal is whether his sentence of 292 months of imprisonment is substantively unreasonable. After applying an abuse of discretion standard of review, we conclude that the sentence imposed was not substantively unreasonable. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Suniga pled guilty to one count of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). The district court calculated the advisory guidelines range at 292 to 365 months, based in part on the defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history. Suniga\u2019s criminal history resulted in more than double the criminal history points necessary to qualify him for the highest criminal history category. Suniga requested a five-level downward variance to a sentence of fifteen years based on his \u201chorrific times as a child\u201d and his status as a \u201ccompassionate caring man who takes care of his family.\u201d Record on Appeal (ROA), Vol. 2 at 114. The government opposed the motion. After considering the motion and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court determined that a sentence of 292 months\u2019 imprisonment was sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Suniga timely appealed, challenging only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Specifically, Suniga contends that the district court failed to give sufficient weight to Suniga\u2019s experiences as a child and gave too much weight to the advisory guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">We \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Tatum, </em>518 F.3d 769, 770-71 (10th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it renders a judgment that is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Regan, </em>627 F.3d 1348, 1352 (10th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201c[A]s long as the balance struck by the district court among the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a) is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly unreasonable, we must defer to that decision even if we would not have struck the same balance in the first instance.\u201d <em>United States v. Sells, </em>541 F.3d 1227, 1239 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Further, in a case like this, where a sentence falls within the properly calculated guideline range and is later challenged on appeal, we presume that the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Reyes-Alfonso, </em>653 F.3d 1137, 1145 (10th Cir.2011). \u201cThe defendant may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the other sentencing factors laid out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 3553(a) requires the court to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in that section. Factors assessed in making this determination include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-13\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-14\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-4\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established [by Congress or the Sentencing Commission policies and guidelines for crimes of this type];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The district court did consider Suniga\u2019s difficult childhood, ROA, Vol. II at 114-18, but found that the defendant\u2019s childhood did not mitigate Suniga\u2019s \u201cviolent criminal history and his gang involvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116. Further, the court considered the other appropriate factors under \u00a7 3553(a) and found that \u201csuch a severe penalty is warranted in this case to provide not only deterrence to this defendant and others, but to adequately protect the public from the dangers posed by this defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Suniga has failed to rebut the presumption that his within-guideline range sentence is substantively reasonable. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 292-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
