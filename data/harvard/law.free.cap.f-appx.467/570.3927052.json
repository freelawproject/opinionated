We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">Wang testified that Chinese police sought to arrest him because he assaulted a police officer and obstructed official police duties. Wang does not allege he suffered past persecution, but fears persecution in the future. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that, even if credible, Wang failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir. 2004) (ordinary prosecution for criminal activity is not persecution on account of a protected ground). Accordingly, Wang\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See id. </em>at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
