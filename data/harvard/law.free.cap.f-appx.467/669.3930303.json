Beltran contends that the district court erroneously applied a sixteen-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based on Beltran\u2019s 2001 Nevada conviction of attempted burglary. We remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">We apply the modified categorical approach to determine whether Beltran\u2019s 2001 conviction \u201cnecessarily rested\u201d on facts satisfying the elements of generic burglary, including the requirement of an \u201cunlawful or unprivileged\u201d entry. <em>United States v. Aguila-Montes de Oca, </em>655 F.3d 915, 940, 941 (9th Cir.2011) (en banc). The district court had before it two documents from the Nevada conviction. The Judgment of Conviction stated that Beltran pleaded guilty to the statutory definition of attempted burglary. Nevada burglary does not require an \u201cunlawful or unprivileged\u201d entry. <em>See, e.g., Stephans v. State, </em>262 P.3d 727, 729 (Nev.2011) (upholding burglary conviction for shoplifting); <em>Hernandez v. State, </em>118 Nev. 513, 50 P.3d 1100, 1113 (2002). Because the Judgment of Conviction did not indicate that Beltran pleaded guilty \u201cas charged\u201d in the Information, the court could not consider facts alleged in the Information. <em>United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072, 1087 (9th Cir. 2007). Without more, it could not find that Beltran\u2019s guilty plea necessarily admitted the elements of generic burglary. <em>See Aguilar-Montes, </em>655 F.3d at 921 (citing <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). The sixteen-level crime of violence enhancement was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The error was not harmless. \u201cA district court\u2019s mere statement that it would impose the same above-Guidelines sentence no matter what the correct calculation cannot, without more, insulate the sentence from remand, because the court\u2019s analysis did not flow from an initial determination of the correct Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Munoz-Camarena, </em>631 F.3d 1028, 1031 (9th Cir.2011). The sixteen-level enhancement significantly increased the Guidelines range to which Beltran was exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">We therefore AFFIRM the conviction but VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing. On remand, the government may produce, and the court may consider, any documents from the 2001 Nevada conviction permitted under <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Aguilar-Montes. See Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254; <em>Aguila-Montes, </em>655 F.3d at 921. We note, however, that police reports and the probation department\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report are not among these. <em>See AguilarMontes, </em>655 F.3d at 921 <em>(Shepard </em>\u201crejected the ... contention that the sentencing court may look at police reports ... to determine what a guilty plea \u2018necessarily admitted[.]\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
