We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal on the basis of the applicable statute of limitations, and for an abuse of discretion its decision whether to apply equitable tolling. <em>Huynh v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>465 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir. 2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-20\">The district court properly dismissed Ahmad\u2019s Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d) claim as time-barred because Ahmad did not file his action within one year of the alleged violation. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e) (an action for damages must be brought within one year of the alleged violation); <em>King v. California, </em>784 F.2d 910, 914-15 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that \u201cthe limitations period in Section 1640(e) runs from the date of consummation of the transaction\u201d and rejecting a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to apply equitable tolling to Ahmad\u2019s TILA claim. <em>See Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>656 F.3d 1034, 1045 (9th Cir.2011) (noting that equitable tolling applies \u201cin situations where, despite all due diligence, the party invoking equitable tolling is unable to obtain vital information bearing on the existence of the claim\u201d and rejecting equitable tolling for Spanish-speaking plaintiffs on their TILA claim because they had \u201cnot alleged circumstances beyond their control that prevented them from seeking a translation of the loan documents\u201d written in English (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-22\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend. <em>See id. </em>at 1041 (setting forth standard of review and noting that leave to amend may be denied if amendment would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-23\">Ahmad\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Defendants\u2019 request for judicial notice is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b660-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
