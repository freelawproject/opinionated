King contends her 27-month sentence was excessive because: the amount of loss attributed to her was incorrect; and the district court misapplied the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">Post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only and our court applies a bifurcated review, determining whether the sentence is procedurally sound and, if it is, whether it is substantively reasonable. <em>E.g., Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence is procedurally sound if, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the Guidelines sentencing range is presumed reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Camero-Renobato, </em>670 F.3d 633, 636 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">Because King raised only a vague objection in the district court, her sentence is reviewed only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497-99 (5th Cir.2012). To establish reversible plain error, King must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected her substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). This court retains discretion to correct the reversible plain error and generally will do so only if it seriously affects \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">King cites no legal authority to support her contentions that the district court erred when it enhanced her sentence under Guideline \u00a7 3B1.3 for abusing a position of trust and that her 27-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. Therefore, she has waived review of these issues. <em>E.g., United States v. Stalnaker, </em>571 F.3d 428, 439-40 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">King\u2019s contention that the district court misapplied Guideline \u00a7 2B1.1 (determining loss amount) because she did not subjectively intend the loss is unavailing. A loss-amount determination is \u201cthe greater of actual or intended loss\u201d for which \u201cthe court need only make a reasonable estimate\u201d, thus granting \u201cwide latitude\u201d to the district court. <em>See United States v. John, </em>597 F.3d 263, 279 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, \u201cthe method used to calculate the amount of loss ... bear[s] some reasonable relation to the actual or intended harm of the offense\u201d and, accordingly, King fails to show plain error in the district court\u2019s application of Guideline \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">King also contends the district court erred when it enhanced her sentence under Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1 for perjuring herself at trial. The sentencing judge, who was also the trial judge, found King perjured herself. Moreover, she failed to rebut the instances of perjury set forth in the pre-sentence investigation report (PSR). <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (5th Cir.1998) (evidence required to rebut PSR findings). Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that she perjured herself does not amount to plain error. <em>See United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 92-96, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1051-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
