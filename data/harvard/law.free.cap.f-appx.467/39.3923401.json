June 21, 2010), aff'g No. A099 687 201 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 9, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-16\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have considered the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Aliyev v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 111, 115 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Dong was not entitled to asylum or withholding because he failed to demonstrate either that he had been persecuted, or that he had a well-founded fear of persecution, under China\u2019s coercive family planning policy. The fact that Dong\u2019s wife was forced to undergo an abortion is not sufficient to entitle Dong to asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 313 (2d Cir.2007). Rather, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>order to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal on this basis, Dong must demonstrate that he has been, or will be, persecuted on the basis of other resistance to the coercive family planning policies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Dong argues that conceiving a child in violation of the family planning policies constitutes other resistance. He did not, however, raise this argument to the BIA, where he argued only that he was entitled to relief on the basis of his wife\u2019s involuntary abortion. Accordingly, because Dong failed to raise this issue in his brief to the BIA, and because the Government has raised that failure to exhaust in its brief to this Court, we decline to consider Dong\u2019s argument that impregnating his wife in violation of the family planning policies constitutes other resistance sufficient to entitle him to asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Dong also argues that the fine imposed on his family after his wife\u2019s abortion constitutes persecution on the basis of a protected ground. Nothing in the record, however, compels this conclusion. Rather, Dong\u2019s testimony demonstrated that the fine was imposed before he fought with family planning officials, and, thus, was not on account of Dong\u2019s resistance to the family planning policies, but, rather, merely because the couple had violated the policies. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 313. Accordingly, the agency did not err in finding that Dong failed to demonstrate the nexus to a protected ground required to establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Even assuming Dong\u2019s altercation with authorities was \u201cother resistance,\u201d the agency reasonably concluded that Dong had failed to establish that he was persecuted as a result, as he was neither detained nor physically mistreated. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that harm must rise above \u201cmere harassment\u201d to constitute persecution); <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985) (defining persecution as a \u201cthreat to the life or freedom of, or the infliction of suffering or harm upon, those who differ in a way regarded as offensive\u201d), <em>overruled, in part, on other grounds, INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Similarly, Dong failed to establish a fear of future persecution. Other than his testimony that he feared arrest on the basis of his confrontation with the officials, Dong offered no evidence that he would be arrested, detained or otherwise harmed if returned to China. Absent \u201csolid support\u201d in the record that his fear is objectively reasonable, Dong\u2019s claim of future persecution is \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d <em>Jian Xing Huang v. U.S. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005). Therefore, as the agency reasonably found that Dong failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, it did not err by denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)(i); <em>see also Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
