As his sole argument on appeal, Puente Madrigal argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines and reversibly erred when it imposed the 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his 1990 Texas conviction for attempted murder. Puente Madrigal argues that this conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence because the Texas concept of attempt is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of attempt. He argues that Texas has not adopted the \u201csubstantial step\u201d test of the Model Penal Code and that Texas\u2019s approach instead provides for a broader test.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">Puente Madrigal\u2019s arguments have been specifically rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>667 F.3d 555, 560-66 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
