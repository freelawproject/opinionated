Roger Vinson, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b862-19\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b862-20\">This case involves the alleged violation of Plaintiffs federal and state rights and the applicability of federal qualified immunity and state-law immunity to the acts of a state officer making an arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">Briefly stated, Plaintiff \u2014 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \u2014 contends that Defendant Glover subjected him to unlawful seizure, excessive force, and malicious prosecution, all in violation of Plaintiffs federal rights. Plaintiff also contends Defendant violated different Alabama state laws. Defendant says he is entitled to federal qualified immunity and to state law-based immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-22\">Providing no explanation of its reasoning, the district court summarily denied part of Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, granted part of Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, and granted partial summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff. We disapprove of such unexplained orders, particularly orders denying immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-23\">On many occasions, we have instructed district courts \u201cthat their orders should contain sufficient explanations of their rulings so as to provide this Court with an opportunity to engage in meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>We could of course strain to review the record and applicable case law and adjudicate this appeal without a detailed order from the district court. But that course would be difficult and time consuming for the appellate court. We need a chart. A reasoned district court order fully and adequately explaining the facts before, and the thinking of, the district court would help us and benefit the parties and the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Especially in the light of our supervisory powers, we vacate the district court\u2019s summary judgment order and remand the case to the district court to enter a different order that provides full insight into the details of the district court\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-16\">. The original Plaintiff \u2014 Anthony Ruffino \u2014 is now deceased. We granted a motion to substitute Doris Ruffino as personal representative of the estate of Anthony Ruffino.
