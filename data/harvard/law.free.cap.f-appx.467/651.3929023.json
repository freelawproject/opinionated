Defendants-Appellees are Hirsch Glass Co. and Paragon Industries (collectively \u201cHirsch\u201d). Steadly and Hirsch compete in the design, manufacture, and sale of glass tile mosaics. Steadly sued Hirsch to enforce several copyrights to glass tile mosaics that he registered with the Copyright Office. He also alleged a trademark claim under the Lanham Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The district court entered judgment in favor of Hirsch on the trademark and copyright claims, but it denied Hirsch\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Steadly appeals the judgment on the copyright claim. Hirsch cross-appeals the denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Steadly claims that the mosaic designs possess copyrightable \u201ccolor expressions\u201d consisting of color blends, color streaking, and the appearance of random arrangements to evoke a \u201cnatural effect.\u201d Hirsch contends that any copyright protection of Steadly\u2019s designs is thin and so requires \u201cvirtual identity\u201d to raise a claim of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of the copyright claim. First, Steadly enjoys a presumption of validity because he filed suit -within five years of registering his copyright. Second, Steadly\u2019s designs substantially comprise uncopyrightable'elements (including coloring, color blends, streaking, and the appearance of randomness). Thus, protection over his designs is thin. <em>See Satava v. Lowry, </em>323 F.3d 805, 811-13 (9th Cir.2003) (holding copyright protection to a work is thin if originality expressed in combination of uncopyrightable elements is not sufficiently substantial). Third, Hirsch\u2019s designs are not \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to Steadly\u2019s because the streaking effect, color blends, and appearance of randomness in Hirseh\u2019s designs are different for the persuasive reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">We reject Hirsch\u2019s cross-appeal of the attorney\u2019s fees orders. We review a district court\u2019s order on attorney\u2019s fees under the Copyright and Lanham Acts for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ets-Hokin v. Skyy Spirits Inc., </em>323 F.3d 763, 766 (9th Cir. 2003) (Copyright Act); <em>Earthquake Sound Corp. v. Bumper Indus., </em>352 F.3d 1210, 1216 (9th Cir.2003) (Lanham Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">As to the attorney\u2019s fees order under the Copyright Act, the district court correctly identified the multifactor test that we have endorsed and reasonably applied it. <em>See, e.g., Perfect 10, Inc. v. CCBill LLC, </em>488 F.3d 1102, 1120 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Ets-Hokin, </em>323 F.3d at 766. Contrary to Hirsch\u2019s contention, the district court considered the fact that Steadly enjoyed a presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>tion of validity under the Copyright Act as one among many reasons to deny attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As to the attorney\u2019s fees order under the Lanham Act, we note the \u201cuphill battle\u201d that Hirsch faces on appeal. <em>Gracie v. Gracie, </em>217 F.3d 1060, 1071 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cFirst, the remedy is available only in \u2018exceptional cases.\u2019 Second, the statute provides that the court \u2018may\u2019 award fees; it does not require them. Finally, the Senate Report expressly commends this decision to the discretion of the [trial] court.\u201d <em>Polo Fashions, Inc. v. Dick Bruhn, Inc., </em>793 F.2d 1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 1986). The district court acted within its discretion in denying attorney\u2019s fees. Steadly\u2019s claim, though meritless, was not vexatious, unjustifiable, or based on false evidence. <em>Compare Love v. Associated Newspapers, Ltd., </em>611 F.3d 601, 615-16 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Lahoti v. Vericheck, Inc., </em>636 F.3d 501, 510-11 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b680-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
