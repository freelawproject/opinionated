Stewart affirmed the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denying Plaintiff Debra Hubble\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433 (2008). Hubble appeals the decision. For the reasons discussed below, the decision is affirmed. Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we restate them here only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-22\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s rejection of the opinions of Dr. Vradenburg, Hubble\u2019s chiropractor. Dr. Vradenburg\u2019s assessment that Hubble was \u201cfully disabled\u201d was not consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>opinions of the other medical sources who evaluated Hubble. Where medical opinions conflict, the ALJ must weigh the credibility of the sources and resolve the conflict. <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 956-57 (9th Cir.2002). The ALJ is entitled to give greater weight to opinions from \u201cacceptable medical sources,\u201d SSR 06-03p, 2006 WL 2329939, *2, and his conclusion that the other sources were more credible was not unreasonable, <em>Thomas, </em>278 F.3d at 956-57. To the extent that the ALJ was incorrect in stating that Dr. Vradenburg did not perform a physical examination of Hubble and in his interpretation of Dr. Vradenburg\u2019s medical notes regarding Hubble\u2019s ability to control her pain with Ibuprofen, the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The ALJ provided specific, clear, and convincing reasons for rejecting Hubble\u2019s testimony about the extent of her symptoms. <em>Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 856-57 (9th Cir.2001)(citing <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998)). The ALJ reasonably concluded that Hubble\u2019s ability to work with similar impairments in the past undermines her claimed inability to work now. <em>Gregory v. Bowen, </em>844 F.2d 664, 666-67 (9th Cir. 1988). Additionally, the ALJ found that Hubble\u2019s actual activities are inconsistent with a finding of disability, and that all the medical opinions besides Dr. Vradenburg\u2019s support the conclusion that Hubble is capable of sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Nor did the ALJ err in discounting the statement of Mindy Deter, Hubble\u2019s neighbor. It was based entirely upon Hubble\u2019s self-reported symptoms, which the ALJ had already discounted.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The ALJ provided germane reasons to reject the 2005 third-party function report completed by Hubble\u2019s husband, Dan Hubble. The report had been edited by another person, which called into question the credibility of the statements and created inconsistencies within the report. The ALJ did not need to provide reasons to reject Dan Hubble\u2019s 2003 third-party function report because the report was largely consistent with the ALJ\u2019s determination of Hubble\u2019s residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The ALJ properly considered Hubble\u2019s obesity and pain disorder in his determination. He listed both as severe medical impairments and gave significant weight to medical source reports that considered how Hubble\u2019s obesity and pain disorder might exacerbate the extent of her symptoms. His conclusion that they did not further impact her residual functional capacity was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The ALJ also properly determined that Hubble\u2019s impairments do not meet or equal Listing 1.02. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, 1.02. The record does not support Hubble\u2019s contention that she was unable to ambulate effectively for a period lasting longer than 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Additionally, the ALJ did not err in finding that Hubble is capable of performing her past relevant work. The ALJ properly relied on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that Hubble could perform the work as it is generally performed in the national economy, based on a hypothetical presenting Hubble\u2019s residual functional capacity. <em>See Bray v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>554 F.3d 1219, 1228 (9th Cir.2009) (vocational expert opinion evidence is reliable if the hypothetical \u201cset[s] out <em>all </em>the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion at step four, and the ALJ was not required to reach step five.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">The ALJ did not provide specific reasons for rejecting the 2004 and 2008 testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>mony of Dan Hubble, some of which conflicts with the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination. However, based on the totality of the evidence in the record, we are convinced that no reasonable ALJ, even crediting Dan Hubble\u2019s testimony, could have reached a different disability determination. <em>Stout v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1056 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Accordingly, the ALJ properly considered or rejected the evidence in this matter, and substantial evidence supports his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b704-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
