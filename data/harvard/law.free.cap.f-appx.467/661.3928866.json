We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand based on intervening authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">James contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to exercise its discretion in imposing the above-Guidelines sentence without considering James\u2019s individualized circumstances. The record does not support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">However, after James\u2019s sentencing, the Supreme Court issued <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2389, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). In reliance on that decision, we then held that \u201cprison, whether as an initial sentence or on revocation of supervised release, can be imposed and the duration selected only for purposes of retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation, not rehabilitation.\u201d <em>United States v. Grant, </em>664 F.3d 276, 282 (9th Cir.2011). Because we cannot ascertain on the record before us whether the district court based its sentence in part on James\u2019s need for rehabilitation (and a longer sentence in order to qualify him for intensive drug abuse treatment), and the district did not have the benefit of <em>Tapia </em>and <em>Grant, </em>we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A9S\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
