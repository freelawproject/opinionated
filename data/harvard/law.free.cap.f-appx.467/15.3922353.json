We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-18\">\u201cWhen deciding an appeal from a denial of ... benefits, [this Court] focusfes] on the administrative ruling rather than the district court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Acierno v. Barnhart, </em>475 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review is deferential, and we set aside the Commissioner\u2019s determination only where such determination \u201cis based upon legal error or not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Berry v. Schweiker, </em>675 F.2d 464, 467 (2d Cir.1982) <em>(per curiam). </em>\u201cFailure to apply the correct legal standard constitutes reversible error, including, in certain circumstances, failure to adhere to the applicable regulations.\u201d <em>Kohler v. Astrue, </em>546 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>260, 265 (2d Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted). Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Curry v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir.2000), <em>superceded by statute on other grounds, </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(c)(2) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Akey contends that (1) the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred in assessing his mental Residual Functional Capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d); (2) the ALJ erred in assessing his physical RFC; (3) the ALJ improperly relied on a flawed hypothetical posed to the vocational expert; and (4) the ALJ committed error in finding that Akey\u2019s testimony regarding the intensity, persistence, and limitations associated with his pain and other symptoms was not \u201centirely credible.\u201d Each of Akey\u2019s arguments is taken in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">First, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Akey was intellectually capable of performing unskilled and semi-skilled work and that he suffered no other mental functional limitations for work. Although Akey points to Nurse Practitioner Jacobsen\u2019s report that Akey suffered from a \u201cmarked limitation\u201d in dealing with work stress, the ALJ did not err in discounting her opinion because she has no expertise in psychology or psychiatry. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(5), 416.927(d)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">As to the physical RFC, Akey failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s determination in his Report and Recommendation that Akey\u2019s physical RFC was supported by substantial evidence. Because Akey\u2019s argument does not have \u201csubstantial merit,\u201d we decline to review the issue. <em>See Spence v. Superintendent, Great Meadow Corr. Facility, </em>219 F.3d 162, 174 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Akey\u2019s contention that the hypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert were flawed is unavailing. The ALJ\u2019s failure to include the limitation to unskilled and semi-skilled work is harmless because the only jobs the vocational expert identified were unskilled or semiskilled. As such, the ALJ did not err by relying on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony as evidence that Akey could perform work existing in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">Finally, the ALJ did not err in finding that Akey\u2019s statements regarding the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of his pain and symptoms were not \u201centirely credible.\u201d The ALJ properly noted the relevant legal standards and identified the factors supporting his conclusion. Contrary to Akey\u2019s claims, the ALJ did consider Akey\u2019s consistent earnings record in his credibility analysis, but nevertheless determined that his statements were not entirely credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">After a thorough review of the record, we find Akey\u2019s remaining arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
