HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b60-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b60-20\">Appellants appeal from the district court\u2019s entry of default judgment against them, and from the district court\u2019s entry of default, denial of their motion to vacate the entry of default, and denial of their motion for reconsideration. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-21\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for entry of default or for entry of default judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Pecarsky v. Galaxiworld.com Ltd., </em>249 F.3d 167, 171 (2d Cir.2001); <em>New York v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Green, </em>420 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.2005) (stating that we have \u201cexpressed a strong preference for resolving disputes on the merits\u201d and that a default judgment is \u201cthe most severe sanction which the court may apply\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). The district court judge is \u201cthe person most familiar with the circumstances of the case and is in the best position to evaluate the good faith and credibility of the parties,\u201d thus a reviewing court will defer to his decision unless it is clearly wrong. <em>Davis v. Musler, </em>713 F.2d 907, 912 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">I. Entry of Default</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Appellants argue that the district court\u2019s entry of default was procedurally flawed because Peterson did not request an entry of default from the district court. The plain language of Rule 55(a) however does not mandate that a default be entered only upon plaintiffs request but rather implies that however a district court ultimately becomes aware of a party\u2019s default, the clerk must enter default. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(a). Although Rule 55(a) contemplates that entry of a default is a \u201cministerial\u201d step to be performed by the clerk of court, a district court judge also possesses the inherent power to enter a default. <em>Beller &amp; Keller v. Tyler, </em>120 F.3d 21, 22 n. 1 (2d Cir.1997); <em>see also Pinaud v. Cnty. of Suffolk, </em>52 F.3d 1139, 1152 n. 11 (2d Cir.1995) (describing \u201cthe entry of default\u201d as \u201clargely a formal matter\u201d). The district court did not err in entering default against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">II. Motion to Vacate Entry of Default</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Rule 55(c) permits a party to be relieved of default \u201cfor good cause,\u201d whereas a default judgment may only be set aside in accordance with Rule 60(b). Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(c). While Rule 55(c) does not define \u201cgood cause,\u201d this Court has advised district courts to consider three criteria in deciding a Rule 55(c) motion: (1) whether the default was willful; (2) whether setting aside the default would prejudice the party for whom default was awarded; and' (3) whether the moving party has presented a meritorious defense. <em>Enron Oil Corp. v. Diakuhara, </em>10 F.3d 90, 96 (2d Cir.1993). The same factors are applied in the context of a Rule 60(b) motion to set aside a default judgment, although they are applied more rigorously, and the district court must resolve any doubts in the defaulting party\u2019s favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Here because the defendants moved for relief pursuant to Rule 55(c) prior to the entry of default judgment, their motion warranted consideration under the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard. While the district court\u2019s decision did not explicitly state whether it applied the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard under Rule 55(c) or the stricter standard of Rule 60(b) to evaluate the defendants\u2019 motion, the district court ultimately concluded that relief was not warranted under either Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">In the present case, we need not address the first criteria, whether the default was willful, because on balance the district court properly concluded that the other two criterion were met. There was nothing improper in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Peterson would suffer prejudice due to the defendants\u2019 actions. The fact that Peterson did not file a single discovery request during the entire discovery period may have mitigated any prejudice suffered by Peterson, but this fact does not render the district court\u2019s finding of prejudice an abuse of discretion. Rather, as the district court noted, prejudice may be found where a plaintiff would suffer increased difficulty in conducting discovery, as Peterson would here due to his lack of knowledge of the defendants\u2019 affir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>mative defenses with only a week remaining in the discovery period. <em>See Davis, </em>713 F.2d at 916 (noting that substantial prejudice could be shown by \u201cincreased difficulties of discovery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Nor did the district court improperly conclude that the defendants had not established a meritorious defense. While the district court may have overlooked a fact presented in the defendants\u2019 memorandum of law stating that it was Peterson who became belligerent and began fighting with the officers, this error was harmless because unsworn statements in a memorandum of law are not evidence. <em>See Kulhawik v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 296, 298 (2d Cir.2009). Moreover, even that memorandum did not traverse the claim that the defendants used <em>excessive </em>force. The defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the entry of default was almost completely devoid of reference to any underlying facts regarding their defenses and contained no facts, which, if proven at trial, would constitute a complete defense to Peterson\u2019s excessive force claim. The district court did not err in concluding that Appellants had not established a meritorious defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">III. Entry of Default Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Once a plaintiff has obtained an entry of default pursuant to Rule 55(a), to obtain a default judgment the plaintiff must follow the provisions of Rule 55(b). <em>Green, </em>420 F.3d at 104. An entry of default judgment \u201cconverts the defendant\u2019s admission of liability into a final judgment that terminates the litigation and awards the plaintiff any relief to which the court decides [the plaintiff] is entitled.\u201d <em>City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, </em>645 F.3d 114, 128 (2d Cir.2011). A default judgment may not be entered until the amount <em>of </em>damages has been ascertained. <em>Enron, </em>10 F.3d at 95, 97. Here, the district court\u2019s December 2, 2010 default judgment against the defendants was improper because the district court entered that judgment before the amount of damages had been ascertained. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s entry of default judgment must be vacated, and the case remanded so the district court may conduct further proceedings to ascertain the amount of damages to which Peterson is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">IV. Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">We review the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Schwartz v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>539 F.3d 135, 150 (2d Cir.2008). A court may grant a motion to alter or amend a judgment where (1) there is an intervening change in the controlling law; (2) new evidence previously not available comes to light; or (3) it becomes necessary to remedy a clear error of law or to prevent manifest injustice. <em>Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat\u2019l Mediation Bd., </em>956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir.1992). With respect to the Rule 59(e) motion that Appellants filed after the district court granted the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>for default judgment, Appellants argue the district court should have granted their Rule 59(e) motion based on \u201cevidence previously not available\u201d and to prevent manifest injustice. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule 59(e) motion advanced on that basis. While Peterson\u2019s deposition transcript attached to the defendants\u2019 motion may not have been available when the defendants filed their motion to vacate the entry of default, the transcript does not reveal any facts that, if proven at trial, would constitute a complete defense. The remaining \u201cevidence,\u201d including the officers\u2019 narratives stating the details surrounding Peterson\u2019s arrest, was all available prior to the initiation of Peterson\u2019s complaint. Finally, the district court properly concluded that manifest injustice would not result from the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Accordingly, we VACATE the default judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings. If either parties appeal the judgment of the district court, the appeal will be assigned to this panel. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s entry of default against the defendants and the denial of the defendants\u2019 motions to vacate the entry of default and for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">. On appeal, Appellants argue that, because the district court\u2019s entry of default judgment was improper as it was entered prior to a calculation of damages, their evidence submitted in support of their motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) should be considered a second Rule 55(c) motion to vacate the entry of default. However, Appellants provide no support for that proposition. To the contrary, \u201c[a] district court has the inherent power to reconsider and modify its interlocutory orders prior to the entry of judgment,\u201d as the district court did here. <em>See United States v. LoRusso, </em>695 F.2d 45, 53 (2d Cir.1982). Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 motion should not be viewed a second motion to vacate the entry of default.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
