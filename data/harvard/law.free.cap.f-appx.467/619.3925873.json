We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008). - The court reviews for abuse of discretion a denial of a motion to remand, <em>de Jesus Melendez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1019, 1023 (9th Cir.2007). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">Reynosa-Galicia does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive determination that his asylum application was time-barred. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Reynosa-Galicia\u2019s withholding of removal claim because Reynosa-Galicia failed to establish that an enumerated ground was one central reason he was attacked. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">Reynosa-Galicia has not raised arguments challenging the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim. <em>See Martinez-Serrano, </em>94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>F.3d at 1259-60 (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Finally, the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand because Reynosa-Galicia did not present additional evidence warranting a remand. <em>See Shin v. Mukasey, </em>547 F.3d 1019, 1025 (9th Cir.2008) (internal citation omitted) (\u201cAliens who seek to remand or reopen proceedings to pursue relief bear a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 of proving that, if proceedings were reopened, the new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b648-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
