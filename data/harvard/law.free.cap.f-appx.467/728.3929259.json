We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, including the adverse credibility determinations. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on discrepancies between Singh\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence regarding continuing interest in him by Indian police, and the lack of specificity in his testimony. <em>See Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 739 (9th Cir.2007) (inconsistencies between testimony and documentary evidence that went to the heart of the claim supported the adverse credibility determination). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, Singh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">Because Singh\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the agency found not credible, and he points to no other arguments showing it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to India, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b757-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
