After careful review, we conclude the revocation and sentence were proper. The district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Cran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ford\u2019s supervised release, as the supervised-release violations to which he admitted-including multiple failed drug tests, as well as failures to report for drug testing and treatment-were not merely an accumulation of technical violations. <em>See United States v. Melton, </em>666 F.3d 513, 516 (8th Cir.2012) (standard of review; revocation is appropriate where violations, while not presenting danger to society, \u201cindicate[ ] a pervasive unwillingness to follow the rehabilitation program\u201d). In addition, we conclude that the court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see United States v. White Face, </em>383 F.3d 733, 740 (8th Cir.2004) (court need not list every \u00a7 3553(a) factor when sentencing defendant upon revocation of supervised release; if sentencing judge references some \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court is satisfied that district court was aware of entire contents of relevant statute), and that Cranford did not possess a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in his revocation hearing, <em>see United States v. Ray, </em>530 F.3d 666, 668 (8th Cir.2008) (Sixth Amendment does not apply to supervised-release revocation hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, subject to counsel informing Cranford about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">.
