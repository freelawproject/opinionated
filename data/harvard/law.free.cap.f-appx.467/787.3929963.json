We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">In March 2011, Bangerter sued Roach, \u201can employee of the [Utah] Office of Guardian Ad Litem,\u201d for violating her due-process rights. Aplt.App. at 4. Bangerter claimed that \u201cRoach used her position at the Office of Guardian Ad Litem\u201d to become the \u201cguardian ad litem for Plaintiffs three minor children\u201d despite having a conflict of interest. ApltApp. at 6. Once appointed, Roach \u201cabandon[ed] her role of representing the best interest of the children in order to show favor to a private attorney and her client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Further, Roach purportedly \u201cignored reports of neglect of one of the minor children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">The district court dismissed Bangerter\u2019s complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), concluding that Roach, as a guardian ad litem, was not a state actor hable under \u00a7 1983. It also found Bangerter\u2019s allegations about Roach\u2019s pre-appointment conduct to be unsupported and conclusory. Finally, the court rejected Bangerter\u2019s summary request for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo, accepting as true all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir.2009). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation omitted). In other words, the \u201c[factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,\u201d and a complaint that merely offers \u201clabels and conclusions,\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,\u201d is insufficient. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">As the district court noted, guardians ad litem are not state actors for purposes of \u00a7 1983 because they give their \u201cundivided loyalty to the minor, not the state.\u201d <em>Meeker v. Kercher, </em>782 F.2d 153, 155 (10th Cir.1986) (per curiam). To circumvent this principle, Bangerter argues that her \u201ccomplaint deals with [Roach\u2019s] actions <em>before </em>her appointment as guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>ian ad litem.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 18. But that characterization of the complaint is not accurate. Most of the complaint deals with post-appointment conduct. And while there is an allegation targeting pre-appointment conduct, it is so vague and conclusory that it fails to raise a right to relief. Specifically, Roach allegedly failed to disclose a conflict of interest, and \u201cmaneuvered] and manipulated] her way to be appointed ... through a series of unlawful acts and assist a private attorney [sic].\u201d ApltApp. at 6. We are left to speculate as to how this conduct \u2014 which apparently occurred when she was an \u201cemployee of the Office of Guardian Ad Litem,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4 \u2014 necessarily constitutes state action, and if it does, how it violated Bangerter\u2019s due-process rights. We conclude that Bangerter\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim for relief. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (stating that a \u201cpleading must contain something more than a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion of a legally cognizable right of action\u201d (quotation and alterations omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Bangerter argues that, in any event, the nature of the district court\u2019s dismissal \u2014 with prejudice \u2014 was inappropriate. She contends that her complaint advanced state and common-law claims, and that pleading deficiencies could have been cured by amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss with prejudice for abuse of discretion. <em>U.S. ex rel. Stone v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>282 F.3d 787, 809 (10th Cir.2002). \u201cA dismissal with prejudice is appropriate where a complaint fails to state a claim ... and granting leave to amend would be futile.\u201d <em>Brereton v. Bountiful City Corp., </em>434 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">In seeking leave to amend, Bangerter never filed a formal motion in the district court. Rather, in her opposition to Roach\u2019s motion to dismiss, she merely requested that \u201cat a minimum Plaintiff be allowed leave to amend any possible perceived pleading failures.\u201d ApltApp. at 25. Such cursory requests for leave to amend are insufficient. <em>See Garman v. Campbell Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. 1, </em>630 F.3d 977, 986 (10th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 95, 181 L.Ed.2d 24 (2011). Further, leave to amend would have been futile, given that the lawsuit targeted a defendant whose conduct as a guardian ad litem is generally beyond the scope of \u00a7 1983 liability. Finally, insofar as Bangerter asserts that she had pleaded facts supporting state and common-law claims, the complaint itself asserts that \u201call current claims deal with constitutional violations [sic] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d Aplt.App. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">We determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making the dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b816-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">. To the extent that Bangerter\u2019s complaint named \"John and Jane Does 1-50\u201d as defendants, there are no allegations that implicate a claim for relief against them.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
