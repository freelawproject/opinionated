As explained below, we have already concluded that the FSA must be applied in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">On July 8, 2010, Mario Hamlin pleaded guilty to two counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Count I was based on a transaction on January 16, 2008, in which Hamlin sold 48.9 grams of crack cocaine to a confidential source who was working with the Drug Enforcement Agency. Count II was based on a transaction that occurred approximately two weeks later on January 31, 2008, in which Hamlin sold 65.3 grams of crack cocaine to the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">At that time, penalties for Hamlin\u2019s offenses were controlled by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) (2006). Under that law, a conviction for an offense, involving at least fifty grams of a substance containing cocaine base, required a mandatory minimum prison sentence of ten years, \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). On August 3, 2010, Congress changed this sentencing scheme through the FSA in order to address a disparity between sentences for crimes such as Hamlin\u2019s that involved crack cocaine and those that involved powdered cocaine. <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2, 124 Stat. 2372, 2372 (2010). As a result, under the FSA, an amount of at least 280 grams of a substance containing cocaine base was required to trigger the mandatory minimum ten-year sentence. Hamlin\u2019s offenses involved less than 280 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">When Hamlin subsequently appeared for sentencing on December 3, 2010, he and the government did not agree whether this statutory change affected his case. Hamlin argued that the FSA controlled any sentence imposed after its enactment, but the government maintained that it did not. Although the District Court noted that, without the 10-year mandatory minimum, it would probably have sentenced Hamlin at the low end of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 seventy to eighty-seven month range, the court adopted the government\u2019s position and sentenced Hamlin to ten years in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Hamlin now appeals, arguing that the District Court\u2019s application of a ten-year mandatory minimum to Count II was inappropriate in light of the changes effectuated by the FSA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree. We recently held in <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>648 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>195 (3d Cir.2011), that the FSA applies to any sentence imposed after its August 3, 2010, enactment regardless of when the underlying crime was committed. Because Hamlin was sentenced on December 3, 2010, the court should have sentenced him pursuant to the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">We will, therefore, vacate the judgment of sentence and remand this case to the District Court for resentencing under the FSA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-13\">. Specifically, Hamlin was sentenced to 120 months in prison \"at both Count I and Count II,\" to be served concurrently, a five-year term of supervised release and a $200 mandatory assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-18\"><em>. </em>We have jurisdiction over Hamlin's appeal on the basis of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and our review is plenary. <em>See United States v. Reevey, </em>631 F.3d 110, 112 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
