We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-17\">Martinez contends that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to decrease his offense level on the basis of his role in the offense, grant a downward departure by reducing the offense level by one level on the basis that the offense constituted behavior that was aberrant for him, and grant a downward departure by reducing the offense level by two levels in exchange for his stipulating to deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Reasonableness review is bifurcated. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We must first decide whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is procedurally sound, we next consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing for reasonableness, we \u201cmerely ask[] whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230, 238-39 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-23\">Martinez contends that he played a minor role in the offense and consequently should have been given a two-level reduction in his offense level, citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b). A defendant bears the burden of showing that the PSR is inaccurate; in the absence of credible rebuttal evidence, the sentencing court may adopt the PSR\u2019s findings as its own. <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>47 F.3d 688, 690 (5th Cir.1995). Martinez produced no evidence that he played <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>a minor role. He offered only the arguments of his counsel that the PSR did not accurately reflect the facts about his role. Martinez has not shown that the district court committed procedural error in adopting the PSR and declining to grant him the minor-role reduction. <em>See Ayala, </em>47 F.3d at 690; <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146 (5th Cir.1996). Consequent ly, he cannot prevail on his claim that it was error to deny him the additional four-level adjustment available only to someone who \u201creceives an adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Martinez any reduction for a mitigating role.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We also reject Martinez\u2019s contention that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to depart downward on the basis of aberrant behavior. We have no jurisdiction to consider the claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying a downward departure, as the record shows that the district court understood that it was free to depart from the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir. 2006). We may consider whether the sentence was unreasonable because the district court \u201cfailed adequately to consider factors counseling in favor of a downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). However, a downward departure for aberrant behavior is improper in light of the pertinent Guideline policy statement, which provides that this departure is not available if the \u201coffense of conviction is a serious drug trafficking offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20(e)(3). Martinez\u2019s drug trafficking offense carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). Thus, Martinez was ineligible for a downward departure for aberrant behavior. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20 cmt. n. 1 (defining serious <em>drug trafficking </em>offense). The district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting a departure on the basis of aberrant behavior. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>Castillo, </em>430 F.3d at 238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Additionally, we find no merit to Martinez\u2019s claim that, under \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2)(B), he should have been given a downward departure because he was willing to stipulate to deportation. The district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting Martinez\u2019s novel argument for imposing a sentence below the Guidelines range; Martinez\u2019s within-range sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d at 375-76; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
