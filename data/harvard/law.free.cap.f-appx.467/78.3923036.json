Nelson denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ying Shi, </em>No. A094 922 372 (B.I.A. May 11, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A094 922 372 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 29, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Shi does not challenge the agency\u2019s findings that he did not suffer past persecution, but argues that he established that he will be targeted for sterilization upon return to China because of his \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy. The agency reasonably determined that Shi failed to establish that his fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable, given that he only claims to have heard from other people that family planning officials wanted to sterilize him, he lived and worked in his home province for one year without incident after he heard that family planning officials wanted to sterilize him, and he did not testify that he took any efforts to conceal his presence during that time. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that a fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d). <em>Cf. Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999) (finding that where asylum applicant\u2019s mother and daughters continued to live in petitioner\u2019s native country, claim of well-founded fear was diminished).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Although Shi claims that background materials established the objective reasonableness of his fear, Shi did not present any evidence of forced sterilization in his home province of Fujian, <em>see Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 160-61, 169-70 (2d Cir.2008), and the BIA specifically addressed the background evidence submitted and reasonably concluded that the evidence did not establish that Shi would be unable to live securely outside of his home village, <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Because objective evidence of future harm is required for withholding of removal and CAT relief, the agency did not err in denying relief based on Shi\u2019s failure to establish that his fear of future sterilization was objectively reasonable. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178, 183-86 (2d Cir.2004) (providing that CAT claim requires petitioner to \u201cproffer objective evidence that he or she is likely to be tortured in the future\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
