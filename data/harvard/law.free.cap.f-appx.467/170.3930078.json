Garcia-Rosario\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states that he has divined no meritorious grounds for appeal but requesting that we review Garcia-Rosario\u2019s guilty plea and sentence for error. Having reviewed the record, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-19\">Because Garcia-Rosario did not challenge the validity of his guilty plea in the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the record convinces us that Garcia-Rosario\u2019s guilty plea was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-20\">As for his sentence, we review it for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In this case, as all parties recognize, the district court simply sentenced Garcia-Rosario to the only term of imprisonment permissible by law: twenty years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(d) (twenty-year maximum for attempted kidnapping); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(g) (twenty-year minimum for a kidnapping offense involving a minor victim). It was eminently reasonable for the district court to follow its statutory obligation. Moreover, the twenty-year term of supervised release was within the range prescribed by statute 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-21\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Garcia-Rosario, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Garcia-Rosario requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Garcia-Rosario.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
