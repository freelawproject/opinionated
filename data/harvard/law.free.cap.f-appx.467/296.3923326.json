Duberney argues that his \u00a7 2241 petition falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) because his prior conviction for interstate transportation in aid of racketeering with intent to promote cocaine and marijuana trafficking did not constitute a drug trafficking offense warranting a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir. 2005). A \u00a7 2241 petition raising errors \u201cthat occurr[ed] at trial or sentencing is properly construed [as arising] under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may, however, be entertained under the savings clause if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">To demonstrate that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, Duberney must establish that his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. The first \u201cfactor requires that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establish that the petitioner is actually innocent,\u201d meaning that he \u201cmay have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830-31 (5th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Duberney is unable to satisfy this factor by merely claiming that the district court improperly applied a sentencing enhancement because the claim does not rely on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision showing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See id.; see also Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427; <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
