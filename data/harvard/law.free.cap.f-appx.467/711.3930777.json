The district court dismissed their appeal for lack of standing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The Bankruptcy Code allows the trustee of a bankruptcy estate to move the bankruptcy court for authority to sell or settle a cause of action. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363; <em>In re Mickey Thompson Entm\u2019t Grp., Inc., </em>292 B.R. 415, 421 (9th Cir. BAP 2003). The trustee must give interested parties notice twenty-one days<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before the sale or hearing on approval of settlement, and provide an opportunity to object. Fed. R. Bankr. Proc. 6004(a), 9019(a), 2002(a)(2)-(3), (c)(1). However, a trustee\u2019s management of the other procedural details surrounding bidding and sale are \u201cultimately a matter of discretion that depends upon the dynamics of the particular situation.\u201d <em>Mickey Thompson, </em>292 B.R. at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The Smedings observe that in this case the trustee originally noticed a proposal to sell the estate\u2019s claims to the Smedings, not to Ahcom. The Smedings argue that when the trustee decided to instead seek approval of Ahcom\u2019s counteroffer, the trustee was obligated to provide a new twenty-day notice. However, the trustee\u2019s notice clearly contemplated the possibility of sale to a higher bidder. It informed the interested parties that Ah-com \u201chas expressed interest in potentially overbidding for control of these causes of action\u201d and that \u201c[ajccordingly, this compromise is subject to overbids.\u201d The Smedings argue that any such overbid should have come by way of the telephonic auction procedure proposed by the trustee, not by way of an objection. However, the notice outlined procedures for objections as well as for overbids, and the Smedings identify no rule or court order which required Ahcom to choose the overbid route instead of the objection route. We hold that the trustee gave the required notice of its intention to sell the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The Smedings raise a new version of their argument in their reply brief. They observe that the causes of action the trustee originally planned to sell to the Smedings did not include a fiduciary duty claim, but that the causes of action the trustee ended up selling to Hacking did. They argue that the trustee never gave notice of the sale of the fiduciary duty claim. However, in spite of the fact that Ahcom\u2019s objections put the Smedings on notice that Ahcom was offering to buy the fiduciary duty claim, the Smedings never mentioned the issue in their objections to the bankruptcy court or at the hearing, gave no sign of being surprised, and never identified any prejudice they suffered as creditors as a result. They therefore do not have standing to raise the issue on appeal. <em>See In re Commercial W. Fin. Corp., </em>761 F.2d 1329, 1335 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
