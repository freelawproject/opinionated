California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Encinas has not filed a response. We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. The judgment should be corrected to reflect that Encinas pleaded guilty to and was convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams, not 500 kilograms, or more of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2. The case is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
