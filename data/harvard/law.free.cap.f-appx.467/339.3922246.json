It challenged his jury-trial conviction for possession of more than 30 grams of cocaine, for which he was sentenced to 60-years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-21\">Dora moved our court to expand the COA to include additional claims addressed in his brief, but our court denied that motion. Therefore, our court has jurisdiction to review only the two claims of prosecutorial misconduct that the district court certified. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>Carty v. Thaler, </em>583 F.3d 244, 266 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-22\">Dora contends the district court erred in rejecting his claim that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. A prosecutor\u2019s comment on defendant\u2019s decision not to testify warrants habeas relief only if it \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 627, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see <em>also Fry v. Pliler, </em>551 U.S. 112, 120, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007) (holding <em>Brecht </em>harmless-error standard \u201csubsumes\u201d deference owed under \u00a7 2254(d) to state court\u2019s denial of such constitutional claim on merits). In the light of the evidence presented at his trial, Dora failed to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">Although he contends the closing argument also violated the Mississippi Constitution, \u201cfederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law\u201d. <em>E.g., Es</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>telle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, Dora contends, for the first time in his reply brief, that the prosecutor made other improper comments. \u201cThis court does not entertain arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 203 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Relying on <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), Dora contends the State violated his due-process rights by failing to inform him prior to trial that a witness intended to incriminate Dora and to recant her previous statement that the cocaine in question belonged to her. Dora does not, however, dispute the district court\u2019s finding that the State disclosed the witness\u2019 initial statement. The <em>Brady </em>rule \u201capplies only to impeachment and exculpatory evidence; neutral or inculpatory evidence lies outside its coverage\u201d. <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>881 F.2d 1305, 1308 (5th Cir.1989). In addition, evidence is material and therefore subject to disclosure under <em>Brady </em>\u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d. <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Dora fails to show the district court erred in ruling that the witness\u2019 intent to incriminate Dora fell outside the scope of <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
