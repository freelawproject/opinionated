June 14, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir. 2006)(per curiam). Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Huang\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred, as it was her second motion to reopen and she filed it seven years after her final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C) (2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Although the time limits on motions to reopen may be excused when the movant demonstrates changed country conditions, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) (2006), the BIA reasonably concluded that only Huang\u2019s personal circumstances had changed, as her claim was based on the fact that she began practicing Falun Gong in the United States in 2008. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 151-56 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Moreover, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Huang failed to establish that conditions in China had changed materially for Falun Gong practitioners. While the evidence indicated that repression of Falun Gong practitioners increased around the 2008 Olympics, the evidence also demonstrated that the repression has been constant and ongoing since the time of Huang\u2019s hearing in 2001, and Huang did not submit evidence indicating that any increased repression of Falun Gong practitioners continued after the 2008 Olympics and into 2009. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 167 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d)(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008) (reviewing the BIA\u2019s factual findings regarding changed country conditions under the substantial evidence standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Finally, given the BIA\u2019s explicit references to the documentation submitted with the motion to reopen, a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude that the BIA ignored any of Huang\u2019s evidence. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006)(holding that the BIA is not required to \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each\u201d individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner as long as it \u201chas given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings\u201d)(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Huang\u2019s motion. <em>See Ali, </em>448 F.3d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
