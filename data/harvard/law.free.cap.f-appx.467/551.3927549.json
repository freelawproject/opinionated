We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Camara omitted from his asylum application that government forces shot and killed his parents and sister at the time of his own detention, <em>see Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003), and his testimony was vague and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>lacking in detail, <em>see Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1999) (level of specificity appropriate consideration in adverse credibility determination). In the absence of credible testimony, Camara\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Because Camara\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he points to no other evidence that shows it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Mauritania, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
