Apr. 21, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 782 874 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 8, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the two decisions in tandem. <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review applies, <em>Islam v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 53, 55 (2d Cir.2006), and we uphold the IJ\u2019s factual findings if the are supported by \u201creasonable, substantial and probative evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 116 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, such as this one, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Analyzed under the REAL ID Act, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">In finding Chen not credible, the agency reasonably relied on inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s testimony and that of her witness with regard to the date on which Chen joined the China Democratic Party (\u201cCDP\u201d) in the United States, whether Chen authored an article that was published on the CDP\u2019s website in July 2007, the frequency of visits from Chinese officials to Chen\u2019s family\u2019s home in China, and the stated purpose of a March 2009 political demonstration in which Chen participated on behalf of the CDP. Although Chen argues that these inconsistencies were too minor to support an adverse credibility determination, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008)(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Furthermore, Chen\u2019s argument that the IJ erred in failing to solicit an explanation for the inconsistencies between her testimony and that of her witness is without merit. While it is true that an IJ may not rest an adverse credibility finding on a non-dramatic discrepancy without first putting a petitioner on notice and offering an opportunity to explain it, <em>see Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 125 (2d Cir. 2006), the agency need not give such notice and opportunity where, as here, it relied on dramatic discrepancies that went to the very heart of Chen\u2019s claim for asylum. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as the agency reasonably found, the discrepancies between Chen\u2019s testimony and that of her witness were not minor and did, in fact, relate to the heart of her claim that she feared persecution if returned to China on account of her CDP activities in the United States, as they directly pertained to the date on which she became a member of the CDP, and the extent of her involvement in political activities that evinced her opposition to the Chinese regime. Accordingly, the IJ was not required to specifically request an explanation for these inconsistencies: where the \u201cinconsistency is \u2018dramatic\u2019 or obvious on its face ... the petitioner can be assumed to be aware-without being told-of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the need to explain it.\u201d <em>Ming Shi Xue, </em>439 F.3d at 122 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We therefore conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 165-66. This determination is dispositive of both Chen\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal, as both claims are based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
