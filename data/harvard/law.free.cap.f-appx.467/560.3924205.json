We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Singh v. Holder, </em>638 F.3d 1264, 1268-69 (9th Cir.2011), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Xu\u2019s submission of a fraudulent employment termination letter, <em>see id. </em>at 1272, the discrepancies between Xu\u2019s testimony and nonimmigrant visa application regarding his educational and employment background, <em>see Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003), and Xu\u2019s inconsistent testimony regarding his surveillance by authorities, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004). The agency reasonably rejected Xu\u2019s explanations. <em>See Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). In the absence of credible testimony, Xu\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">Because Xu\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b589-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
