We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>district court\u2019s interpretation of a settlement agreement, and for clear error any factual findings made in interpreting the settlement agreement. <em>City of Emeryville v. Robinson, </em>621 F.3d 1251, 1261 (9th Cir. 2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The district court properly dismissed Bahaudin\u2019s action as barred by the terms of the settlement agreement resolving his prior employment action. <em>See Stroman v. W. Coast Grocery Co., </em>884 F.2d 458, 461-63 (9th Cir.1989) (Title VII claims barred by prior agreement where waiver was voluntary, deliberate, and informed). Bahaudin failed to establish that the settlement agreement was procured by fraud and was therefore invalid. <em>See Pardi v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., </em>389 F.3d 840, 848 (9th Cir.2004) (upholding settlement agreement where plaintiff failed to establish that the agreement was procured by fraud or any other basis that would render it invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing without leave to amend because amendment would be futile. <em>See Gordon v. City of Oakland, </em>627 F.3d 1092, 1094 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Bahaudin\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We do not consider arguments and allegations raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Padgett v. Wright, </em>587 F.3d 983, 985 n. 2 (9th Cir.2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
