He has two U.S. citizen children and other U.S. citizen relatives. He appeals his conviction for attempted entry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Rodriguez moved before the district court for dismissal of that count of his indictment, alleging that his deportations in 1998 and 2005 were invalid. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). The government conceded error in the 1998 deportation. The district court determined that the 2005 deportation was valid and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-24\">Rodriguez alleges that he was deprived of due process in his 2005 deportation because he was not adequately informed of his right to apply for voluntary departure. \u201cThe requirement that the IJ inform an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>alien of his or her ability to apply for relief from removal is mandatory, and failure to so inform the alien of his or her eligibility for relief from removal is a denial of due process that invalidates the underlying deportation proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d 1042, 1048 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). We have held that this specifically applies to voluntary departure, <em>see United States v. Arias-Ordonez, </em>597 F.3d 972 (9th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Ortiz-Lopez, </em>385 F.3d 1202 (9th Cir.2004), and that the advice must be \u201cmeaningful[ ],\u201d <em>see United States v. Melendez-Castro, </em>671 F.3d 950, 952 (9th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Rodriguez was deprived of due process during the 2005 deportation hearing because, like the defendant in <em>Melendez-Castro, </em>he was advised of the availability of voluntary departure, but \u201cwas not meaningfully advised of his right to seek\u201d such relief or to file an application seeking it. <em>Id. </em>The IJ\u2019s discussion of voluntary departure was ambiguous at best. He referred to it during the group hearing and told the aliens about some of its benefits, but he did not explain the circumstances under which such relief was available. The IJ simply told the group that in the afternoon, when he spoke with them individually, he would ask questions about their \u201cequities\u201d and that if the alien believed he should be granted voluntary departure, he should explain his \u201cequities.\u201d At the very end of the group hearing, the IJ stated that he would go over each of the items in their charging documents \u201cto determine whether there\u2019s any relief that [they] could apply for.\u201d But during his individual colloquy with Rodriguez, the IJ did not mention voluntary departure. Although he appeared to be sympathetic to Rodriguez and explored certain of his \u201cequities,\u201d the IJ never asked whether Rodriguez would like to pursue this avenue of relief. Instead, the IJ signed an order for deportation in which he denied \u201cRespondent\u2019s application for voluntary departure,\u201d an application that Rodriguez never made or was informed that he could make. While it is true that Rodriguez stated that he wished to be removed to Mexico because his father was \u201creal sick\u201d and \u201cdoing pretty, pretty bad,\u201d he did not say that he was not willing to depart voluntarily immediately, nor is there any reason to think that he would not have done so had the IJ explained the voluntary removal process to him. In sum, Rodriguez \u201cnever had a genuine opportunity to apply for voluntary departure or to present evidence of the factors favoring this relief.\u201d <em>Melendez-Castro, </em>671 F.3d 950, 953-54. Consequently, Rodriguez was deprived of due process during the 2005 deportation hearing and his waiver of his right to appeal was not \u201cconsidered and intelligent.\u201d <em>Ubaldo-Figueroa, </em>364 F.3d at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">A petitioner must show prejudice resulting from the due process violation in order to succeed on a motion to dismiss an indictment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). <em>United States v. Muro-Inclan, </em>249 F.3d 1180, 1184 (9th Cir.2001). In order to establish prejudice, an alien does not have to show that he would actually have been granted relief. <em>United States v. Arrieta, </em>224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cInstead, he must only show that he had a \u2018plausible\u2019 ground for relief from deportation,\u201d <em>id., </em>which Rodriguez did here. In any event, the government does not contest prejudice but conceded at oral argument that it did not raise that issue in its brief to this court. The government also conceded at oral argument that if a due process violation is found \u2014 and we so find \u2014 Rodriguez would satisfy the prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\u00a7 1326 count of the indictment and vacate Rodriguez\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1326.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-19\">. Because we vacate Rodriguez's conviction on this ground, we do not reach any of his remaining challenges to the validity of the 2005 deportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
