See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Jane Doe appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order dismissing her case. Doe\u2019s amended complaint raised numerous claims against multiple federal, state and private parties, apparently arising out of incidents of involuntary commitment in 2005 and 2006. We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The facts of the case are known to the parties. We repeat them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">Doe first argues that the district court erred by holding that the amended complaint failed to comply with the pleading requirements and by granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. Knievel v. ESPN, </em>393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir.2005). The district court correctly held that Doe\u2019s amended complaint did not comport with the pleading standards set forth in Rules 8(a) and 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A complaint \u201cdoes not require \u2018detailed factual allegations\u2019 but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)) (internal citations omitted). And although pro se pleadings are construed liberally, even pro se pleadings \u201cmust meet some minimum threshold in providing a defendant with notice of what it is that it allegedly did wrong.\u201d <em>Brazil v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>66 F.3d 193, 199 (9th Cir.1995). Doe\u2019s amended complaint was insufficient to provide notice to the defendants even under the liberal pro se pleading standards. Accordingly the district court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">For the same reasons, the district court did not err in granting the remaining defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Goodman v. Staples The Office Superstore, LLC, </em>644 F.3d 817, 822 (9th Cir.2011). Because Doe\u2019s complaint was not sufficient to give the parties notice of what she was pleading, it was also insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to what she was pleading. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">Doe next argues that the district court erred in dismissing her case with prejudice and without leave to amend. We review a district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice and without leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Eminence Capital, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., </em>316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">After a pleading is amended as a matter of course, a court should only grant further leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1) &amp; (2). Although the policy allowing amendments \u201cis to be applied with extreme liberality,\u201d <em>Eminence Capital, </em>316 F.3d at 1051 (internal quotation marks omitted), there are several factors that weigh against granting successive amendments: \u201cundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment [or] futility of amendment.\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In light of Doe\u2019s conduct in this action, the district court had good reason to believe that further amendments would be futile and prejudice the defendants. It was therefore not an abuse of discretion to dismiss this case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Doe argues that the district court erred by denying her motions for a preliminary injunction and her motion for an extension of time as moot. We review the denial of both of these motions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Harris v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>366 F.3d 754, 760 (9th Cir.2004) (denial of motion for preliminary injunction reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Ahanchian v. Xenon Pictures, Inc., </em>624 F.3d 1253, 1258 (9th Cir.2010) (denial of motion for an extension of time reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u201ca strong likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>366 F.3d at 759 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Doe\u2019s complaint was insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, she could not show a strong likelihood of success on the merits. It was therefore not an abuse of discretion to deny the motions for a preliminary injunction as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Rule 6(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows the court to grant an extension of time \u201cfor good cause.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 6(b). Although the district court did not rule on Doe\u2019s motion during the pendency of the case, the district court did not rule on defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss until nearly seven months after they were filed. Given that Doe had far more time to respond to defendants\u2019 motions than she would have under a regular pleading schedule, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny as moot her motion for extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">We have reviewed Doe\u2019s remaining contentions and determine that they lack merit. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. All pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b755-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
