STRANCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Defendant Eugene Rantanen was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor (sometimes also called \u201cstatutory rape\u201d) in Indian country pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243(a) and 1153 for having sexual intercourse with his then-girlfriend when she was fourteen years old and he was eighteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rantanen appeals his conviction and sentence on the grounds that (1) the district court improperly instructed the jury that he had the burden to prove his innocence, (2) statements made in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights were erroneously admitted into evidence, (3) his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to address his main argument for a downward variance, and (4) the Government failed to disclose <em>Brady </em>material. Finding no error, we AFFIRM Rantanen\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">On October 28, 2008, Eugene Rantanen was indicted by a federal grand jury on four counts of various sex offenses against S.P., a minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 16, 2009, a Superseding Indictment added a fifth count for sexual abuse of a minor against a different alleged victim, R.G. A two-day trial was held three months later, which focused almost entirely on the allegations in the first four counts relating to S.P. Rantanen\u2019s defense to these counts was generally that the alleged sexual acts did not occur and S.P. lied about her age.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">The only evidence directly relating to the fifth count was the relatively brief testimony of R.G. herself. On direct examination, R.G. stated that she began dating Rantanen when she was twelve or thirteen, that they first had \u201cconsensual\u201d sexual intercourse when she was fourteen, and that they had sexual relations \u201c[l]ike three or four times\u201d in total. On cross examination, she agreed with Rantanen\u2019s attorney that she never complained to anyone that Rantanen had \u201ccommitted any kind of crime against\u201d her, that he never \u201cforced sex\u201d on her, and that she loved him and believed he loved her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rantanen provided no evidence or argument to refute the elements in the fifth count.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">The jury acquitted Rantanen on each of the first four counts but convicted on the fifth. Two jurors wrote letters to the court after their verdict lamenting their \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d decision to convict in count five but acknowledging their understanding that they had \u201cno choice\u201d to do otherwise under the law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>One of the letters urged the court to \u201cafford some leniency\u201d in sentencing. At the sentencing hearing, the district court calculated the Guidelines range to be 57-71 months. The Government and Rantanen advocated upward and downward variances, respectively. After considering these arguments, the district court imposed a sentence at the lower end of this range \u2014 57 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 to be followed by ten years of supervised release. Rantanen filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Before his appellate brief was filed, Rantanen alleges he was told that R.G. had previously claimed to have been the victim of an unrelated sexual assault but law enforcement authorities deemed her claims to be \u201cfalse.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor who handled Rantanen\u2019s trial did not provide this information in response to Rantanen\u2019s pretrial request for <em>Brady </em>materials and claims to have been ignorant of it at the time, though he was able to locate reports from tribal police and/or the F.B.I. relating to an investigation of R.G.\u2019s allegations. The parties give conflicting accounts of the contents of these reports, which are not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aka\">A. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Rantanen first argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the applicable burden of proof. During jury instructions, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">To find the defendant guilty, every one of you must agree that the defendant has overcome the presumption of innocence that proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 with evidence that proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">After the jury retired to deliberate, the prosecutor told the judge that the word \u201cdefendant\u201d had been substituted in place of the word \u201cgovernment\u201d before the phrase \u201chas overcome the presumption.\u201d Rantanen\u2019s attorney declined the judge\u2019s offer to bring the jury back into the courtroom for the correct sentence to be read, stating \u201cI think they got the message by that time.\u201d Before taking a recess, the judge stated: \u201c[Wje will send the sanitized version of the jury charge back\u201d to the jury along with the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Because Rantanen did not object to the jury instruction \u2014 and \u201cindeed, he acquiesced in it\u201d \u2014 we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Cleaves, </em>299 F.3d 564, 567 (6th Cir.2002). \u201cAn instruction is not plainly erroneous unless there was an egregious error, one that directly leads to a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>653 F.3d 399, 409 (6th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Yang, </em>281 F.3d 534, 551 (6th Cir.2002)). \u201cA judgment may be reversed based upon an improper jury instruction only if the instructions, viewed as a whole, were confusing, misleading, or prejudicial.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>502 F.3d 521, 527 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Harrod, </em>168 F.3d 887, 892 (6th Cir.1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">On its face, the jury instruction at issue may appear to violate the \u201cclearly establish[ed]\u201d principal that, \u201c[i]n a criminal trial, the State must prove every element of the offense.\u201d <em>Joseph v. Coyle, </em>469 F.3d 441, 464 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Middleton v. McNeil, </em>541 U.S. 433, 437, 124 5. Ct. 1830, 158 L.Ed.2d 701 (2004)). However, it seems clear to us \u2014 as it did to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Rantanen\u2019s trial attorney \u2014 that, in the context of all the instructions, the jury would have interpreted the statement as merely a \u201cslip of the tongue.\u201d This Court has found that a similarly mistaken instruction-that the defendant, rather than the government, has the burden to \u201cconvince you beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d \u2014 did not result in plain error for two reasons. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>215 Fed.Appx. 417, 421 (6th Cir.2007). \u201cFirst, the district court correctly stated the government\u2019s burden of proof in the written instructions provided to the jury.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Jones, </em>468 F.3d 704, 710 (10th Cir.2006) (joining five other circuits in holding \u201cslip-of-the-tongue\u201d errors to be either harmless or not plain when coupled with correct written instructions).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, \u201cthe court repeatedly stated the government\u2019s burden correctly during its preliminary instructions to the jury and its final charge to the jury.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>215 Fed.Appx. at 421; <em>see also O\u2019Neal v. Moris, </em>3 F.3d 143, 146-47 (6th Cir.1993), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom., O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 115 S.Ct. 992, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995). Here, the correct burden was articulated, among other places, in the very next sentence: \u201cTo find the defendant not guilty, every one of you must agree that <em>the government </em>has failed to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added). Moreover, the court\u2019s misstatement was clearly a \u201ccomplete <em>non sequitur </em>\u201d because a defendant obviously would have no desire to overcome the presumption of innocence to prove his own guilt. <em>United States v. Ancheta, </em>38 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir.1994). In light of these considerations, we hold that the mistaken sentence at issue here did not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">B. <em>Miranda </em>Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Rantanen urges this Court to grant him a new trial on the basis that the Government violated his Fifth Amendment rights by introducing at trial statements he made in custody without receiving the proper warnings. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 471-72, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Rantanen concedes that he did not object to the introduction of these statements at trial or move to suppress them prior to trial but suggests that we can still review this claim for plain error. However, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12 \u201cprovides that a party waives the ability to bring a motion to suppress by failing to file a motion before the pretrial motion deadline.\u201d <em>United States v. Walden, </em>625 F.3d 961, 967 (6th Cir.2010) (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3), (e)). Although Rule 12(e) allows courts to grant relief from waiver for \u201cgood cause,\u201d we have held that even plain error review is precluded when \u201ca defendant completely fails to file a pretrial motion to suppress evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>544 F.3d 656, 666 (6th Cir.2008); <em>Walden, </em>625 F.3d at 967.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Though Rantanen may pursue this claim through a collateral appeal by arguing that his attorney was ineffective for failing to raise a timely motion to suppress, Walden, 625 F.3d at 967 (citing Massaro <em>v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255), it is precluded from review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">C. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Rantanen argues his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to specifically address his arguments that he deserved a lower sentence because he and R.G. were \u201cdating and in love\u201d and because she did not consider herself a \u201cvictim.\u201d \u201cIt is well established that, as part of its sentencing procedure, a court must consider all non-frivolous arguments in support of a lower sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>620 F.3d 642, 645-46 (6th Cir.2010) (citing <em>United States v. Blackwell, </em>459 F.3d 739, 774 (6th Cir.2006)). In reviewing this procedure, this Court looks to the entirety of the sentencing proceedings to determine whether we are satisfied that the district court fulfilled its obligation to \u201cconduct a meaningful sentencing hearing and truly consider the defendant\u2019s arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647. \u201cWe are to focus less on what the transcript reveals that the court said and more on what the transcript reveals that the court did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Rantanen did not object at the sentencing hearing, he concedes that his claim will be reviewed for plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the sentencing judge \u201chas considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision making authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Chiolo, </em>643 F.3d 177, 184 (6th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). Further, the matter at issue\u2014 Rantanen\u2019s relationship with R.G. \u2014 was addressed by the court. After Rantanen raised it at the sentencing hearing and mentioned the jury\u2019s unhappiness with their obligation to convict on the fifth count, the court responded, \u201cIn other words, the jury followed the law? That\u2019s what they are supposed to do.\u201d Moreover, Rantanen\u2019s arguments were addressed when the court provided the following reasoning for its sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">I think there is one view that, you know, the defendant here is just a young kid who is out sewing his wild oats. That happens all of the time at the ... [Indian] reservation and other places, and there is another that he ... is a predator who is wanting to satisfy his sexual desires at all costs, no matter what the age or condition of the partner.... Those two obviously cannot be reconciled, although ... it is probably some of both, at least that\u2019s the safest conclusion that I can reach here, and that\u2019s the best I can do with it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">The government wants an upward variance. The defense wants a lower variance. I think that the Court is going to basically set his sentence at the low end of the guidelines, because I think that\u2019s probably about right. I don\u2019t think that ... we should pile upon him. At the same time, I don\u2019t think we need to-or should be giving him any breaks at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Because we conclude Rantanen\u2019s arguments were addressed, we need not consider the Government\u2019s suggestion that matters of the victim\u2019s consent and perceived harm are <em>per se </em>frivolous as a matter of law in a statutory rape case. <em>But see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (providing that sentencing judge must consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">D. <em>Brady </em>Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Rantanen\u2019s final issue on appeal is that his constitutional right to due process was violated when the Government failed to disclose exculpatory evidence. <em>See Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). This evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>dence apparently consists of reports generated by tribal police and/or the FBI indicating that the victim in count five had previously filed sexual assault allegations unrelated to this case which were investigated but did not result in criminal charges. Rantanen learned about the allegations from a friend while incarcerated following his conviction. The prosecutor in charge of Rantanen\u2019s case claims to have been ignorant of the investigation until Rantanen\u2019s attorney asked him about it during the pendency of this appeal, at which time he was able to locate the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Because of the time at which he discovered the existence of this information, Rantanen raises his <em>Brady </em>claim for the first time on appeal. \u201cThis court normally will not address an issue not first raised in the district court unless exceptional circumstances are present.\u201d <em>United States v. McLain, </em>9 Fed.Appx. 463, 464 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing <em>Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>85 F.3d 257, 261 (6th Cir.1996)). As both parties recognize, such circumstances do not exist here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The record does not contain the reports themselves and the parties disagree about exactly what is contained therein: Rantanen submits that the reports demonstrate that the tribal police and F.B.I. \u201cinvestigated her allegations and concluded that they were false\u201d whereas the Government submits the reports \u201cdid not involve a finding that [the victim in count five] was lying or fabricating what she described.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Neeley, </em>308 Fed.Appx. 870, 880 (6th Cir.2009) (deciding to consider <em>Brady </em>issue on direct appeal when content of material was undisputed and no further factual development was required). Accordingly, Rantanen\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim is best raised in the first instance in the district court in a collateral appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">For the reasons provided above, Rantanen\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\">. Although the dates of birth for the minors in this case have been redacted from the record, the prosecutor stated during closing arguments that the age differential was about four years and three months. This puts Rantanen just outside the four-year \"window\u201d within which a person may engage in a sexual act with a minor without violating the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\">. The minors in this case are referred to by their initials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-16\">. The jury also heard her agree that she does not \"feel like [she is] a victim of a crime,\u201d although the court sustained a relevance objection after her answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b444-17\">. Rantanen's counsel was presumably attempting to pursue a \"strategy of jury nullification.\u201d <em>United States v. Steverson, </em>230 F.3d 221, 223 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see United States v. Jones, </em>108 F.3d 668, 676 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-18\">. Rantanen\u2019s attorney stated during the sentencing hearing that \"more than one juror approached [him]\u201d with the same concerns, although it is unclear whether these were different jurors from the ones who wrote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>letters, and if so, whether they had any additional feelings about the verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b445-14\">. As will be discussed below, the Government disputes the substance of this characterization of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b446-4\">. We do not reach the question of whether the correct written instructions alone would have been sufficient to preclude reversible error. <em>See United States v. Ancheta, </em>38 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir.1994) (observing that \"often oral instructions are used to cure typographical and other errors in written instructions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\">. This Court has sometimes referred to this as a \"jurisdictional\u201d bar. <em>United States v. Collier, </em>246 Fed.Appx. 321, 336 &amp; n. 5 (6th Cir.2007); <em>e.g., Jordan, </em>544 F.3d at 666. The result is the same regardless of whether this term is applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b448-5\">. Rantanen states that he is merely presenting this claim on direct appeal \"in order to avoid a claim that the issue has been waived or forfeited.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
