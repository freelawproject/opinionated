Mulligan denying Chen\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>See In re Shao Ming Chen, </em>No. A088 775 616 (B.I.A. Dec. 28, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 775 616 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 13, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-22\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>with the BIA decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We \u201cdefer ... to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. For asylum applications such as Chen\u2019s, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on, <em>inter alia, </em>an applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 163, 164 &amp; n. 2,165.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. In finding Chen not credible, the IJ reasonably relied in part on Chen\u2019s demeanor, noting that she appeared to testify from a script and that she became \u201canxious\u201d when confronted about inconsistencies in her testimony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(m). We defer to the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, especially where, as in this case, the finding is supported by specific examples of inconsistencies in Chen\u2019s evidence. <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006). The IJ noted (for example) that, contrary to Chen\u2019s testimony that her mother and father were detained, the letters from her parents did not mention any such detention. Accordingly, we find no error in the agency\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 10 34.1(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\">. We note our concern with the poor quality of the brief filed by Chen's counsel, Tina Howe. The brief contained a number of substantive, grammatical, and typographical errors, including: (1) quoting a Third Circuit case, <em>Yun Jun Cao v. Att'y Gen. of the U.S., </em>but attributing the quotation to a Second Circuit case with a similar name, <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, see </em>Petitioner's Brief (\"PB\") at 16-17; (2) copying and pasting irrelevant text into the brief relating to Falun Gong, although this case concerned a claim based only on Christianity, <em>see id. </em>at 17-18; (3) providing incorrect pin cites to the record and cited cases, see <em>id. </em>at 7, 11, 14, 16-17; and (4) listing cases in the table of contents that are not subsequently cited in the text, and vice-versa, <em>see id. </em>at 3, 14, 16 (citing <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias; N.L.R.B. v. Columbian Enameling and Stamping Co.; Bandari v. I.N.S.; Rizal v. Gonzales; </em>and <em>Li v. Mukasey). </em>Since Howe has already been warned about her deficient briefing, <em>see, e.g., Mei Juan Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 Fed.Appx. 37 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>Su Ying Wen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>No. 07-3915-ag, we refer the present matter to this Court's Grievance Panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
