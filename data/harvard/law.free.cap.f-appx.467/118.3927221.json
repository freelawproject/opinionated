He also seeks appointment of counsel to represent him on appeal. Because the appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and deny Terrell\u2019s request for counsel. <em>See </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In 2004, Terrell pleaded guilty to: (Count One) distribution of more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A); (Count Two) aiding and abetting the distribution of more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A); (Count Three) possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B); (Count Four) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); and (Count Six) possession of a machine gun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o)(l). Pursuant to the plea agreement, Terrell stipulated that his offense involved 388.1 grams of crack cocaine and 1000 grams of powder cocaine. Based on this drug quantity, Terrell faced a sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment, which included 20 years for the violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and a mandatory consecutive term of 5 years imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Further, under the Sentencing Guidelines, Terrell\u2019s base offense level was 34, with a criminal history category of III. However, Terrell\u2019s prior convictions subjected him to the career offender provision in the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which resulted in an increased base offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI. Terrell received a three-level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility, and the District Court granted his unopposed request for a one-level criminal history reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3, on the ground that the career offender status overstated the seriousness of Terrell\u2019s criminal history. In the end, the District Court determined that Terrell had an offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of V, yielding a Guidelines range of 235 to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, in addition to the mandatory five-year term required by \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The District Court imposed an aggregate sentence of 300 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In December 2011, Terrell filed in the District Court a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence in light of the 2007 amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. The District Court denied the motion, and Terrell now appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s denial of Terrell\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Styer, </em>573 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir.2009). We may summarily affirm if the appeal does not present a substantial question, <em>see </em>Third Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, and we may do so on any basis apparent in the record. <em>See Hughes v. Long, </em>242 F.3d 121, 122 n. 1 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">In November 2007, the Sentencing Commission amended the crack cocaine guidelines by revising a portion of the drug quantity table at \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The amendment generally reduced the base offense levels for crack offenses under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) by two levels. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (Nov. 1, 2007). The Sentencing Commission later made Amendment 706 retroactive. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582 \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>... after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, a district court\u2019s \u00a7 3582 authority to reduce sentences based on amended guideline ranges is limited by \u00a7 1B1.10, which provides, in relevant part, that a reduction is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if the \u201camendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In denying Terrell\u2019s motion, the District Court reasoned that Amendment 706 did not lower Terrell\u2019s guideline range because he was sentenced pursuant to a range calculated under the career offender provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 201.1(c). We agree. As we held in <em>United States v. Mateo, </em>560 F.3d 152 (3d Cir.2009), \u201cAmendment 706 only affects calculations under \u00a7 2Dl.l(e), and the lowering of the base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) has no effect on the application of the career offender offense level required by \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. Because Terrell was sentenced using the career offender range, and because any downward departure from that range was not expressly made based on the \u00a7 2D1.1 guideline range, \u00a7 3582 does not authorize a reduction of sentence in this case, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Terrell\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Therefore, we will summarily affirm. Terrell\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 155 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
