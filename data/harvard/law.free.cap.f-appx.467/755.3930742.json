We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the substantial discrepancies between Wuryanto\u2019s testimony and asylum application regarding what occurred during the 1996 and 2000 encounters he described. <em>See id. </em>at 1043; <em>Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 739 (9th Cir.2007). Wuryanto\u2019s contentions that he was not afforded an opportunity to explain the discrepancies and that the BIA failed to provide its rationale for affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination are belied by the record. In the absence of credible testimony, Wuryanto\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Because Wuryanto\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Indonesia, his CAT claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
