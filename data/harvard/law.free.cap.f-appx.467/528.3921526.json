Sanchez was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 120 months in prison and now challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a safety valve departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), later adopted by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-23\">We review the district court\u2019s denial for clear error. <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>627 F.3d 274, 279 (7th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-24\">The \u201csafety valve\u201d refers to a court\u2019s ability to impose shorter sentences on first-time, nonviolent, less-culpable, and fully cooperative defendants, despite any mandatory minimum sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. Eligibility for the safety valve departure requires defendants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they have satisfied the necessary requirements listed in \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5). <em>United States v. Montes, </em>381 F.3d 631, 634 (7th Cir.2004). If a court finds that the defendant has satisfied all five requirements, a two-level reduction is applied to the defendant\u2019s Sentencing Guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(16); 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-25\">It is undisputed that Sanchez satisfied the first four requirements listed under \u00a7 501.2(a). But the district court found that Sanchez failed to prove satisfaction of the fifth requirement. Section 501.2(a)(5) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-26\">(a) [I]n the case of an offense under 21 U.S.C .... \u00a7 846, ... the court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable guidelines without regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>to any statutory minimum sentence, <em>if</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">(5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.... U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">This safety valve statute was created to remedy sentencing inequities and aid law enforcement by rewarding cooperative defendants who might otherwise receive overly-harsh sentences. <em>United States v. Arrington, </em>73 F.3d 144, 147-148 (7th Cir. 1996). For these reasons, the defendant\u2019s timely candor to the Government and the court is strictly required.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">As this Court has previously established, the district court\u2019s choice of whom to believe is almost never vulnerable to a finding of clear error, and furthermore, because the court\u2019s determination of safety valve eligibility is fact-specific, it is therefore heavily reliant on credibility determinations that cannot be made at the appellate level. <em>Montes, </em>at 631, 637 &amp; n. 5 (citing <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>326 F.3d 857, 862 (7th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>69 F.3d 136, 144 (7th Cir. 1995)). The Government gave Sanchez ample opportunity to cooperate and fully disclose all known information, yet the record is rife with Sanchez\u2019s inconsistencies regarding his personal whereabouts at specific times, the identities and roles of various individuals involved, and the manner in which the offense took place. At sentencing, the district court indicated it found the defendant to be lacking credibility from the plea agreement stage through the defendant\u2019s safety valve interview and proffer. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the district court clearly erred in denying a safety valve departure to Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The ruling of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
