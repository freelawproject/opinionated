The district court granted a Certificate of Appealability to review Jackson\u2019s Confrontation Clause claims and, finding them meritless, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b468-27\">In April 2001, a Michigan jury convicted Jackson of two counts of first-degree premeditated murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, and she was later sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. This conviction arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>from the October 1998 murders of Kevin Garland and Mary Ann Simmons.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On October 7, 1998, Timothy Landers, Jackson\u2019s co-defendant, agreed to sell three kilograms of cocaine to Michael McConico. Rather than purchase the drugs, McConico robbed Landers and shot him in the leg. Landers blamed Garland for this incident because Garland introduced McConico to him, and Landers sought revenge. Landers, accompanied by Jackson, Eric Willis, and Ronney Johnson, tracked down and killed Garland and then Garland\u2019s girlfriend, Simmons. After these murders, Landers, Jackson, Willis, and Johnson left Michigan and drove to California. Facing the need to move some furniture in Michigan, Jackson and Johnson returned to Michigan in November 1998 and while there, police pulled over Johnson\u2019s van and found a concealed weapon. Johnson was charged with carrying a concealed weapon, but the prosecutor later dropped the charges in exchange for Johnson\u2019s testimony at Jackson\u2019s and Landers\u2019s homicide trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">At trial, among the prosecution\u2019s witnesses were Johnson, McConico, and Angela Wallace. Johnson provided eyewitness testimony of Garland\u2019s shooting as well as Landers\u2019s order to Willis and Jackson to \u201ctake care\u201d of Simmons. McConico testified as to the motive, admitting that he robbed and shot Landers in the leg. Wallace, a California attorney, testified as to her role in representing Johnson on his concealed-weapon charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The prosecution\u2019s strategy included the theory that Jackson hired Wallace to represent Johnson in his weapon charge in order to control Johnson and prevent him from implicating her in the murders. Johnson testified that shortly after his arrest, Wallace visited his mother\u2019s home in California, informing her that Johnson was in trouble and offering to represent him. At Johnson\u2019s arraignment, Clarence Tucker, a Michigan attorney, appeared and attempted to provide representation, which Johnson declined. Wallace testified that she arranged for Tucker to appear on Johnson\u2019s behalf. Wallace further testified, contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s expectations, that it was Johnson\u2019s nephew, not Jackson, who retained her in the concealed-weapon charge, and indicated that she first met Jackson in February 1999, months after Johnson\u2019s arraignment. Wallace explicitly stated both that she was not asked by Jackson to represent Johnson nor was she acquainted with Jackson in February 1998, and then she was excused from further testimony in the trial and returned to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The next day, the prosecutor informed the trial court that he had obtained a copy of Wallace\u2019s grand jury testimony from a California district court, which contained prior inconsistent statements regarding Wallace\u2019s relationship with Jackson. In this grand jury testimony, Wallace admitted to meeting Jackson in March 1998, not February 1999. As this fact was directly contradictory to her in-court testimony, the prosecutor sought its admission for impeachment. The trial court instructed the prosecutor to subpoena Wallace and have her return to court to explain this prior inconsistent statement. The prosecutor contacted Wallace, issued another subpoena, and made her travel arrangements. In the following days, the prosecutor unsuccessfully tried to reach Wallace and eventually learned from Wallace\u2019s sister that Wallace left for Texas, leaving no address or telephone number. Wallace discontinued all contact with the prosecutor and did not arrive on the flight the prosecutor arranged for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Declaring Wallace unavailable, the trial court permitted the prosecution to use Wallace\u2019s grand jury testimony for the lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ited purpose of impeachment. Prior to admitting the transcript into the record, the trial court provided a limiting instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">First of all, this testimony can only be considered in judging the credibility of the witness Angela Wallace. It cannot be used for any other purpose, that is, it cannot be used as proof of any of the facts stated in that transcript. Again, it can only be used to judge the credibility of the witness Angela Wallace and for no other purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">... It cannot be used for any other purpose. Again, I\u2019ll repeat, it cannot be used as facts of any of the statements that are contained within the transcript.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">Wallace\u2019s prior inconsistent statement was then entered into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Following her conviction, Jackson appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, alleging Confrontation Clause violations, prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, violations of due process, and evidentiary errors. The appellate court found Jackson\u2019s arguments meritless and denied relief. <em>See People v. Jackson, </em>No. 236360, 2004 WL 2913643 (Mich.Ct. App. Dec.16, 2004) (per curiam). With regard to Jackson\u2019s Confrontation Clause claims, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">The trial court\u2019s decision to allow the prosecutor to introduce Angela Wallace\u2019s prior testimony in a federal case, for the limited purpose of impeaching her trial testimony, did not contravene defendant\u2019s confrontation rights because the Confrontation Clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for a purpose other than to establish the truth of the matter asserted. We presume that the jury followed the limiting instruction given by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\"><em>Id. </em>at *1 (citations omitted). Jackson then unsuccessfully sought discretionary review in the Michigan Supreme Court. <em>See People v. Jackson, </em>474 Mich. 871, 703 N.W.2d 812 (Mich.2005) (table). On state collateral review, Jackson raised two grounds for relief: ineffective assistance of counsel and the Confrontation Clause violation. The Wayne County Circuit Court denied both claims, and the Michigan Court of Appeals and Michigan Supreme Court affirmed. <em>See People v. Jackson, </em>480 Mich. 1003, 742 N.W.2d 379 (2007); <em>People v. Jackson, </em>No. 275785 (Mich.Ct.App. May 18, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Jackson filed a petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of Michigan, advancing three grounds for relief: a Confrontation Clause violation, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, and prosecutorial misconduct. The district court denied Jackson\u2019s petition, but granted a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the Confrontation Clause claim. Jackson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s legal conclusions, including its ultimate decision to grant or deny the writ, de novo. <em>Satterlee v. Wolfenbarger, </em>453 F.3d 362, 365 (6th Cir.2006) <em>(Moore, </em>Cole, Clay). Jackson filed his habeas petition in May 2007, after the effective date of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), and so AEDPA governs this Court\u2019s review of Jackson\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Section 2254(d) imposes the following standard of review in a habeas case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law occurs when \u201cthe state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). \u201cIn order for a federal court to find a state court\u2019s application of [Supreme Court] precedent \u2018unreasonable,\u2019 the state court\u2019s decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous. The state court\u2019s application must have been \u2018objectively unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520-21, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (citation omitted); <em>see Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Section 2254(d)(1) limits \u201cthe source of clearly established law to [the Supreme] Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\n<em>B. Wallace\u2019s Out-of-Court Statements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhP\">The Sixth Amendment grants a criminal defendant the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The Supreme Court has interpreted this right to require that \u201c[testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial ... only [be admitted] where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The term testimonial \u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. While this confrontation right applies only to testimonial statements, <em>see Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 823-26, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), \u201c[t]he Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354. \u201cThe admission of a testimonial statement in and of itself is not enough to trigger a violation of the Confrontation Clause. Instead, the statement must be used as hearsay \u2014 in other words, it must be offered for the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>405 F.3d 390, 399 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Jackson alleges that the admission of Wallace\u2019s grand jury testimony violated the Confrontation Clause, as it was an out-of-court testimonial statement used against a criminal defendant without the opportunity for cross examination. Because this statement took place before a grand jury, it is undisputed that it was not subject to cross examination and that it was testimonial in nature. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. What is disputed is whether the statement was used as hearsay to prove the truth of the matter asserted or solely as impeachment of Wallace\u2019s credibility. Only if the statement was used substantively, to prove the truth of the matter asserted, does Jackson have a cognizable Confrontation Clause claim. <em>See id. </em>at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <em>Pugh, </em>405 F.3d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">When the trial court admitted Wallace\u2019s grand jury testimony, it gave a limiting instruction, explaining the narrow purposes for which the jury could consider the statement. That instruction stated, three separate times, that the statement could \u201conly be considered in judging the credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ity of the witness Angela Wallace\u201d and that it could not \u201cbe used for any other purpose.\u201d We must presume that a jury follows a trial court\u2019s instructions. <em>See Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987); <em>see also Shannon v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 573, 585, 114 S.Ct. 2419, 129 L.Ed.2d 459 (1994). Nevertheless, Jackson contends that the statement was, in fact, used substantively because it had impeachment value only if accepted as true. According to Jackson, unless the jury believed the content of the out-of-court assertion that Wallace knew Jackson in February 1998, Wallace\u2019s prior inconsistent statement had no impeachment value; therefore, the prosecution actually used the grand jury testimony substantively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jackson\u2019s argument underestimates the importance of prior inconsistent statements. As the district court noted, \u201c[t]he impeaching value of a prior inconsistent statement comes not from the fact that the prior statement is true and the later statement is false, but from the very fact of inconsistency.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Stovall, </em>No. 2:08-CV-10094, 2010 WL 1754446, *13 (E.D.Mich.2010) (citing McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 34 (\u201cThe attack by prior inconsistent statement is not based on the theory that the present testimony is false and the former statement true. Rather, the attack rests on the notion that talking one way on the stand and another way previously ... rais[es] a doubt as to the truthfulness of both statements.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Regardless, the sole issue before this Court is not to determine the precise use of the statement, but rather whether the state court unreasonably applied Supreme Court precedent in finding that its admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that Wallace\u2019s statement \u201cdid not contravene [Jackson\u2019s] confrontation rights because the Confrontation Clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for a purpose other than to establish the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>2004 WL 2913643, at *1. All relevant evidence suggests that the evidence was not admitted substantively: the prosecutor introduced it exclusively as a prior inconsistent statement to reflect on Wallace\u2019s credibility; the trial court expressly limited its purpose to impeachment; and the trial court provided a clear limiting instruction to the jury, prohibiting it from considering the statement as substantive evidence. Therefore, we are unable to conclude that the state court\u2019s determination that Wallace\u2019s statement was admitted solely for impeachment purposes, and not hearsay, is \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>See Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 520-21,123 S.Ct. 2527.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The district court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-5\">. Jackson also argues that the prosecutor improperly used Wallace's prior testimony substantively during his rebuttal to closing argument. Because this issue was raised as a prosecutorial misconduct claim in Jackson\u2019s petition and it lies outside the scope of the COA, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (\"Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals .... \u201d); <em>see also Willis v. Jones, </em>329 Fed.Appx. 7, 12 (6th Cir.2009) (\"Without a COA, a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over a denial of habeas relief.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
