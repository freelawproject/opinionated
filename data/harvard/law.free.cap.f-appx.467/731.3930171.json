Good Samaritan also cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for costs. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We are troubled that Good Samaritan waited six years to assert immunity under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (\u201cHCQIA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11101-11152, even though it was available to them at the outset of the litigation. This failure resulted in nearly six years of costly discovery and multiple rounds of motion practice. We are also troubled that Good Samaritan affirmatively decided not to follow the HCQIA\u2019s requirement that it report Fox\u2019s suspension to the National Practitioner Data Bank. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11133(a)(1). Nevertheless, we find that the HCQIA grants immunity for Good Samaritan\u2019s suspension of Dr. Fox, and affirm on that claim. We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Good Samaritan\u2019s motion for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The district court held that Good Samaritan was immune from damages under the HCQIA. A hospital is entitled to HCQIA immunity for any \u201cprofessional review action,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11111, taken \u201cbased on the competence or professional conduct of an individual physician,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11151(9), so long as the hospital afforded the physician adequate procedural protections, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 11112(a). Although the parties agree that Fox\u2019s competence was never at issue, Fox disagrees with Good Samaritan\u2019s contention that issues relating to Fox\u2019s professional conduct justified revoking Fox\u2019s privileges at Good Samaritan.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">First, Fox argues that Good Samaritan is collaterally estopped from arguing that Fox\u2019s professional conduct was ever at issue. But the California Court of Appeal\u2019s earlier decision in related litigation made no reference to Fox\u2019s professional conduct whatsoever. That court held that Good Samaritan\u2019s suspension action \u201cwas quasi-legislative and therefore no hearing was required.\u201d <em>See Fox v. Good Samaritan Hosp., </em>2003 WL 21675515, *5-6 (Cal.Ct.App. Jul. 18, 2003). The California court determined that it was Dr. Fox\u2019s \u201cnoncompliance with the policy, ... that resulted in his privileges being suspended.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Fox\u2019s claim for judicial estoppel likewise fails. Although Good Samaritan argued in state court that its suspension action was quasi-legislative rather than adjudicatory in nature because its action was the result of the \u201cimplementation of a policy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *5 (quoting <em>Hay v. Scripps Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>183 Cal.App.3d 753, 758, 228 Cal.Rptr. 413 (1986)), rather than \u201cmisconduct,\u201d Fox cannot claim judicial estoppel because Good Samaritan\u2019s characterization of its decision as quasi-legislative, as opposed to adjudicatory, was not clearly inconsistent with its position that the decision implicated Fox\u2019s professional conduct. <em>See New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001) (holding, as a threshold matter, that for judicial estoppel to apply, \u201ca party\u2019s later position must be \u2018clearly inconsistent\u2019 with its earlier position\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Next, Fox claims that Good Samaritan\u2019s failure to report Fox\u2019s suspension to the National Practitioner Data Bank, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11133(a)(1), forecloses HCQIA immunity. Fox is incorrect because failure to report only forecloses immunity if the Secretary of Health and Human Services publishes the hospital\u2019s name in the Federal Register, which did not happen here. <em>See id. (\u201cA </em>health care entity ... shall lose the protections of section 11111(a)(1) of this title if the Secretary publishes the name of the entity under section 11111(b) of this title.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Fox further argues that his professional conduct could not have motivated Good Samaritan\u2019s decision because the underlying dispute concerned a policy disagreement, and not his professional conduct. However, the rule Fox violated clearly required Fox to designate alternates with privileges \u201cidentical\u201d to his own, and it is undisputed that his designated alternates did not have identical privileges. A doctor\u2019s failure to comply with a rule of the hospital where he practices unquestionably implicates his professional conduct, whether or not he agrees with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, Fox claims Good Samaritan failed to offer him \u201cadequate notice and hearing procedures ... as are fair to the physician under the circumstances.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(3). Hospitals are presumed to have offered adequate procedures unless the party challenging the procedures can prove otherwise. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 11112(a). Although Good Samaritan did not offer Fox a formal administrative hearing, such a hearing was not necessary under the unique circumstances of Fox\u2019s case. Fox does not dispute the fact that he failed to designate alternates with \u201cidentical\u201d privileges, as required by the hospital\u2019s rules. A formal hearing geared toward resolving factual disputes would therefore have done nothing to help Fox\u2019s case or aid Good Samaritan\u2019s decision-making. Rather, because Fox\u2019s disagreement was with the substance of the alternate call coverage rule \u2014 and not his noncompliance with the rule \u2014 Good Samaritan offered him the opportunity to challenge the rule in informal hearings before the Executive Committee and the Board of Trustees. Given the situation, the hearings Fox received were \u201cfair to the physician under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11112(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">With regard to the district court\u2019s denial of Good Samaritan\u2019s motion for costs, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion. While the prevailing party is presumed to be entitled to costs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), the district court has broad discretion to deviate from that presumption, so long as it \u201cexplain[s] why [the] case is not \u2018ordinary\u2019 and why, in the circumstances, it would be inappropriate or inequitable to award costs.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Mex.-Am. Educators v. California, </em>231 F.3d 572, 592-93 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). Here, the district court explained that although HCQIA immunity was available to the defendants at the outset of the litigation, the defendants failed to assert it until after nearly six years of costly discovery and multiple rounds of motion practice. The district court further noted that none of these costs or the time expended would have been necessary had the defendants raised HCQIA immunity in a timely manner. In light of the district court\u2019s thorough explanation of the unusual nature of this case, there are no grounds for believing that the district court abused its discretion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number><footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate * for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
