Because this appeal calls for the adjudication of factual disputes, this court dismisses for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">Mr. Glatt served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from November 1974 to November 1976. In 1989, Mr. Glatt was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder by a private physician. In 1995, Mr. Glatt filed a claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) seeking disability benefits. In January 1999, the Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) granted service connection for his major depressive disorder, effective July 31, 1995. Mr. Glatt disagreed with the effective date and appealed. In December 2000, the Board denied Mr. Glatt\u2019s appeal. When Mr. Glatt declined to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>peal the decision, it became final. In September 2004, the Board denied Mr. Glatt\u2019s application to reopen his claim for an earlier effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">In July 2006, the RO received an apportionment request from Mr. Glatt\u2019s spouse. The RO notified Mr. Glatt of the request and his rights in an August 2006 letter. In October 2006, the RO granted the request and authorized $500 a month apportionment effective July 1, 2006. Mr. Glatt filed a notice of disagreement in later that same month and submitted an October 23, 2006 Philippine court decision that annulled his marriage. The RO stopped the apportionment, effective November 1, 2006, because of the annulment.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction to review Veterans Court decisions is strictly limited. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), a party may obtain review \u201cwith respect to the validity of a decision of the [Veterans] Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the Court in making the decision.\u201d Absent a constitutional issue, this court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Mr. Glatt asks this court to review the sufficiency of the evidence underlying the Veteran\u2019s Court and Board decisions denying him an earlier effective date for major depressive disorder and approving the apportionment of his compensation benefits. Mr. Glatt\u2019s arguments relate to questions of fact and are beyond the jurisdiction of this court. Moreover, the Veterans Court found Mr. Glatt\u2019s freestanding claim for an earlier effective date, which did not allege clear and unmistakable error in the original unappealed decision of December 2000, was not properly before it. Likewise, this court cannot adjudicate that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">The only legal issue raised by Mr. Glatt\u2019s brief is a claim that his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial was violated by the VA\u2019s adjudication of both claims at issue in this appeal. While the Seventh Amendment provides the right to a jury trial in civil suits at common law, it is not \u201cimplicated in the VA adjudication process.\u201d <em>Paswell v. Nicholson, </em>21 Vet.App. 102, 2006 WL 2106952, at *2 (June 6, 2006); <em>see also Tull v. United States, </em>481 U.S. 412, 418 n. 4, 107 S.Ct. 1831, 95 L.Ed.2d 365 (1987) (\u201cthe Seventh Amendment is not applicable to administrative proceedings\u201d). Accordingly, Mr. Glatt\u2019s constitutional argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">For the foregoing reasons, this court dismisses Mr. Glatt\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
