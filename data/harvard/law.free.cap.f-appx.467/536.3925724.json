Miller worked for the Nebraska Department of Economic Development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>(\u201cNDED\u201d) from 1986 until his discharge in June 2007. Miller\u2019s father, Richard, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2005 and with stage IV terminal lung cancer in 2006. Miller regularly obtained leave from work to attend Richard\u2019s medical appointments throughout 2005 and 2006. On April 5, 2007, Dr. Douglas Fiedler, Richard\u2019s pulmonologist, predicted that Richard had a sixty- to ninety-day life expectancy and recommended that the family look into hospice care. Soon thereafter, Miller and Richard began to disagree on how to proceed with Richard\u2019s care. It is undisputed that Miller stopped attending Richard\u2019s medical appointments beginning on April 17, but Miller subsequently missed at least twenty-three days of work during April and May 2007, frequently with little or no explanation. On June 15, NDED terminated Miller\u2019s employment, citing his unexcused absences. Miller contested the termination through a collective bargaining agreement grievance process, explaining that he suffered a \u201ccomplete physical and mental breakdown\u201d beginning on April 17 from dealing with his father\u2019s medical condition. After an arbitrator rejected his wrongful discharge grievance, Miller brought this lawsuit for interference and retaliation in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq., </em>alleging that he was absent to care for Richard. Concluding that no reasonable jury could find that Richard was unable to care for his own needs or that Miller used his absences to provide Richard with necessary care, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted NDED\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Roberson v. AFC Enters., Inc., </em>602 F.3d 931, 933 (8th Cir.2010). \u201c[W]e will affirm if, upon review, we agree that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that [the movant] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Thorson v. Gemini, Inc., </em>205 F.3d 370, 375-76 (8th Cir.2000) (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)). We must \u201c(1) resolve direct factual conflicts in favor of the nonmovant, (2) assume as true all facts supporting the nonmovant which the evidence tended to prove, [and] (3) give the nonmovant the benefit of all reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Roberson, </em>602 F.3d at 933 (quoting <em>Larson ex rel. Larson v. Miller, </em>76 F.3d 1446, 1452 (8th Cir.1996) (en banc)). \u201cThe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Davidson &amp; Assocs. v. Jung, </em>422 F.3d 630, 638 (8th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">On appeal, Miller primarily challenges the district court\u2019s determination that no reasonable jury could conclude that Miller was needed to care for his father in April and May 2007. The FMLA does not define the phrase \u201cneeded to care for,\u201d but both parties rely on regulations issued by the Department of Labor. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.124 (2009) (formerly 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.116) (defining \u201cneeded to care for\u201d as including physical and psychological care where, because of a serious health condition, a family member is \u201cunable to care for his or her own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety\u201d). Miller raises three challenges to the district court\u2019s conclusion that no reasonable jury could find that Miller was \u201cneeded to care for\u201d Richard.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Miller contends that a reasonable jury could conclude that Richard was unable to care for his own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs based on Miller\u2019s affidavit, in which he claims that Richard \u201cwould often need assistance\u201d using the bathroom, dressing, and standing up, and based on Dr. Fiedler\u2019s declaration that he \u201cwould have certified that ... Miller was needed to care for Richard\u201d in April or May 2007 if he had been asked. Miller contends that the district court improperly disregarded this evidence in favor of the testimony of Lois Reed, Richard\u2019s companion of over twenty-one years, and her daughter that Richard did in fact care for his own medical, hygienic, and nutritional needs during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Miller\u2019s affidavit does not create a direct factual conflict with the testimony of Lois and her daughter that, when he was with them, Richard was able to bathe, shampoo and comb his hair, brush his teeth, take his medication, dress himself, feed himself, use the telephone, shop for groceries, and use the restroom, all without assistance. While Miller claims to have provided assistance to Richard at times for some of these activities, even taking all of Miller\u2019s factual assertions as true, they do not contradict the testimony of Lois and her daughter as to what Richard was able to do on a daily basis during April and May 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During that period, Richard operated a motor vehicle, attended social functions and church services, went to restaurants, and even danced. Moreover, Richard spent ten days away from Miller traveling with Lois in Oklahoma and Texas in May 2007. During that trip, Richard attended a pool party, walked around a lake, went shopping, and attended commencement exercises for Lois\u2019s granddaughter. Richard took several more trips with Lois in June to attend a wedding, visit a friend for Father\u2019s Day, and vacation in Omaha. Miller did not accompany Richard and Lois on any of these trips and has offered no evidence to contradict Lois and Lois\u2019s daughter\u2019s accounts of Richard\u2019s activities and ability to care for himself. Because Miller asserts no personal knowledge of what Richard was able to do in his absence, his affidavit does not contradict Lois\u2019s testimony that Richard was able to care for his own basic medical, hygienic, and nutritional needs during those times. <em>See Doza v. Am. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>314 F.2d 230, 232 (8th Cir.1963) (noting that an affidavit \u201cmust show that the affiant possesses the knowledge asserted\u201d (quoting <em>Sprague v. Vogt, </em>150 F.2d 795, 800 (8th Cir.1945))).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Dr. Fiedler\u2019s declaration similarly fails to create a genuine factual conflict with the testimony of Lois and her daughter. Dr. Fiedler stated in his declaration that he observed that Richard appeared weak at a three-month follow-up visit on April 5, 2007. Without mentioning any subsequent consultations, Dr. Fiedler then offered his opinion that Richard \u201cwould periodically be unable to care for his own basic medical, hygienic or nutritional needs in April and May of 2007.\u201d However, Dr. Fiedler\u2019s declaration merely establishes that Dr. Fiedler would have expected Richard to require assistance. While we have no doubt that someone with stage IV cancer who was a candidate for hospice care might be <em>expected </em>to require assistance with his basic needs, that does not necessarily create a genuine question as to whether an individual patient <em>actually </em>re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>quired such assistance. In this case, the record shows that Richard attended to his own basic medical, hygienic, and nutritional needs while he was traveling and whenever he was with Lois. The Fiedler declaration does not state or imply that the experiences of Lois and her daughter with Richard were implausible or contrary to medical evidence, and thus does not create a genuine conflict with Lois\u2019s testimony about Richard\u2019s actual capabilities. Furthermore, Miller concedes that Richard engaged in a variety of activities during that period, consistent with Lois\u2019s testimony regarding Richard\u2019s active lifestyle. Neither Miller\u2019s affidavit nor Dr. Fiedler\u2019s declaration creates a genuine factual conflict with the testimony of Lois and her daughter that Richard was able to care for his own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs when he was with them in April and May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Miller\u2019s affidavit and Dr. Fiedler\u2019s declaration also fail to establish that Miller\u2019s absences from work were taken for the purpose of providing necessary assistance to Richard, even assuming such assistance was \u201cperiodically\u201d necessary. Dr. Fiedler\u2019s declaration does not address how Miller actually used his absences from work. Miller vaguely states in his affidavit that in April and May 2007, he \u201cwould help\u201d Richard with certain activities, but Miller does not specify how frequently he provided this assistance, whether he provided this assistance during his absences from work, or what portion of his absences he actually dedicated to providing such assistance. Furthermore, the reason Miller initially cited for his absences during his grievance process \u2014 that Miller himself had suffered \u201ca complete physical and mental breakdown\u201d \u2014 undermines Miller\u2019s claim now that he was providing necessary assistance to Richard at the same time. Where a conclusory affidavit raises dubious claims that are contradicted by the affiant\u2019s previous position on the same issue, we have held that \u201c[a] properly supported motion for summary judgment is not defeated by self-serving affidavits.\u201d <em>See Bacon v. Hennepin Cnty. Med. Ctr., </em>550 F.3d 711, 716 (8th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gander Mountain Co. v. Cabela\u2019s, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 827, 831 (8th Cir.2008)). Thus, Miller has not raised a genuine question of fact as to whether Miller actually provided Richard with necessary care during his absences from work in April and May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Miller also contends that the district court erroneously ignored the psychological comfort that Miller testified he provided to Richard and that Dr. Fiedler declared Richard \u201cwould have\u201d needed. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.124(a) (necessary care \u201cincludes providing psychological comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a ... parent with a serious health condition who is receiving inpatient or home care\u201d). Miller primarily relies on <em>Scamihorn v. Gen. Truck Drivers, Office, Food &amp; Warehouse Union, Local 952, </em>282 F.3d 1078 (9th Cir.2002), in which Scamihorn moved in with his father at the recommendation of the father\u2019s psychologist to involve family members in the recovery process of the father\u2019s \u201csignificant depressive illness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1080-84. The Ninth Circuit concluded that Scamihorn had \u201craise[d] a genuine issue regarding whether his activities were necessary because his father was at times unable to care for some of his own basic needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1088. In contrast, Miller introduced no comparable evidence that Richard was receiving \u201cinpatient or home care,\u201d <em>see </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.124(a), or that his absences from work were <em>for </em>the purpose of providing psychological care to Richard as part of the ongoing treatment of Richard\u2019s serious health condition, <em>see Marchisheck v. San Mateo Cnty., </em>199 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir.1999) (employee\u2019s par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ticipation in \u201congoing treatment\u201d of family-member\u2019s serious health condition is required to qualify for FMLA leave). Moreover, as explained above, Miller failed to raise a jury question as to whether he used his absences from work to provide Richard with necessary care. Furthermore, Miller could not have used some of his absences to provide psychological care to Richard because they took place while Richard was traveling with Lois. <em>See Tellis v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., </em>414 F.3d 1045, 1047 (9th Cir.2005). Without evidence that Miller used his absences to provide Richard with psychological care as part of Richard\u2019s ongoing inpatient or home care treatment, <em>Scamihom </em>is inapplicable, and we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Finally, Miller contends that his father needed him to arrange hospice care. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.124(b) (necessary care includes making \u201carrangements for changes in care, such as transfer to a nursing home\u201d). Although Dr. Fiedler\u2019s declaration establishes that hospice care would have been a viable option if Richard had desired it, Miller\u2019s own testimony establishes that his father opposed hospice care, and there is no evidence that such care was necessary despite Richard\u2019s opposition. Furthermore, apart from his own vague and conclusory statements, Miller offered no specific facts to show that he devoted significant amounts of time during his absences to arrange hospice care for Richard. Accordingly, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-5\">.
