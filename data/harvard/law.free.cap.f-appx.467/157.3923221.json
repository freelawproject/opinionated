Because Trammell has not demonstrated that he is entitled to such relief, we will deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-25\">Construed liberally, <em>United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644, 648 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972)), Trammell\u2019s petition appears to stem from a decision of the Delaware Court of Chancery to remove him from his position as the administrator of his late father\u2019s estate. According to Trammell, this decision resulted in the forced auction of his home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Litigation over that decision and the sale of his home is ongoing in the state courts. He has twice sought removal to federal court to challenge the auction, and each time the action has been remanded to the state courts. <em>See Trammell v. Trammell, </em>No. 12-cv-0014, 2012 WL 293164 (D.De. Jan. 23, 2012); <em>Trammell v. Trammell, </em>No. 11-cv-0793 (D.De. Nov. 28, 2011). Trammell is currently pursuing an appeal to this Court challenging one of the District Court\u2019s orders remanding the case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Trammell presently seeks a writ of mandamus preventing proceedings in the state court relating to the sale of his home, and contends that the state courts lack jurisdiction over the matter during the pendency of his federal appeal. This is simply not so. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (after a district court has remanded an action to the state courts, they \u201cmay thereupon proceed with such case\u201d). A petitioner seeking mandamus must demonstrate, among other things, a clear and indisputable right to issuance of the writ. <em>Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia, </em>542 U.S. 367, 381, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004). Trammell has not, and we will therefore deny his petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">. Trammell has filed numerous federal complaints, most of which are nearly indecipherable and concern state litigation over his father's estate. <em>See, e.g., In re Trammell, </em>- Fed.Appx. -, 2012 WL 1242331 (3d Cir. 2012) (denying petition for writ of mandamus seeking to prevent auction of Trammell\u2019s home); <em>Trammell v. Trammell, </em>446 Fed.Appx. 530, 531 (3d Cir.2011); <em>Trammell v. Lillies Love &amp; Care Daycare Ctr., et al., </em>448 Fed. Appx. 188 (3d Cir.2011); <em>see also Trammell v. All Other Collateral Heirs of Estate of Marie Jones Polk, </em>446 Fed.Appx. 437 (3d Cir.2011) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(abstruse complaint asserting claims regarding the estate of Trammell\u2019s deceased aunt).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-22\">. The merits of that appeal, C.A. No. 12-2057, are not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
