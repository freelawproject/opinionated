We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, <em>1042 </em>(9th Cir.2001). We review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition <em>for </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-23\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the inconsistency between Djong\u2019s testimony and identification card regarding whether he was ever Buddhist, his inability to recall when he converted to Christianity, and his failure to provide evidence corroborating that he is a practicing Christian. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723-24 (9th Cir.1997); <em>see also Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090-92 (9th Cir.2000). In the absence of credible testimony, Djong\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-24\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Djong did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the Indonesian government. <em>See Wakkary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009). Accordingly, his CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Finally, we reject Djong\u2019s assertion that the IJ violated his due process rights by admitting evidence concerning the conduct of the organization that prepared his asylum application. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 972 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error and prejudice to establish a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b776-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
