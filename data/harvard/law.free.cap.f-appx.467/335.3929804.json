The district court\u2019s determination fell within the amount agreed upon, and when Aequicap failed to pay as agreed, the district court ordered the agreement enforced upon motion by the plaintiff. The district court\u2019s judgment after the insurer became insolvent that the insureds were jointly and severally liable was not inconsistent with either the initial liability judgment or the high/low agreement. The liability judgment merely determined that Roach was the sole proximate cause of the accident. The high/low agreement provided that Aequicap\u2019s payment of damages was on behalf of <em>both </em>the insurer <em>and </em>the insureds. The high/low agreement did not absolve the insureds of liability, but rather established the total amount of damages in an enforceable contract, to which the insureds were parties. <em>See </em>La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3071 (defining a compromise as a contract between the parties to it).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
