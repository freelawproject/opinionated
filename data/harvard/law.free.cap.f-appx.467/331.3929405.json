The district court carefully explained why Chambers failed to establish proper venue in Mississippi for any of his alleged claims. On appeal, Chambers does not challenge the decision to dismiss as such, but he objects that the case was dismissed <em>with prejudice. </em>He wants to sue another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">As the district court noted, however, Chambers has already struck out twice in Louisiana state and federal courts. He abandoned a state case, and the federal case was dismissed for lack of the amount in controversy for federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">Under these unusual circumstances, no point would be served by dismissing this case without prejudice \u2014 the doors of Louisiana courts are closed. The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-24\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
