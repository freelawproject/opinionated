Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asking the court to conduct a full examination of the record for prejudicial error. Rendon has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he asserts that his counsel was ineffective and suggesting that there was insufficient evidence to support his aggravated identity theft conviction. The Government has declined to file a responsive brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Rendon\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion de novo. <em>See United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005). When a Rule 29 motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, the jury\u2019s verdict must be sustained \u201cif there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 244 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 as evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Alerre, </em>430 F.3d at 693 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have reviewed the record of the district court proceedings and conclude that it was reasonable for the jury to accept the Government\u2019s evidence as adequate and sufficient to find Rendon guilty of the offenses with which he was charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">We reject on this appeal Rendon\u2019s assertion that his trial counsel was ineffective. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim should generally be raised in a habeas corpus motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2011) in the district court. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Although an ineffective assistance claim may be cognizable on direct appeal if \u201cit conclusively appears from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation!;,]\u201d <em>United States v. Benton, </em>523 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2008), it does not conclusively appear on the reeord that counsel provided ineffective representation. Accordingly, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not cognizable on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Rendon, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Rendon requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Rendon. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
