Doran has a high school education and was previously employed as an ironworker, soldier, equipment operator, and construction worker. Although Doran has not worked since July 2000, he returned to school to study computer science.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">An administrative law judge (ALJ) held three hearings on Doran\u2019s application for benefits before concluding that Doran could still perform a significant number of jobs in the economy despite his impairments. The Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ\u2019s decision, which therefore constitutes the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>Kyle v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>609 F.3d 847, 854 (6th Cir.2010). Thereafter, Doran filed a timely request for judicial review with the district court. The district court remanded the case to Commissioner for further analysis regarding the inconsistencies between statements made by the vocational expert and the definitions in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles concerning the jobs which Doran was found to be able to perform by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">At a 2006 hearing, following the remand, a vocational expert testified that a person with Doran\u2019s limitations could perform such jobs as an office clerk, security guard, and parking lot attendant. Following this hearing, the ALJ again denied Doran\u2019s request for benefits based on the vocation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>al expert\u2019s testimony. The Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Doran again sought judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The case was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended affirming the denial of benefits. The magistrate judge rejected Doran\u2019s argument that the vocational expert\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the residual functional capacity determination made by the ALJ. The magistrate judge also rejected Doran\u2019s objection that office clerk jobs in the local and national economy did not exist in a significant number.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Doran filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, but the government did not file a response. The district court reversed the Commissioner\u2019s decision with instructions to award benefits because the government had failed to respond to Do-ran\u2019s objections. The government then filed a motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s decision, pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 59(e), arguing that it had not waived its challenge to Doran\u2019s claim simply because it had opted not to file a response to Doran\u2019s objections. The district court granted the government\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, finding that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On appeal, Doran challenges the district court\u2019s grant of the Rule 59 motion which resulted in the denial of benefits. He also contends that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence and that there are not a substantial number of jobs in the economy that he could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The vocational expert based her opinion on the exhibits in the record showing that Doran could lift ten pounds or under, could walk or stand six and one-half to eight hours per day, and could sit five and one-half hours to eight hours per day. The vocational expert noted that Doran\u2019s ability to concentrate and to be supervised were impaired. The vocational expert stated that Doran\u2019s impairments prevented him from working directly with the general public or performing a job that was inherently highly stressful. Doran was not precluded, however, from performing activities with regular attendance and a regular schedule. Doran could complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically-based symptoms. He could also perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number of rest periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The vocational expert testified that a person with Doran\u2019s limitations could perform such positions as an office clerk, night security guard, and parking lot attendant. The vocational expert noted that there were no discrepancies between the descriptions of these jobs in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and her testimony regarding the physical and mental requirements of these jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Doran argues that the government should not have been permitted to oppose Doran\u2019s claim by filing a Rule 59 motion, rather than filing objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. The argument is without merit. As we have explained for decades, the waiver rule approved in <em>Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985), is not jurisdictional. <em>Kent v. Johnson, </em>821 F.2d 1220, 1222-23 (6th Cir.1987); <em>Patterson v. Mintzes, </em>717 F.2d 284, 286 (6th Cir.1983). We are free to address the parties\u2019 claims on the merits. <em>See Vaughn v. Lawrenceburg Power Sys., </em>269 F.3d 703, 714-15 (6th Cir.2001). A district court may grant a timely Rule 59 motion to alter or amend judgment to correct a clear error of law; to account for newly discovered evidence or an intervening change in the controlling law; or to otherwise prevent manifest in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>justice. <em>GenCorp, Inc. v. Am. Int\u2019l Underwriters, </em>178 F.3d 804, 834 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In social security cases, we must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, and whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Blakley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>581 F.3d 399, 405 (6th Cir.2009). A decision is supported by substantial evidence when \u201ca reasonable mind might accept the relevant evidence as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Warner v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>375 F.3d 387, 390 (6th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). We defer to an ALJ\u2019s findings if they are supported by substantial evidence, even if the record supports an opposite conclusion. <em>Lindsley v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>560 F.3d 601, 604-05 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The basis of Doran\u2019s appeal is that the vocational expert did not accurately reflect the ALJ\u2019s determinations regarding Do-ran\u2019s residual functional capacity, including his skill level and exertional capabilities. Doran also argues that, by referring to the medical-vocational guidelines, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, the ALJ had determined that Doran could perform only unskilled sedentary jobs, and that only one job described by the vocational expert fell into this category. Do-ran then argues that, as a result, the government failed to meet its burden at step five of the sequential evaluation of his disability because there are not a significant number of available jobs for this position. <em>See Cole v. Astrue, </em>661 F.3d 931, 939 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The vocational expert explained, and took into account, any discrepancy between the Dictionary of Occupational Titles and her testimony, including the combination skilled and semiskilled jobs under the Dictionary of Occupational Titles\u2019s office clerk position. The vocational expert excluded those positions requiring semiskilled work. Therefore, the ALJ properly relied on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, which included the vocational expert\u2019s personal observations and experience with jobs requiring such \u201cmixed\u201d ranges of skills and exertion. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt P, App. 2, \u00a7 200.00(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Regarding the number of available unskilled office jobs, we have found no \u201cmagic number\u201d in evaluating whether a job exists in significant numbers. This factor is determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>See Hall v. Bowen, </em>837 F.2d 272, 275 (6th Cir.1988). However, we need not decide this issue because for the other positions that the vocational expert identified that Doran could perform, the security guard and parking lot attendant positions, because thousands of these jobs exist on a national basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The district court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
