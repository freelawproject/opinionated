Pinckney seeks review of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the parts of that decision relevant to this appeal, the Veterans Court affirmed an August 5, 2008, decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) that denied Mr. Pinckney\u2019s claims for service connection for hemorrhoids and increased disability ratings for his service-connected right and left hip disorders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Mr. Pinckney does not raise any issues within our jurisdiction, we <em>dismiss </em>his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Mr. Pinckney served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1979 to April 1987. In November 2002, he was granted service connection for a bilateral hip disorder, and each hip was assigned a separate 10% disability rating. Mr. Pinckney filed an appeal requesting increased disability ratings in April 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">In August 2003, the Department of Veterans Affairs regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) denied Mr. Pinckney\u2019s separate claim of service connection for hemorrhoids. Mr. Pinckney appealed that decision to the Board. The Board consolidated Mr. Pinckney\u2019s appeals, conducted a personal hearing, and remanded the case for additional evidentiary and procedural development, including new medical examinations regarding Mr. Pinckney\u2019s bilateral hip and hemorrhoid claims. After obtaining additional medical records and examinations, the RO maintained its decision to deny Mr. Pinckney\u2019s claims for service connection for hemorrhoids and increased disability ratings for his service-connected right and left hip disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Mr. Pinckney again appealed to the Board, which affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Veterans Court agreed, concluding that the Board\u2019s findings on Mr. Pinckney\u2019s claims regarding his hemorrhoids and hip disorders were not clearly erroneous. Mr. Pinckney now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">This court\u2019s review of Veterans Court decisions is strictly limited by statute. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), we may review \u201cthe validity of a decision of the [Veterans] Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter) that was relied on by the Court in making the decision.\u201d Unless an appeal presents a constitutional issue, we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>al determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Giving Mr. Pinckney\u2019s extensive informal briefs, including the evidentiary appendix, the broadest latitude, we identify the following issues as constituting Mr. Pinckney\u2019s bases for this appeal: (1) the Board and Veterans Court erroneously interpreted 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.102, 3.103, 3.156(b), 4.1-L3, 4.27, 4.40-4.45, and 4.59; (2) Mr. Pinckney\u2019s right to due process was violated by (i) the RO\u2019s failure to obtain certain records, (ii) the RO\u2019s failure to comply with the Board\u2019s remand instructions, and (iii) the RO\u2019s reliance on inadequate medical examinations; (3) the Board and Veterans Court should have found that the RO violated its duty to notify Mr. Pinckney of required information and evidence; and (4) the Board and Veterans Court erred in determining that the diagnostic codes assigned to his hip disorders were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">In reviewing appeals from the Veterans Court, we must distinguish between cases with issues which are questions of legal interpretation over which we have jurisdiction, from cases in which the questions challenge a law or regulation as applied to the facts of the particular case, cases which by statute we may not review. We have considered each of Mr. Pinckney\u2019s arguments and conclude that, although they can be framed as constitutional issues or as challenges to the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of a law or regulation, in fact the issues are not constitutional and the arguments actually challenge factual conclusions reached by the Board, or the application of laws and regulations to the facts of this particular case. Because we may not review these types of challenges, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), we dismiss Mr. Pinckney\u2019s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\">. <em>Pinckney v. Shinseki, </em>No. 08-3657, 2010 WL 3934369 (Vet.App. Oct.6, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-10\">. The Veterans Court\u2019s decision also remanded Mr. Pinckney\u2019s claim for service connection for a bladder disorder claimed as secondary to a service-connected lumbar spine disorder. In his briefs, Mr. Pinckney acknowledges but does not challenge the Veterans Court\u2019s decision to remand his claim for readjudication by the Board. Thus, the Veterans Court\u2019s remand decision is not before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-16\">. As Mr. Pinckney notes in his briefs, the Board\u2019s decision also remanded his claims for service connection for spina bifida and an increased disability rating for a service-connected lumbar spine disorder. The Veterans Court declined to address those claims because they were not the subject of a final Board decision. <em>Pinckney, </em>2010 WL 3934369, at *1 n. 1. Accordingly, those claims are not properly before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
