The memorandum disposition filed on August 11, 2011 is withdrawn. A new Memorandum Disposition shall be filed simultaneously with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">David B. Grecu (\u201cGrecu\u201d), a California state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal, on timeliness grounds, of his habeas corpus petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Mr. Grecu maintains that, with the benefit of statutory tolling during the pendency of his state habeas petitions and of equitable tolling following the Supreme Court of California\u2019s denial of his last state petition, his federal petition was timely under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We initially affirmed the district court and denied relief. <em>See Grecu v. Evans, </em>No. 08-17452, 2011 WL 3510231 (9th Cir. Aug.ll, 2011). Mr. Grecu filed a petition for panel and rehearing en banc. We now grant Mr. Greeu\u2019s petition for panel rehearing. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b747-17\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts of the case, we will repeat them here only to the extent necessary to explain our decision. Mr. Grecu filed his federal habeas petition on February 6, 2007. The district court advised the parties that Mr. Grecu\u2019s habeas petition appeared untimely and ordered the State to \u201cfile with the Court ... a motion to dismiss the petition as untimely, or a notice that Respondent is of the opinion that a motion to dismiss is unwarranted.\u201d R.ll at 4. Within the time set by the district court, the State filed a motion to dismiss. The State\u2019s argument focused on the lapse of time between the denial of state postconviction relief by the Supreme Court of California and the filing of Mr. Grecu\u2019s federal habeas petition. In his response, Mr. Grecu argued that, during the relevant period, he was in administrative segregation and unable to direct the timely filing of his federal petition. He also noted that he had taken measures to ensure that his federal petition was timely filed even while he was in administrative segregation; specifically, Mr. Grecu had enlisted the assistance of attorney Paul Couenhoven to file his federal habeas petition. In its reply, the State argued that Mr. Grecu\u2019s late filing was the result of attorney error, which could not justify application of equitable tolling principles. <em>See Lawrence v. Florida, </em>549 U.S. 327, 336-37, 127 S.Ct. 1079, 166 L.Ed.2d 924 (2007) (\u201cAttorney miscalculation is simply not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>particularly in the postconviction context where prisoners have no constitutional right to counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">On August 27, 2008, the district court granted the motion to dismiss, but not on the ground proffered by the State. Instead, the district court held that Mr. Grecu was not entitled to statutory tolling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) during the pendency of his state habeas petitions because his petition to the state appellate court had been untimely. Because the district court concluded that Mr. Grecu was not entitled to statutory tolling during the pendency of his state habeas filings, it did not address whether equitable tolling should extend the time that Mr. Grecu had to file his federal habeas petition following the denial of his last state petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Mr. Grecu filed a motion for reconsideration in which he addressed the ground relied upon by the district court and stated that he could \u201cexplain and justify\u201d the delay between the denial of his state superior court filing and his filing in the state appellate court, namely, he had been in administrative segregation and therefore had been unable to access his court files. R.28 at 1. The district court denied this motion as well on the ground that Mr. Grecu had not established any basis for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and had not \u201cprovide[d] any extraordinary reason justifying relief.\u201d ER 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">We do not believe that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Grecu\u2019s petition can be squared with <em>Herbst v. Cook, </em>260 F.3d 1039 (9th Cir.2001). In <em>Herbst, </em>we held: \u201c \u2018A habeas court must give a petitioner notice of the procedural default and <em>an opportunity to respond to the argument for dismissal. </em>When dealing with a pro se petitioner, the court must make clear the procedural default at issue and the consequences for failing to respond.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1043 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Boyd v. Thompson, </em>147 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998)). Notably, we also said that \u201ca motion for reconsideration is inadequate as an opportunity to respond\u201d because, inter alia, \u201cthe bar that must be cleared in order to succeed upon reconsideration is higher than pre-dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Consequently, under our case law, Mr. Grecu never had an adequate \u201copportunity to respond to the argument\u201d that formed the basis for the district court\u2019s judgment \u2014 the alleged untimeliness of his petition to the state appellate court. <em>See id. </em>at 1043 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Mr. Grecu\u2019s petition, and we remand for further consideration of Mr. Grecu\u2019s claim that he was entitled to statutory tolling during the pendency of his state habeas petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">If the district court concludes that Mr. Grecu\u2019s state filings were timely, it also must address Mr. Grecu\u2019s equitable tolling argument with respect to the filing of his federal habeas petition. In <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), the Supreme Court held that, under appropriate circumstances, AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling. The Court held that \u201ca \u2018petitioner\u2019 is \u2018entitled to equitable tolling\u2019 only if he shows \u2018(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\u2019 and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2562 (quoting <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005)). \u201cA habeas petitioner ... should receive an evidentiary hearing when he makes a good-faith <em>allegation that would, if true, </em>entitle him to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Roy v. Lampert, </em>465 F.3d 964, 969 (9th Cir.2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Here, Mr. Grecu has made the necessary showing for a hearing on the issue of equitable tolling. Mr. Grecu has alleged that his placement in administrative segregation prevented him from personally filing his federal habeas petition. This court has recognized that the placement in administrative segregation may constitute an extraordinary circumstance for purposes of equitable tolling. See <em>Espinoza-Matthews v. California, </em>432 F.3d 1021, 1027-28 (9th Cir.2005). However, prior to Mr. Grecu\u2019s placement in segregation, he both prepared his federal petition and requested that Mr. Couenhoven \u2014 acting as a friend, but not as an attorney \u2014 file the petition as soon as the state supreme court issued its ruling. Finally, if, as Mr. Grecu alleges, he was not represented by counsel but was relying on Mr. Couenhoven\u2019s \u201cministerial\u201d services, then Mr. Grecu\u2019s own lack of access to his file was the obstacle preventing the timely filing of his federal petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In sum, Mr. Grecu has alleged facts that, if established, may entitle him to equitable tolling of the time period after the state supreme court\u2019s denial of his state petition. Consequently, if the district court concludes that Mr. Grecu is entitled to statutory tolling, it also must hold an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Grecu\u2019s claim to equitable tolling. <em>See Roy, </em>465 F.3d at 975 (discussing the role of the district court in evaluating conflicting evidence presented with respect to the issue of equitable tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b747-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">. Even if the district court were to find that Mr. Couenhoven was Mr. Grecu\u2019s counsel for purposes of filing his federal habeas petition, this fact standing alone would not preclude equitable tolling. \"Common sense dictates that a litigant cannot be held constructively responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>-U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2568, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (Alito, J\u201e concurring in part and in the judgment). Whether there was any neglect by Mr. Couenhoven in this role, and whether this neglect constitutes misconduct that qualifies as an \"extraordinary circumstance,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 2564 (majority opinion) (noting that, although \"a garden variety claim of excusable neglect ... does not warrant equitable tolling,\u201d nevertheless \"serious instances of attorney misconduct\u201d may qualify as \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d that justify application of equitable tolling) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), would be matters for the district court to determine on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
