Jordan, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. As part of a plea agreement, Jordan waived the right to file this motion. The district court enforced Jordan\u2019s waiver, dismissed Jordan\u2019s motion, and denied his application for a certificate of appealability (COA) as well as his motion to reconsider. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Jordan has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>al right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we also deny Jordan the COA and accordingly dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In 2009, Jordan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and was sentenced to 168 months in prison. In the plea agreement he reached with the government, he waived the right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with his prosecution, conviction, and sentence, including his right to file a motion under \u00a7 2255, except as limited by <em>United States v. Cockerham, </em>237 F.3d 1179 (10th Cir.2001). Jordan nonetheless filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in district court, arguing that the waiver he had executed was invalid due to ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial conduct, and his youth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court rejected these arguments, dismissed Jordan\u2019s motion, and denied him a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We have jurisdiction to address the merits of Jordan\u2019s appeal only if we first issue a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We do so only where an applicant makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To accomplish this, Jordan must show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">We apply a three-part test to evaluate the enforceability of a waiver of \u00a7 2255 rights in a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir. 2004). We determine \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Jordan does not dispute the district court\u2019s conclusion that this appeal falls within the terms of his waiver. He continues to argue, however, that the waiver was not knowing and voluntary and that its enforcement would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Jordan\u2019s primary argument is based on the theory that the statute under which he was convicted did not apply to his actions. He notes that the drug stash house he conspired to rob did not actually exist; it was invented by government agents. Congress did not intend, he argues, to punish \u201cfake robbery conspiracies.\u201d Because his lawyers did not bring this argument to his attention, Jordan insists that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and his plea was not knowing or voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">This argument fails because Jordan\u2019s lawyers had no obligation to discuss with him a meritless legal theory. Jordan did not plead guilty to possessing drugs, but to conspiracy. \u201cAt the core of a single conspiracy is an agreement to break the law. Criminalized is the agreement itself. That the illegal act does not materialize is another matter.... \u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>14 F.3d 502, 511 (10th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). \u201cThough it might seem odd, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>the fact that the stash house, the drugs\u2014 indeed the whole plot \u2014 was fake is irrelevant. That the crime agreed upon was in fact impossible to commit is no defense to the crime of conspiracy. The crime of conspiracy is the agreement itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Corson, 579 F.3d 804, 810 </em>(7th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>360 F.3d 949, 957 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cImpossibility is not a defense to the conspiracy charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Jordan also asserts more generally that he did not understand the waiver he entered into or the elements of the charge to which he pleaded guilty. To the extent that Jordan intends this to be a separate argument from his claim that his counsel was ineffective, we reject it. The plea agreement clearly states the rights Jordan waived to appeal or challenge his sentence. Moreover, the district court noted that \u201cthe court, during its Rule 11 colloquy with Mr. Jordan, specifically discussed that he had waived his right to challenge his sentence through a \u00a7 2255 motion. Mr. Jordan assured the court that he understood the nature of \u00a7 2255 claims, that he understood that he had waived his right to assert such claims, and that he was entirely willing to do so.\u201d Mem. &amp; Order of Feb. 28, 2011 at 4, 2011 WL 768695. We see no room for reasonable debate as to whether Jordan\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary or as to whether a miscarriage of justice would result from its enforcement. Jordan does not make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">We DENY Jordan\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-19\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">.
