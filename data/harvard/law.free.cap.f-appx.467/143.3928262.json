At the time of the accident, Treadways was covered by insurance policies issued by Travelers Property Casualty Company of America and The Travelers Indemnity Company (collective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ly, \u201cTravelers\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on these policies, Travelers denied coverage. Treadways filed an action against Travelers, asserting coverage based on Travelers\u2019 bad faith, and by waiver and estoppel based on Travelers\u2019 breach of its duty to indemnify (the \u201cestoppel claim\u201d). The District Court dismissed the bad faith claim on Travelers\u2019 motion for summary judgment. As to the estoppel claim, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Travelers. Treadways appeals the grant of summary judgment and certain of the Court\u2019s rulings during the trial regarding the estoppel claim. It requests that we reverse the grant of summary judgment and vacate the Court\u2019s entry of judgment for Travelers on the jury verdict. Instead, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>Claims Under the Insurance Policies Relating To The Accident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Because we write solely for the parties, we recite only the facts necessary to our decision. Travelers issued two insurance policies to Treadways, a commercial automobile insurance policy (the \u201cAuto Policy\u201d), and a worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability insurance policy (the \u201cWC/EL Policy\u201d). During the term of these policies, one of Treadways\u2019 employees, Todd Gonsar, was struck by an uninsured motorist while he was unloading tires from a rented delivery truck in the course and scope of his employment. Treadways reported the accident to Travelers. Travelers paid Gonsar workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the WC/EL Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Gonsar filed a writ of summons against Treadways in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (the \u201cGonsar Suit\u201d). Treadways notified Travelers of the Gonsar Suit, whereupon Travelers established a claim under the Auto Policy and retained counsel to defend Treadways in the suit. On receiving Gonsar\u2019s complaint, Travelers advised Treadways that it believed the Auto Policy might not cover the claims asserted. Travelers nonetheless continued to retain counsel to defend Treadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Near the close of discovery, Travelers sent a letter to Treadways denying coverage of the Gonsar Suit under the Auto Policy and withdrawing its defense of Treadways in that action. Travelers stated that the Auto Policy did not cover the accident because the policy only covered automobiles owned by Treadways and Gonsar was driving a rented truck on the date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The Gonsar Suit ended approximately six months later with a judgment against Treadways. Based on this judgment, Treadways submitted a claim to Travelers under the WC/EL Policy. Travelers sent a letter to Treadways denying coverage on the basis that the WC/EL Policy did not cover the claims asserted in the Gonsar Suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">\n<em>District Court Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">Over a year later, Treadways filed its action against Travelers. Following the close of discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment. They agreed that neither policy covered the claims asserted in the Gonsar Suit. Noting that Pennsylvania\u2019s applicable standard for bad faith re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>quired, as a prerequisite, the existence of coverage under a policy, the District Court granted Travelers summary judgment as to the bad faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The Court, however, allowed the estoppel claim to proceed to trial. Four of its rulings prior to or during the trial are at issue on appeal. The first two rulings regard testimony and evidence. First, the Court granted Travelers\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the testimony of its corporate designee and other evidence regarding Travelers\u2019 alleged violations of its internal claims handling procedures. Importantly, Treadways admitted that it did not have access to these procedures. The Court held that the testimony and evidence were irrelevant and prejudicial under Fed. R.Evid. 402 and 403. Second, the Court prohibited the introduction of Travelers\u2019 letter denying coverage under the WC/EL Policy as irrelevant based on its holding, among other reasons, that Treadways could not support its estoppel claim with evidence of conduct that occurred after entry of the verdict in the Gonsar Suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The remaining two rulings regard Treadways\u2019 proposed jury instructions. It sought the following instruction regarding a presumption of prejudice: \u201cIn Pennsylvania, when the insurer undertakes the defense of an insured and requires the insured to relinquish management of the litigation to the insurer, the insurer may not later disclaim coverage after a verdict of judgment.\u201d Appendix (\u201cApp.\u201d) at 836. The District Court denied the instruction based on its ruling that relevant case law provided that prejudice must be shown in the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Treadways also requested that the jury be instructed with regard to 31 Pa.Code \u00a7 146.7: \u201cThe Pennsylvania Code provides for Unfair Claims Settlement Practices and states, \u2018An insurer may not deny a claim on the ground of a specific policy provision, condition or exclusion unless reference to the provision, condition or exclusion is included in the denial.\u2019 \u201d App. at 837. The Court declined to give this instruction because this provision was irrelevant to the estoppel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\n<em>Dismissal of Bad Faith Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Ray v. Twp. of Warren, </em>626 F.3d 170, 173 (3d Cir.2010). Summary judgment is proper when, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">The District Court dismissed Treadways\u2019 bad faith claim based on its holding that Pennsylvania\u2019s standard for bad faith in the insurance context requires, as a prerequisite, the existence of coverage under a policy. Treadways argues that this holding ignores that a bad faith claim may be premised on bad faith in actions other than denial of coverage and that the existence of coverage is not a predicate of a bad faith claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">\u201cBad faith\u201d under Pennsylvania\u2019s bad faith statute \u2014 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8371, which provides a remedy in an action under an insurance policy \u2014 is defined as \u201cany frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay proceeds of a policy.\u201d <em>J.C. Penney Life Ins. Co. v. Pilosi, </em>393 F.3d 356, 367 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting <em>Terletsky v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>437 Pa.Super. 108, 649 A.2d 680, 688 (1994)). A valid cause of action for bad faith requires \u201cclear and convincing evidence ... that the insurer: (1) did not have a reasonable basis for denying benefits under the policy; and (2) knew or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis in denying the claim.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Id. </em>Under the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard, \u201cthe plaintiff [must] show \u2018that the evidence is so clear, direct, weighty and convincing as to enable a clear conviction, without hesitation, about whether or not the defendants acted in bad faith.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bostick v. ITT Hartford Grp., Inc., </em>56 F.Supp.2d 580, 587 (E.D.Pa.1999)). Though we have held that bad faith may be found in circumstances other than an insured\u2019s refusal to pay, \u201c[a] reasonable basis is all that is required to defeat a claim of bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. See also Frog, Switch &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>193 F.3d 742, 751 n. 9 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Treadways does not argue that Travelers wrongly denied coverage under the policies. Indeed, it admits that the policies precluded coverage. This alone was sufficient for the District Court to dismiss the bad faith claim. Because the claims asserted in the Gonsar Suit were not covered by the policies, Travelers had good cause to deny coverage and cease defending the litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATt\">\n<em>Evidentiary Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">We generally review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, but apply a plenary review to determinations based on the interpretation of federal rules. <em>United States v. Green, </em>556 F.3d 151, 155 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Evidence is relevant if \u201c(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. As such, \u201cevidence is irrelevant only when it has <em>no </em>tendency to prove the fact.\u201d <em>Spain v. Gallegos, </em>26 F.3d 439, 452 (3d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Blancha v. Raymark Indus., </em>972 F.2d 507, 514 (3d Cir.1992)) (emphasis in original). Irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. Fed.R.Evid. 402. Relevant evidence may be excluded as prejudicial \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">To recap, two evidentiary rulings are at issue. First, the District Court excluded as irrelevant and prejudicial testimony of Travelers\u2019 corporate designee and other evidence regarding Travelers\u2019 alleged violations of its internal claims handling procedures. To establish an estoppel claim, Treadways had to prove an inducement to believe certain facts, justifiable reliance, and actual prejudice. <em>See Guardian Life Ins. Co. v. Zerance, </em>505 Pa. 345, 479 A.2d 949, 954 (1984). Estoppel thus focuses on an insurer\u2019s knowledge and conduct and the insured\u2019s reliance on that conduct. Because Treadways did not have access to Travelers\u2019 claims handling procedures, testimony and other evidence regarding these procedures were irrelevant to the estoppel claim. The District Court properly excluded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Second, the District Court prohibited the introduction of Travelers\u2019 letter denying coverage under the WC/EL Policy. Treadways tendered its claim, and Travelers denied coverage, under this policy after entry of the verdict in the Gonsar Suit. More than six months prior to entry of the verdict, Travelers informed Treadways that the claims asserted in suit were not covered by the Auto Policy, the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>under which it was defending Treadways, and, at that time, ceased its defense of Treadways. It could not have relied on or been prejudiced by Travelers\u2019 conduct in denying coverage under the WC/EL Policy. The letter was irrelevant, and the Court properly excluded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Weatherly, </em>525 F.3d 265, 269-70 (3d Cir.2008). \u201cA court errs in refusing a requested instruction only if the omitted instruction is correct, is not substantially covered by other instructions, and is so important that its omission prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>183 F.3d 231, 250 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">First, Treadways argues that the Court improperly denied its requested instruction regarding a presumption of prejudice if an insurer undertakes the defense of an insured and later disclaims coverage after the rendering of a verdict. Prejudice may be presumed in an estoppel context if an insurer defends an insured to verdict, without reservation of rights, and then denies coverage after entry of the verdict based on the policy\u2019s inapplicability to a particular loss. <em>See Goulding v. Sands, </em>355 F.2d 230, 232, 233 (3d Cir.1966). In contrast, if the insurer withdraws from defending the insured prior to the verdict, prejudice is not presumed. <em>See W.O. Hickok Mfg. Co. v. Unigard Mut. Ins. Co., </em>15 Pa. D. &amp; C.3d 593, 595 (Pa.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Travelers denied coverage and withdrew its defense of Treadways in the Gonsar Suit approximately six months prior to entry of the verdict. Treadways thus was required to demonstrate prejudice. The District Court properly denied the proposed instruction presuming prejudice to Treadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Second, Treadways argues that the Court improperly declined to give an instruction with regard to 31 Pa. Code \u00a7 146.7. This provision relates to Unfair Claims and Settlement Practices, which is part of Pennsylvania\u2019s Unfair Insurance Practices Act. Whether Travelers\u2019 conduct violated this provision is unrelated to the estoppel claim. In addition, an instruction regarding this provision could have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict based on an irrelevant matter. The Court properly denied the proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">4* 4\u00bb 4*</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">. Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company also issued insurance policies to Treadways. It is undisputed that it did not issue an insurance policy covering the automobile accident. The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of Charter Oak and dismissed it from the action. This dismissal is not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\">. The District Court also held that Treadways failed to present evidence that Travelers acted intentionally or recklessly in denying coverage under the policies. Because we hold that Treadways cannot establish the first element of bad faith, we do not reach arguments regarding the second element of such a claim or Treadways' ability to present evidence showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
