We grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The decision of the Board incorrectly identified Solis\u2019s conviction as being for assault with a deadly weapon. Solis was charged with that crime, but that is not the offense for which he was convicted. As the government acknowledged, he was convicted under another part of California Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1), for assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. When the Board fails to identify correctly the elements of the crime for which the petitioner was convicted, its decision merits no deference. <em>See Uppal v. Holder, </em>605 F.3d 712, 715 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cBecause the BIA failed to identify the elements of \u00a7 268 correctly, its CIMT analysis ... is misdirected and so merits no deference from this Court.\u201d); <em>see also Hemandez-Cruz v. Holder, </em>651 F.3d 1094, 1106 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cAs the BIA erred at step one, we owe its CIMT analysis at step two no deference.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Generally, an error by the Board in the first stage of a moral turpitude analysis warrants remanding for reconsideration. <em>See Uppal, </em>605 F.3d at 719-20 (remanding where the Board may have misconstrued statutory elements of crime and applied CIMT analysis inconsistent with case law). The government argues that a conviction under any part of section 245(a)(1) should qualify categorically as a CIMT. Neither the Board nor this court has so held in a precedential opinion. We remand to the Board for consideration of whether the crime for which Solis was actually convicted constitutes a CIMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b667-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
