Lemos-Zamora argues that his sentence is unreasonable as measured by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also argues that his within-guidelines sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry Guidelines are not empirically based. As acknowledged by Lemos-Zamora, that argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Because Lemos-Zamora\u2019s arguments fail under either a plain error or an abuse of discretion standard of review, we need not decide whether, despite his arguments in the district court in support of a downward variance, Lemos-Zamora\u2019s failure to object to the reasonableness of his sentence results in plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The record reflects that the district court considered Lemos-Zamora\u2019s mitigation arguments, weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and provided a reasoned basis for its decision. Lemos-Zamora\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to establish error on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Lemos-Zamora has failed to establish that his sentence, which is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness, was the result of error, much less plain error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Mandragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
