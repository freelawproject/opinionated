Johnson appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of disparate treatment and the employer proffers a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action, the plaintiff must then show that the proffered reason is merely a \u201cpretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Here, the district court found that Johnson established a prima facie case of discrimination and that Defendants provided four legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for removing Johnson from her position as co-chair of the science department: (1) Johnson sent mass emails to the faculty expressing discontent with administrative decisions, (2) Johnson repeatedly and publicly questioned the credentials of a colleague, (3) Johnson was unwilling to accept a classroom without a laboratory and involved students in the controversy, and (4) Johnson undermined student and parent confidence in the school\u2019s International Baccalaureate program.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">Upon reviewing the record, reading the briefs, and with the benefit of oral argument, we find that Johnson has not provided sufficient evidence to indicate that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons provided by Defendants were a pretext for race or age discrimination. Furthermore, she has not shown that her removal would not have occurred but for Defendants\u2019 discriminatory animus. Thus, the district court did not err in granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
