Squatrito, <em>J.) </em>and was sentenced to 151 months in prison and three years\u2019 supervised release. After leaving prison, he admitted violating the terms of his supervised release by, inter alia, possessing and using narcotics, and was sentenced (Robert N. Chatigny, <em>J.) </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ninety days in prison and the resumption of his supervised release. After fulfilling the second sentence, he again admitted violating the terms of supervised release by committing third-degree robbery, to which he entered an <em>Alford </em>plea of guilty in state court, and was returned to the district court (Vanessa L. Bryant, <em>J.) </em>for a proceeding to determine the consequences of this violation. The district court sentenced Williams to twenty-one months in prison, with no further federal supervised release. Williams now challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence, and argues \u2014 for the first time on appeal \u2014 that he did not receive due process during the revocation proceedings before the district court. Finding no merit to Williams\u2019s arguments, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Our review of district court sentencing decisions encompasses review of allegations of both procedural and substantive errors. <em>See United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc). A district court \u201ccommits procedural error where it ... makes a mistake in its Guidelines calculation, ... does not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or rests its sentence on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review substantive challenges to a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Williams challenges his sentence on three interrelated bases: (1) that the district court failed to weigh mitigating factors pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (2) that the sentence of incarceration was improperly based on the rehabilitative effects that a prison term would have on Williams; and (3) that the sentence, although at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of twenty-one to twenty-four months, was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">All of these arguments are unavailing. First, although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) instructs a sentencing judge to consider a number of factors, that obligation does not require the judge to make explicit reference to each factor considered. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 29 (2d Cir.2006). In this case, the district court plainly considered \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors that were applicable to Williams, as it considered for example Williams\u2019s personal history, the kinds of sentences avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>able, and the requirement that the sentence be sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. And the court not only considered some of the sentencing arguments that Williams now contends were ignored but appears to have credited them: for example, his difficulties in complying with some of the requirements of supervised release led the district court to conclude that, upon his release from prison, Williams should no longer be subject to federal supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Second, Williams argues that the district court improperly considered the rehabilitative effects that a criminal sentence might have on him, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a). <em>See Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). Assuming without deciding that the rule of <em>Tapia </em>applies to sentences for violations of supervised re<em>lease </em>\u2014 but <em>see United States v. Anderson, </em>15 F.3d 278, 282 (2d Cir.1994) (holding, over dissent and before <em>Tapia, </em>that rehabilitation needs may be taken into account in connection with supervised release sentences) \u2014 the district court did not violate the prohibition that Williams cites. While the statute does provide that \u201cimprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a), the district court\u2019s statement that Williams \u201chas benefitted from incarceration\u201d does not violate that prohibition, as a mere reference to the past \u201cbenefits\u201d of incarceration for a defendant does not equate to the selection of a term of incarceration for the purposes of rehabilitating that defendant. The cases where sentencing judges have violated the statute contrast sharply with the facts here. In several such cases, for example \u2014 some of them cited by Williams \u2014 the defendant was given a longer sentence designed to facilitate eligibility for a prison drug treatment program. <em>See Tapia, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2385; <em>United States v. Manzella, </em>475 F.3d 152, 161 (3d Cir.2007); <em>In re Sealed Case, </em>573 F.3d 844, 851 (D.C.Cir.2009). Nothing of the sort occurred here. The sentence was manifestly the product of Williams\u2019s repeated criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Third, Williams argues that the length of his twenty-one-month sentence\u2014 which was at the bottom of the guidelines range \u2014 is substantively unreasonable. He is incorrect. Although we do not presume that a sentence at the bottom of a guidelines range is inherently reasonable, <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27, we also reverse such sentences only if the district court \u201cexceeded the bounds of allowable discretion,\u201d <em>United States v. Kane, </em>452 F.3d 140, 144 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of Williams\u2019s criminal history, his repeated violations of the terms of his supervised release, and the complementary reduction of his sentence by the elimination of any further term of federal supervised release, we cannot conclude that this sentence was outside the range of appropriate discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Finally, Williams also argues, for the first time on appeal, that, because the First and Second Amended Reports of Violation of Supervised Release were never docketed, the district court violated his due process rights. Because Williams raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we can reverse only if there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, ... (3) that affects substantial rights[, and] (4) [that] seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Aspinall, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>889 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir.2004), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (applying plain error review to claim of due process violation during sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Under this standard of review, Williams\u2019s argument cannot prevail. The due process requirements for a revocation proceeding have been codified at Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2), and focus, as relevant to this case, on the defendant\u2019s right to \u201cwritten notice of the alleged violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (b)(2)(A). Williams does not dispute that he had notice of the First and Second Amended Reports, which his counsel acknowledged having discussed with the defendant during the revocation hearing. Thus, even assuming arguendo that the failure to docket and file the Amended Reports was error, it is not \u201cplain,\u201d did not \u201caffect[ ] substantial rights,\u201d and does not \u201cseriously affect[] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, as Williams received the notice guaranteed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We have considered all of Williams\u2019s contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\">. After the case had been fully briefed on the merits, the government moved to dismiss the appeal as moot, because Williams\u2019s sentence has now been fully served. As the government correctly notes, our usual presumption that a challenge to a criminal conviction is not mooted by completion of the sentence imposed does not apply to violations of probation, parole, or supervised release. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 14, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998); <em>United States v. Probber, </em>170 F.3d 345, 348 (2d Cir.1999). Rather, \"an individual challenging the revocation of his parole \u2014 and whose term of re-incarceration has expired \u2014 bears the burden of demonstrating that some concrete and continuing injury continues to flow from the fact of the revocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Williams remains detained pending adjudication of additional charges, which were filed while Williams was still serving his 21-month sentence for violation of supervised release. Thus, whether Williams will be credited with time served towards any eventual sentence in the pending case will likely depend on whether he was serving a valid sentence on the supervised release violation during the period of overlap between the present detention and the supervised release sentence. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the supervised release sentence, though expired, continues to present sufficient concrete consequences in Williams\u2019s ongoing criminal case to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement. We therefore deny the motion to dismiss and reach the merits of Williams\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
