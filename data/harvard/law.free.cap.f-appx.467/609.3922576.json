We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence. <em>Singh v. Holder, </em>643 F.3d 1178, 1180 (9th Cir.2011). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on Yeo\u2019s admitted misrepresentations in her initial declaration regarding the 1998 riots. <em>See id. </em>at 1181 (upholding adverse credibility finding where petitioner made conscious decision to lie). Further, the agency was not compelled to accept Yeo\u2019s explanations for the false statements, <em>see Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011), and the record does not otherwise compel a finding of credibility, <em>see Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 744 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, we deny the petition as to Yeo\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
