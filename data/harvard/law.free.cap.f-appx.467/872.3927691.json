He appeals his sentence, raising one issue: whether the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We will set aside a sentence if left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court properly calculated the Guidelines sentence range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We find no procedural error in this case. The district court allowed both parties to present arguments as to the appropriate sentence. The court stated for the record that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the presentence investigation report, and Gillings\u2019s arguments, including Gillings\u2019s argument made in support of a downward variance \u2014 that he would be in danger if imprisoned. The court considered that argument in fashioning Gillings\u2019s sentence, as evidence by its notice to the Bureau of Prisons. As for the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, although the court did not address the factors individually and explicitly on the record, its explanation for the sentence imposed indicates that it took the factors appropriately into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">A sentence is substantively reasonable if it is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). To impose a sentence that is substantively reasonable, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines sentence range, the pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Given the record before the district court, we conclude that Gillings\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. It was within the Guidelines sentence range, and, considering Gillings\u2019s extensive criminal history and his prior deportation, a sentence within that range was needed to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and deter him from further criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
