Garcia-Chavez argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he (1) knowingly and intentionally conspired to possess with intent to distribute marijuana or (2) knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Garcia-Chavez moved for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d at the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, but he failed to renew the motion at the close of all evidence. <em>See United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 567 n. 5, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977) (noting that Fed. R.CrimP. 29(a) substituted the term \u201cjudgment of acquittal\u201d for \u201cdirected verdict\u201d and that the change was purely formal). Thus, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 329-31 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc); <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>958 F.2d 1304, 1310 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc). He must show (1) an error or defect, (2) that was clear or obvious, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 329-30. If he meets those three prongs, this court has the discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Applying the plain error standard in the sufficiency of the evidence context, reversal is warranted only upon a showing of \u201ca <em>manifest </em>miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358; <em>Pierre, </em>958 F.2d at 1310. The court will find the requisite \u201c \u2018obviousness\u2019 \u201d only if \u201c \u2018the record is <em>devoid of evidence </em>pointing to guilt or if the evidence is so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 331 (quoting <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>477 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">To sustain Garcia-Chavez\u2019s conviction for the drug conspiracy, the Government was required to prove that (1) two or more people entered into an agreement or conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute it, (2) Garcia-Chavez knew of the conspiracy, and (3) he willfully joined and participated in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>561 F.3d 398, 402 (5th Cir.2009). The Government may prove its case by direct or circumstantial evidence, and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the, evidence. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Contrary to Garcia-Chavez\u2019s suggestion that the evidence at his trial was purely circumstantial, the Government introduced through Dearing\u2019s testimony ample direct evidence of Garcia-Chavez\u2019s participation in the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garcia, </em>567 F.3d 721, 732 (5th Cir.2009) (noting that testimony that witness saw defendant serve as a \u201clookout\u201d was direct evidence that defendant was acting as a lookout for a marijuana operation); <em>see generally Jones v. Robinson Prop. Group, L.P., </em>427 F.3d 987, 992 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cDirect evidence is evidence which, if believed, proves the fact without inference or presumption.\u201d). Garcia-Chavez is, in essence, asking this court to assess Dearing\u2019s credibility and weigh the evidence, which we will not do. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 273-74 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Moreover, the jury may have found it implausible that although the weather was exceptionally cold and Garcia-Chavez\u2019s health was fragile, Garcia-Chavez, who was in possession of $160, chose to travel with Dearing by boat to Corpus Christi to visit a family member rather than to use another means of transportation. Implausible explanations can constitute evidence of guilty knowledge. <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 325 (5th Cir.2003); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>United States v. Diaz-Carreon, </em>915 F.2d 951, 954-55 (5th Cir.1990). Contrary to Garcia-Chavez\u2019s suggestion, the evidence did not consist merely of evidence placing him at the scene of a drug smuggling endeavor. <em>See United States v. Mendoza, </em>226 F.3d 340, 343 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In order to sustain a conviction for a controlled substances violation pursuant to \u00a7 841, the Government had to prove that Garcia-Chavez knowingly possessed the marijuana with the intent to distribute. <em>United States v. Mata, </em>491 F.3d 237, 242 (5th Cir.2007). Although the knowledge element for possession of contraband is rarely proven by direct evidence, <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>74 F.3d 575, 577 (5th Cir.1996), Dearing testified at trial that Garcia-Chavez asked for his help in smuggling marijuana and that Garcia-Chavez delivered the marijuana to the hotel parking lot and helped to repackage the marijuana before placing it back into the black boxes. Garcia-Chavez\u2019s attempt to persuade this court to assess Dearing\u2019s credibility and reweigh the evidence is unavailing. <em>See Delgado, </em>256 F.3d at 273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The record is not devoid of evidence that Garcia-Chavez conspired to possess with intent to distribute marijuana and possessed with intent to distribute marijuana. <em>See Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 331; <em>Phillips, </em>477 F.3d at 219. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b317-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
