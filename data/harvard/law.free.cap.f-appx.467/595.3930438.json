Blundell failed to respond by the March 9th deadline. After Blundell belatedly served inadequate responses on April 2, the magistrate judge ordered Blundell to supplement the answers within thirty days. Blundell failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">On September 21, the magistrate judge ordered Blundell to supplement his answers to the interrogatories within seven days. The judge also ordered Blundell to pay $50 in sanctions to the County (and his former attorney to pay $1,345 in sanctions). The judge warned Blundell of the possibility of dismissal of his action if he failed to comply with this discovery order. Blundell again failed to meet the deadline for supplementing his answers to the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">On October 30, after a hearing <em>on the </em>County\u2019s third motion for sanctions, the judge ordered Blundell to serve supplemental answers immediately. The judge also ordered Blundell to pay $100 sanctions to the County. The judge again warned Blundell of the possibility of dismissal of his action if he failed to comply with this third discovery order. Blundell failed to serve supplemental answers to the County\u2019s interrogatories at any time prior to the discovery cut-off date of November 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">At a hearing on November 20, on the County\u2019s motion for dismissal, Blundell\u2019s attorney served supplemental answers to the County\u2019s interrogatories. No court has assessed the adequacy of these answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">On December 1, the magistrate judge recommended, in a detailed written report to the district court, that Blundell\u2019s action against the County be dismissed as sanctions for violating three discovery orders. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and ordered dismissal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">In a separate order of November 25, the district court denied Blundell\u2019s motion for a discovery continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-17\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b624-18\">On February 26, 2010, Blundell filed a notice of appeal, <em>pro se, </em>specifying that he was appealing the judgment \u201centered 01/29/10.\u201d The only entry on January 29, 2010 on the district court docket is the Order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation of dismissal. The district court did not enter final judgment until February 3, when it dismissed Blundell\u2019s suit against all the parties, including the County. Because Blundell did not specify the February 3 judgment in his notice of appeal, the County contends this Court lacks jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-19\">We reject the County\u2019s contention. The Order of January 29, 2010, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Blundell\u2019s action be dismissed, makes clear his intent to appeal the dismissal. <em>See Le v. Astrue, </em>558 F.3d 1019, 1022 (9th Cir. 2009). Moreover, the County has fully briefed the merits of Blundell\u2019s appeal and so has not suffered prejudice from any mistake as to the date of final judgment. <em>See Lockman Found. v. Evangelical Alliance Mission, </em>930 F.2d 764, 772 (9th Cir. 1991) (\u201cWhere the appellee has argued the merits fully in its brief, it has not been prejudiced by the appellant\u2019s failure to designate specifically an order which is subject to appeal.\u201d). Finally, we can also address the merits of Blundell\u2019s appeal as to the denial of the continuance motion. <em>See Nat\u2019l Am. Ins. Co. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>93 F.3d 529, 540 (9th Cir.1996) (permitting review of interlocutory order not designated in notice of appeal if such order \u201cmay have affected the outcome below\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Denial of Motion to Continue Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\u201cThe district court is given broad discretion in supervising the pretrial phase of litigation, and its decision regarding the preclusive effect of a pretrial order ... will not be disturbed unless they evidence a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 604, 607 (9th Cir.1992). Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to continue discovery because Blundell offers no evidence that he or his attorney was diligent in attempting to meet the discovery deadline. <em>Id. </em>at 609 (holding that diligence of party seeking amendment is primary justification for amending scheduling order). Blundell\u2019s contention that his prior counsel failed to conduct adequate discovery, serve all defendants, and amend the pleadings is inconsistent with a showing of diligence. <em>Id. </em>(holding that \u201ccarelessness is not compatible with a finding of diligence and offers no reason for a grant of relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Dismissal as a Sanction for Discovery Noncompliance</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">We review discovery sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Fair Housing of Marin v. Combs, </em>285 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir.2002). Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion to adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s report in the face of Blundell\u2019s noncompliant discovery. We apply a five factor test on review of a terminating sanction. First, the magistrate judge found that the public\u2019s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation favored dismissal, and we \u201cdefer to the district court\u2019s judgment about when delay becomes unreasonable.\u201d <em>In re Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) Prods. Liability Litig., </em>460 F.3d 1217, 1227 (9th Cir.2006). Second, the judge also found that the court had a need to manage its docket, and \u201cwe give deference to the district court since it knows when its docket may become unmanageable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Third, Blundell\u2019s failure to produce supplemental answers to the interrogatories, as ordered, is sufficient to show prejudice to the County. <em>Id. </em>at 1227. Fourth, public policy favoring disposition on the merits generally weighs against dismissal, but a party, like Blundell, who stalls discovery and unreasonably delays reaching the merits must \u201cbear responsibility for halting movements towards a merits resolution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237. Fifth, the court twice tried less drastic sanctions, ordered discovery compliance three times, and warned Blundell twice of possible dismissal if he failed to comply. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Blundell\u2019s action against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b624-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
