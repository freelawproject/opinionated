We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence findings of fact, including adverse credibility determinations, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">The agency found Njoroge not credible based on his admission that no information in his initial asylum application was true. The agency also relied on the inconsistencies within and between Njoroge\u2019s asylum application and his testimony concerning whether any family members were harmed after he left Kenya, how many threatening notes he received and when he received them, and when his store was burned down. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See id. </em>at 1043; <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1066-67 (9th Cir.2005) (lying on an asylum application is an \u201cindication of dishonesty\u201d). In the absence of credible testimony, Njoroge\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">Because Njoroge\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and Njoroge does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Kenya, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b781-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
