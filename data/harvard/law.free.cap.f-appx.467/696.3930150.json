(\u201cGreat River\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying Great River\u2019s request for an order of civil contempt against Kim Seng Co. (\u201cKim Seng\u201d) for failure to comply with the district court\u2019s March 10, 2008, injunction. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Great River was barred by laches from seeking con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>tempt sanctions against Kim Seng. Its findings that Great River\u2019s delay was unreasonable and caused prejudice to Kim Seng are supported in the record. <em>See Couveau v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>218 F.3d 1078, 1083 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo establish laches a defendant must prove both an unreasonable delay by the plaintiff and prejudice to itself.\u201d). Great River knew that Kim Seng was selling products with packaging that Great River claimed violated the injunction as early as September 2008. Yet Great River failed to act for one full year. Then, upon discovering that Kim Seng\u2019s products were being sold in markets, Great River still did nothing for five months. Under these circumstances, the district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in concluding that the doctrine of laches precluded sanctions. <em>See Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., </em>263 F.3d 942, 955 (9th Cir.2001) (the unreasonable delay element of laches is satisfied where plaintiff offers \u201cno viable justification\u201d for delay); <em>Miller v. Glenn Miller Prods., Inc., </em>454 F.3d 975, 999 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cA defendant may establish prejudice by showing that during the delay, it invested money to expand its business or entered into business transactions based on his presumed rights.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Nor did the district court err in concluding that Kim Seng had substantially complied with the injunction. Paragraph Two of the injunction provided that Kim Seng could use its Old Man Que Huong Brand mark, registration No. 2311982, \u201cbut only in conjunction with a graphic of a walking bearded farmer.\u201d Kim Seng requested a clarification, to which the district court responded that \u201cDefendant cannot use Plaintiff\u2019s Que Huong trademark except in connection with the Oldman Que Huong Brand in conjunction with the graphic of a walking bearded farmer, period.\u201d The district court correctly concluded that Kim Seng\u2019s interpretation of this ambiguous order was reasonable. Therefore, the packaging which featured the phrase \u201cOld Man Que Huong Brand\u201d in the surround of the graphic of a walking bearded farmer clearly complied with the terms of the injunction. The words \u201cQue Huong Brand\u201d otherwise were used only in proximity to the graphic and therefore did not violate the injunction. We agree with the district court that Kim Seng\u2019s actions \u201cappear[ ] to be based on a good faith and reasonable interpretation of the [court\u2019s order].\u201d Go-Video, <em>Inc. v. Motion Picture Ass\u2019n of Am. (In re Dual-Deck Video Cassette Recorder Antitrust Litig.), </em>10 F.3d 693, 695 (9th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
