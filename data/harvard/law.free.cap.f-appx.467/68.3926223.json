Elstein denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Chang Le Lin, </em>No. A093 396 998 (B.I.A. April 23, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A093 396 998 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 5, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-21\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-22\">As an initial matter, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s pretermission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Lin\u2019s asylum application as untimely because Lin challenges only the IJ\u2019s factual findings regarding when and where he arrived in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(3), 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 326-29 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that a question of law is <em>not </em>implicated \u201cwhen the petition for review essentially disputes the correctness of the IJ\u2019s fact-finding\u201d). Thus, we dismiss Lin\u2019s petition for review with respect to his asylum claim. Because Lin does not challenge the denial of CAT relief, we address only the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The agency did not err in concluding that Lin failed to meet his burden of proof in demonstrating that he suffered persecution or faced a likelihood of persecution on account of his \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s family planning policy. Lin was not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum solely on the basis of his wife\u2019s forced sterilization, but he could have qualified for relief by demonstrating that: (1) he engaged in \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy; and (2) he suffered harm rising to the level of persecution or has a well-founded fear of suffering such harm as a direct result of his resistance. <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-310, 313 (2d Cir.2007). The agency reasonably found, however, that the harms Lin allegedly suffered did not constitute persecution. The agency reasonably determined that Lin\u2019s physical mistreatment did not constitute past persecution, as Lin was not detained at the time, and acknowledged that he did not need to seek any medical treatment. <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that \u201cthe difference between harassment and persecution is necessarily one of degree that must be decided on a case-by-case basis\u201d); Jian <em>Qiu Liu v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir.2011) (holding that a minor beating by family planning officials prior to arrest and detention by police, and carried out without any intention to arrest or detain, need not constitute persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In addition, the agency reasonably determined that the fine imposed on Lin and his wife for their violation of the family planning policy did not constitute persecution, as Lin did not argue or present evidence of any economic disadvantage or deprivation suffered as a result of the fine. <em>See Matter of T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 170-71 (BIA 2007) (defining persecution as including \u201cthe deliberate imposition of a severe economic disadvantage or the deprivation of liberty, food, housing, employment or other essentials of life.\u201d); <em>see also Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir.2002) (requiring at least a showing of a \u201cdeliberate imposition of a substantial economic disadvantage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Thus, because Lin does not present any argument, apart from past harm, as to why he would face persecution upon return to China, the agency reasonably determined that he did not establish his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178, 183-86 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
