On appeal, Roberts argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence following an alleged illegal search of his residence. Roberts has also filed a motion to remand the case for resentencing in light of the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d) of 2010. We affirm Roberts\u2019s convictions and deny his motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Following the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>634 F.3d 243, 246 (4th Cir.2011). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if this court \u201con the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 337 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In conducting our review, we give particular deference \u201cto a district court\u2019s credibility determinations, for it is the role of the district court to observe witnesses and weigh their credibility during a pre-trial motion to suppress.\u201d <em>United States v. Abu Ali, 528 </em>F.3d 210, 232 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cBecause the district court denied the motion to suppress, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Black, 525 </em>F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">On appeal, Roberts does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that exigent circumstances justified the officers\u2019 entry into his residence to conduct a protective sweep. Instead, Roberts asserts for the first time that the officers impermissibly entered the \u201ccurtilage\u201d surrounding his residence when they approached the rear door, rather than the front door, to conduct their \u201cknock and talk,\u201d thereby violating the Fourth Amendment. Because Roberts failed to raise this argument in his motion to suppress before the district court, our review is for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). Plain error occurs when: (1) there was an error; (2) the error is plain; (3) the error affects substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Wilkinson, </em>137 F.3d 214, 223 (4th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches extends to the curtilage of a home. <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984); <em>Rogers v. Pendleton, </em>249 F.3d 279, 287 (4th Cir.2001). However, \u201cjust as private citizens may approach a home, absent contrary instructions from the owner, to knock on a door, so may the police approach without probable cause, a warrant, or exigency.\u201d <em>Pendleton, </em>249 F.3d at 289. Officers may enter an individual's backyard without a warrant \u201cwhen they have a legitimate law enforcement purpose for doing so.\u201d <em>Alvarez v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>147 F.3d 354, 358 (4th Cir.1998). Once on a private individual\u2019s property, however, the officers may not \u201cexceed their legitimate purpose for being there.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">In this case, the officers had a legitimate reason to approach Roberts\u2019s townhouse\u2014 to apprehend a wanted fugitive believed to be residing there. Based upon their previous observations during the course of surveillance, the officers saw that all guests approached and entered the townhouse through the rear entrance. As the rear patio connected to an adjoining parking lot along a paved sidewalk, it would be reasonable for members of the public to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>proach the townhouse through the rear entryway as well. Moreover, although a dog was chained in the backyard, the patio was not fenced and contained no signs forbidding trespassers. Accordingly, the officers reasonably approached the rear door to conduct a \u201cknock and talk.\u201d Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Roberts\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In his motion to remand, Roberts asserts that the case should be remanded for resentencing in light of the FSA. The FSA increased the threshold quantities of cocaine base needed to trigger certain mandatory minimum sentences under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2011). This court has not yet ruled on whether the FSA is retroactively applicable to a defendant, like Roberts, who committed the offense prior to August 3, 2010, the effective date of the FSA, but was sentenced after that date. <em>See United States v. Bullard, </em>645 F.3d 237, 248 n. 5 (4th Cir.2011) (reserving judgment on \u201cwhether the FSA could be found to apply to defendants whose offenses were committed before August 3, 2010, but who have not yet been sentenced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">However, the district court determined Roberts\u2019s advisory Guidelines range based upon his status as a career offender, not his drug quantities. Although 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute 12.8 grams of cocaine base, Roberts\u2019s status as a career offender governed his subsequent advisory Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(3) (2010). Accordingly, any change in the minimum mandatory sentence for possession with intent to distribute 12.8 grams of cocaine base would not affect Roberts\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and deny Roberts\u2019s motion to remand. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
