Our jurisdiction is governed by under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings and review de novo its legal conclusions. <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, 542 </em>F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that even if credible, Cao did not establish that the Chinese police targeted him on account of a protected ground. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, 555 </em>F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Thus, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The agency determined that Cao waived his withholding of removal and CAT claims by failing to meaningfully challenge them. Cao does not challenge this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b677-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
