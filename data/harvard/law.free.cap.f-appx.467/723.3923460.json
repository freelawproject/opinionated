Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">Toledo has been in the United States since her parents brought her here from Brazil when she was six years old, on a nonimmigrant tourist visa. She has an approved 1-130 petition based on her marriage to a United States citizen. She has a college education. She has no criminal record. Additionally, she has never returned to Brazil and is not fluent in Portuguese. Toledo\u2019s case satisfies the requirements of ICE Director John Morton\u2019s June 17, 2011 memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-19\">B. BIA\u2019s denial of Toledo\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002). We grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-21\">We have jurisdiction to review Toledo\u2019s equitable tolling claim because she properly raised it before the BIA in her \u201cReply to Government\u2019s Opposition to Motion to Reopen.\u201d <em>See Brezilien v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 403, 413 (9th Cir.2009) (holding petitioner properly exhausted issue because it was raised \u201c[i]n his final brief before the BIA\u201d). Specifically, in her reply brief to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>the BIA, Toledo contended that \u201cTolling of the time limitations is permitted and warranted in this case because [Toledo] has been diligent and could not have filed her motion at an earlier date.\u201d Although Toledo\u2019s discussion of equitable tolling was cursory, it was \u201csufficient to put the BIA on notice\u201d of the equitable tolling issue and was therefore properly exhausted. <em>Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721 (9th Cir. 2004) (per curiam); <em>see also Aden v. Holder, </em>589 F.3d 1040, 1047 (9th Cir.2009) (explaining that a petitioner can properly exhaust an issue by \u201cmention[ing]\u201d the issue in his brief to the BIA, even though he fails to discuss the issue \u201cat any length\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Because the BIA failed to address Toledo\u2019s equitable tolling claim, the BIA abused its discretion when it denied Toledo\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1006, 1015 (9th Cir.2005) (remanding to the BIA where it denied petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen without addressing petitioner\u2019s equitable tolling argument). Accordingly, we remand Toledo\u2019s case to the BIA to consider Toledo\u2019s equitable tolling claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Petition GRANTED; REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b752-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b753-8\">TASHIMA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AvnY\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">I would deny the petition for review because Toledo\u2019s equitable tolling claim, which the majority faults the BIA for failing to address in denying her motion to reopen, was not properly exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Although Toledo mentioned \u201ctolling\u201d in her reply brief, she never presented any facts or any argument on the issue to the BIA. Thus, her filing does not meet \u201c[t]he policy underlying the exhaustion requirement ... to give an administrative agency the opportunity to resolve a case or controversy or to correct its own errors before judicial intervention.\u201d <em>Zara v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 927, 931 (9th Cir.2004). In fact, in her supplemental briefing, Toledo <em>admits </em>that her attorney failed to raise any tolling claim before the BIA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the claim was not exhausted, it is not ripe for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">I would therefore deny the petition for review, and respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-11\">. Toledo argues that her attorney Guajardo\u2019s \"failure to raise the one claim that provides relief from the time bar must constitute deficient performance. <em>The BIA simply could not consider an argument that was not raised.\" </em>Supp. Brief at 29 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
