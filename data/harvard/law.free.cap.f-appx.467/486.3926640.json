His guilty plea reserved the right to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. He now exercises that right, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">From a police helicopter flying over a rural area in Clinton County, Kentucky, a police \u201cspotter\u201d identified marijuana plants growing a few hundred yards behind Witherspoon\u2019s home in a neighboring cornfield. The spotter alerted a team of police officers on the ground to the marijuana and directed the officers to the driveway of the house nearest the cornfield. The house\u2014 which stood remote from other homes in the area \u2014 belonged to Witherspoon, who rented the house but did not own or maintain the adjacent cornfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Witherspoon\u2019s property consisted of a one-acre plot of land situated between the main road and a large cornfield. Three buildings sit on the property arranged as follows: Facing the property from the front, a house surrounded by a mowed lawn stands on the left side of the property. From the right side of the house, a gravel driveway leads back to a metal-sided outbuilding. The metal outbuilding abuts a wooden shed and forms an \u201cL,\u201d the interior angle of which faces the cornfield behind the property. Behind the metal building, a weedy and overgrown area interspersed with patches of bare dirt extends to the edge of the cornfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">After the officers parked near Wither-spoon\u2019s property, the spotter led them to several large marijuana plants a few hundred yards into the cornfield. Once the officers destroyed the plants, the spotter shepherded them back to their vehicles via a route near the edge of the cornfield behind Witherspoon\u2019s property. As they approached this edge of the cornfield, the officers discovered a six-foot-tall marijuana plant sitting in a tub between the first few rows of corn. The discovery prompted one officer to search the nearby edge of the cornfield, where he found several plastic trays containing around 150 marijuana seedlings. These plants sat approximately 60 yards \u201cdirectly behind\u201d Witherspoon\u2019s house, in the first few rows of corn at the edge of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">The seedlings suggested cultivation, and nearby footprints identified a possible cultivator. A recent rain left the ground muddy, and officer James McArthur noticed fresh-looking tracks near the marijuana plants. The tracks marked a path between the marijuana seedlings and the entrance to the metal outbuilding on Witherspoon\u2019s property. Believing that someone walking from the outbuildings to tend to the seedlings created the tracks, McArthur followed them from the cornfield into the clearing behind the outbuilding. Once in the clearing, McArthur noticed another tub containing several large marijuana plants nestled within the corner of the \u201cL\u201d formed by the two outbuildings. Though he recognized these plants after following the footprints into the clearing, McArthur testified that the plants were visible from the edge of the cornfield. McArthur followed the footprints to their terminus, the entrance of the metal outbuilding. Professedly out of concern for officer safety, McArthur entered the building, where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>found an additional tray of marijuana seedlings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Only after his initial search of Wither-spoon\u2019s outbuilding and surrounding area did McArthur seek a warrant to search Witherspoon\u2019s property. His affidavit in support of the search warrant stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">Four marijuana plants where [sic] spotted in a cornfield approximately two hundred yards behind residence by Kentucky State Police Spotter G. Wilson. The Marijuana Strike Force located the plants in the cornfield and eradicated the plants. While in route [sic] back to the vehicles a large marijuana plant was located in between the weeds behind residence and corn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">While looking around edge of cornfield approximately 149 plants were located between the corn and weeds in plastic containers. There also what [sic] appeared to be fresh footprints in the mud from the outbuilding to the cornfield. Following the foot prints a plastic potting tub was visible with approximately five marijuana plants beside the outbuilding and an air compressor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">A state judge, satisfied that probable cause existed, issued the search warrant. Armed with the warrant, police officers searched Witherspoon\u2019s property and seized marijuana, marijuana seeds, and other items associated with marijuana manufacturing, along with several firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">A grand jury charged Witherspoon with manufacturing 100 or more marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(vii). At his arraignment, Witherspoon pleaded not guilty and moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of his property, including marijuana seized from his house, his outbuildings, and from the cornfields behind his property. Witherspoon argued that McArthur included knowingly false statements in the affidavit supporting the search warrant, that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to search Witherspoon\u2019s property, and that the affidavit contained information discovered through a warrantless search of Witherspoon\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The district court denied Witherspoon\u2019s motion to suppress, finding (1) that the search warrant affidavit contained only lawfully obtained information and (2) that the officers inevitably would have discovered the evidence Witherspoon sought to suppress absent the allegedly unlawful search. After the court denied his motion for reconsideration raising the same arguments, Witherspoon conditionally pleaded guilty, preserving the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">On appeal, Witherspoon again argues that the affidavit contains information obtained during an unlawful search of his curtilage, and that without this ill-gotten evidence the affidavit fails to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between the marijuana in the cornfield and Witherspoon\u2019s property. Further, he challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that the inevitable-discovery doctrine bars his claim. Last, he argues that McArthur knowingly included material false statements and omitted material facts from the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>See United States v. Dillard, </em>438 F.3d 675, 680 (6th Cir.2006). We find clear error only if, after reviewing the record in the light most likely to support the district court\u2019s decision, we are left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Navarro-Camacho, </em>186 F.3d 701, 705 (6th Cir.1999).)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>B. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Witherspoon wisely refrains from challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that the search warrant affidavit demonstrated probable cause to search his property. Probable cause exists when common sense suggests a \u201cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). An affidavit demonstrating such a probability must establish \u201ca nexus between the place to be searched and the evidence sought.\u201d <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>360 F.3d 591, 594 (6th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Van Shutters, </em>163 F.3d 331, 336-37 (6th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">McArthur\u2019s affidavit in support of the search warrant described overwhelming evidence of the illegal cultivation of marijuana, all of which pointed directly at Witherspoon\u2019s property. First, a \u201clarge marijuana plant\u201d grew between the weeds behind Witherspoon\u2019s property and the cornfields. Another 149 marijuana seedlings in plastic containers skirted Wither-spoon\u2019s property, resting between the weeds and corn that marked the end of Witherspoon\u2019s property and the beginning of the cornfield. Footprints in the mud connected the marijuana plants in the cornfield to Witherspoon\u2019s property; the tracks evidenced a commute between the plants and the entrance of an outbuilding behind Witherspoon\u2019s house. Last, approximately five marijuana plants sat in a plastic potting tub beside the outbuilding. Based on these facts \u2014 particularly the \u201csignificant\u201d number of plants at the edge of the cornfield, the fresh footprints, and the marijuana plants near the outbuilding \u2014 the district court correctly found a nexus sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In evaluating probable cause, Wither-spoon asks us to excise the portions of the search warrant affidavit describing the location of the plants as \u201cbetween the weeds behind [the] residence and [the] corn,\u201d the footprints leading from the plants to the outbuilding, and the five large plants located near the outbuilding. He contends that the police officers could not see the footprints and marijuana plants near his outbuilding without following the footprints out of the cornfield and onto the bare patch of land surrounding his outbuildings \u2014 an area he claims lies within the curtilage of his home. Because the officers entered this clearing without a warrant, Witherspoon argues that the affidavit\u2019s statements describing the plants near the outbuilding and the footprints are the products of an unlawful search.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The district court disagreed. Crediting McArthur\u2019s testimony that he could see the trail of footprints and the marijuana plants from the edge of the cornfield, the court found that \u201cnone of the evidence obtained from the illegal search was used in the search warrant affidavit.\u201d <em>See Widgren v. Maple Grove Twp., </em>429 F.3d 575, 581 (6th Cir.2005) (holding that naked-eye observations of a house or property from neighboring property or open fields do not constitute Fourth Amendment searches).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">We do not find this conclusion clearly erroneous, but Witherspoon\u2019s arguments on appeal fail for a more fundamental reason: Witherspoon did not request, and the district court did not make, factual findings regarding the extent of Wither-spoon\u2019s curtilage. Because the district court found that the footprints and marijuana plants were visible from the edge of the cornfield \u2014 an area everyone agreed lay outside the curtilage \u2014 it rejected Wither-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>spoon\u2019s argument without delineating the boundaries of the curtilage. The absence of a finding on the extent of Witherspoon\u2019s curtilage is fatal to his arguments on appeal, because he must demonstrate an expectation of privacy in the area behind his outbuildings before claiming that the officers intruded on that expectation. While the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections extend to a home\u2019s curtilage, <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984), Witherspoon, as proponent of the motion to suppress, bears the burden of establishing that the challenged search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. <em>United States v. Richards, </em>659 F.3d 527, 536 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Witherspoon fails to meet this burden. He comes nearest to proving an incursion on his privacy by pointing to McArthur\u2019s admission that he did not see the marijuana plants next to the outbuildings until he stood \u201cvery close\u201d to them. The district court acknowledged that the plants located next to Witherspoon\u2019s outbuilding sat \u201cwithin the curtilage,\u201d and the government conceded the point. But showing that McArthur verged on entering the curtilage does not show that he invaded it, and we accordingly find no reason to strike any of the challenged evidence from the affidavit supporting probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Witherspoon offers a stronger argument that the officers invaded his privacy by entering his metal outbuilding, where they found another tray of marijuana plants. McArthur responds that officer safety justified the intrusion. Fresh footprints in the mud \u2014 McArthur estimates that the tracks were less than six hours old \u2014 led from the marijuana seedlings in the cornfield to the door of the metal outbuilding. These circumstances, McArthur claims, led him to fear that someone might be hiding, armed, inside the building. Witherspoon rejects this explanation, citing the exclusionary rule, which \u201cprohibits the admission of evidence seized in searches and seizures that are deemed unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment\u201d as requiring suppression of the outbuilding evidence. <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>61 F.3d 494, 497 (6th Cir.1995). We need not settle this disagreement because, as the district court correctly found, the inevitable-discovery doctrine trumps Wither-spoon\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The inevitable-discovery doctrine provides that where \u201ctainted evidence would be admissible if in fact discovered through an independent source, it should be admissible if it inevitably would have been discovered.\u201d Mur<em>ray v. United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 539, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988). The doctrine thus avoids \u201cput[ting] the police in a worse position than they would have been in absent any error or violation.\u201d <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431, 443, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984). We apply the rule in two settings: (1) when an \u201cindependent, un- \u25a0 tainted investigation ... inevitably would have uncovered the same evidence\u201d; or (2) when there exist \u201cother compelling facts establishing that the disputed evidence inevitably would have been discovered.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>61 F.3d at 499. Circuit precedent holds that \u201can alternate, independent line of investigation is not required for the inevitable discovery exception to apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499-500.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We apply the doctrine where officers follow a potentially illegal search with a valid, warrant-supported search. <em>See, e.g., Murray, </em>487 U.S. at 541^3,108 S.Ct. 2529 (remanding case for consideration of the inevitable-discovery doctrine where police initially conducted an unlawful search of a warehouse but later obtained a search warrant and conducted a lawful search); <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>396 F.3d 751, 758-60 (6th Cir.2005) (upholding the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>of a motion to suppress where initial unlawful search was followed by a lawful search); <em>United States v. Keszthelyi, </em>308 F.3d 557, 574 (6th Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]he inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule applies when ... evidence discovered during an illegal search would have been discovered during a later legal search and the second search inevitably would have occurred in the absence of the first.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">That is precisely what happened here. First, the search could not affect the issuing judge\u2019s decision to issue a warrant because the search warrant affidavit included no information gleaned from the unlawful search. Before entering the outbuilding, the officers legally discovered marijuana plants in the nearby cornfield, over a hundred marijuana seedlings in the rows of corn directly behind Witherspoon\u2019s home, and several large marijuana plants next to buildings on Witherspoon\u2019s property. Nor is there any reason to believe that the officers would refrain from searching the outbuilding absent the initial, unlawful search: if the marijuana surrounding the outbuilding failed to settle a sufficient cloud of suspicion over the building, fresh footprints led from the marijuana seedlings directly to the building\u2019s entrance. We thus agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the officers would have found the evidence in the outbuilding\u2014 along with everything else discovered during the later search \u2014 absent the initial, allegedly unlawful search.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Finally, Witherspoon presses that McArthur exaggerated some facts and omitted others from the warrant affidavit. Specifically, Witherspoon asserts that McArthur\u2019s affidavit (1) lied about the existence of a \u201ccontinuous\u201d set of footprints from the outbuilding to the marijuana plants in the cornfield; (2) exaggerated the proximity of the trays of small plants to Witherspoon\u2019s residence; and (3) failed to inform the issuing judge that he conducted a warrantless search of Witherspoon\u2019s outbuilding and that Witherspoon did not own the cornfield behind the property. Under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>a court must strike from a warrant affidavit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahd\">statements that the defendant can prove by a preponderance of the evidence to be both (a) materially false and (b) made with reckless or intentional disregard for their falsity. If the redacted affidavit, purged of recklessly and materially false statements, no longer establishes probable cause, then the court must hold the resulting search warrant invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az6\"><em>United States v. Elkins, </em>300 F.3d 638, 649 (6th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">After hearing McArthur\u2019s testimony and reviewing the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, the district court rejected Witherspoon\u2019s arguments. It instead (1) credited McArthur\u2019s testimony that he \u201cwas able to follow a set of footprints ... to the building and back\u201d; (2) accepted McArthur\u2019s explanation of his alleged exaggeration of the marijuana seedlings\u2019 proximity to Witherspoon\u2019s residence; and (3) found that McArthur\u2019s failure to mention his unlawful search would not have affected the issuing judge\u2019s probable cause determination, because none of the evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful search was included in the affidavit. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we discern no error in these conclusions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Witherspoon\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
