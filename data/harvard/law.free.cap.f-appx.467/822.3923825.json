After review, we vacate and remand for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b850-22\">In 2005, Porter was indicted on 17 drug- and firearm-related offenses. A jury found him guilty of all 17 offenses, and the district court sentenced him to 182 years\u2019 imprisonment. This Court affirmed Porter\u2019s convictions and sentence on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Porter, </em>293 Fed.Appx. 700, 704-08 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-23\">In 2010, Porter filed this <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate under \u00a7 2255, asserting ten claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, nine by his pretrial/stand-by trial counsel and one by his appellate counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addressing Porter\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court discussed the claims against his pretrial/stand-by trial counsel and found they lacked merit, but it did not discuss the claim against his appellate counsel. This Court granted a certificate of appeal (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-24\">Wfiiether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>when it failed to address Porter\u2019s argument that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to compel witnesses in his favor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-25\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b850-26\">In <em>Clisby, </em>this Court instructed district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus prior to granting or denying relief. <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc)(involving state prisoner\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition); <em>see Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009) (applying <em>Clisby </em>to a federal prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion). If the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>court does not address all claims prior to issuing judgment, this Court \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Porter argues, and the government concedes, that the district court did not address Porter\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. We agree that the district court addressed Porter\u2019s claims against his pretrial/stand-by trial counsel but never addressed the claims against his appellate counsel. This failure to consider all of the claims set forth in his \u00a7 2255 motion violates <em>Clisby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">We reject Porter\u2019s invitation to consider the merits of his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. Under <em>Clisby, </em>our role is to vacate the judgment \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and remand to the district court for consideration of the unaddressed claim in the first instance. <em>Id. </em>Porter offers no reason that the district court will not be able to fairly review his appellate counsel claim. Furthermore, the merits of Porter\u2019s appellate counsel claim exceed the scope of our review, which is limited to the <em>Clisby </em>issue specified in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250 (11th Cir.1998). Consistent with these reasons, we vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand the case to the district court to consider Porter\u2019s ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-17\">. Porter argued that by denying his request for a trial continuance to obtain a ballistics expert, the trial court effectively violated his Sixth Amendment right to compel witnesses in his favor, and that his appellate counsel's failure to raise this issue on appeal constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\">. In reviewing the district court's denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error, and questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
