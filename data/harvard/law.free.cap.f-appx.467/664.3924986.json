Rouse appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-31\">Rouse contends that he was denied parole in violation of his plea agreement, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>that the Governor\u2019s decision to deny him parole was not supported by \u201csome evidence\u201d and therefore violated his due process rights. After briefing was completed in this case, this court held that a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) is required to challenge the denial of parole. <em>See Hayward v. Marshall, </em>608 F.3d 546, 554-55 (9th Cir.2010) (en banc). Now the Supreme Court has held that the only federal right at issue in the parole context is procedural, and the only proper inquiry is what process the inmate received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly. <em>See Swarthout v. Cooke, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 859, 863, 178 L.Ed.2d 732 (2011). Because Rouse raises no procedural challenges regarding his parole hearing, and jurists of reason would not find it debatable whether the petition states any valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right, a COA cannot issue, and we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">DISMISS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
