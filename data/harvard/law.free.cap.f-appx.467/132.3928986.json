The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendant. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">On June 16, 2003, Stanley was involved in a bar brawl in Pittsburgh that resulted in the stabbing death of Ronald Barber, Sr. Based on the testimony of an eyewitness alleging Stanley held Barber while another man stabbed him and identifying Stanley from a photo array, Detective Joseph Myers submitted an Affidavit of Probable Cause to the county coroner, who issued a warrant for Stanley\u2019s arrest for criminal homicide. Stanley alleges he was not involved in Barber\u2019s death and claims Myers\u2019s Affidavit ignored exonerating statements that contradicted the eyewitness testimony. Stanley was charged with criminal homicide but, in the course of a bench trial, the charges were withdrawn with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Stanley then filed this claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s policy at the time of his arrest permitting an officer to submit an Affidavit of Probable Cause without any review and on the strength of a single witness violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendant on the ground that Stanley had presented no evidence that the policy had caused the alleged constitutional violation. <em>Stanley v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>No. 9-1450, 2011 WL 1327634 (W.D.Pa. Apr. 6, 2011). Stanley timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">II.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">Section 1983 provides a cause of action for constitutional violations committed under color of state law. Under \u00a7 1983, a municipality may not be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, but may be responsible when a municipal policy or custom itself caused the violation in question. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). To establish liability based on a municipal policy or custom, the plaintiff must demonstrate the municipality was \u201cthe \u2018moving force\u2019 behind the injury alleged\u201d by showing that there was a \u201cdirect causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.\u201d <em>Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997). A plaintiff must also establish that the municipal decision \u201creflects deliberate indifference to the risk that a violation of a particular constitutional or statutory right will follow the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411,117 S.Ct. 1382. This is a \u201cstringent standard of fault\u201d that \u201crequir[es] proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 117 S.Ct. 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Stanley\u2019s conclusory allegations cannot satisfy this standard here. Even if we entertain the questionable assertion that the coroner lacked probable cause and Stanley\u2019s constitutional rights were violated, Stanley has offered no evidence that this violation resulted from the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s policy. As the District Court noted, neither the practice of allowing a coroner to assess probable cause nor the policy permitting a single officer to submit an affidavit can be considered the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind the alleged constitutional violation where Stanley has not shown how these particular policies were directly responsible for the issuance of the arrest warrant. Nor do Stanley\u2019s allegations satisfy the \u201cstringent\u201d deliberate indifference standard. Stanley has offered no evidence that the harm he suffered was a known or obvious consequence of the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s policy, which did not itself violate any constitutional requirements. At best, Stanley urges us to find municipal liability based on the \u201cgeneralized ... risk\u201d that the policy made \u201ca violation of rights more <em>likely.\u201d Brown, </em>520 U.S. at 410, 117 S.Ct. 1382. But the Supreme Court has already stated that such a showing alone does not satisfy the deliberate indifference standard, <em>id. </em>at 410-11, 117 S.Ct. 1382, and Stanley\u2019s attempt to impute the actions of Myers and the coroner to the City of Pittsburgh threatens to collapse the well-established distinction between municipal liability and <em>respondeat superior </em>liability. Because of these legal shortcomings, Stanley\u2019s municipal liability claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 &amp; 1343.
