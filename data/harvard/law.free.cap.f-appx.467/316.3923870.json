In this appeal, Gutierrez contends that the district court erred in increasing his Sentencing Guidelines offense level by 16 levels based on its determination that Gutierrez\u2019s 2007 Texas conviction of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon constituted a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-19\">Because Gutierrez\u2019s Texas conviction of aggravated assault qualified as a conviction for the enumerated offense of aggravated assault, the district court did not err in imposing the 16-level enhancement. <em>See United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th C\u00edr. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
