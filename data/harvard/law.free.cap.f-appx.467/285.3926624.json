Osequera Morales argues that he is actually innocent of the offense of conviction. He contends that he pleaded guilty to an indictment that charged him with a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), which provides a maximum sentence of five years. Therefore, he argues that his 195-month sentence is invalid because it exceeds the statutory maximum sentence for the offense to which he pleaded guilty. Osequera Morales contends that his claim falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because it is based on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), which is retroactively applicable to his case on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">A petitioner can attack the validity of his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). The petitioner shoulders the burden of affirmatively showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The Court held in <em>Begay </em>that a conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol was not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 148, 128 S.Ct. 1581. Thus, the holding in <em>Begay </em>has no relevance to Osequera Morales\u2019s case. Additionally, <em>Begay </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>In re Bradford, </em>660 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">Osequera Morales has not shown that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Thus, he has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
