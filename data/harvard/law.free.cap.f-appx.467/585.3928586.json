We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Shakur v. Schriro, </em>514 F.3d 878, 883 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Cir.2008). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Trimble v. City of Santa Rosa, </em>49 F.3d 583, 584 (9th Cir. 1995) (per curiam). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Barendt\u2019s RLUIPA claim relating to other inmates\u2019 ability to participate with Barendt in a candle-lighting service, because he failed to introduce evidence that this limited restriction on a group religious service substantially burdened his ability to exercise his religion. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l(a)(l)-(2); War<em>soldier v. Woodford, </em>418 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir.2005) (prisoner has initial burden to demonstrate that prison policies constitute a substantial burden on the exercise of his religious beliefs); <em>id. </em>at 996 (prison policy imposes substantial burden when it \u201cintentionally puts significant pressure on inmates ... to abandon their religious beliefs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Insofar as Barendt\u2019s complaint can be construed as seeking damages for temporarily restricting Barendt from participating in the candle-lighting service at the appropriate time, summary judgment was proper because defendants would be entitled to sovereign and qualified immunity. <em>See Sossamon v. Texas, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1651, 1663, 179 L.Ed.2d 700 (2011) (\u201cStates, in accepting federal funding, do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under RLUIPA\u201d); <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 243, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (state officers entitled to qualified immunity if their actions do not violate clearly established law); <em>see also Warsoldier, </em>418 F.3d at 997 n. 7 (\u201cThere exists little Ninth Circuit authority construing RLUIPA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">To the extent that Barendt sought the disgorgement of federal funds for any alleged RLUIPA violations, the district court properly determined that granting such relief would not be likely to redress his alleged injury. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 103, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (party invoking federal jurisdiction must establish the \u201clikelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Barendt\u2019s appeal of the denial of his motion for preliminary injunctive relief is moot. <em>See Mount Graham Red Squirrel v. Madigan, </em>954 F.2d 1441, 1450 (9th Cir. 1992) (when underlying claims have been decided, the reversal of a denial of a preliminary injunction would have no practical consequences, and the issue is therefore moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Barendt\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
