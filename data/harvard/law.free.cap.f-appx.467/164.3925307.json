After exhausting his state remedies, Scanlon filed this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 action, raising eight claims of error. The district court ultimately awarded summary judgment to the State of North Carolina and dismissed Scanlon\u2019s petition. The district court also granted Scanlon a certificate of appealability (COA) on a single claim: whether his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), by failing to review and use Harris\u2019 medical records at trial. Cognizant of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reminder that a habeas petitioner\u2019s burden for meeting <em>Strickland </em>is sufficiently high that \u201ceven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable,\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>- U.S. -, 181 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011), we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">The North Carolina Court of Appeals (the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d) summarized the trial evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-20\">[Donald Scanlon] worked for Claudine Wilson Harris as a handyman from October 1995 through January 1996 [in Durham, North Carolina], [Scanlon] lived at Ms. Harris\u2019 residence until she discovered that he had been misusing her credit cards and forging checks on her checking account. After Ms. Harris evicted [Scanlon] from her home and sought to take out warrants against him, [Scanlon] threatened to kill her. Ms. Harris told her sister, Barbara Breeden, that she feared that [Scanlon] had a key to her home and she felt that she should have the locks changed. Ms. Harris never changed the locks to her residence; however, as a result of her fears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>for her own safety, Ms. Harris\u2019 nephew, Carlos Breeden, and his girlfriend came to live with her at the end of January 1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">At around 9:00 p.m. on 27 February 1996, Carlos Breeden found Ms. Harris\u2019 body in her bed with a plastic bag wrapped around her head and tied in a knot. Ms. Harris\u2019 sweatshirt was pushed up, revealing her underclothes, and her sweat pants and under pants were partially pulled down. Near her bed was a soup can punched with holes, described as a pipe for smoking controlled substances, and a torn-up letter to [Scanlon] expressing her feelings for him. A toxicology report revealed that she had cocaine metabolites in her blood. On 10 March 1996, authorities arrested [Scanlon] in Syracuse, New York (on unrelated charges) and found in his possession several of Ms. Harris\u2019 credit cards, as well as a blank check from Ms. Harris\u2019 business checking account. The arresting officers also seized pieces of paper containing Ms. Harris\u2019 address, date of birth, social security number, and her First Union checking account number. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, where [Scanlon] admittedly abandoned Ms. Harris\u2019 car a few days before, police officers found three keys in the car, none of which fit the lock to Ms. Harris\u2019 home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><em>State v. Scanlon, </em>176 N.C.App. 410, 626 S.E.2d 770, 775 (2006) (Wynn, J.). Based on the foregoing, a grand jury indicted Scanlon on March 18, 1996, charging him with the first-degree murder of Harris, felonious breaking and entering of her residence, and felonious larceny and possession of her car and her credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">At trial, the State introduced forensic evidence indicating that Scanlon was in Harris\u2019 home near the time of her death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA7b\">A cigarette butt in Harris\u2019 house, not present two days before her death, contained saliva that matched Scanlon\u2019s saliva. Scanlon\u2019s head hairs and one pubic hair were found on Harris\u2019 bed. Further, on the day of Harris\u2019 death Scanlon pawned a gold ring similar to one that Carlos Breeden owned and which went missing following Harris\u2019 death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO2\"><em>Scanlon v. Harkleroad, </em>740 F.Supp.2d 706, 709 (M.D.N.C.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The State also put forth evidence that Scanlon told his arresting agents that he was abducted from his motel room in Durham the weekend before Harris\u2019 murder and, after being held for several days, was released, given Harris\u2019 car and credit cards, and told to leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Scanlon\u2019s trial counsel, Brian Aus and Lee Castle, pursued a two-track defense by contending that Harris\u2019 death was not a homicide \u2014 but rather a suicide or an accidental death due to cocaine-induced coronary blockage during attempted sexual asphyxiation \u2014 and that Scanlon was not in Durham at the time of Harris\u2019 death. To support the theory of accidental death, Scanlon\u2019s expert, Dr. Lawrence Harris, testified that, based on \u201cthe plastic bag, cocaine metabolites, \u2018new clots\u2019 blocking the bypass artery in Ms. Harris\u2019 heart, her disarranged clothing, and the round bed where her body was discovered,\u201d Harris died during attempted sexual asphyxiation. <em>State v. Scanlon, </em>626 S.E.2d at 776. On cross-examination, however, Dr. Harris admitted that he never reviewed Harris\u2019 medical records and conceded that it was likely someone else put the bedcovers over her and tied the knot in the plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">To counter this defense, the State elicited testimony from Dr. Robert Thompson, a forensic pathologist who supervised Harris\u2019 autopsy. Dr. Thompson testified that Harris\u2019 cause of death was asphyxiation and that the manner of death was homicide. Consistent with this view, Dr. Thompson testified that Harris had bruis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ing around her eye that could have been caused by a fist and marks on her arms that could have been caused by someone grabbing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Also at trial, Seanlon put forth evidence that Harris was hospitalized in December 1995, had severe coronary artery disease, had likely suffered a heart attack in the past, and had undergone coronary bypass surgery. The State, however, represented that Harris\u2019 surgery had helped her regain some functionality and corrected her heart problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The jury convicted Scanlon of all charges and, following a penalty phase, he was sentenced to death. On May 5, 2000, Scanlon filed a Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel was ineffective under <em>Strickland </em>for failing to use Harris\u2019 medical records at trial to show that her heart condition was extremely serious and to establish that she had a history of clinical depression, making suicide a possible cause of death. The MAR court held an evidentiary hearing, during which Scanlon\u2019s trial attorneys both testified. In addition, Scanlon presented testimony from multiple expert witnesses opining on Harris\u2019 medical records, including a cardiologist, two forensic pathologists, a clinical psychologist, and a psychiatrist. These experts testified, generally, that Harris was a good candidate for \u201csudden death\u201d given her heart condition, particularly if she ingested cocaine. Regarding her mental health records, Scanlon\u2019s experts testified that Harris had significant risk factors for suicide and that her death was consistent with a successful suicide attempt. However, only one expert would affirmatively testify that suicide was the cause of death, but even that expert allowed that he \u201c[did not] have any problem with undetermined\u201d as the cause of death because \u201c[t]here are features of virtually every single manner of death in this case.\u201d (J.A. 2445).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Dr. Thompson also testified at the MAR hearing, and he concluded that although the medical records would have led him to consider suicide or undetermined as the cause of death, ultimately the records did not alter his trial testimony that Harris\u2019 cause of death was asphyxiation and that the manner of death was homicide. Dr. Thompson testified that he based this conclusion in part on the scene of the death\u2014 including the bedcovers placed over Harris and the plastic bag around her head. In addition, Dr. Daniel Gianturco, Harris\u2019 treating psychiatrist, testified that he did not believe Harris was suicidal and that he did not see signs of suicidal ideation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">The MAR court issued its ruling on February 25, 2004, concluding that counsel was not constitutionally ineffective in its representation as to the guilt phase of Scanlon\u2019s trial, but that counsel was ineffective regarding the sentencing phase.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State declined to pursue the death penalty at the new sentencing hearing, and Harris was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Relevant here, Seanlon appealed the MAR court\u2019s denial of relief as to the guilt phase, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Scanlon, </em>626 S.E.2d at 789-91. The Court of Appeals recognized that Scanlon\u2019s claim arose under <em>Strickland, </em>and that Scanlon had the burden of establishing that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency caused him prejudice. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of Appeals affirmed the MAR court\u2019s ruling denying Scanlon relief, concluding that \u201ceven if trial counsel\u2019s actions were objectively unreasonable, [Scanlon] was not prejudiced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The Supreme Court of North Carolina denied Scanlon\u2019s request for discretionary review and dismissed his appeal, and this \u00a7 2254 petition followed. After Scanlon filed his petition, both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The petition was referred to a magistrate judge, who recommended granting the State\u2019s motion and dismissing Scanlon\u2019s petition. The magistrate judge concluded that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient within the meaning of <em>Strickland, </em>but that Scanlon could not establish prejudice. Scanlon timely filed objections and, relevant here, the district court concluded that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was an unreasonable application of Strickland as to the deficient-performance prong. <em>Scanlon v. Harkleroad, </em>740 F.Supp.2d at 728-30. The district court also found, however, that the Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling on the prejudice prong was not an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. Id. </em>at 730. In reaching this conclusion, the court noted \u201csignificant evidence of Scanlon\u2019s guilt that would not have been controverted by the use of the Records at trial,\u201d including the physical evidence tending to place Scanlon in Harris\u2019 residence around the time of the murder, the evidence of Scanlon\u2019s prior threats against Harris, and the evidence that Harris had a \u201cpotential altercation\u201d at or near the time of her death. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The district court therefore <em>granted </em>the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Scanlon\u2019s petition. The court granted Scanlon a COA on his <em>Strickland </em>claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">On appeal, Scanlon agrees with the district court that the Court of Appeals unreasonably applied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deficient-performance prong. Scanlon argues, however, that the district court erred in concluding that the Court of Appeals reasonably applied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. \u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny [Scanlon\u2019s] \u00a7 2254 petition based on the record before the [state court], applying the same standards as did the district court.\u201d <em>Golphin v. Branker, </em>519 F.3d 168, 178 (4th Cir.2008). \u201cPursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u2018AEDPA\u2019), the scope of our review in cases on collateral review from a state court proceeding that adjudicated a claim on the merits is both deferential and highly constrained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, under \u00a7 2254, federal habeas relief may not be granted unless a petitioner shows that the earlier state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to\u201d clearly established federal law, \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; or that it \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of\u2019 such law, \u00a7 2254(d)(1); or that it \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts\u201d in light of the record before the state court, \u00a7 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Recently, the Supreme Court reiterated the scope of federal habeas review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Strickland, </em>claims. <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 786. The Court began by explaining that a showing of error is insufficient under \u00a7 2254, because \u201c[f]or purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), \u2018an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 410, 120 S.Ct. 1495). \u201c[E]ven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786. As the Court succinctly stated, \u201c[i]f this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to be.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In the <em>Strickland </em>context, a federal habeas court \u201cmust determine what arguments or theories supported or, [if none were stated], could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of [the Supreme] Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Habeas relief is appropriate only if \u201cthere is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court\u2019s decision conflicts with [the Supreme] Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court reminded lower courts that, even without \u00a7 2254\u2019s deference, the <em>Strickland </em>standard \u201cis a most deferential one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. Moreover, \u201c[w]hen combined with the extra layer of deference that \u00a7 2254 provides, the result is double deference and the question becomes whether \u2018there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Sec\u2019y, DOC, </em>643 F.3d 907, 910-11 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788). \u201cDouble deference is doubly difficult for a petitioner to overcome, and it will be a rare case in which an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that was denied on the merits in state court is found to merit relief in a federal habeas proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">In this case, the district court properly performed the role of a federal habeas court. It recognized the deferential <em>Strickland </em>standard and applied that standard correctly and in \u201ctandem\u201d with \u00a7 2254(d) to determine that the Court of Appeals\u2019 application of <em>Strickland </em>was not unreasonable. <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788. In so doing, the district court heeded the <em>Harrington </em>Court\u2019s admonition that an <em>\u201cunreasonable </em>application ... is different from an <em>incorrect </em>application of federal law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 785 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original), and \u201cguard[ed] against the danger of equating unreasonableness under <em>Strickland </em>with unreasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 788. Accordingly, having reviewed the voluminous record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Scanlon, </em>740 F.Supp.2d at 728-30.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment denying and dismissing Scanlon\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\">. The MAR court based its determination regarding the sentencing phase on the State\u2019s use of the aggravating factor that the murder was \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\u201d The MAR court concluded that the medical records could have disputed the State's position that the murder was cruel and heinous because Harris suffered \"air hunger\u201d before her death. In the MAR court's view, the medical records could have shown that, given Harris' heart condition, her death would have occurred quickly. (J.A. 4311-4317).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\">. Scanlon also contends that the Court of Appeals' decision is \"contrary to\u201d \"clearly established federal law\u201d under 2254(d)(1). That prong of \u00a7 2254 applies when the state court failed to recognize the clearly established federal law or applied the incorrect clearly established law. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (noting \"contrary to\u201d clause applied \u201cif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>indistinguishable facts.\u201d). In this case, however, the Court of Appeals applied the correct federal law (Strickland) and the \u201ccontrary to\u201d clause is not implicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, we do not address the State's alternate argument that the Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply the deficient-performance prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
