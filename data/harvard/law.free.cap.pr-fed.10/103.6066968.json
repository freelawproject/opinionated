It has been decided in the second circuit that this does not apply where the application was duly made before the declaration of war, and the matter before the court is the final proof. This was originally decided by Judge Mayer of the district court in New York city, and was affirmed, but with a strong dissenting opinion by Judge Hough.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The question does not seem to have been reported from the first circuit, although it is understood that Judge Morton at Boston has also admitted applicants under the same circumstances.
