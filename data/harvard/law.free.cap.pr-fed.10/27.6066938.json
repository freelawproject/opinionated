When it is called to-day it is discovered that tbe demurrer in question is a general demurrer, and, under tbe practice of tbis court, cannot be entertained. Leave was given to tbe defendant to amend, which has been done, and tbe bearing has been set for next Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Tbe motion is made under \u00a7 13 of tbe Act of March 1, 1902 (Compilation, p. 849), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u201cEvery remedy to secure tbe effectiveness of a judgment shall be void if tbe suit be suspended on petition of tbe party in whose favor tbe remedy was <em>granted; </em>or if tbe date fixed by tbe court for tbe bearing be extended on tbe petition of tbe said party, except in case tbe petition for suspension of proceedings or extension of time be based upon force majeure properly proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>I tbinlc I shall have to deny the motion. There are two grounds. It is perfectly true that this Act of March 1, 1902, to secure the effectiveness of judgments (Compilation, p. 849), is a special act and is very strict in its terms. It is adopted from the Spanish Code of Civil Procedure, very much modified however, and pursues a good many of the details of that Code. It is to be construed with a view to advance the remedy sought, but at the same time must not be pressed beyond the fair meaning of the words. The motion is to declare the remedy void, because the date fixed by the court for hearing has been extended upon the petition of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">1.' In the first place, I do not think this comes within the earlier provision of \u00a7 13, that every \u201cremedy\u201d to secure the effectiveness of judgments shall be void in certain cases, because the present condition of the case does not come within the proper meaning of the word \u201cremedy,\u201d so far as this statute is concerned. Turning to \u00a7 2 of the act, \u00a7 5234 of the Revised Statutes of Porto Rico, we are told that if the obligation be for the payment of any sum of money, \u2014 and I take it that is the provision under which this suit is brought, \u2014 if the obligation be the payment of any sum of money, the provisional remedy shall consist of the attachment of sufficient property of the debtor to cover the amount'claimed. It would seem, then, that the remedy contemplated by this statute is the attachment, not the order of attachment. The order is a prerequisite, of course, but that is not the definition of the word \u201cremedy.\u201d The order of attach* ment does not specify what particular property shall be levied on, \u2014 that is, it does not need to, \u2014 but the actual attachment does, and we are told here that the remedy in this case is the attachment. I take it that that means the actual levy by the marshal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>oil sufficient property of the debtor. So that it would seem as if the remedy is not at present in a condition for the motion to be sustained under \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">2. And further, the second reason is this. There was no' \u201csuspension of suit,\u201d and I do not think that the \u201cextension of hearing\u201d in this particular case is that contemplated by the second part of \u00a7 13, \u201cif the date fixed by the court for the hearing be extended on petition of the party.\u201d This extension was as much for the convenience of the court as anything else. It may be doubted if \u201chearing\u201d refers property to a mere preliminary like a demurrer. Hearing would property be hearing on the merits. It would seem to be \u201chearing of the suit,\u201d as it is \u201csuspension of the suit\u201d in question. But at all events, even if the demurrer had been heard on the first day, it would have been overruled, because a general demurrer; and the extension of a time to hear a void demurrer can hardly be within the reason of the statute. So that it seems to the court, as_ it stands right now, the motion must be denied. Of course what may happen later by further extensions is another question. I do not pass on that at all. Conditions may arise that would make \u00a7 13 applicable, but I do not think it is applicable just at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The motion to declare the attachment void, therefore, is denied, and the demurrer will be heard Monday.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
