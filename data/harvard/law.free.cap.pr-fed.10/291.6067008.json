It does not seem, however, that this is applicable to the case at .bar, because the joint resolution does not in terms nullify the title to lands. It says only that \u201cevery corporation hereafter authorized to engage,, in agriculture shall by its charter be restricted to the OAvnership and control of not to exceed 500 acres of land.\u201d Whether there could be a cross complaint aiming first to cancel or avoid deeds to excess lands and then .defeat the bill need not be decided. It might well be that in such case, in order to do full justice, the' court would have to go further than merely declaring the plaintiff not the owner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and that the grantors of the land would have to -he .made parties before snch conveyances could be declared void. This might bring in several or many other parties, which might not he allowable under the rules of pleading, inasmuch as they would have .nothing to do with the main object of the bill, their interests not \u201carising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit.\u201d Equity rule 30. However, the case is not presented in this aspect. There is a mere answer, not a cross complaint, although it contains a prayer asking the court to \u201cgrant such affirmative relief as to this Honorable Court may seem just and equitable.\u201d The court could not undertake, under such general allegations, to determine what relief, if any, would be proper, even if the answer was in a different shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">It follows, therefore, that the motion must be granted; and so much of the answer as is headed <em>\u201ca </em>separate and distinct defense,\u201d being the second half of the answer so filed, must be stricken from the'files.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
