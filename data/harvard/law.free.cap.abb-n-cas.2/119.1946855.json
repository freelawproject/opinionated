November, 1876. Foreclosure of a mechanics\u2019 lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-7\">This action was brought by Frederick Marryatt and William Nelson, against Christiana Riley, wife of John Riley, Sophia Palmer, widow and administratrix of John Palmer, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-8\">The plaintiffs rendered work and labor, and furnished materials on and about the erecting of a house on a lot of land owned by one John Palmer. \u2018 The contract was entered into between plaintiffs and said John Palmer in February, 1876. John Palmer died in March, 1876, seized of the premises in question, and leaving his widow, Sophia Palmer, and Christiana Riley, a daughter his only hems at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\">Mrs. Palmer was appointed administratrix in March, 1876. The contract was not completed till about May 1,1876, and on May 12,1876, the notice of lien was filed against the above named defendants, and also the said John Palmer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">The complaint alleged that the work and materials were done and furnished in pursuance of a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>with said John Palmer and the defendants above named, but the evidence showed that the contract was made with John Palmer alone, and that the only connection which the defendants had therewith, was, after the death of John Palmer, to request the plaintiffs to go on and complete th'e contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">It appeared from the evidence that the whole contract price was $525, upon which there was paid by John Palmer in his life time, $300, leaving due on the contract $225, to which is to be added an item of extra work, 79 cents, making the total amount due, $225.79. It also appeared that work to the amount of about $150. was done after the death of Mr. Palmer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-6\"><em>Rufus L.

Rogers, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-8\">McCue, J. [After stating the facts]\u2014The lien law has not in express terms made provision where the owner has died before the completion of the contract and before the filing of the notice of lien, and we have not been able to find any reported cases which can be invoked as authority on this precise point. We are left, therefore, to dispose of the case in such manner as will give effect to the plain intent and scope of the lien law, which was intended, as its title indicates, for the better security of mechanics, laborers and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-9\">The death of John Palmer did not release the plaintiffs from the obligations which they assumed when they entered into the contract, and they were bound to go on and perform the contract notwithstanding the death of one of the parties. And it follows that if they fulfill the contract on their part, they are entitled to all the privileges and securities which attached to the contract at the time they entered into it. The lien law then in force, and in view of which we have the right to presume the contract was entered into by all the parties, gave the plaintiffs the right to secure payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>for their labor and materials by filing a notice of lien as prescribed in section 3 of the act. This notice conld not be filed until the contract had been performed, but could be filed at any time thereafter and within three months of the time of completion. So that from the time the contract was made and the performance of it was entered upon, the corresponding rights and privileges of the parties were fixed, and we do not think that the death of one of the parties can in any way change them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-5\">It follows, therefore, that the plaintiffs had a right to file this notice of lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-6\">It is insisted, however, that the defendants were not parties to the contract, and that the action cannot lie against them, and also, that the action is in violation of the statute which prohibits the bringing of any suits against the heirs or devisees of real estate, in order to charge them with the debts of the testator or intestate, within three years from the granting of letters testamentary or of administration (See 3 <em>R. S. </em>6th ed. p. 119).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-7\">It is also urged that the plaintiffs must first seek payment out of the general estate of the deceased; and that to hold otherwise is in effect to give the plaintiffs a preference over other creditors of the deceased (3 <em>R. S. </em>6th ed. p. 125. \u00a7 18, subdiv. 1).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-8\">To this it may be answered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-9\">1st. No personal claim is made against the defendants. The proceeding is <em>in rem.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-10\">2nd. The provisions of the Revised Statutes above referred to, cannot be held to apply to the case under examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-11\">The right to the lien was coextensive with the contract itself, requiring only that the conditions should be thereafter fulfilled which the law pointed out, viz., the completion of the work, and the filing of the notice within three months thereafter. After which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>effect of the lien, to the extent of the right, title and interest of the' owner, was as. perfect as though the owner had, contemporaneously with the execution of the contract, executed a formal instrument to secure the money which was to grow due on the contract. In other words, the law has provided in this class of contracts a special security by way of lien upon the real estate improved, to the extent of securing the mechanic the value of his labor and materials.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">It is true that as between the heirs at law and next of kin, the personal estate is the primary fund for the payment of all debts \u2022 not' secured by mortgage, and it may well be that on the settlement of the estate, the heir at law will have a right to claim to be re-imbursed whatever amount she may be compelled to pay in order to relieve her inheritance from this lien. But this rule cannot operate to the extent of depriving the plaintiffs of the benefit of the law, which gave them security in a certain event, for the amount which they might expend in the improvement of the real estate in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">This doctrine is, I think, plainly recognized in Taylor <em>v. </em>Taylor (3 <em>Bradford's Surrogate Reports, </em>54), referred to by defendant\u2019s counsel. It does not appear when the liens were filed in the case cited; but it is a fair presumption that they were not filed until after the death of the intestate, because the report shows that at the time of his death, the intestate had made two payments only on the house, leaving a large payment unpaid, and which, by the terms of the contract, was not due until the house was fully completed. The contract was made in January, and the intestate died in the March following, thus giving rise, I think, to the inference, that at the time of his death the contract was not complete, and therefore the contractor could not have been in a position to file a notice of lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Referring to the fact that the amounts due on the contract had been paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate, the surrogate says : \"They were paid out of the land sold in the first instance as a matter of necessity, for being <em>liens, </em>a good title could not be given to the purchaser without paying them.\u201d The surrogate then discusses the ultimate fund out of which these debts were to be discharged, and concluding that the builder, although he had a lien upon the land, had also a right of action against the administratrix, concludes that ultimately the personal estate was bound to discharge these liabilities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\">But whether these liens were filed before or after the death of the intestate, would not, in my view of the law, make any difference. The special law which governs this class of contracts, gives a right to the lien for all moneys which grow due under the contract; and to hold that the death of one of the parties deprives the other of his security, is to introduce an element of insecurity totally inconsistent with the avowed intent of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">I am of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiffs are entitled to enforce their lien and to have the usual decree in such cases, with costs. The decree may provide, if the defendant Riley elect, that the administratrix pay her out of the personal estate of the .intestate, whatever sums the said Riley may be compelled to pay to discharge the lien, and to defray the costs and expenses of this action as the same may be taxed and allowed to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">II. <em>April, </em>1877. Appeal from order denying costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">The foregoing decision was afterwards modified as to costs upon a motion for an extra allowance. The motion was in the nature of an appeal from the taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Mr. Justice McCtns, before whom the motion was heard, delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">\u201cThe mechanics\u2019 lien act provides that costs shall be allowed by the statutes in civil actions <em>(Laws </em>1873, ch. 478, \u00a7 6).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">\u201c The Code gives costs in an action defended by an executor or administrator as in an action against a person defending in his own right; the costs are chargeable only upon the estate or fund unless the court shall direct the same to be paid personally by the defendant for mismanagement or bad faith in such defense. This section is not to be construed to allow suits against executor or administrator where they are now exempted by sec. 41, tit. 3, ch. 2 of the <em>Revised Statutes.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">\u201cSection 41, above referred to, declares that costs cannot be collected against executor or administrator to be levied on their property or of the property of the deceased, unless it appears that the demand has been presented within the time provided by law (six months) and payment has been unreasonably resisted or neglected, or there has been a refusal to refer; in which case the court may award costs against the property of the deceased, having reference to the facts as they appeared in the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">\u201cThe contract was made in February, 1876. The owner died in March following, and the defendant Sophia Palmer was appointed administratrix in the same month; contract was completed about May 1, 1876, and on the 13th of the same month the lien was filed. This action was commenced on or about May 39, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">\u201cThe inventory of the decedent\u2019s estate was filed on May 8, 1876, and as it therein appears the .personal estate amounted to $505.14; deducting therefrom the amount set apart by the statute for the widow, the net personal estate reached the sum of $355.14.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-10\">\u201cIn. view thus of all the facts and circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the case, I do not think that it can be said that the payment of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was unreasonably resisted or neglected; but it is a proper case for the exercise of the discretion vested in the court to deny the usual taxable costs. The plaintiffs, however, should have their proper disbursements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">\u201c The decision heretofore made by me in respect to costs to be modified accordingly, and judgment should be entered only for the amount of the principal, interest and disbursements.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">From this decision the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-7\"><em>Rufus L. </em>Scott, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOr\">I. This case was disposed of as though it were against an executrix, without passing judgment as to the right of costs, independent of that fact; whereas the defendant Riley incurred costs in her individual capacity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-8\">II. The costs could not in any event be charged to the estate (Hallam <em>v. </em>Weed, 24 <em>Barb. </em>546).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-9\">III. The plaintiffs are entitled to costs as a matter of course <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 304 ; Trust <em>v. </em>Pierson, 1 <em>Hilt. </em>292 ; <em>Kneeland's Lien Law, </em>82).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-10\">IV. It is held that mortgages are excluded from the application of section 304 by the language of section 308, which implies the reverse as to lien suits (Gallagher <em>v. </em>Egan, 2 <em>Sandf. </em>742).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-11\"><em>James J.

When the action is brought in the supreme court or in a county court, such direction shall be made in the discretion of the court, as to the payment of costs, as shall be just and equitable, and the judgment entered shall specify to whom and by whom the costs are to be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The Rensselaer county act (1 <em>L. </em>1866, p. 15, c. 778 of 1865, \u00a7 15) prendes that, \u201c Costs and disbursements shall be allowed to either party upon the principles and by the same rules in such proceedings as they are now allowed by law in actions on contract, and shall be included in the judgment recovered; and the expenses incurred in serving said summons upon the owner by publication shall be allowed by the justice, or in the said justices\u2019 court, and added to the amount of costs now allowed in justices\u2019 courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The provisions on the subject in the Buffalo act (2 <em>L. </em>1871, p. 1981,- c. 872, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9), are that upon default of the owner, the clerk of the court may assess the amount due, and \u201cjudgment shall' be entered, establishing the amount of said lien, with the costs, and execution shall issue thereupon, \u201d and that on appeals in actions to enforce liens \u201cshall be thereafter heard, governed and determined, upon the same principles and by the same rules, that appeals in said actions are now heard, governed and determined, with like costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>disbursements, and judgment thereon enforced in the same manner as judgments on appeals are now enforced and collected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">The New York city act <em>(L. </em>1875, pp. 438, 439, 6. 379, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 19) in section 18, after providing that the owner may offer to pay a certain amount into court, &amp;e., is as follows: \u201cIn case the offer be not accepted within ten days, and the plaintiff fails to recover any more favorable judgment against the property, he shall pay all costs in the action incurred by the owner from the time of the offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">The following is section 19 of this act : \u201cCosts in all actions under this act, except as provided in section thirteen, shall rest in the discretion of the court, and may be awarded to or against the plaintiff or defendants, or any or either of them, as may be just.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b153-12\">Reynolds, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqEm\">In this case the question arises whether, under the act passed April 24, 1862, providing for mechanics\u2019 liens in Kings and Queens counties, the prevailing party, in an action brought to foreclose a lien, is entitled to costs as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Subdivision 4 of section 2 of said act provides, in broad and comprehensive terms, that the pleadings and practice in such actions shall be the same as in civil actions ; that costs shall be taxed and recovered pursuant to the \u201claw, rules and practice in-such civil ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tions and that \u201csuch action shall be governed, and the judgment thereon enforced, in the same manner as upon issues joined and judgments rendered in all other such civil actions aforesaid;\u201d and in section 6 it is more explicitly provided that \u201c costs shall be allowed npon the same principles and by the same rules in the action as they are now allowed by statute in civil actions aforesaid, and shall form a part of the judgment, except in cases where the amount of recovery is less than fifty dollars, no more costs than damages shall be allowed to the party recovering such judgment.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">It is claimed that the language of the section last quoted imperatively requires the allowance of costs to the successful party. I do not so understand it. I think the plain intention was to put these actions upon the same ground as to costs, as if they had been embraced -by the Code. Costs in these actions are to be allowed \u201c upon the same principles \u201d as in other cases. Turning to the Code on the subject of costs, we find that in certain specified classes of actions, costs shall be given or withheld, according to the rules which are prescribed by section 306. In other actions costs may be allowed or not, in the discretion of the court.\u201d Actions for the foreclosure of mechanics\u2019 liens, are plainly not among the classes mentioned in section 304, and come within the designation, \u201cother cases.\u201d I tlrmk it follows that the allowance of costs, in an action under this statute, is in the discretion of the court. Any other construction of the statute would apply different \u201cprinciples and rules\u201d from those which govern other civil actions, and which would have governed this, if it had been in existence at the time of the adoption of the Code. The legislature, on the other hand, seem to have meant to place it on the same footing as if it had been originally embraced in that system. This conclusion is strengthened by reference' to section 13 of the act, which provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the contractor or sub-contractor may be sued with <em>the </em>owner, and in case of recovery against the contractor or sub-contractor, in addition to judgment against the owner, the court may award costs against such of the parties as shall be just. The reasons given by the court in this case for the refusal of costs to the plaintiff, seem to have been sufficient, and we do not feel called npon to interfere with that disposition of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Neilsoh, Ch.
