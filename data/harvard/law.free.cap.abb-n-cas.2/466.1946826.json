The act of 1831 should not be construed harshly towards the debtor. A liberal construction should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>given to it, because it is a law in restraint of the personal liberty of the citizen, and the present policy of this State does not favor imprisonment for debt, and it. is an act which may easily become, in the hands of relentless creditors, an instrument of persecution and wrong (People <em>v. </em>Recorder of Albany, 6 <em>Hill, </em>429).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-5\">Y. The court of its own motion should disregard the supplementary proceedings and judgment-roll, as the statutes prohibiting their admissibility are not a mere rule of evidence which a party can waive at his option, but they operate as an injunction upon the plaintiff, notwithstanding the failure to object to their admissibility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b500-6\">YI.

These moneys were affected by conflicting claims, and one of the objects of the action was to secure a determination of those claims, and to establish the right of the plaintiff as receiver to the moneys. It was prosecuted in the form of an action in equity. The relief demanded by the complaint was entirely consistent with the case it presented; that was that the plaintiff should be adjudged entitled to, and to be invested with the property, estate, and credits of the judgment debtor ; that his preceding assignment should be adjudged fraudulent and void as to his creditors ; that the chamberlain should account to him for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>debtor\u2019s moneys in Ms hands, and that he should have judgment against the defendants for the moneys received by them. The relief awarded was substantially that which was demanded, the assignment was set aside as fraudulent, and a recovery was had in the relator\u2019s favor, for the amount of the judgment debtor\u2019s money in the hands of the defendant Dusenbury, and upon tMs judgment proceedings for its collection were taken against him under the provisions of the act abolishing imprisonment for debt. The complaint in the receiver\u2019s action neither set forth in terms nor in any manner alluded to any contract existing between himself or the judgment debtor, and the defendant Dusenbury, either as a basis of the liability desired to be enforced and maintained, or otherwise. It was, on the contrary, an action to set aside an assignment made by the judgment debtor, and for an accounting concerning the moneys received by the respective defendants. The defendant, Dusenbury, had received such moneys, claiming to be entitled to them under the authority of the assignment. But it was held that he had no such right, and that the plaintiff as receiver should recover the money. By the provisions of the non-imprisonment- act a party can proceed against the debtor under it, when he has a demand upon which according to the preceding provisions, the debtor cannot be arrested or imprisoned (3 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>5th Ed. 126, \u00a7 6). And the cases in which, by such preceding provisions, the debtor cannot be arrested or imprisoned, are those where the suit shall be brought \u201c for the recovery of any <em>money </em>due upon any judgment or decree founded upon contract, or due upon any contract express or implied, or for the recovery of any damages for the non-performance of any contract\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00a7 1). The prohibition against arrest and imprisonment contained in this section was' not confined to what were understood to be actions at law for the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>covery of moneys clue upon or for breach of a contract, but it also included actions in courts of equity. And where they were founded upon an express or implied contract, there the debtor, according to the express language of this section, could not be imprisoned upon any execution issuing upon the decree. It was not necessary, under these provisions of the statute, that a contract should be averred as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s action, in order to exonerate the defendant from arrest and imprisonment. But it was sufficient for this purpose that this suit should be for the recovery of money, due upon contract, express or implied. And from the facts, imperfectly stated in the complaint as they were, it could readily be seen that an implied contract existed in law for the payment of the moneys received by the defendant Dusenbury to the receiver, in case he had no right to receive and hold them upon the ground claimed by him. As the facts turned out, the moneys were received by the defendant Dusenbury without right, and consequently for the use of the receiver. And the law, therefore, implied a promise against him to pay them over, as the judgment directed that it be done (Admr. of Dumond <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 3 <em>Johns. </em>183; Buell <em>v. </em>Broughton, <em>2 Den. </em>91; Cobb <em>v. </em>Dows, 6 <em>Seld. </em>335, 341). The action was not one in which the defendant could be imprisoned upon an execution, for the reason that it was an implied contract against him, and therefore he could be proceeded against under the non-imprisonment act. The action might have been prosecuted in a different form, but as it was not, that fact cannot affect the plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">No wrongful act was alleged as the foundation of the action, beyond the circumstances showing that the money had been procured without any actual right to it. And the judgment proceeded upon the same theory ; so far as it was recovered against Dusenbury. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>simply that the plaintiff recover against him personally, with costs, the snm adjudged to be in his hands. All conformed to the theory that the liability enforced was for money received by him, under the claim of authority to act under the assignment. He had no such authority, and when the assignment was set aside as fraudulent it followed that he must account for and pay over the money he had received. And the law implied a promise against him that he would do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">[The court then examined the competency of the examination, and held as stated in the last two head-notes.]</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">For that reason the order made should be reversed, and further proceedings directed before the judge having cognizance of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Davis, P.
