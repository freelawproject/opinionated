Centeno-Hernandez contends that the record compels the conclusion that he suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution or torture based on his presumed anti-Sandinista political opinions. He also contends that Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega\u2019s reelection as President of Nicaragua following his asylum hearing justifies reopening the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the BIA based its conclusions on the reasons identified in the IJ\u2019s decision, we will review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory refugee status. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutory factor. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We review factual determinations under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 1283. That test is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and does not allow \u201creweighfing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Silva v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). Instead, we must affirm if the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s factual determinations are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s [and BIA\u2019s] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Here substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that Centeno-Her-nandez has not suffered past persecution. \u201c[P]ersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Se-pulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Centeno-Her-nandez\u2019s claim is based on his detention for seven to fifteen days in his military unit after making a statement in opposition of then-General Humberto Ortega. During his detention, he was not physically tortured or beaten. He argues, however, that he was psychologically tortured with sleep depravation because he was interrogated frequently and was allowed to sleep for only a few hours at time during his detention. Although we have rejected \u201ca rigid requirement of physical injury,\u201d <em>De Santamar\u00eda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., 525 </em>F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008), we refused to reverse the BIA where a petitioner was detained for several days, subjected to psychological coercion, and forced to stand out in the sun for two hours. <em>See Zheng v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1291 (11th Cir.2006). The evidence regarding Centeno-Hernandez\u2019s detention and interrogation, is insufficient to compel the conclusion that he was persecuted. <em>See </em>id; <em>see also Djonda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that the record did not compel the conclusion that the petitioner had suffered past persecution when he was detained for thirty-six hours, suffered a \u201cminor beating,\u201d and was later threatened with future harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Additionally, the record does not compel the conclusion that Centeno-Hernandez\u2019s fear of future persecution was objectively reasonable. His fear stems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>from his one-time statement of opposition against then-General Humberto Ortega and his desertion from the army. The statement at issue was made thirteen years before the 2006 removal proceedings, and General Ortega no longer commands the Nicaraguan military. Further, Centeno-Hernandez\u2019s children continue to live in Nicagrua unharmed. Those factors undermine an objective fear of future persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.Sd at 1232 (holding that threats of future violence based on prior political activity are insufficient to compel a finding of future persecution where the evidence does not indicate that the petitioner\u2019s notoriety would outlast her four-year absence). CentenoHernandez has also failed to present any evidence that military deserters have been \u201cdisproportionately punished\u201d in Nicaragua. <em>See Mohammed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1346 (11th Cir.2008). Although Centeno-Hernandez fears detention if he returns to Nicaragua, detention is not the same thing as persecution. <em>See Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1171. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s denial of asylum to Centeno-Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Because Centeno-Hernandez has failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution to support his asylum claim, he cannot establish entitlement to relief under CAT. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">That leaves us with the motion to remand. The substance of a motion to remand will determine how we review it on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. We will treat a motion to remand as part of the petitioner\u2019s appeal and not as a motion to reopen or reconsider if it \u201csimply articulates the remedy requested by an appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cConversely, if a motion to remand seeks to introduce evidence that has not previously been presented, it is generally treated as a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here we treat Centeno-Hernandez\u2019s motion to remand as a motion to reopen because he seeks additional proceedings to present new evidence regarding his eligibility for asylum and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u201cMotions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 <em>(1992) </em>(internal quotation mai'ks and citation omitted). The movant \u201cbears a heavy burden, and must present evidence of such a nature that the BIA is satisfied that if proceedings before the IJ were reopened, with all attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Ali v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">We review \u201cthe BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary or capricious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">Centeno-Hernandez\u2019s motion was based on the recent re-election of Daniel Ortega, a Sandinista, as President of Nicaragua. Centeno-Hernandez argues that his \u201creturn to the country would be a red flag that would reignite the search\u201d for him. Centeno-Hernandez has not, however, submitted any evidence to support that argument. Additionally, although Cen-teno-Hernandez argues that he spoke out directly against President Daniel Ortega, that is incorrect. His earlier statement of opposition was against then-General Humberto Ortega, not President Daniel Ortega. We therefore conclude that the BIA did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>not abuse its discretion in denying Cen-teno-Hernandez\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-15\">. Because Centeno-Hernandez listed Tremi-nio as a derivative applicant, the basis for her asylum claim is the same as his. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3). Accordingly, we will refer only to Centeno-Hernan-dez. Centeno-Hernandez also requested derivative relief for his children, but they are not listed in the petition for review, and their claims are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-23\">. Centeno-Hernandez also originally requested withholding of removal, but he has waived that claim by failing to argue it on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
