She argues that the events that resulted in her termination from a community corrections center were not her fault and that she showed progress while on supervised release. She has not, however, shown that the district court\u2019s decision was based on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. Applying the abuse of discretion standard, we find no error. <em>See United States v. Grandlund, </em>71 F.3d 507, 509 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-22\">Cord further contends that her 10-month prison sentence was substantively unreasonable. Cord\u2019s sentence was within the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, below the statutory maximum, and imposed after her third revocation of supervised release. Under the plain error standard, Cord has failed to demonstrate any clear or obvious error affecting her substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 273 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-25\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
