Because Aguilar had a prior conviction for robbery, his offense level was adjusted upward by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). After granting the Government\u2019s request for a two-level downward departure for early disposition under \u00a7 5K3.1, p.s., the district court sentenced Aguilar to a 37-month term of imprisonment, at the bottom of the guidelines range. Aguilar appeals his sentence, arguing that it is unreasonable. In reviewing a sentence, we \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-26\">Aguilar argues that \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and should be accorded little weight in the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) analysis. Because Aguilar did not raise this argument in the district court, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009). Aguilar has not shown error, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Aguilar is essentially asking this court to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which we may not do. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. The totality of the circumstances, considered in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, supports the sentence the district court imposed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
