May\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. The district court found that May was eligible for consideration for sentence reduction pursuant to the Amendment. However, the court ultimately denied the motion based on its consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors \u2014 in particular, the danger to the public May poses if released from custody \u2014 and May\u2019s post-sentence conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-25\">On appeal, May argues that the district court erroneously applied the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion, that the court improperly penalized him for prison violations for which he had already been disciplined, and that the court overly relied on his post-sentence conduct to the exclusion of relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Moreover, we liberally construe the pleadings of a <em>pro se </em>petitioner. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 632, 172 L.Ed.2d 619 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">A district court may reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To that end, Amendment 706, which was made retroactive by Amendment 713, reduced the offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend.\u2019s 706, 713 (2008). In determining whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court must engage in a two-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">First, the court must substitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed. In undertaking this first step, only the amended guideline range is changed. All other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact ... Second, in light of the conclusion reached in the first step, the court must consider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\"><em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). In addition, the applicable Guidelines policy statement provides that the court \u201cshall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment,\u201d and that the court \u201cmay consider posUsentenc-ing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the original term of imprisonment[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(ii) and (iii)). Moreover, while the court must engage in this two-step analysis, it is not ultimately required to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence because \u201c[t]he grant of authority to the district court to reduce a term of imprisonment is unambiguously discretionary.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Here, we find no abused of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of May\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for sentence reduction. The court\u2019s decision is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
