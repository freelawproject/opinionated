On appeal, Chen argues that the BIA: (1) erred in determining that he had not suffered past persecution; (2) applied the erroneous legal framework to his claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution; (3) failed to consider evidence he had submitted; and (4) considered evidence not in the record. After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision but did so on alternative grounds that the IJ did not address, we review the decision of the BIA only. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">When evaluating a petition to review a decision by the BIA to deny an application for asylum and withholding of removal, we review findings of fact under the \u201csubstantial evidence test,\u201d and must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). Under the substantial evidence test, \u201cwe consider only whether there is substantial evidence for the findings made by the BIA, <em>not </em>whether there is substantial evidence for some <em>other </em>finding that could have been, but was not, made.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and may not overturn findings of fact unless the record compels it. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286-87. The BIA is \u201centitled to rely heavily\u201d upon the State Department country reports. <em>Djon-da v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or the Secretary of Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-15\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>son last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Naj-jar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We have held that \u201cpersecution,\u201d as used to illustrate that an alien has suffered \u201cpast persecution,\u201d is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and alterations omitted). If the alien establishes past persecution, it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened upon return to the country of removal unless the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the country\u2019s conditions have changed such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would no longer be threatened or that the alien could relocate within the country and it would be reasonable to expect him to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(1), 208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">An alien who has not shown past persecution may still be entitled to asylum if he can demonstrate a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(2), 208.16(b)(2). To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear,\u201d an applicant must show that she has a fear of persecution in her home country and that \u201c[t]here is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if he or she were to return to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i). Furthermore, an applicant must establish \u201cthat there is \u2018a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out individually for persecution,\u2019 or that he is a member of, or is identified with, a group that is subjected to a pattern or practice of persecution.\u201d <em>Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1174 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)). When a petitioner fails to \u201cestablish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">For petitioners basing their asylum claims on the application of a coercive family planning policy, the following applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZv\">a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). Interpreting this provision, we have held that \u201c[i]n addition to meeting the nexus requirement based on \u2018resistance\u2019 to the family planning law, an applicant claiming persecution based on an unmarried partner\u2019s abortion must demonstrate that he has suffered harm amounting to persecution on account of that resistance.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Gen., </em>494 F.3d 1311, 1318 (11th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2466, 171 L.Ed.2d 228 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">First, we find no merit to Chen\u2019s claim that the BIA\u2019s finding that he did not suffer past persecution was not supported by substantial evidence. Our review of the record shows that Chen did not say whether he was injured during his physical altercation with family planning officials; there is nothing in the record to determine whether the 5,000 yuan fine was overly oppressive, as the record does not indicate Chen\u2019s salary or net worth at the time; and Chen\u2019s detainment at the hospital did not appear to be for a significant duration of time. Nor do the threats compel a finding of past persecution because threats standing alone do not generally amount to persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (holding that threats do not rise to the level of past persecution compelling the reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision); <em>see also Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>154 Fed.Appx. 809, 811 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the cumulative effect of the mistreatment did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1008 (11th Cir.2008) (describing cases that compelled the finding of past persecution where the facts included severe beatings and prolonged detention); <em>Yang, </em>494 F.3d at 1319. Based on this record, we are not compelled to hold that Chen suffered past persecution. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286-87.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">Next, we are unpersuaded that the BIA erred by requiring Chen to show a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution to establish his future persecution claim. The BIA said that \u201cthe evidence does not show a pattern and practice of forced sterilizations or abortions for Chinese nationals returning from abroad, <em>nor </em>does the evidence establish a reasonable possibility that the respondent would be forced to under go such procedures if returned to China.\u201d (Emphasis added). An examination of the BIA\u2019s decision thus shows that it did not require Chen to show <em>both </em>a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d <em>and </em>that he was specifically targeted for persecution. Rather, the BIA applied the correct legal framework for determining if a wellfounded fear of future persecution existed. <em>See Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1174.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>We also are unpersuaded that the BIA failed to consider an expert affidavit Chen submitted. When the BIA \u201chas given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). In Tan, we held, that the IJ did not give reasoned consideration to the petitioner\u2019s application because: (1) \u201cthe Immigration Judge misstated the contents of the record\u201d; (2) the IJ failed to explain why an attack on the petitioner was not based on the petitioner\u2019s race; and (3) the IJ\u2019s \u201creasoning was unresponsive to any argument reflected in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375-76. Here, however, the BIA said that it considered the \u201cexpert affidavit\u201d submitted by Chen. So even though the BIA did not give a detailed discussion of the affidavit, it did not fail to consider the affidavit or give reasoned consideration to the affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Finally, we reject Chen\u2019s claim that the BIA violated his right to due process by impermissibly incorporating the 2007 U.S. State Department\u2019s Country Report into the record without notice by citing to its prior decisions. Although the BIA did cite to its previous decisions, it also considered the evidence in the record, did not cite to the 2007 U.S. State Department\u2019s Country Report, and did not rely on its own decisions as evidence. In addition, it is clear that the BIA cited to its prior decisions in order to demonstrate that it had previously considered similar documentary evidence and reached the same conclusion that it reached in Chen\u2019s application. The BIA therefore did not err by incorporating the 2007 U.S. State Department\u2019s Country Report into its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Accordingly, we deny Chen\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">. Notably, the legislative history surrounding the enactment of the statutory provision establishing asylum claims based on the application of a coercive family planning policy provides that this kind of persecution is to be analyzed like any other type of persecution. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 104-469(1), at 174 (1996) (\u201cDetermining the credibility of the applicant and whether the actual or threatened harm rises to the level of persecution is a difficult and complex task, but no more so in the case of claims based on coercive family planning than in cases based on other factual situations. Asylum officers and immigration judges are capable of making such judgments.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">. Nor are we convinced that the BIA failed to consider whether Chen established \"other resistance\u201d to China's coercive population control policy. For starters, because Chen failed to show that he was persecuted on account of his other resistance, the establishment of other resistance is not a basis for a grant of asylum. <em>Yang, </em>494 F.3d at 1318. Moreover, the BIA explained in its decision that it was determining whether Chen \u201csuffered past persecution due to his resistance to the Chinese family planning laws.\u201d It is thus clear that the BIA considered whether he suffered past persecution on account of his other resistance to China\u2019s coercive population control policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-14\">.Moreover, Chen waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2 (\"When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">. Since Chen failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he also failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
