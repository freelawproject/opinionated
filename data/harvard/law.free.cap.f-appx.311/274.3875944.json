Finding reversible error, we VACATE and REMAND for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b300-26\">In March 2002, Williams was sentenced to 130 months of imprisonment for conspiring to distribute less than 50 grams of cocaine base. Rl-149 at 1-2; Doc. 130. Because Williams sold 44.11 grams of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>crack cocaine, his base offense level was 30. Rl-149 at 7-9. He received a two-level reduction at sentencing, however, resulting in a total offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of V. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The district court sentenced Williams to the minimum sentence of his guideline range \u2014 130 months. He did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In March 2008, Williams filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on amendments to the sentencing guidelines which reduced offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Williams did not indicate what his new guideline range would be but requested a reduction to 96 months of imprisonment based on his acceptance of responsibility, his close ties with his siblings and children, his education and rehabilitation, and his ability to find employment. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9. The government did not respond to the motion. The district court\u2019s only stated reason for denying Williams\u2019 motion was that it had \u201ccarefully reviewed said Motion and the entire court file and [was] otherwise fully advised in the premises.\u201d Rl-150.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On appeal, Williams argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him a two-level reduction under Amendment 706 and in failing to provide adequate reasons for its denial. In his reply brief, Williams also asserts for the first time that applying the revised version of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a sentence based on a guideline imprisonment range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See id. </em>Amendment 706 retroactively reduces certain base offense levels and guideline ranges for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984-85 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). As a result of Amendment 706, base offense level 28 (rather than level 30) now applies to offenses involving between 35 and up to 50 grams of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c)(6) (Nov.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Any reduction pursuant to Amendment 706 must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Policy statement \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) prohibits reductions below the minimum of the amended guideline range except where the original term of imprisonment was less than the original guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B). Moreover, the reduced term of imprisonment may not be less than that which the defendant has already served. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">The district court must follow a two-step procedure in evaluating a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the district court must determine the new base offense level under the guideline amendment, leaving intact all other original guideline application decisions. <em>See id. </em>Second, the court must decide whether it will exercise its discretion to impose the newly calculated sentence or retain the original sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 781. This determination requires consideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the danger a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>reduction would pose to any person or the community. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)-(ii)). Additionally, a court may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct in assessing the appropriateness and amount of a reduction. <em>See id. </em>at comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). Although a district court is not required to make specific findings regarding each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the record must demonstrate that the court considered these factors. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The district court abused its discretion here because the record fails to establish that it engaged in the two-step analysis outlined above.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As for the first step, there is no indication that the court calculated or considered Williams\u2019 new guideline range under Amendment 706. Williams\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not include his amended guideline range and the government did not file a response. The parties now agree that Amendment 706 lowers Williams\u2019 base offense level from 30 to 28 and that his total offense level is 26 after factoring in the two-level reduction applied at the original sentencing hearing. Based on his criminal history category of V, his amended sentencing range is 110 to 137 months of imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A. This places Williams\u2019 original sentence of 130 months of imprisonment at the higher end of the amended guideline range, whereas the district court initially sentenced him to the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As for the second step, we infer from the record that the district court considered the appropriate \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of Williams\u2019 repeated reference to these factors in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Given that Williams\u2019 motion did not specifically identify every \u00a7 3553(a) element, however, we encourage the district court on remand to enunciate sufficient reasons in its order demonstrating that the pertinent factors have been considered. <em>See Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322. In any event, the district court should not consider whether to reduce Williams\u2019 sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors until <em>after </em>it substitutes the amended guideline range. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">A final matter remains regarding Williams\u2019 argument that applying the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. It is well established that any issue not raised in the initial brief is waived on appeal. <em>See United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). As Williams raised this issue for the first time in his reply brief, it has been waived. <em>See id. </em>Even if he had properly raised this issue, the district court would have lacked jurisdiction to consider it because a court may not address extraneous resentencing issues such as constitutional claims in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Bravo, 203 F.3d </em>at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Williams is eligible for a two-level reduction in his base offense level pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Amendment 706, which would reduce his total offense level from 28 to 26. Because the record does not reflect that the district court substituted the amended guideline range before determining whether to retain Williams\u2019 original sentence, we conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for sentence reduction. Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. The factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) include in part: (1) the nature and circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment; (4) the need for adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (5) the protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-11\">. The government concedes that \"there is nothing in the record that would even support an inference that the district court engaged in the two-step <em>Bravo </em>analysis in ruling <em>on </em>Williams's \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\" Brief for the United States at 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
