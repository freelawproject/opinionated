Lee\u2019s appellate brief fails to assign error to or address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal and is devoid of legal argument and citation to authority. The clerk of this court afforded Lee an additional 10 days in which to file a brief in compliance with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure or risk waiver of his appellate issues. Lee made no further filings. Lee has therefore waived review of the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Lee has not shown an abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in denying him leave to amend his complaint, <em>see Aguilar v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>160 F.3d 1052, 1053 (5th Cir.1998), and his fraud claim does not raise a constitutional issue and is therefore not cognizable in a <em>Bivens </em>complaint, <em>see Cornish v. Corr. Servs. Corp., </em>402 F.3d 545, 549 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-21\">Lee\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore dismissed. 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal and the dismissal of Lee\u2019s appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Lee is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b726-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
