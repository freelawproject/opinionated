Ezekor received concurrent sentences of 94 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. His cases have been consolidated for purposes of appeal. Ezekor argues that his convictions must be reversed because the district court erred in summarily denying his motion to dismiss the indictments based on a speedy trial violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\u201cWhen a defendant enters a voluntary and unconditional guilty plea, the plea has the effect of waiving all nonjurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 336, 169 L.Ed.2d 236 (2007). The waiver applies to alleged speedy trial violations. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir.1992). Thus, the Government\u2019s contention has merit, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Ezekor has filed a motion requesting leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. He contends that his appellate counsel failed to raise important issues that were in dispute before the district court. Because Ezekor has no right to hybrid representation, his motion is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Ogbonna, </em>184 F.3d 447, 449 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
