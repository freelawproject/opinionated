We will uphold the BIA\u2019s determination that Ouyang is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal if that determination is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The substantial evidence stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>dard requires that the decision be based on the evidence presented and that the decision be substantially reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The Respondent contends that Ouyang has waived her claims concerning asylum based on past persecution and relief under the CAT by failing to argue them in the body of her brief. This contention is accurate. We thus decline to consider Ouy-ang\u2019s claims related to asylum based on past persecution and CAT relief and consider only those claims related to INA relief that she has argued in her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Ouyang argues that she fears future persecution, and thus is entitled to asylum and withholding of removal, because the birth of her second child places her in violation of China\u2019s population control policy. She also contends that she is entitled to withholding of removal because she has shown that she was forced to undergo an abortion in 1994 and thus has established past persecution. Ouyang has not shown that the evidence she adduced \u201c \u2018was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ouyang also has not shown that the evidence compels a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s rejection of her claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Ouyang\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
