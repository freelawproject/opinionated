Specifically, he contends that the government could not re-try him after the district court granted Mata a mistrial at his first trial because the prosecutor intentionally \u201cgoaded\u201d Mata into moving for the mistrial. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-23\">A federal grand jury returned a second superceding indictment against Mata, charging him with: conspiracy to file false currency transaction reports, defraud and obstruct the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), and obstract a federal grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1512(c) and 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(a)(2) (Count One); six counts of filing false currency transaction reports, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313(a), 5324(a)(2), 5322(b), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Counts Two through Seven); two counts of filing false federal payroll tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1) (Counts Eight and Nine); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>obstructing a federal grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(2) (Count Ten).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The indictment alleged that, as the President and owner of Kodiak Construction &amp; Management, Inc. (\u201cKodiak\u201d), Mata issued large checks that purported to be for the payment of subcontractors\u2019 invoices. However, the indictment alleged that Mata hired individuals to pose as subcontractors, cash the checks, and return the proceeds to Mata, who would then use the proceeds to pay Kodiak employees. Thus, the indictment alleged that the subcontractor invoices were \u201cfraudulent\u201d and were used only to \u201cdisguise the payment of cash wages to the employees of Kodiak.\u201d This scheme allowed Mata to avoid withholding federal payroll taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On the second day of Mata\u2019s first trial, the government called James Donovan, who testified as follows. Mata hired Donovan, a certified public accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d), to prepare financial statements and tax returns for Kodiak so that Mata could expand the business. While Donovan was engaged in this process, he received a grand jury subpoena from the IRS related to James Monahan, one of Kodiak\u2019s alleged subcontractors. Upon investigation, and after noticing that Mona-han consistently received large checks from Kodiak every week, Donovan asked Mata for documentation confirming that Monahan was in fact a subcontractor. Mata did not provide Donovan with any such documentation, but rather informed Donovan that Monahan was a \u201ccheck cash-er\u201d who returned the proceeds to Mata so that he could pay his employees. Donovan then contacted a tax attorney, and Mata thereafter discharged Donovan as his CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">On cross-examination by Mr. White, Mata\u2019s defense attorney, Donovan reiterated that Mata told him that Monahan was a check casher and that Mata did not provide Donovan with any substantial documentation confirming that Monahan was a subcontractor. Specifically, Donovan testified that \u201cthere was no contract, I can assure you of that. I don\u2019t recall, there may have been an invoice or two, but there was not any substantial amount of data that I could say, okay, IRS here is your stuff.\u201d Despite the lack of documentation on Monahan, Donovan nonetheless prepared a package of documents to send to the IRS in order to attempt to comply with the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Donovan testified that, a few weeks before the trial began, and in response to a subpoena he received from White, Donovan allowed White to come to his office and inspect his records. White then introduced documents related to Monahan that White allegedly found in Donovan\u2019s files. Donovan responded that he had never seen the documents before: \u201cI have never seen this many documents [related] to Monahan. Never. No, sir, we never sent this many invoices, to the best of my recollection, to the IRS. This information was not in the file.\u201d Donovan identified a copy of the cover letter that he wrote to the IRS, and he pointed out that, while his letter mentioned copies of checks and a certificate of liability insurance, \u201cit [did] not mention invoices.\u201d In this respect, Donovan testified that, if the invoices had been in his file, he would have mentioned them in his cover letter and sent them to the IRS, as \u201cone of the goals in trying to comply with an IRS subpoena is to provide as much information as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">At that point in Donovan\u2019s testimony, White requested a sidebar. White told the court that, \u201cas an officer of the court,\u201d he had copied the Monahan invoices from Donovan\u2019s original file. White therefore requested that Donovan return the following day with his original file, and the court subsequently instructed Donovan to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The next day at trial, White called Donovan as a defense witness, and Donovan acknowledged that the Monahan invoices that White had shown him the day before were contained in Donovan\u2019s file. However, Donovan repeated that he had never seen them before, had no idea how they got in his file, and would have sent them to the IRS if he had known that they were in the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">On cross-examination by the government, Donovan testified that he knew, upon receiving the subpoena, that the IRS\u2019s \u201centire investigation was these invoices, if they existed.\u201d Donovan reiterated that he had never seen the Monahan invoices before and that, because that type of information went to the heart of the investigation, he would have remembered those documents and provided them to the IRS if he had seen them. Donovan then agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the invoices could have appeared in his file \u201cimmediately before the trial.\u201d After the prosecutor engaged in a line of questioning suggesting that Mata had created the invoices on his typewriter, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">GOVERNMENT: Prior to this trial, did anybody from Kodiak\u2019s office including Mr. White have unfettered access to these original records?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">DONOVAN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">GOVERNMENT: When did that happen and where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">DONOVAN: Mr. White issued a subpoena and c[a]me into my office, and I sat down with him and brought him to a rear office of mine, a private office and gave him a box, this whole box, and he wanted access to a copy machine. I gave him access to a copy machine and he made copies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">GOVERNMENT: You didn\u2019t sit there ' and watch him, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">DONOVAN: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">GOVERNMENT: Nobody with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">DONOVAN: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">GOVERNMENT: He didn\u2019t bring an investigator or witness with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\">DONOVAN: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-15\">GOVERNMENT: Neither you nor anybody else from your office sat there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-16\">DONOVAN: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-17\">GOVERNMENT: Your original records were sitting with him in that box?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-18\">DONOVAN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-19\">GOVERNMENT: During that time period, you didn\u2019t have any expectation or acknowledge that what purported to be original invoices were in your file?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-20\">DONOVAN: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-21\">GOVERNMENT: For all you know, sir, and your recollection, under oath, those records could have been placed in your file while you weren\u2019t watching.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">At that point, White objected and the court held a sidebar conference. White pointed out that he was being accused of a crime. The court stated that the government\u2019s \u201cquestion raises the inference that counsel for the defense planted evidence,\u201d to which the government responded: \u201cI am directly making that inference and let me tell you why. I have asked James Monahan yesterday about these invoices. He says they are complete forgeries, and that he never submitted either photocopies or original invoices of this type in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-23\">The court expressed its concern that the government\u2019s suggestion that White was \u201cin cahoots\u201d with Mata would undermine Mata\u2019s right to be represented by an attorney who had not been \u201cimpu[g]ned in front of the jury.\u201d The government apologized for raising the issue in front of the jury, but the court found that, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>government could bring in evidence establishing that the invoices were forgeries, it had \u201cgone too far\u201d in suggesting that defense counsel was a party to that. The court granted a recess to allow the attorneys to reflect on how to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">When the court reconvened, White moved for a mistrial. He explained he could not proceed because the government had created a conflict of interest and made White a fact witness in the case. The government responded that, although it was sensitive to Mata\u2019s right to counsel, the decision whether to grant a mistrial was in the discretion of the court, and it suggested that if the court gave a \u201ccurative instruction and admonition to the jury to disregard the question, that would be addressing the improper and prejudicial evidence.\u201d The prosecutor acknowledged he asked one too many questions, but stated that \u201csometimes lawyers get heated in the battle, say things they shouldn\u2019t....\u201d Thus, the government \u201cbelieve[d] [that] this jury can be instructed and can be saved. I would oppose the motion at this time. I would not oppose a motion to strike and instruction for them to disregard that remark.\u201d After the court summarized the events leading up to the motion for a mistrial, it asked whether the government would agree to the curative instruction, to which the government responded: \u201cWe can live with that.\u201d White, however, reiterated that he did not believe a curative instructive would be sufficient under the circumstances. The court ultimately deferred to White\u2019s assessment and granted the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In coming to this decision, the court stated: \u201cThese things happen. Sometimes in the heat of trial people get carried away with something.\u201d The court repeated this point twice more in explaining to the jury why a mistrial had been granted. After the jury was excused, the court repeated this point again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">Let me say this on the record and I mean it sincerely. I think we have two very fine lawyers in this case. This issue, clearly, developed without warning to either lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">I want to be clear, I don\u2019t think any lawyer set out to do anything impermissible. These are the things that suddenly happen and you look back and say, wait a minute, there is another dimension to this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Before the second trial commenced, Mata, through a new defense attorney, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds. Mata argued that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred him from being re-tried after the mistrial because the prosecutor intentionally \u201cgoaded\u201d him into moving for a mistrial by suggesting that White planted the invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The court held a hearing on the motion and, after reviewing the trial up to that point, the court stated that the applicable standard was not whether there was an intentional error on the part of the prosecutor, but rather whether any such error was intended to \u201cprovoke a mistrial.\u201d The court explained that \u201cthe classic situation that one thinks of is where the Government is forced to go to trial and they don\u2019t have a witness they would like to have, or the trial turns out to be going badly, not the way they expected.... \u201d In this case, however, the court found that, while the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning clearly impaired Mata\u2019s right to counsel, \u201cthere ha[d] been no showing that this is the type of error that was intentionally undertaken for the purpose of goading Mr. Mata into asking for a mistrial.... \u201d In this respect, the court again reiterated that \u201c[t]his was truly a moment when there was a flash point in the trial,\u201d and that nobody \u201cwant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ed a mistrial other than Mr. White and Mr. Mata.... \u201d Accordingly, the court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">A jury subsequently found Mata guilty on all of the counts in the indictment after nine days of trial, and the court sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial after the grant of a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial unless the prosecution intentionally goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see United States v. Fern, </em>155 F.3d 1318, 1324 n. 7 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that the definition of \u201cgoad\u201d was \u201cto drive, incite, or rouse\u201d) (quotation omitted). \u201cMere \u2018overreaching\u2019 or \u2018bad faith\u2019 does not implicate double jeopardy unless the prosecutor actually intended to provoke the defendant\u2019s motion [for a mistrial].\u201d <em>United States v. Shelley, </em>405 F.3d 1195, 1200 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe inquiry into the prosecution\u2019s intent is, for the most part, a matter to be inferred from the objective facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Fern, </em>155 F.3d at 1324 (citing <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 679-80, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2092, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982) (Powell, J., concurring)). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s factual finding for clear error and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d at 1162. \u201cThe court\u2019s determination of the prosecutor\u2019s intent is a finding of fact\u201d that we review for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In this case, the district court repeatedly found that the prosecutor\u2019s impermissible line of questioning was not intended to provoke a mistrial. The court\u2019s finding in this regard is strongly supported by the fact that the prosecutor persistently opposed Mata\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1037 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting the defendants\u2019 double jeopardy argument because, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe prosecutor vigorously argued against\u201d the defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial); <em>Shelley, </em>405 F.3d at 1201 (concluding that there was nothing in the record to indicate prosecutorial \u201cgoading\u201d where, the prosecutor, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ccontested the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial\u201d). Specifically, the government repeatedly argued that instructing the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning would cure the inference that White had planted the Monahan invoices, and that the court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial would not constitute an abuse of discretion subject to reversal on appeal. Indeed, it was White who refused to accept a curative instruction and insisted on a mistrial. In this respect, the court subsequently found that nobody \u201cwanted a mistrial other than Mr. White and Mr. Mata....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Mata argues that the court\u2019s findings on this point were clearly erroneous. Mata correctly points out that White\u2019s presentation of the Monahan invoices impeached Donovan\u2019s earlier testimony that he did not see any substantial documentation establishing that Monahan was a subcontractor. In response, the prosecutor engaged in a line of questioning that was intended to suggest that the invoices were subsequently planted in Donovan\u2019s file. Thus, the reason why the prosecutor engaged in this improper line of questioning was to rehabilitate Donovan\u2019s credibility, not provoke a mistrial. <em>See Shelley, </em>405 F.3d at 1201 (concluding that the prosecutor did not intend to provoke a mistrial where an improper line of questioning resulting in a mistrial was designed to undermine a witness\u2019s credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In this respect, and contrary to Mata\u2019s assertion, White\u2019s successful impeachment of Donovan on the issue of whether there were invoices contained in his file did not significantly damage the government\u2019s case. This is so because the government\u2019s case did not depend on the complete absence of such invoices, but rather on the allegation that such documents were forged. Thus, even if the Monahan invoices were contained in Donovan\u2019s file, this would not have prompted the government to provoke a mistrial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>719 F.2d 1516, 1519 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cThere was no indication that the trial was going poorly for the government; the prosecutor therefore had no reason to prompt a mistrial.\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds, Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 619, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 1804, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994). This is especially true in light of the fact that the mistrial occurred after only two days of trial, before the government put on the bulk of its evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Posner, </em>780 F.2d 1536, 1540-41 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cIf the government attorneys had truly intended to subvert Posner\u2019s double jeopardy rights by engineering a \u2018dry run\u2019 as he claims, surely they would have waited longer before pressing the issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Thus, because the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that White planted the invoices was motivated by a desire to rehabilitate Donovan\u2019s credibility, rather than by an intent to provoke a mistrial, Mata\u2019s remaining arguments \u2014 that the prosecutor\u2019s line of questioning was pre-planned and that it was so obviously improper that it must have been intended to induce a mistrial\u2014 are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">In sum, Mata has not shown that the district court clearly erred by finding that the prosecutor did not intend to provoke a mistrial. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\">. In response, Mata points out that the government did not call Donovan as a witness at the second trial. However, the government\u2019s failure to call Donovan at the second trial confirms that he was not a critical witness for the government and that his impeachment at the first trial would not have prompted the government to provoke a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-21\">. This point is amplified by the fact that the second trial took nine days and involved substantial witness testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
