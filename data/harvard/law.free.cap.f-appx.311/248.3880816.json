(\u201cCanada Life\u201d), asserting claims under state law \u2014 claims for loss of earnings and mental anguish \u2014 and claims for relief under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted Canada Life summary judgment, and Veg-ter appeals. She presents several arguments for reversal: the district court erred (1)in holding that she did not have a Seventh Amendment right to have a jury decide her ERISA claims; (2) in concluding that <em>res judicata </em>barred her state law claims; (3) in denying her claims for long-term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d), short-term disability (\u201cSTD\u201d), and concurrent disability benefits; and (4) in concluding that her STD claim was barred by the employee welfare benefit plan\u2019s (\u201cthe Plan\u201d) economic loss provision. We consider and dispose of Vegter\u2019s arguments in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-19\">(1) Vegter did not have a Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial on her ERISA claims because the statute provides for equitable, not legal, remedies. <em>Stewart v. KHD Deutz of Am. Corp., </em>75 F.3d 1522, 1527 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-20\">(2) <em>Res judicata </em>bars a party from relitigating a claim that was, or could have been, presented in a previous suit between the parties that resulted in a final judgment on the merits. <em>In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1296 (11th Cir.2001). The district court correctly held that Vegter\u2019s state law claims were barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The same claims were asserted by her, and dismissed by the court on the merits, in an earlier law suit she brought against Canada Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">Vegter challenges the court\u2019s summary judgment disposition of her claims for LTD, STD, and concurrent disability benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She admits in her brief that she was not entitled to concurrent disability benefits; hence, we only address the claims for LTD and STD benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>A plan administrator has fiduciary duties under ERISA. <em>Piazza v. Ebsco Industries, Inc., </em>273 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2001). As a fiduciary, the administrator is required to discharge its duties under a plan</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u2018solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries ... for the exclusive purpose of ... providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries ... with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Hamilton v. Allen-Bradley Co., Inc., </em>244 F.3d 819, 825 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)). On the form Vegter filed with Canada Life, she presented only a STD claim, not a LTD claim. The court therefore did not err in granting the company summary judgment on the latter claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The district court rejected Vegter\u2019s claim for STD benefits because \u201cVegter did not present <em>any </em>evidence that she was disabled from her position prior to her termination for poor performance.\u201d Order, Vol. 5, at Tab 85, at 24. Moreover, it was clear from \u201cthe evidence in the record ... that Vegter\u2019s loss of income was not attributable to her alleged disability; it was due to her termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Vegter has presented no basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s summary judgment in this case. It is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-16\">. The disability in this case appears to have been \u201canxiety state unspecified\u201d or depression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-22\">. In reviewing the court\u2019s decision, we consider the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to Vegter, the non-movant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">. The court added that Vegter's post-hoc allegations of hyperthyroidism are largely irrelevant and appear to have been introduced solely to bolster a claim that appeared more and more likely to fail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
