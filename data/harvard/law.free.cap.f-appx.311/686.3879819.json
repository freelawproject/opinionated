Alaniz argues that the district court erred in denying him a three-level reduction in his guidelines offense level for acceptance of responsibility at sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\">At the sentencing hearing, Alaniz at first raised the issue of the denial of the reduction to his offense level but then withdrew the objection. The district court specifically confirmed with Alaniz\u2019s counsel and with Alaniz that Alaniz was withdrawing the objection. Counsel stated that he had \u201c[n]o objection\u201d to the lack of the three-level reduction. Likewise, Alaniz answered, \u201cYes, Your Honor,\u201d when the district court asked him if he wanted to withdraw his objection \u201cto losing acceptance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-22\">Alaniz\u2019s unambiguous and intentional withdrawal of his objection constitutes a waiver of the objection. <em>See United States v. Dodson, </em>288 F.3d 153, 160 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 931 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cWaived errors are entirely unreviewable.... \u201d <em>Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d at 931. Because the only issue Alaniz raises on appeal is unreviewable, his conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
