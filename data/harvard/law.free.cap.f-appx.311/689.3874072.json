Lorenzo appealed his sentence, contending that the district court clearly erred in imposing a three-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because the evidence did not establish he was a manager or supervisor in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">A defendant\u2019s base offense level may be increased three levels pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the ... managed] or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). This court reviews the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant was a manager or supervisor under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for clear error. <em>United States v. Fullwood, </em>342 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir.2003). Where a factual finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">The district court did not clearly err when it increased Lorenzo\u2019s base offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because the record evidence reflects that Lorenzo managed or supervised Roseangela Martinez. Lorenzo directed her transportation of his portion of the cocaine, he paid for her flight to Texas, he agreed to pay her for successful transportation of the cocaine, and he delivered the cocaine to her for transport. Therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that Lorenzo occupied an aggravating role is plausible in light of the record as a whole and is not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
