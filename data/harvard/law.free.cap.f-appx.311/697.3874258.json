He was sentenced to 27 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-22\">Gareia-Martinez appeals his conviction for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36, arguing that the judgment should be corrected to reflect that he was convicted of \u201cbeing found in\u201d the United States and not of \u201cillegal reentry,\u201d the offense that is listed on the judgment. Gareia-Martinez argues that \u201cbeing found in\u201d the United States and \u201cillegal reentry\u201d are distinct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-23\">Rule 36 authorizes this court to correct only clerical errors, which exist when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1026 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d description, \u201c[ijllegal reentry after deportation,\u201d so closely tracks the \u00a7 1326 title, \u201c[rjeentry of removed aliens,\u201d that it bears no indicia of the district court having made a mistake or oversight. Rather, it appears that the district court intended the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d to refer generally to the title of \u00a7 1326. Therefore, there is no clerical error, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See United States v. Buendiar-Rangel, </em>553 F.3d 378, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
