At sentencing, the district court found Mack accountable for four and one third kilograms of crack cocaine. Because he was responsible for over 1.5 kilograms of the drug, his base offense level was set at 38. That level was increased by eight levels to level 46 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1, 3Bl.l(a), and 3C1.1. Level 46 coupled with Mack\u2019s criminal history category of II yielded a Guidelines sentence range of life imprisonment. The Government moved the court for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The court granted its motion and sentenced Mack to a prison term of 264 months. The Government subsequently filed a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 motion for a further reduction, and the court reduced Mack\u2019s prison term to 223 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">On May 7, 2008, Mack, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>moved the district court to reduce his prison term to 168 months pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He contended that his sentence should be reduced in light of Guidelines Amendment 706, which is retroactive, the disparity between sentences for cocaine powder and crack, and the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court denied his motion. Although Amendment 706 reduced Mack\u2019s previous offense level from 46 to 44, the Guidelines sentence range remained at life imprisonment. Put another way, the two level reduction provided by Amendment 706 did not affect Mack\u2019s sentence range. Mack now appeals the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentence, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Amendment 706 reduced the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) offense levels in crack cocaine cases. Prior to the amendment, base offense level 38 applied to drug offenses involving 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See e.g., </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l)(2006). As a result of Amendment 706, base offense level 36 now applies to an offense involving at least 1.5 but fewer than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), (2). Thus, although Amendment 706 reduced the offense levels in certain crack cocaine cases by two levels, the base offense level for sentences based on 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine remained unchanged. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Contrary to Mack\u2019s position, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence does not provide the basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(3). Accordingly, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). A district court should leave intact its previous factual decisions from the sentencing hearing when deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1997) (upholding district court\u2019s refusal in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to re-examine drug quantity).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Amendment 706 did not effectively reduce Mack\u2019s Guidelines sentence range. Therefore, district court did not err in concluding that Mack was not entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court\u2019s ruling is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
