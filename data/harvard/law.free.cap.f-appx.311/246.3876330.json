Williams argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We review the reasonableness of a criminal sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3558(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The weight allocated an individual factor in section 3553 \u201cis a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence within the guideline range. Although Williams complains that the court failed to consider that he had assisted law enforcement and he had a history of substance abuse and various mental infirmities, the court stated that it had considered those facts. The court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that a sentence of 240 months of imprisonment served the statutory purposes of deterrence and adequate punishment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Williams\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Williams\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
