The court assumed (1) that Simpson had ADHD and SLD, and that, under the Act, ADHD and SLD are mental impairments, and (2) that learning and working are major life activities. The court concluded, however, that Simpson failed to present evidence establishing that these impairments substantially limited his ability to learn, that they substantially limited one or more major life activities, and that the defendants relied on a record of such impairments. Nor did the defendants perceive him as disabled in any life activity. In sum, the court concluded that Simpson failed to show that he was \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Simpson now appeals the court\u2019s judgment. As a threshold issue, we must address the defendants\u2019 argument that Simpson has abandoned his claim that he is disabled with respect to the major life activity of <em>working, </em>because his brief addresses only the district court\u2019s findings with respect to the major life activity of <em>learning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u201c[A] party seeking to raise a claim or issue on appeal must plainly and prominently so indicate. Otherwise, the issue\u2014 even if properly preserved at trial \u2014 will be considered abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003). Passing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim on appeal \u2014 if the appellant \u201cfails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989). Simpson\u2019s brief presents no argument challenging the district court\u2019s determination with respect to the major life activity of working. Simpson\u2019s claim that his disability limits such activity is accordingly abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Simpson argues that the district court erred in concluding that, as a matter of law, the evidence he presented was insufficient to establish that his mental conditions significantly limited his ability to learn. To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, the plaintiff must show that he was: (1) disabled or perceived to be disabled; (2) a qualified individual; and (3) discriminated against on the basis of his disability. <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005). The standards for liability under the Act serve as precedent for cases under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102, and vice versa. <em>See Cash v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1301, 1305 n. 2 (11th Cir.2000). Under the federal regulations, an individual is \u201cdisabled\u201d if he (1) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>major life activities, (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded by his employer as having such an impairment. <em>Cash, </em>231 F.3d at 1305; <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In concluding that Simpson failed to establish for summary judgment purposes that his mental conditions had a significant limiting effect on his ability to learn, the district court cited Simpson\u2019s past academic success. Simpson contends that the court erred, that he adduced evidence showing that this success was dependent upon the accommodations, such as extended time, that he received from organizations such as Vocational Rehabilitation. He points out, moreover, that the court had before it evidence, such as his scores on tests conducted by the Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, showing how his \u201cprocessing speed\u201d limits him, as compared to others in the general population. Finally, he notes that doctors, counselors, and other evaluators all considered these test results and diagnosed him with a disability which substantially limits his ability to learn.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The Act defines \u201cdisability\u201d as \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(9)(B). This definition of \u201cdisability\u201d involves a three-step analysis. <em>Rossbach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1357 (11th Cir.2004). First, has the plaintiff established that his condition constitutes a physical or mental impairment? <em>See id. </em>Second, has he established that the life activity he claims has been limited is a \u201cmajor life activity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>According to the regulations, \u201c[m]ajor life activities means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, <em>learning, </em>and working.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i) (emphasis added). Finally, has the plaintiff established that the impairment \u201csubstantially limits\u201d the major life activity he has identified? <em>See Rossbach, </em>371 F.3d at 1357. The term \u201csubstantially limits\u201d means \u201c[u]nable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform\u201d or \u201c[s]ig-nificantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i)(l)(i), (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In determining whether an individual is substantially limited, the court considers: \u201c(1) the nature and severity of the impairment; (2) the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and (3) the permanent or long term impact, or the expected permanent or long term impact of or resulting from the impairment.\u201d <em>Sutton, </em>185 F.3d at 1208-09 (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(2)). The court considers, in addition, any alleged disability \u201cwith reference to corrective [or mitigating] measures.\u201d <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 488, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 2149, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). The terms \u201cmajor life activities\u201d and \u201csubstantially limits\u201d are to be strictly interpreted \u201cso as \u2018to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled ....\u2019\u201d <em>Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. At Birmingham Bd. Of Trustees, </em>507 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 197, 122 S.Ct. 681, 691, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">That a person is disabled means \u201cthat [the] person be presently \u2014 not potentially or hypothetically \u2014 substantially limited.\u201d <em>Sutton, </em>527 U.S. at 482, 119 S.Ct. at 2146. \u201cIt is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status under this test to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.\u201d <em>Toyota </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Motor Mfg., </em>534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. at 691. Rather, the plaintiff must offer evidence \u201cthat the extent of the limitation [caused by the impairment] in terms of their own experience ... is substantial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Although the test results contained in Simpson\u2019s Vocational Evaluation Report may indicate that Simpson\u2019s learning ability is somewhat limited in some specific areas, they do not indicate that his overall ability to learn is substantially limited. Simpson presented no evidence of the effect his conditions <em>currently </em>have on his every day activities and, more specifically, his ability to learn. In sum, Simpson has failed to establish that he suffers from a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Simpson challenges the court\u2019s determination that he failed, as a matter of law, to prove a record of an impairment. He asserts that he had a documented record of his impairment, to-wit: a diagnosed learning disability, which, by definition, substantially limits his ability to learn.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The relevant regulation defines \u201crecord of ... impairment\u201d as meaning that a person \u201chas a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(k) (1997). <em>Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., </em>181 F.3d 1220, 1229 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cThe intent of this provision, in part, is to ensure that people are not discriminated against because of a history of disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis part of the definition is satisfied if a record relied on by an employer indicates that the individual has or has had a substantially limiting impairment.... There are many types of records that could potentially contain this information, including but not limited to, education, medical, or employment records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The district court was correct in concluding that Simpson failed to show that his impairment substantially limited his ability to learn. The court had before it no evidence that the defendants relied on a record of any such impairment. In short, Simpson has no case of discrimination based on a record of impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Simpson\u2019s final challenge to the district court\u2019s summary judgment is that the court erred in holding that he failed to introduce evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that one or more of the defendants regarded him as disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">A person may be \u201cdisabled\u201d under the Act if he is \u201cregarded by\u201d his employer as disabled, meaning that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ9\">(1) has an impairment that does not substantially limit a major life activity, but is treated by an employer as though it does; (2) has an impairment that limits a major life activity only because of others\u2019 attitudes towards the impairment; or (3) has no impairment whatsoever, but is treated by an employer as having a disability as recognized by the [Rehabilitation Act].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\"><em>Hilburn, </em>181 F.3d at 1230. \u201c[F]or a plaintiff to prevail under this theory, he must show two things: (1) that the perceived disability involves a major life activity; and (2) that the perceived disability is substantially limiting and significant.\u201d <em>Rossbach, </em>371 F.3d at 1360 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cAs with actual disabilities, a perceived impairment must be believed to substantially limit a major life activity of the individual.\u201d <em>Hilburn, </em>181 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">The fact that Wayne Sellers, Director of the Marshall County DHR, may have been aware of Simpson\u2019s conditions while he was employed by the DHR was clearly insufficient to establish that Sellers perceived him to have a disability. Furthermore, Sellers\u2019s comment regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>vocational rehabilitation clients in no way indicates that Sellers terminated Simpson\u2019s employment <em>because </em>he regarded Simpson as having a disability, or even that he believed that Simpson was substantially limited in his ability to learn. We therefore reject Simpson\u2019s final challenge. The judgment of the district court is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. At the same time, Simpson alleged that he was able to perform the essential functions of a social worker employed by the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
