Specifically, Casaran-Rivas first argues that the indictment (a) was insufficient for failing to allege that he had the specific intent to re-enter the United States for illegal purposes and (b) violated the United States\u2019s obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (\u201cRefugee Convention\u201d) and United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT Treaty\u201d), namely not to penalize him for illegal entry or presence in the United States because he arrived from a territory where his life or freedom was threatened and not to return him to a country where he might be tortured. Ca-saran-Rivas also argues that his counsel was ineffective on several grounds, which was the issue raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion that he now appeals. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Before trial, Casaran-Rivas submitted a motion to dismiss the indictment, on the ground that it violated the United States\u2019 obligations under the Refugee Convention and CAT Treaty. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that the Refugee Convention and CAT Treaty were not defenses to illegal re-entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">At jury trial, Casaran-Rivas and the government stipulated that (1) Casaran-Rivas was a citizen of Colombia and alien to the United States, (2) Casaran-Rivas previously was removed from the United States, and (3) Casaran-Rivas traveled from Costa Rica to the United States without first obtaining permission from the Attorney General to reapply for admission. Casaran-Rivas testified in his own defense that he had no choice but to flee to the United States. He and his brother witnessed a \u201cmassacre\u201d by guerillas. Two of the guerillas involved in the massacre were arrested, and the guerillas blamed Casar-an-Rivas and his brother. The guerillas kidnaped his brother and father, and set fire to their house. Neither Casaran-Ri-vas nor any member of his family had heard from his brother or father since, and Casaran-Rivas had no doubt that they were dead. Thus, Casaran-Rivas traveled to Panama and requested asylum. However, some Colombians came to the place he was staying and shot at him. Casaran-Rivas then fled to Costa Rica and requested asylum. However, these same Colombians came to the docks where he was working. Scared, he boarded the only vessel that his company currently had docked, which was traveling to the United States. He only intended to seek temporary shelter in the United States while he arranged for asylum in another country, and stated as much to the immigration officer who interviewed him as soon as the vessel landed. The jury convicted Casaran-Rivas.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Before sentencing, Casaran-Rivas submitted a \u00a7 2255 motion, asserting that his counsel was ineffective on several grounds. After denying the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the \u00a7 2255 motion as premature and without first holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the motion on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The district court sentenced Casaran-Rivas to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Casar-an-Rivas appealed his conviction, sentence, and denial of all pre-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\n<em>II. Law and Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>A. Motion to Dismiss Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment for an abuse of discretion; however, questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2003). Pursuant to \u00a7 1326, any alien who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAr\">(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding, and thereafter (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States, unless (A) prior to his reembarkation at a place outside the United States or his application for admission from foreign contiguous territory, the Attorney General has expressly consented to such alien\u2019s reapplying for admission; or (B) with respect to an alien previously denied admission and removed, unless such alien shall establish that he was not required to obtain such advance consent under this chapter or any prior Act,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">shall be fined or imprisoned. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). In <em>United States v. Henry, </em>111 F.3d 111, 114 (11th Cir.1997), we held that \u201cspecific intent is not an element of the offense of illegal re-entry into the United States after deportation in violation of [ ] \u00a7 1326.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The United States acceded to the Refugee Convention on November 6, 1968, thereby binding itself to comply with Articles 2 through 34 of the Refugee Convention. <em>Cuban American Bar Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Christopher, </em>43 F.3d 1412, 1420 (11th Cir.1995). Specifically, Article 32 prohibits expulsion of a \u201clawful\u201d refugee except on grounds of \u201cnational security or public order,\u201d and then only pursuant to a decision reached in accordance with due process of law. <em>Haitian Refugee Center v. Smith, </em>676 F.2d 1023, 1029 (5th Cir.1982). Article 33 prohibits deportation of a refugee \u201cto the frontiers or territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The CAT Treaty has been in effect in the United States since November 20, 1994. <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179-80 (11th Cir.2004). Article 3 of CAT provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o State Party shall expel, return ... or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">However, a \u201ctreaty must be self-executing in order for an individual citizen to have standing to protest a violation of the treaty.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>928 F.2d 1060, 1066 (11th Cir.1991) (considering the Geneva Convention). A \u201cself-executing international agreement is one that directly accords enforceable rights to persons without the benefit of Congressional implementation.\u201d <em>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc. v. Baker, </em>949 F.2d 1109, 1110 (11th Cir.1991). We have held that the provisions of the Refugee Convention are not self-executing. <em>Id. </em>at 1110 (discussing Article 33). We also have held that the CAT Treaty is not self-executing. <em>Cadet, </em>377 F.3d at 1180 n. 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to dismiss the indictment for the reasons alleged. <em>See McPhee, </em>336 F.3d at 1271. First, the indictment was not insufficient for failing to allege that Casaran-Rivas had specific intent to enter the United States as a previously deported criminal alien, as illegal reentry under \u00a7 1326 is not a specific intent crime. <em>See Henry, </em>111 F.3d at 114. Also, any argument that the indictment violated the refugee Convention and CAT Treaty is without merit, as the Refuge Convention and CAT Treaty are not self-executing, or subject to relevant legislation, and, therefore, do not confer upon aliens a private right of action to allege a violation of their terms. <em>See Baker, </em>949 F.2d at 1110; <em>Cadet, </em>377 F.3d at 1180 n. 3; <em>Thompson, </em>928 F.2d at 1066. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\n<em>B. \u00a7 2255 Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">An ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact; we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and decision on the ultimate issue <em>de novo. Conklin v. Scho-field, </em>366 F.3d 1191, 1201 (11th Cir.2004). A defendant normally presents ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims by way of a habeas motion or on direct appeal. As to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims presented in a habeas motion, \u00a7 2255 instructs that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Section 2255 also instructs that the prisoner must do so within one year of the latest of the date on which, <em>inter alia, </em>the judgment of conviction becomes final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). A judgment of conviction generally becomes final when the opportunity for direct appeal has been exhausted. <em>Akins v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1086, 1089 n. 1 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Also as to the timing of a \u00a7 2255 motion, this and other Circuits have held that, absent extraordinary circumstances, a defendant may not seek collateral relief while his direct appeal is pending, as the outcome of the direct appeal may negate the need for habeas relief. <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 976 (11th Cir.1990); <em>see also Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 570 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] a collateral attack is generally inappropriate if the possibility of further direct review remains open\u201d); <em>Welsh v. United States, </em>404 F.2d 333 (5th Cir.1968) (\u201cA motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 -will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>be entertained during the pendency of a direct appeal, inasmuch as the disposition of the appeal may render the motion moot\u201d); <em>Capaldi v. Pontesso, </em>135 F.3d 1122, 1124 (6th Cir.1998) (\u201c[I]in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a district court is precluded from considering a \u00a7 2255 application for relief during the pendency of the applicant\u2019s direct appeal\u201d); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>604 F.2d 474, 484 (7th Cir.1979) (\u201cOrdinarily a[\u00a7 ] 2255 action is improper during the pen-dency of an appeal from the conviction\u201d); <em>Masters v. Eide, </em>353 F.2d 517, 518 (8th Cir.1965) (\u201cOrdinarily resort cannot be had to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 or habeas corpus while an appeal from conviction is pending\u201d); <em>Jack v. United States, </em>435 F.2d 317, 318 (9th Cir.1970) (\u201cExcept under most unusual circumstances, not here present, no defendant in a federal criminal prosecution is entitled to have a direct appeal and a \u00a7 2255 proceeding considered simultaneously in an effort to overturn the conviction and sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">As to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims presented on direct appeal, the Supreme Court has held that appellate courts generally should not review ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-505, 123 S.Ct. 1690,1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). The Supreme Court reasoned that the record usually has not been sufficiently developed as to counsel\u2019s performance at that point in the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court explained that the facts presented at trial would focus on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence and that, while the record \u201cmay reflect the action taken by counsel,\u201d it would not disclose the reason or strategic motive behind this action. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded that the proper arena for such claims is collateral review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The district court erred in denying Casaran-Rivas\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits, as it was premature. Section 2255\u2019s statutory construction demonstrates that \u00a7 2255 was intended to afford strictly post-conviction relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a), (f). First, \u00a7 2255 allows \u201c[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a court\u201d to challenge that sentence, such that the statutory language itself assumes that the movant already has been sentenced. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Also, \u00a7 2255, and the relevant case law, instruct that the time for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion begins to run after the direct appeal process is complete, such that the statutory language suggests that pursuit of habeas relief should follow pursuit of direct-appeal relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f); <em>Akins, </em>204 F.3d at 1089 n. 1; <em>Washington, </em>243 F.3d at 1300; <em>Clay, </em>537 U.S. at 532, 123 S.Ct. at 1079. Likewise, the reasoning cited by the courts who have held that collateral relief and direct-appeal relief cannot be pursued simultaneously, namely that the disposition of a direct appeal might render a habeas motion unnecessary, applies with equal force to pursuing habeas relief before direct-appeal relief. <em>See, e.g., Khoury, </em>901 F.2d at 976. To this end, the record includes no reason to conclude that the instant case presents extraordinary circumstances that render this reasoning inapplicable. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the district court should have dismissed Casaran-Rivas\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The government suggests on appeal that we consider Casaran-Rivas\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims in a direct-appeal context. However, the record before us is not sufficiently developed to do so. <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. at 1694. The district court did not hold a hearing on the claims submitted, and the record otherwise does not indicate why Casaran-Rivas\u2019s counsel made the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>sions at issue. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). Accordingly, we vacate the order denying Casaran-Rivas\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits and instruct the district to dismiss the motion as premature. <em>See Mohammed-Blaize, </em>133 Fed.Appx. 774; <em>Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504-05, 123 S.Ct. at 1694. Should Casaran-Rivas decide to pursue collateral relief, any \u00a7 2255 motion submitted would not be second or successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\">. Although Congress implemented the CAT Treaty through the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1988 (\u201cFARRA\u201d), Pub.L.
