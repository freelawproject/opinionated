Ramirez\u2019s guideline range was 8-12 months, but the district court sentenced him to the statutory maximum of 60 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Ramirez argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s 750% upward \u201cdeviation\u201d from the guideline range was unreasonable and was the result of the court\u2019s (1) overemphasis of his criminal history, (2) improper sentencing procedure, and (3) inadequate consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Ramirez contends that the court failed to consider the $1,000 loss amount, and he notes that, according to our precedent, (1) a sentence that falls far outside the guideline range must be supported by \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d and (2) in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court should not rely on any one single factor. Ramirez also argues that the district court failed to either set forth any statutory elements to support an upward variance or follow the procedural requirements for an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. In his reply brief, Ramirez argues that the district court did not follow <em>Booker\u2019s</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>directives because it first failed to correctly calculate the guideline range and then to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Further, according to Ramirez, the court failed to implement uniform sentencing, and the sentence nullified the two-level decrease he received for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">\u201cWe review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReasonableness\u201d review requires that the appellate court review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (stating that the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cexplanation of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 review in the <em>Booker </em>opinion made it pellueidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions\u201d). We</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArY\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><em>Id., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential,\u201d and, in reviewing for reasonableness, the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors that a district court must consider include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">When applying these factors to a particular sentence, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors because \u2018our review is not de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and alteration omitted), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the section 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">In <em>United States v. Valdes, </em>500 F.3d 1291 (11th Cir.2007), we vacated Valdes\u2019s sentence and remanded to the district court because it was unclear whether the court was departing upwardly under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 or whether the court was applying a variance based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and, therefore, the record was \u201cinsufficient to permit the affir-mance of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292. We stated that \u201c[i]f the court intended to rely solely on \u00a7 3553(a) to vary upward from the Guidelines, the reasons discussed were inadequate to support an extraordinary variance to a sentence of 108 months, which was more than double the high-end of the calculated Guidelines range, and significantly, well above the Government\u2019s recommended Guidelines range of 57-71 months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a footnote, we stated that, \u201c[m]any of the bases for the district court\u2019s sentence were already accounted for in calculating the Guidelines range and noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ing extraordinary about the circumstances of this case justified this extreme variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 2. We found support in <em>United States v. MeVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348 (11th Cir.2006), which held that a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence that falls far outside the Guidelines range must be supported by \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1290-92 (11th Cir.2006), we determined that a five-hour term of imprisonment was unreasonable. Although the district court stated \u201cthe sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense, provides just punishment, affords adequate deterrence and adequately protects the public,\u201d we determined that the district court\u2019s primary concern at sentencing was to provide restitution, and the court imposed a brief sentence to allow the defendant to earn money in order to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1290-91. We stated, \u201ca district court\u2019s \u2018unjustified reliance upon any one [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factor is a symptom of an unreasonable sentence,\u2019 \u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he district court focused single-mindedly on the goal of restitution to the detriment of all of the other sentencing factors. An unreasonable approach produced an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292 (citation omitted). In addition, we stated that \u201cdistrict courts should consider the policies behind the applicable guidelines provision\u201d in deciding a sentence and noted that \u201calong with other relevant factors under the guidelines, loss serves as a measure of the seriousness of the offense and the defendant\u2019s relative culpability and is a principal factor in determining the offense level under this guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (backg\u2019d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In its recent <em>Gall </em>decision, the Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may ... take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines. We reject, however, an appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinary circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range. We also reject the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-10\"><em>Gall, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. at 594-95. The Supreme Court stated that a \u201cproportional review\u201d is \u201cinconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions-whether inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. at 596. When a sentencing judge determines that a non-guideline sentence is warranted, \u201che must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. However, \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the sentence for reasonableness, an appellate court \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">In the present case, we affirm Ramirez\u2019s sentence because even though the sentence amounted to a significant upward variance, the district court properly calculated the advisory guideline range, considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, articulated its reasons in open court, considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Ramirez\u2019s arguments, and had a reasoned basis for its decision. <em>See Gall, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rita, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">. <em>United States v.
