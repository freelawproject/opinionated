We granted a certificate of appealability on whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>F.2d 925, 986 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>when it failed to address appellant\u2019s claim that his convictions for first-degree sodomy in Counts 32 and 33 in his indictment violated the principles of double jeopardy. Summers argues that the district court failed to resolve one of the claims articulated in his \u00a7 2254 petition, asserting that \u201cit does not appear that the court have [sic] specifically addressed whether two convictions can be had on first-degree sodomy on Count 32 of the indictment and first-degree sodomy on Count 33 of the indictment.\u201d He also argues about the merits of his underlying double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition, we review the decision <em>de novo. McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">As an initial matter, we. will not address the merits of Summers\u2019s double jeopardy claim because our scope of review is limited to the issue specified in the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250 (11th Cir.1998) (addressing a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Out of \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions,\u201d in <em>Clisby </em>we exercised our supervisory authority over the district courts and instructed them to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for habeas corpus relief, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied. 960 F.2d at 935-36. When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court\u2019s order violated <em>Clisby </em>because it adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, which was silent on Summers\u2019s argument that Counts 32 and 33 violated double jeopardy. Thus, the district court failed to address one claim asserted in Summers\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. We therefore vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand the remaining claim for consideration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
