No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Petitioner is a Chinese native who arrived in the United States in December 2004. He filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT, alleging he fears harm based on his religion, political opinion, and membership in a particular social class if he returns to China. Li\u2019s concerns stem from his father\u2019s practice of Falun Gong in secret at the family\u2019s home and the father\u2019s arrest in January 2004. After Li\u2019s father\u2019s alleged arrest, Li traveled to the United States. Since arriving in the United States, Li has started to practice Falun Gong. According to Li, he is afraid that, if he is sent back to China, he will be arrested just like his father and other practitioners of Falun Gong.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The IJ denied Li\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. Li filed a notice of appeal to the BIA, which it denied in its own written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">When the BIA issues its own decision, separate from the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, this court\u2019s review is de novo.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThis court reviews administrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). This Court will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">An alien who seeks asylum carries the burden of proving statutory refugee status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To carry this burden, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution may be established by showing (1) past persecution that creates a rebuttable presumption of a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, (2) a reasonable possibility of future personal persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country, or (3) a pattern or practice in the subject country of persecuting members of a statutorily defined group of which the alien is part. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">An alien who seeks withholding of removal carries the burden of showing that it is more likely than not that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(C). An applicant who cannot meet the lower \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution burden for asylum usually cannot meet the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard required to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 820-21 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">This Court has explained that \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). Persecution requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Court has upheld agency decisions when petitioners failed to prove past persecution in cases where petitioners had been temporarily detained and suffered injuries that required hospitalization. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">An alien who seeks relief under CAT carries the burden of establishing \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). The \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard for relief under CAT is higher than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for relief for asylum, so a petitioner who fails to meet the asylum standard will usually not be able to carry his burden for relief under CAT. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The BIA\u2019s decision that Li is not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief is supported by the evidence. Li did not present evidence that he was arrested or otherwise harmed while living in China. He did not present evidence that the Chinese government is aware that he currently practices Falun Gong. He also failed to present evidence that the Chinese government has ever been interested in him, would single him out for harsh treatment if he returns, or any other reason he should have a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution,\u201d especially because he is not a Falun Gong leader and simply practices in the privacy of his home. Furthermore, this Court has held that \u201c[ijnvolvement in Falun Gong in China by itself does not entitle a person to asylum in the United States.\u201d <em>Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1292. Petitioner has not demonstrated reversible error in the BIA\u2019s decision; accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
