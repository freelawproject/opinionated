On appeal, Grant argues that the district court failed to make an independent finding of the amount of loss, which was necessary to calculate his guidelines sentencing range correctly, and erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Grant also argues that the district judge abused her discretion in presiding over the re-sentencing proceedings because she had not presided at trial or conducted an evidentiary hearing. Finally, Grant argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel during re-sentencing in that his counsel specifically requested that the district court not conduct an evidentiary hearing. We AFFIRM Grant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">Grant was indicted on charges of aiding and abetting false statements under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1014 and 2 (\u201cCounts 1-6\u201d), aiding and abetting bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344 and 2 (\u201cCount 7\u201d), and conspiracy to defraud the United States under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (\u201cCount 8\u201d). A jury found him guilty of Counts 1-6 and not guilty of Count 8.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury also found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Grant\u2019s offenses caused Covenant Bank to lose $350,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">Grant was the President of Southern Pride Contractors, Inc. (\u201cSPC\u201d), which had a $500,000 line of credit with Covenant Bank in Leeds, Alabama. SPC could draw on the line of credit up to 80% of the value of its accounts receivable. From the fall of 2002 through May 2003, SPC was bidding on a large U.S. military contract. During this time, at Grant\u2019s direction, an SPC employee, Michael Crisp, provided Covenant Bank with false accounts receivable reports, apparently in an attempt to increase SPC\u2019s credit line in anticipation of the military contract. Based on the false statements, Covenant Bank kept the $500,000 line of credit open, although SPC\u2019s accounts receivable were insufficient to support it. If Covenant Bank had known the actual amount of accounts receivable, it could have called the loan and taken funds from SPC\u2019s checking account to reduce the bank\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">Relying on Covenant Bank\u2019s \u201cDeclaration of Victim Losses,\u201d an exhibit in the related case against Crisp, the probation office calculated Covenant Bank\u2019s loss as $481,945.38 plus legal fees of $2,192.00, interest, and late fees, for a total of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>$497,158.87.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This would have yielded a total amount of restitution of $484,137.38 (if restitution of interest and late fees was not authorized by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Grant was assigned a base offense level of six pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2003). The Guidelines then called for the addition of 14 levels for a loss amount between $400,000 and $1,000,000 and the further addition of two levels for obstruction of justice. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. This resulted in a total offense level of 22, which, with a criminal history category of 1, gave Grant a guideline imprisonment range of 41-51 months. The probation officer noted that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014, the maximum statutory term of imprisonment was 30 years per count.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Before sentencing, Grant objected to, among other things, the amount of loss alleged in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSP\u2019). The government responded that, although the jury had found a loss of $350,000 beyond a reasonable doubt, the government intended to establish a greater amount at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The original sentencing judge, who had also presided at trial, found, without explanation, that Covenant Bank\u2019s loss was $50,000 and sentenced Grant to five months in prison on each count, to be served concurrently. R9 at 18, 38-39. Grant appealed his conviction and sentence, and the government cross-appealed. We affirmed Grant\u2019s convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded to the district court for re-sentencing. In so doing, we held that the district court had \u201cfailed to provide any factual basis whatsoever for its ultimate loss calculation of $50,000,\u201d and thus erred in calculating the amount of loss. Rl-62 at 19-20. We also observed that the district court had erred in calculating the guidelines range because the amount of loss was an \u201cessential component\u201d in the calculation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">After the original sentencing judge re-cused himself, Grant filed a motion requesting that his conviction be set aside, or that he be granted a new trial, on the bases (1) that the amount of loss, an essential factor in determining a sentence, had not been and could not be proved, and that allowing the government to prove the amount at re-sentencing would be effectively retrying the ease; and, (2) that a judge other than the trial judge could not fairly determine a sentence. At re-sentencing, the successor judge stated that she had read the trial transcripts and exhibits, the PSI, the sentencing transcript, and the objections to the PSI. The court then heard arguments on Grant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">Grant argued that it was prejudicial to him to be sentenced by a judge who had not been present to observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanor at trial and to assess their credibility. Grant also objected to \u201cthe government being allowed to have another bite at the apple in trying to prove that there was a loss to the bank.\u201d R10 at 5. Grant argued that it was \u201cin the nature of double jeopardy\u201d to allow the government to present additional evidence of the amount of loss because the government did not carry its burden to prove the amount at the original sentencing hearing and should not be allowed another opportunity. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The government argued for an evidentiary hearing, particularly pointing out that it had been surprised by the original sentencing judge\u2019s loss determination because (1) the PSI had indicated a loss amount of \u201cwell over $400,000,\u201d and (2) Grant\u2019s objection to that amount had suggested the loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>amount ought to have been between $200,000 and $400,000. <em>Id. </em>at 15. Grant argued, however, that we had asked the district court \u201cto form a rational basis about what the loss was\u201d based on the evidence contained in the transcripts from the trial and the original sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">After discussing several reported cases addressing the propriety of a non-trial judge presiding at re-sentencing, the court found that no issue in Grant\u2019s case was particularly dependent upon the demeanor of the witnesses. The court noted that although one witness had pled guilty to making false statements, \u201cthe evidence was consistent and accepted by the jury from several witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. The court then denied Grant\u2019s motion to set aside his conviction or for a new trial, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">And I find that in this specific case, with this specific record, and these specific allegations, and based on my review of every document that exists about the case, other than pretrial motions, I can adequately and fairly sentence this defendant because I am familiar enough with the case to be able to assign an appropriate sentence from that review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK0\"><em>Id. </em>at 22. The court granted Grant\u2019s request not to hear additional evidence as to the amount of loss, stating that it would \u201cproceed on the basis of the trial transcript, the exhibits, the previous sentencing hearing, the presentence report, and the objections to the presentence report, and anything that I hear in allocution today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The district court found that there was \u201csufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination of a $350,000 loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. The court discussed in detail the trial testimony regarding the loss amount, observing that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that SPC had true accounts receivable of between $300,000 and $400,000 at the time that the loan balance was $496,000 and at the time that the false statements were made to the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 26. The court found the loss amount to be $350,000 on the bases of the jury\u2019s verdict, the sentencing transcript, and the trial transcript. This yielded a new guidelines offense level of 20, resulting in a sentencing range of 33-41 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The court then heard arguments from the parties on whether the court should vary from the Guidelines. Grant requested a variance based on the bank\u2019s own participation in the scheme, his poor health, his Marine Corps service, his years of contracting with the federal government without any trouble, and his inability to pay restitution if he were to receive a long sentence. The court also heard from Grant personally. The government responded that the testimony at trial had shown that Grant had prepared the false statements for his own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">With reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court stated that it considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, Grant\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to deter Grant and others from committing similar offenses, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense. The court then sentenced Grant to 24 months on each count, to be served concurrently. Neither party stated further objections to the findings, the calculations, the sentence, or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced. However, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">A. <em>Independent Finding of the Loss Amount</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">We review a final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After <em>Booker, </em>district courts must first correctly calculate the advisory sentencing range under the Guidelines, and then must determine a reasonable sentence in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per cu-riam). The standards of review for application of the Guidelines remain the same as before <em>Booker: </em>we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and review the application of the Guidelines to those findings <em>de novo. United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen the appealing party does not clearly state the grounds for an objection in the district court, we are limited to reviewing for plain error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For plain error, we must find: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>Then, we may correct such an error \u201conly if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Rule 32(i)(3)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that, at sentencing, the court \u201cmust \u2014 for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter \u2014 rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). In economic offense cases, the district court must properly calculate the amount of loss in order correctly to calculate the guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b); <em>see United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he sentencing Guidelines require a district court, at the sentencing stage, to make <em>independent </em>findings establishing the factual basis for its Guidelines calculations.\u201d <em>Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d at 1338 (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B) while reviewing a district court\u2019s reliance on the jury\u2019s forfeiture verdict in calculating the loss amount for purposes of the Guidelines). \u201cThe district court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the [pre-sentence investigation report], or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u201cUsually, the government must prove disputed facts at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Malol, </em>476 F.3d 1283, 1292 (11th Cir.2007). However, if the evidence in the record amply supports the amount of loss as determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, a sentencing court may use such amount in calculating the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Here, the record shows that the district court determined the loss amount based on the jury verdict and a thorough review of both trial and sentencing transcripts. Upon this review, the district court specifically found that there was \u201csufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s determination\u201d of the loss amount. R10 at 24. Thus, the district court stated a factual basis for its independent determination of the loss amount for purposes of calculating the guidelines range, in accordance with our direction following Grant\u2019s previous appeal. <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>211 Fed.Appx. 889, 898 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>see also Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d at 1338; <em>Malol, </em>476 F.3d at 1293. Therefore, the district court did not commit error, much less plain error, in determining the amount of loss. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 818.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>B. <em>Decision to Preside Over Resentenc-ing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We review a district court judge\u2019s decision to preside over re-sentencing for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Government of the Canal Zone v. O\u2019Calagan, </em>580 F.2d 161, 165 (5th Cir.1978); <em>see also United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1256 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 941, 127 S.Ct. 335, 166 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). Rule 25(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">(1) In General. After a verdict or finding of guilty, any judge regularly sitting in or assigned to a court may complete the court\u2019s duties if the judge who presided at trial cannot perform those duties because of absence, death, sickness, or other disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">(2) Granting a New Trial. The successor judge may grant a new trial if satisfied that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">(A) a judge other than the one who presided at the trial cannot perform the post-trial duties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">(B) a new trial is necessary for some other reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 25(b). We have declined to hold that a judge who was not present at trial must read the trial transcript before imposing a sentence, where the record contained \u201cample evidence that [the sentencing judge] was familiar enough with the trial to impose sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraza, </em>843 F.2d 432, 437 (11th Cir.1988) (per curiam). We have also held that a sentencing judge was \u201csufficiently familiar with [the defendant\u2019s] trial to sentence him,\u201d where the sentencing judge had ruled on pretrial motions, read the trial transcripts, and read the transcripts of all later proceedings. <em>Dowd, </em>451 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">In this case, the record shows that the re-sentencing judge determined that she was able to sentence Grant fairly based on her review of the trial transcript, exhibits, jury verdict, and sentencing transcript. The sentencing judge also found that there was nothing in the case that depended particularly on the demeanor of the witnesses. Thus, there was \u201cample evidence\u201d that the sentencing judge was familiar enough with the case to impose a sentence. <em>See Caraza, </em>843 F.2d at 437. Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court judge to preside at re-sentencing when she had not presided over the trial or the original sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">C. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">On appeal Grant argues that he is preserving his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but that the record is not sufficiently developed for us to review his claim on direct appeal. The government argues that the record is sufficient to find that Grant received effective assistance of counsel with regard to counsel\u2019s request that the district court not conduct an evidentiary hearing on the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">\u201cWhether a criminal defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact, subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). However, we generally do not consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised for the first time on direct appeal, except in rare cases in which the record is sufficiently developed as to that issue. <em>Id.; see Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>500, 504-05, 508, 128 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). In this case, we conclude that the record is adequate to enable review of the limited issue Grant raises, <em>i.e., </em>whether counsel was ineffective in that he argued against hearing additional evidence at re-sentencing on the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u201cTo prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, [a defendant] must prove: (1) that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that he was thereby prejudiced, that is, there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of his trial would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1272 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686-87, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Based on the jury\u2019s determination of the loss amount, the applicable Guidelines, the presentence investigation report, and the government\u2019s lower burden of proof at sentencing, a reasonable attorney could have concluded that further evidence on the amount of loss would be more likely to result in a higher guidelines imprisonment range. <em>See Malol, </em>476 F.3d at 1292. Thus, counsel\u2019s request not to hear additional evidence was not \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>See Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1272. Accordingly, Grant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Grant appeals his 24-month sentence for aiding and abetting false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1014 and 2. Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error with regard to the district court\u2019s finding of the amount of loss or the district judge\u2019s decision to preside at the re-sentencing hearing. Finally, because a reasonable attorney could have concluded that an additional evidentiary hearing at sentencing might not have been in the best interests of his client, we find that Grant\u2019s counsel was not ineffective. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Grant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-11\">.
