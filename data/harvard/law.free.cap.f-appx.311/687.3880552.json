He was sentenced to 65 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-24\">Polanco appeals his conviction for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36, arguing that the judgment should reflect that he was convicted of \u201cbeing found in\u201d the United States and not of \u201c[ijllegal [r]e-[e]ntry,\u201d as listed in the judgment. He argues that \u201cbeing found in\u201d the United States and \u201cillegal reentry\u201d are distinct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-25\">Rule 36 authorizes us to correct only clerical errors, which occur when \u201cthe court intended one thing but by merely clerical mistake or oversight did another.\u201d <em>United States v. Steen, </em>55 F.3d 1022, 1026 n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In the district court\u2019s judgment, the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d description, \u201c[i]llegal [r]e-[e]ntry,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>so closely tracks the \u00a7 1826 title, \u201cReentry of removed aliens,\u201d that it bears no indicia of the district court having made a mistake or oversight. Rather, it appears that the district court intended the \u201cNature of Offense\u201d to refer generally to the title of \u00a7 1326. Therefore, there is no clerical error. <em>See United States v. Buen-dia-Rangel, </em>553 F.3d 378, 379 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
