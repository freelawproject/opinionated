Negron and Unit Manager Mark Johnson of the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court ruled that Wade failed to exhaust available administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-24\">Section 1997e(a) provides that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title ... by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of an action for failure to exhaust. <em>Johnson v. Meadows, </em>418 F.3d 1152, 1155 (11th Cir.2005). A district court may dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>a complaint if it \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-25\">The Bureau of Prisons provided a administrative grievance procedure, and Wade failed to comply with that procedure. The three-step procedure required Wade to file a grievance at the institution where she was incarcerated and, if the request was denied, to appeal to the regional office and then the Office of General Counsel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.14(a), 542.14(a)(b). An inmate may file a grievance directly with the regional office if the inmate \u201creasonably believes the issue is sensitive\u201d and, if the regional office finds the request not sensitive, the inmate is permitted to re-initiate the process at the institutional level. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 542.14(d). Wade filed a \u201csensitive\u201d grievance with the regional office and was instructed by that office to \u201cfile a request or appeal at the appropriate level via regular procedures.\u201d When Wade appealed to the Office of General Counsel, that office also told Wade to \u201cfirst file a BP-9 request through the institution for the Warden\u2019s review and response before filing an appeal.\u201d Because documents attached to Wade\u2019s complaint establish that she did not exhaust administrative remedies, the district court did not err when it dismissed Wade\u2019s complaint summarily. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 213-15, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920-21, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The dismissal of Wade\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
