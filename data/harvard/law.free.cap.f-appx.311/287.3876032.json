Flores appeals the district court\u2019s grant of her <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce her ten-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court found that, based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, Flores was entitled to a reduction in her sentence, but not below the ten-year statutory minimum provided by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). On appeal, Flores argues for the first time that the district court erred by failing to re-determine her eligibility for \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, based on Amendment 709 to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Generally, \u201c[i]n a proceeding to modify a sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d and we review for an abuse of discretion \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). Arguments raised for the first time on appeal, however, are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). When reviewing for plain error, we will not reverse the district court\u2019s decision \u201cunless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if \u201cthe error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201c[Wlhere the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant if that defendant \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, the district court may reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, after considering applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>In a ease in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), ... and any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (2008). For a district court to have authority, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to reduce a sentence based on an amendment to the Guidelines, two initial conditions must be met. First, the sentencing range must be lowered by the amendment. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>58 F.3d 1567, 1568-69, 1572 (11th Cir.1995) (ordering the district court to reinstate the original sentence on remand because the sentencing range was not lowered by the amendment). Second, the amendment must be listed as retroactively applicable in \u00a7 IB 1.10(c). <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Amendment 706 to the Sentencing, Guidelines reduced base offense levels for certain crack cocaine offenses, as reflected in the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2008). Amendment 706, which is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), was made retroactive by Amendment 713. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Amendment 709 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and was not made retroactive by any later amendment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); <em>see generally </em>U.S.S.GApp. C. As a result of this amendment, sentences for \u201cmisdemeanor and petty offenses\u201d are generally counted for purposes of computing a defendant\u2019s criminal history, but sentences of probation for certain listed offenses are counted only if the sentence was for \u201cmore than one year,\u201d instead of \u201cat least one year.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 709; <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) (2006) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">A defendant convicted of an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, known as the \u201csafety valve,\u201d a district court must impose a sentence without regard to the statutory minimum sentence if the defendant meets the criteria listed in subsections (1) through (5), which include having no more than one criminal history point. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(l)-(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">The record here shows that the district court followed the proper procedure for re-sentencing under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In addition, the district court did not plainly err in failing to apply Amendment 709 to redetermine Flores\u2019s safety-valve eligibility. Accordingly, we affirm Flores\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
