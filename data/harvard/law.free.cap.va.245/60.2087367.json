Alleging medical malpractice, Nikolaos and Sandra Panousos, Nicole\u2019s parents and administrators of her estate, sued Dr. Robert M. Allen, a radiologist, and his employer, Fairfax Radiological Consultants, P.C. The trial court entered judgment upon a jury verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>We granted this appeal limited to the question whether the evidence supports the granting of the following instruction, tendered by the defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">An intervening cause is an independent event, not reasonably foreseeable, that completely breaks the connection between the defendant\u2019s negligent act and the plaintiff\u2019s injury. An intervening cause breaks the chain of events so that the defendant\u2019s original negligent act is not a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury in the slightest degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">As we will note later, in any event, the instruction as written is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Because the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, we assume it applied and relied upon the principles articulated in the instruction in reaching its verdict, <em>Reams v. Doe, </em>236 Va. 237, 238, 372 S.E.2d 405, 406 (1988); <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. </em>v. <em>White, </em>158 Va. 243, 256, 163 S.E. 530, 534-35 (1932), and we further assume that the jury found Dr. Allen was negligent, but that a superseding cause broke any connection between his negligent act and the subsequent death of his patient. Accordingly, we will state the facts and the reasonable inferences deducible therefrom that support the theory of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Nicole, then acutely ill, was admitted to the hospital with a large, distended abdomen. For some days previous to her admission, Nicole had experienced diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, and had refused to nurse, although this was her sole form of fluid and nutrition.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">In examining Nicole, Dr. Earl Hodin, a pediatric surgeon, noticed that her abdomen \u201cseemed to contain a large mass.\u201d Before making a diagnosis and deciding whether to delay the operation for 24 hours or to operate immediately, Dr. Hodin ordered a sonogram. A sonogram is a diagnostic ultrasound examination employing equipment that projects a picture of internal organs on a television screen by the use of high-frequency sound waves. The timing of the operation was to have important consequences for Nicole, as we shall see later.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Dr. Allen performed the sonogram and other tests and advised Dr. Hodin that there were two cystic (fluid-filled) masses in Nicole\u2019s abdomen, but that neither mass was the bladder. Had Dr. Allen advised Dr. Hodin that the larger mass was the bladder, Dr. Hodin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>would have attempted to drain the bladder by catheterization and then assessed Nicole\u2019s condition before deciding whether to delay surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">After receiving Dr. Allen\u2019s report, Dr. Hodin performed emergency surgery upon Nicole. The surgery took approximately four hours and forty-five minutes. During surgery, Dr. Hodin discovered that Dr. Allen had misinformed him, and that the large mass in Nicole\u2019s abdomen was her bladder. Dr. Hodin drained approximately one liter of urine from the bladder. This was approximately 10% of Nicole\u2019s entire body weight and more fluid than her total blood volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Dr. Hodin also found, and excised, a fluid-filled tumor (the smaller mass observed by Dr. Allen on the sonogram), which was pressing against Nicole\u2019s urethra. This tumor had blocked the flow of urine from her bladder, causing it to swell. Nicole went into cardiac arrest the next day and died the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses, Dr. Arthur Mar\u00f3n, a pediatrician, and Dr. Richard B. Karsh, both a diagnostic radiologist and a pediatric cardiologist, reviewed Nicole\u2019s medical records after the operation. Dr. Karsh characterized Dr. Allen\u2019s tests as insufficient and testified that Dr. Allen should have performed other tests, which would have identified the large mass as the bladder. Both doctors testified that had Dr. Allen reported to Dr. Hodin that the large mass was the bladder, the urine enlarging Nicole\u2019s bladder could have been drained and the surgery could and should have been postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">According to Dr. Karsh, substantial changes in the fluid levels in infants have important consequences in monitoring their levels of hydration, in normalizing their electrolytes (chemicals in the blood responsible for normal cellular function), and in caring for infants. One of the defendants\u2019 expert witnesses, Dr. Bradley Rodgers, a pediatric surgeon, testified that in the surgery Dr. Hodin was to perform, there would be \u201ca lot of fluid shifts,\u201d and that such shifts would continue for 8 to 12 hours following the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Dr. Mar\u00f3n testified that had Nicole been given the opportunity to resume breast feeding to improve her protein nutrition, her physical condition would have improved within several hours. Both Drs. Marion and Karsh concluded that had the operation been delayed, Nicole would not have been subjected to the higher risks associated with emergency surgery upon acutely ill infants.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Noting Nicole\u2019s depleted nutritional state and her weakened physical condition, Dr. Mar\u00f3n further testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">[t]here were dramatic shifts in the child\u2019s fluid balance secondary to surgery and secondary to the drainage from the bladder. There were electrolyte disturbances which means that the ability of the child to compensate for deficiencies and surpluses of various salts and electrolytes in the bloodstream were affected. There was a problem with hydration or fluid maintenance on the part of the child, because it was very difficult to tell whether the urination was secondary to having had an obstruction previously or whether [it resulted from] not getting enough fluids. Therefore, fluids were given that might have been excessive in error because of the fact that we\u2019re not aware of the. true hydration state of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">These number of things cumulatively resulted, I believe, in congestive heart failure, a weakening of the heart muscle and eventually cardiac arrest which occurred in the early morning of the 6th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">The cardiac arrest was of such a nature and electrolytes were of such a disturbance that the cardiac arrest was irreversible in spite of the heroic measures taken to restore the child\u2019s cardiac status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Defendants\u2019 expert, Dr. Rodgers, testified that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no objective evidence to support any of the four primary suspects in this case,\u201d the three causes of death described by Doctors Mar\u00f3n and Karsh and another cause initially suspected by Dr. Rodgers. Dr. Rodgers\u2019 conclusion was that \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s [enough] data here to support any particular cause of death over another.\u201d The defendants reason from this testimony and the testimony of Drs. Mar\u00f3n and Karsh that the issue of superseding cause had thus been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Neither party cites any case in which we have considered the sufficiency of the evidence necessary to support a superseding cause instruction. Defendants recognize that they have the burden of going forward with evidence of superseding cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">We have differentiated intervening and superseding cause in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>There may, of course, be more than one proximate cause of an event. And not every intervening cause is a superseding cause. In order to relieve a defendant of liability for his negligence, negligence intervening between the defendant\u2019s negligence and the injury \u201cmust so entirely supersede the operation of the defendant\u2019s negligence, that it alone, without the defendant\u2019s [negligence contributing] thereto in the slightest degree, produces the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><em>Coleman v. Blankenship Oil Corp., </em>221 Va. 124, 131, 267 S.E.2d 143, 147 (1980) (quoting <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>103 Va. 320, 324, 49 S.E. 482, 483 (1905)). Hence, the instruction at issue is more precisely described as a superseding cause instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In support of their contention that they have met their burden of going forward with the evidence on this issue, the defendants first note Dr. Rodgers\u2019 rebuttal of the causation testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 experts. The defendants then conclude that \u201c[l]ogic dictates that if none of the factors postulated by Appellants\u2019 trial experts had any causal role in [Nicole\u2019s death], some unknown and superseding cause necessarily precipitated the [death]\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe jury was entitled to infer that a superseding, entirely unforeseeable causal agent triggered Nicole\u2019s cardiac arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">However, the defendants draw a different conclusion than Dr. Rodgers did from his premise. They postulate a superseding cause in the place of Dr. Rodgers\u2019 conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was simply insufficient to establish proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In our opinion, reasonable persons could infer nothing more from Dr. Rodgers\u2019 testimony than that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that Dr. Allen\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of Nicole\u2019s death. And the jury was fully instructed that, in the absence of such proof, it should find for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Next, the defendants cite Dr. Mar\u00f3n\u2019s testimony regarding the possible negligence of some of the other health care providers, who injected additional and unnecessary fluids into Nicole after her operation. The defendants overlook Dr. Allen\u2019s role in contributing to the more difficult conditions that gave rise to such alleged negligence. Dr. Mar\u00f3n testified that because of the concurrent draining of Nicole\u2019s bladder and the \u201cdramatic shifts in the child\u2019s fluid balance\u2019 \u2019 during and after the operation, it was much more difficult to determine how much additional fluid Nicole needed in her stressed condition. Applying the rationale of <em>Gay </em>and <em>Blankenship, </em>we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>that the jury could not reasonably infer from Dr. Mar\u00f3n\u2019s testimony that Dr. Allen\u2019s negligence did not contribute \u201cin the slightest degree\u201d to cause Nicole\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">As a final justification for the superseding cause instruction, the defendants cite the following testimony of Dr. Karsh:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">[Dr. Allen] would certainly know that a misdiagnosis could cause harm to the patient, but he probably would be unable to specifically identify what harm it might cause. It could be anything from a larger postsurgical scar obviously to death with the likelihood of death I\u2019m sure being very, very low on his list.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">This testimony is clearly insufficient to justify the instruction. \u201c[I]f a reasonably prudent person in the same circumstances ought to have foreseen that <em>some </em>injury might probably result\u201d from his negligence, he need not have foreseen the precise injury that occurred to subject him to liability for such negligence. <em>Blondel </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>241 Va. 467, 475, 403 S.E.2d 340, 345 (1991) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In summary, we conclude that none of the evidence, medical or otherwise, justifies a superseding cause instruction and that the court erred in granting the instruction. And, because the jury may have found for the defendants because of the instruction, the error was prejudicial. <em>Potter v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 606, 611, 283 S.E.2d 448, 451 (1981). Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
