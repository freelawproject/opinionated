Therefore, we will state the facts in the light most favorable to Loving, and if there is any credible evidence in the record that supports the verdict, then we must reinstate that verdict and enter judgment thereon. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>243 Va. 308, 309-10, 415 S.E.2d 222, 223 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">The accident that is the subject of this appeal occurred at the intersection of Commander Shepard Boulevard and North Armistead Avenue in Hampton. Commander Shepard Boulevard extends north and south. North Armistead Avenue extends east and west. A \u201cguard shack\u201d is located on Commander Shepard Boulevard approximately 65 feet north of the intersection. Vehicles traveling north on Commander Shepard Boulevard must stop at the \u201cguard shack\u201d before entering the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) property, an area restricted to public traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">An exhibit, drawn at trial by Wayne Childress, the officer who investigated the accident, indicates that two lanes of travel extend in a southerly direction on Commander Shepard Boulevard and are used by vehicles exiting NASA. Traffic in these lanes is controlled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>by two yield signs, located at the intersection of Commander Shepard Boulevard and North Armistead Avenue. The posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Loving was driving her car north on Commander Shepard Boulevard. As she approached the intersection, she moved into the left-turn lane and activated her car\u2019s left-turn signal light. As she began to make her left turn onto North Armistead Avenue, she looked and did not see any vehicles that would obstruct her intended path of travel. As she proceeded through the intersection, her car was struck by a Ford Bronco driven south into the intersection by David Lane Hayden, Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">According to David Earnest Brownley, a witness to the accident, Hayden\u2019s vehicle was traveling 35 to 40 miles per hour when the accident occurred. The collision moved Loving\u2019s car a distance of 30 to 50 feet from the point of impact. After the accident, Hayden got out of his vehicle and stated, on at least three occasions, that he did not see Loving\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Loving testified that even though she looked before she entered the intersection, the \u201cguard shack\u201d obstructed her vision because \u201c[y]ou cannot see the left-hand lane fully of cars coming out [of NASA] if you\u2019re a certain distance away, because the guard shack being in the median blocks the first portion of that left-hand lane coming out.\u201d Hayden\u2019s vehicle was traveling in the left-hand lane when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The jury considered issues relating to liability, contributory negligence, and damages and returned a verdict in favor of Loving against Hayden and his employer, Radiological Services, Inc., in the amount of $750,000. The trial court set the verdict aside because it was of opinion that Loving was contributorially negligent as a matter of law and that her negligence was a proximate cause of the accident. We awarded Loving an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Loving argues that reasonable minds could differ whether she was negligent in failing to see Hayden\u2019s vehicle and, therefore, the trial court erred by holding that she was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Hayden and Radiological Services argue that Loving had an absolute duty to see an oncoming vehicle which was in plain view and that she was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law because she failed to see Hayden\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">We have stated on numerous occasions the legal principles pertinent to our resolution of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Resolving conflicts in the evidence is a prerogative of the jury. A court should not determine as a matter of law . that a party is guilty of or free from negligence unless the evidence is such that reasonable [persons], after weighing the evidence and drawing all just inferences therefrom, could reach but one conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><em>J &amp; E Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hancock Peanut Co., </em>220 Va. 57, 62, 255 S.E.2d 481, 485 (1979). Furthermore, we have stated repeatedly that, ordinarily questions of contributory negligence must be resolved by the jury. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>243 Va. at 311, 415 S.E.2d at 224; <em>Artrip </em>v. <em>E.E. Berry Equip. Co., </em>240 Va. 354, 358, 397 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1990); <em>Philip Morris Inc. </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>235 Va. 380, 403, 368 S.E.2d 268, 280 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We hold that the trial court erred by holding that Loving was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Our review of tire evidence of record reveals that reasonable persons could indeed differ on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">As we mentioned earlier, Loving testified that even though she looked before entering the intersection, the \u201cguard shack\u201d obstructed her view of vehicles traveling in a southerly direction in the left lane on Commander Shepard Boulevard, Hayden\u2019s lane of travel when the accident occurred. The jury was entitled to conclude that when Loving looked before she entered the intersection, her view of Hayden\u2019s vehicle was obstructed by the \u201cguard shack\u201d and that she did not see, and in the exercise of reasonable care under the circumstances could not have seen, his vehicle in sufficient time to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">It is true that we have held that a driver has a duty to \u201ckeep a reasonable lookout for oncoming vehicles and to see any such vehicles approaching in plain view.\u201d <em>Von Roy </em>v. <em>Whitescarver, </em>197 Va. 384, 391, 89 S.E.2d 346, 351 (1955). However, whether Hayden\u2019s vehicle was approaching Loving\u2019s car in \u201cplain view\u201d was a question of fact to be resolved by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Hayden and Radiological Associates now seek to argue that the trial court erred by refusing to grant their motion for a mistrial. At trial, Loving\u2019s counsel requested in closing argument that the jury award her specific amounts of compensation for past and future pain, suffering, mental anguish, inconvenience^ bodily injury, and disfigurement. Her attorney suggested a dollar range for each element of damage and wrote those ranges on a chart that he showed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the jury. Counsel for Hayden and Radiological Services made a motion for a mistrial, which was renewed after the jury had returned its verdict. Because the trial court set aside the verdict on the ground that Loving was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, the court did not rule on the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Subsequently, Hayden and Radiological Services filed a petition for appeal to this Court and argued that the trial court erred because it did not rule on their motion for a mistrial. We dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, because the petitioners were the recipients of a favorable final judgment and, therefore, they were not aggrieved parties within the intendment of Code \u00a7 8.01-670(A)(3). <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Loving, </em>Record No. 920934 (October 28, 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Rule 5:18(b) states, in relevant part: \u201cThe brief in opposition may include assignments of cross-error and, except in cases of appeals of right to this Court, no cross-error not then assigned will be noticed by this Court.\u201d Hayden and Radiological Associates failed to assign cross-error to the trial court\u2019s failure to rule on their motion for a mistrial as required by Rule 5:18 and, therefore, we will not consider their argument. <em>See Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd. </em>v. <em>Village Grill, </em>217 Va. 632, 636, 231 S.E.2d 327, 330 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict, and will enter final judgment here confirming that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
