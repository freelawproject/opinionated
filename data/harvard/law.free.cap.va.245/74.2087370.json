Newbold, Billy C. Newbold, and Elwanda J. Newbold (collectively, Newbold). At the conclusion of the law firm\u2019s case, the trial court granted Newbold\u2019s motion to strike the law firm\u2019s evidence on the ground that the law firm had failed to establish its corporate existence. The trial court then denied the law firm\u2019s motion to reconsider that ruling and dismissed the case with prejudice. We awarded the law firm an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">When considering a motion to strike a plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the trial court, and this Court, are guided by the same principle: the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Costner </em>v. <em>Lackey, </em>223 Va. 377, 381, 290 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1982). At trial, James C. Brincefield, Jr., testified that he was the president of \u201cBrincefield, Hartnett &amp; Associates, P.C., which is a firm of attorneys located in Alexandria, Virginia;\u201d and that the law firm was the \u201ccorporate successor of the law offices of James C. Brincefield, Jr. and Brincefield and Associates.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This testimony identifies the law firm as a corporation operating in Virginia. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 13.1-544.1 authorizes the use of the abbreviation \u201cP.C.\u201d in the name of a legal entity \u201cto indicate that such corporation is duly organized under, and subject to, the provisions\u201d of the chapter on professional corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In our opinion, based on Brincefield\u2019s testimony, the law firm established a <em>prima facie </em>case of its corporate existence. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred when it granted Newbold\u2019s motion to strike the law firm\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and will remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\"> While no trial transcript was submitted, the trial court\u2019s final order indicated that the affidavits of Mr. Brincefield and of the law firm\u2019s bookkeeper accurately restated and reflected the trial testimony of the affiants.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
