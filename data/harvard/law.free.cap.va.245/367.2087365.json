(New River) as a radio disc jockey and operations manager of Radio Station WPSK in the Town of Pulaski. On that date, New River terminated Knighton\u2019s employment, and the parties entered into a written, noncompetition agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">The agreement provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that, in consideration of $2,000 paid to Knighton by New River, Knighton covenanted that, for a period of 12 months, he would not engage in a business that competed with New River within 60 air miles of New River\u2019s broadcast station. The agreement further provided that, in the event Knighton breached the covenant, New River would be entitled to an injunction restraining him from engaging in the proscribed business. At the time the agreement was executed, a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $2,000 was delivered to Knighton.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">On February 17, 1992, Knighton obtained employment at a radio station in the City of Radford and returned the $2,000 check to New River. The Radford station is located within the 60-mile radius of New River\u2019s station, and both stations play country music and attract the same advertisers. The Radford station is New River\u2019s \u201cmost direct competitor in the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">On February 21, 1992, New River filed a chancery suit seeking to enjoin Knighton from working at the Radford radio station. In his answer, Knighton admitted the material allegations in New River\u2019s bill of complaint but denied that New River was entitled to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>injunction. Additionally, Knighton filed a cross-bill, alleging that the agreement was \u201cunreasonable and oppressive\u201d and, therefore, \u201cvoid and unenforceable.\u201d Knighton sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">The trial court ordered an issue out of chancery, Code \u00a7 8.01-336(E), and the cause, therefore, was tried before a jury. At the conclusion of New River\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial court struck New River\u2019s evidence and allowed the cause to proceed on Knighton\u2019s cross-bill, all over New River\u2019s objection. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Knighton in the amount of $15,000, and the trial court, over New River\u2019s objection, entered judgment on the verdict. New River appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In determining whether a noncompetition agreement is valid and enforceable, we apply the following criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">(1) Is the restraint, from the standpoint of the employer, reasonable in the sense that it is no greater than is necessary to protect the employer in some legitimate business interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">(2) From the standpoint of the employee, is the restraint reasonable in the sense that it is not unduly harsh and oppressive in curtailing his legitimate efforts to earn a livelihood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">(3) Is the restraint reasonable from the standpoint of a sound public policy?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-8\"><em>Roanoke Eng. Sales </em>v. <em>Rosenbaum, </em>223 Va. 548, 552, 290 S.E.2d 882, 884 (1982); <em>accord Blue Ridge Anesthesia </em>v. <em>Gidick, </em>239 Va. 369, 371-72, 389 S.E.2d 467, 468-69 (1990); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Paxton Company, </em>203 Va. 790, 794, 127 S.E.2d 113, 117 (1962). Therefore, a noncompetition agreement that passes this three-part test, \u201cin the light of the facts of each case,\u201d will be enforced in a court of equity. <em>Gidick, </em>239 Va. at 372, 389 S.E.2d at 469; <em>Rosenbaum, </em>223 Va. at 552, 290 S.E.2d at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The facts in the present case are not in dispute. New River owns Radio Station WPSK-FM, a country music radio station that broadcasts primarily in the New River Valley area. The radius of the station\u2019s signal strength is about 60 miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Knighton was New River\u2019s morning announcer and had the highest profile of any of its personalities. New River had \u201cinvested substantial time and money in promoting [Knighton] as an air personality.\u201d Additionally, Knighton supervised other radio announcers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201ccoordinated technical issues\u201d with New River\u2019s engineering staff. He also was involved in developing promotions and contests and in producing commercials. Clearly, Knighton had been a valued employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">From these undisputed facts, we conclude that each of the three criteria has been satisfied. The agreement is reasonable from New River\u2019s standpoint, and it is \u201cno greater than is necessary to protect\u201d New River\u2019s legitimate business interests. The restraint is also reasonable from Knighton\u2019s standpoint. The 60-mile, 12-month limit is not unduly harsh and oppressive in diminishing Knighton\u2019s legitimate efforts to earn a living. Finally, nothing in the record suggests that enforcement of the agreement would be unreasonable from a public-policy standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in ruling that the agreement was void and in refusing to grant the injunction. Therefore, we will reverse the decree and vacate the judgment in favor of Knighton. We will remand the cause to the trial court for entry of a decree enjoining Knighton from violating the noncompetition agreement for a period of 12 months from the date of the entry of the decree, subject to credit for such time as may be due Knighton by reason of the trial court\u2019s entry of a temporary injunction, <em>see Rosenbaum, </em>223 Va. at 556, 290 S.E.2d at 887, and directing New River to pay Knighton the $2,000.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">By order entered March 16, 1992, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to March 2, 1992, the trial court temporarily enjoined Knighton from working at the Radford radio station.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
