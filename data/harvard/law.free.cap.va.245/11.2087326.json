We awarded this appeal to consider whether the trial court properly applied the doctrine of <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone, </em>134 Va. 450, 114 S.E. 652 (1922). According to the doctrine, no party litigant can successfully ask a court or jury to believe that the party\u2019s testimony is untruthful; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>party is bound by statements of fact and necessary inferences flowing from those facts. In other words, when the case depends upon facts within the party\u2019s own knowledge, and as to which the party has testified, the case cannot be made stronger than such party makes it. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 114 S.E. at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">In March 1985, appellant Margaret S. Braden, experienced in the sale of real estate, executed an \u201cIndependent Contractor Agreement\u201d with IsaBell K. Horsley, an Urbanna real estate broker doing business under the corporate name IsaBell K. Horsley Real Estate, Ltd. The parties agreed to become affiliated with each other in the broker\u2019s general real estate business. On June 30, 1986, the broker unilaterally terminated the affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In June 1989, Braden filed the present action against the Horsley corporation for breach of contract. In an amended motion for judgment, the plaintiff alleged that she \u201cbecame employed as a real estate salesperson with\u201d the defendant in March 1985, and that the defendant agreed to compensate the plaintiff according to a certain schedule providing for \u201cCommission Splits.\u201d The schedule allowed for certain percentages of the earned commissions to be divided among the plaintiff, defendant, or \u201cAnother Agent,\u201d depending upon certain contingencies, such as whether the plaintiff sold property upon which she had obtained an authorization to sell (a listing) or whether the plaintiff merely listed property that another agent sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The plaintiff alleged that when defendant \u201cinvoluntarily terminated\u201d the affiliation, the plaintiff \u201chad procured for defendant\u201d four real estate listings from which the plaintiff was to receive a percentage of any commissions earned by defendant when the properties were sold. According to the allegations, the plaintiff was entitled to \u201clisting commissions\u201d on the sales of properties which we shall designate as Greer, Spechio, Johnson, and Sanders Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The plaintiff alleged that \u201cdefendant has failed to pay plaintiff commissions earned by plaintiff during her employment with defendant in regard to her efforts in listing . . . properties while employed by defendant.\u201d The plaintiff sought recovery for the commission amounts as well as other items of expense, which she claimed arose from the affiliation, in the total sum of $44,495.64. Responding, the defendant denied any liability to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>In a November 1991 trial by jury, the court below sustained defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s evidence at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief. The plaintiff appeals from a January 1992 order dismissing the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We will dispose of the claims based upon the Greer, Spechio, and Johnson properties in summary fashion. In each transaction, during her affiliation with defendant and prior to her June 1986 termination, plaintiff had obtained a listing to sell the property. Each transaction closed after the plaintiff had been terminated and, in each case, the listing had expired by its terms before a contract to purchase the property had been executed and before the property had been sold. And, in each instance, a new and separate listing agreement had been obtained by another agent affiliated with defendant and the sale was made under the new listing. Additionally, each new listing agreement made no reference to any renewal of an earlier agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">As the plaintiff observes, the employment agreement between the plaintiff and defendant provided for the plaintiff to share in any commission received from the sale of property even if plaintiff only had listed the property for defendant. As pertinent, the agreement stated: \u201cWhen Salesperson shall perform any service hereunder, whereby a commission is earned, such commission shall, when collected, be divided between Broker and Salesperson.\u201d Also, the employment agreement was silent regarding the effect on commissions of the expiration of an original listing agreement and subsequent relisting by another agent. But the employment agreement also provided that, after termination of the agreement, \u201call listings of Broker\u2019s office of real estate for sale and lease during such affiliation shall be the property of Broker.\u201d Additionally, a statement of \u201cCompany Policy\u201d incorporated in the employment agreement provided: \u201cIf an Agent leaves the Company, all listings become the property of the Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Given the contract provisions and the facts of the three transactions, we hold that the trial court properly ruled, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff had not established prima facie that she was entitled to share the commissions received by defendant for the sales of the Greer, Spechio, and Johnson properties. The plaintiff has not furnished any basis, either from the evidence or from the terms of the various contracts, that would entitle her to share commissions from sales made upon new and independent listings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>purchase contracts, all of which were negotiated by other salespersons after termination of her affiliation with defendant and after the original listings had expired. Contrary to the plaintiffs contention, there was no credible evidence that the plaintiff, by procuring the original listings, had set in course a chain of events that resulted in the payment of commissions to the defendant for its listing of the three properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">We now turn to a discussion of the Sanders Bay transaction; the chronology of events displays a different pattern from the other three transactions. The sale of the Sanders Bay property, a 24-acre parcel on the Rappahannock River near White Stone, was consummated within the term of the original listing obtained by the plaintiff, but the contract of purchase was executed and the closing occurred after the plaintiffs affiliation with defendant had ended. Specifically, two listings (one for the land and another for townhouses to be built on the land) were dated May 15, 1986 to expire November 30, 1987. After the plaintiff\u2019s affiliation terminated on June 30, 1986, a contract for the purchase of the property was executed on September 9, 1986. Closing of the transaction occurred on September 25, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Significantly, both listing agreements included the following provision, \u201cNOTE: This contract subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.\u201d For clarity, we shall treat the two listing agreements as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">During cross-examination of the plaintiff, the defendant sought to obtain an admission that no valid listing agreement existed with the owners of Sanders Bay because the bankruptcy court never approved the listing. Thus, according to defendant, plaintiff \u201cdid not obtain a listing, did not procure a purchaser, did not negotiate a contract and, in sum, played no part in the sale of Sanders Bay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Plaintiff was asked repeatedly if she knew whether the bankruptcy court ever approved the listing. The plaintiff answered the queries differently. At one point, she said that she \u201chad to assume\u201d it was approved \u201csince\u201d Horsley \u201cnever told me any differently.\u201d At another point, the plaintiff responded, \u201cI assumed that it was approved because of Mrs. Horsley. I had no reason to question it.\u201d Later, she stated, \u201cI had no knowledge that it had not been approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Counsel for defendant referred the plaintiff to her discovery deposition taken about eight months before trial. Plaintiff conceded that she answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question, \u201cAre you aware of whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>not it [the listing agreement] was ever approved by the bankruptcy court?\u201d When asked again whether she remembered being asked the deposition question, she responded, \u201cI assumed it was.\u201d Upon being reminded that the answer was not responsive to the question in that the trial question merely was whether she recalled saying \u201cNo\u201d to the deposition question, the plaintiff answered at trial, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t recall it.\u201d At another point, plaintiff said she \u201cmust have misunderstood\u201d counsel during the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">During cross-examination, counsel for defendant also referred the plaintiff to a letter (not a part of the record on appeal) apparently written by the plaintiff to the state \u201cReal Estate Commission\u201d about the Sanders Bay transaction. Plaintiff admitted that she wrote: \u2018 \u2018Also, to my knowledge, these listings were never approved by the bankruptcy court.\u201d The plaintiff explained during her testimony, however, that she was \u201csaying that\u201d only after she heard Horsley make such a statement. The plaintiff also stated that, although she had \u201cgone on record with the state agency\u201d that to her knowledge the listing agreement \u201cwas not a valid listing,\u201d she nevertheless thought at the time she wrote the letter that the listing was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Finally, during cross-examination, the plaintiff was asked whether her \u201canswer today\u201d is that she \u201cassumed\u201d the listing had received court approval, she responded, \u201cYes, because [Horsley] was saying it was an exclusive.\u201d Then the plaintiff answered \u201cNo\u201d to the trial question whether she had \u201cany knowledge that it was ever approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In comments made when sustaining the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the Sanders Bay claim, the trial judge referred to the deposition testimony and the letter. The court applied <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Firmstone, </em>stating \u201cthere was no dispute\u201d that the plaintiff believed that the listing was invalid. This was error; plaintiff\u2019s statements do not preclude her from asserting that the listing agreement is valid and that she is entitled to a listing commission under it. Rather, the jury should have been permitted to evaluate the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as a whole, taken together with all the other evidence in the case, in deciding whether plaintiff was entitled to the commission under her contract with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The <em>Massie </em>doctrine applies only to a party litigant\u2019s statements of fact that are within the litigant\u2019s own knowledge, and not to statements of opinion. <em>Erlich </em>v. <em>Hendrick Constr. Co., </em>217 Va. 108, 114, 225 S.E.2d 665, 669 (1976). The doctrine does not apply to statements made by a party concerning matters beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>party\u2019s realm of knowledge, <em>Charlton </em>v. <em>Craddock-Terry Shoe Corp., </em>235 Va. 485, 489, 369 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1988), to equivocal statements, <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>193 Va. 555, 560-61, 69 S.E.2d 424, 428-29 (1952), or to adverse statements considered in isolation from a party\u2019s testimony as a whole, <em>Travis </em>v. <em>Bulifant, 226 </em>Va. 1, 5, 306 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">In the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s deposition statements and the statement in the letter may not be viewed in isolation from her whole testimony at trial. When ruling on the motion to strike, the trial court was bound to view that trial testimony, which was equivocal, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Thus viewed, the testimony supported a conclusion that the listing was valid, particularly in light of evidence presented by the plaintiff which established that the property was actually sold and that the defendant received a sales commission of $28,858.65. A legitimate inference from that fact alone is that the bankruptcy court must have approved the listing as a predicate for payment of a commission on the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Moreover, many of the plaintiff\u2019s statements at trial were mere expressions of opinion or were statements of fact that were not within her own knowledge. Repeatedly, she stated that she \u201cassumed\u201d the listing had been approved but said that she had no \u2018 \u2018knowledge\u2019 \u2019 that it was ever approved. In sum, this is the classic example of a case in which the <em>Massie </em>rule should not have been applied. <em>See TransiLift Equipment, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>234 Va. 84, 94-95, 360 S.E.2d 183, 189 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Consequently, the trial court\u2019s judgment as it relates to the Greer, Spechio, and Johnson transactions will be affirmed. The judgment as it relates to the Sanders Bay transaction will be reversed and the case will be remanded for a new trial limited to the plaintiff\u2019s claim arising from that transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
