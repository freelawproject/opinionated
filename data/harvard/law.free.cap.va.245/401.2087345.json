Carter was stationed at the front entrance of a house in the City of Richmond while other police officers were executing a search warrant for drugs inside the house. As Carter stood at the front entrance making sure that no one entered or left the house during the search, he noticed a car being driven slowly by the house and at least one of its passengers looking in Carter\u2019s direction. After passing the house, the driver stopped the car, and one passenger exited and walked up the street toward the house. Just after the former passenger turned \u201cto come to the front door,\u201d he \u201clooked right straight at\u201d Carter from a distance of about 12 feet. Carter recognized him as Jimmie Hugene Woodson, Sr. (Woodson, Sr.), a former police officer \u201cnow convicted of drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Although Carter said \u2018 \u2018there is no need to walk away, Mr. Wood-son,\u201d Woodson, Sr. \u201cthen rapidly turned\u201d and walked away from the house and the car. Carter was not in uniform, but he pulled his police badge, which he wore around his neck, to the outside of his shirt and walked over to the vehicle. Carter had his automatic pistol in his right hand \u201cdown to [his] right side.\u201d Carter knew that the police were still looking for one person connected with the events leading to the issuance of the search warrant. As Carter walked to the driver\u2019s door, he said \u201cPolice Officer. Gentlemen, put your hands where I can see them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Both passengers immediately complied, but Jimmie Hugene Woodson, Jr. (Woodson), the driver, turned to his right and bent down to his right side. Carter could not see \u201cwhat he was grabbing for,\u201d but when Carter opened the car door, Woodson had a large revolver in his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Carter grabbed Woodson\u2019s right arm with his left hand, held his own pistol against Woodson\u2019s neck with his other hand, and told Woodson that if he did not drop the revolver, he, Carter, would shoot him. Woodson dropped the revolver to the floor, but continued to struggle as he tried to get his hand in his right front pants pocket. Carter called for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>As Detective P.H. Brunson entered the front passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle, Carter observed that Woodson again had his hand \u201cback down in the floorboard,\u201d and Brunson noticed that Woodson had his hand on the butt of the gun. Additional police officers were required to remove Woodson from the car and then handcuff his hands behind his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">During the struggle, Detective J.E. King noticed that Woodson kept trying to reach into his right pants pocket before he was handcuffed. As King \u201cwent to check\u201d this pocket after Woodson was handcuffed, Woodson said, \u201cOkay. I am an addict. You have got me. It is in my right front pocket.\u201d When King reached into that pocket, he retrieved a small, self-sealing plastic bag, which contained \u201ca $20.00 bill folded that had white powder inside of the $20.00 bill.\u201d The powder later was determined to be cocaine. Officer John Bukavich, another officer who assisted in subduing Woodson, found a small amount of marijuana in Woodson\u2019s right front shirt pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Woodson was charged with: (1) possession of marijuana; (2) possession of cocaine; (3) obstructing Carter in the performance of his duties as a police officer; and (4) possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine. A jury convicted Woodson of the first three charges, and judgment was entered on those verdicts. Woodson appealed these convictions to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed. <em>Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 787, 421 S.E.2d 1 (1992). We awarded Woodson this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Woodson contends that the cocaine and marijuana were inadmissible in evidence because they were the fruit of an unreasonable seizure of his person in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. As noted previously, we must first determine <em>when </em>Woodson was \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The Commonwealth relies upon <em>California </em>v. <em>Hodari </em>D.,_ U.S._, 111 S.Ct. 1547 (1991). In <em>Hodari D., </em>a police officer did not have the requisite reasonable suspicion that Hodari was engaged in some criminal activity when the police officer attempted to stop and question him. Yet the cocaine which Hodari discarded while fleeing from the police officer was properly admitted in evidence. The Supreme Court justified its admission upon two grounds: (1) that the drugs were abandoned by Hodari and lawfully recovered by the police, and (2) that the police officer\u2019s observation of \u201cthe rock of cocaine, at least if he recognized it as such, would provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>reasonable suspicion for the unquestioned seizure when he tackled Hodari.\u201d_U.S. at_,111 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Hodari relied, and Woodson relies, upon <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544 (1980), in arguing that there had been a seizure of their persons in violation of the Fourth Amendment. According to <em>Mendenhall, </em>\u201c[a] person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment <em>only if, </em>in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">However, as the Court noted in <em>Hodari D., </em>the <em>Mendenhall </em>language \u2018 \u2018 \u2018only if\u2019 . . . states a <em>necessary, </em>but not a <em>sufficient </em>condition ... for [a Fourth Amendment] seizure effected through a \u2018show of authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hodari </em>D.,_U.S. at_, 111 S.Ct. at 1551 (emphasis in original). And because Hodari did not submit to the police officer\u2019s \u201cshow of authority\u201d but fled from the officer, the Supreme Court held that he was not seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the issue in <em>Hodari D. </em>was not what a reasonable person would have assumed under the circumstances, but what the accused actually did in response to the police officer\u2019s show of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Claiming that he was seized when Carter ordered him to place his hands where Carter could see them, Woodson attempts to distinguish <em>Hodari D. </em>on the ground that he was confined to the vehicle and that it is reasonable to assume that, had he attempted to leave the vehicle, Carter would have seized him by physical force. However, Woodson overlooks the fact that he had armed himself, and this gave rise to an inference that he did so to resist any effort by Carter to restrain his movement. And in deciding whether Woodson submitted to Carter\u2019s order, we see no essential difference between Woodson\u2019s act in arming himself and Hodari\u2019s act in fleeing from the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Thus, as in <em>Hodari D., </em>because Woodson did not submit to Carter\u2019s command, we must focus upon what Woodson did, not what a reasonable person would have assumed under the circumstances. Considered in that light, it is apparent that Woodson had not been seized when Carter ordered him to place his hands where Carter could see them because Woodson did not submit to Carter\u2019s authority; instead, he armed himself with the apparent intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>shooting Carter. And when Woodson did this, he provided the requisite reasonable suspicion of criminal activity that justified his seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Accordingly, Woodson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated thereafter when the cocaine and marijuana were discovered during the search incident to that seizure. <em>U.S. v. Waupekenay, </em>973 F.2d 1533, 1537 (10th Cir. 1992); <em>U.S. v. Bailey, </em>691 F.2d 1009, 1016-1018 (11th Cir. 1982) (police may arrest for \u201cnew, distinct crime\u201d by defendant in response to unlawful police conduct). Therefore, the cocaine and marijuana were properly admitted in evidence. <em>Bailey </em>at 1018-1019. And because Woodson\u2019s statements that he was an \u201caddict\u201d and that \u201c[i]t [the cocaine] is in my right front pocket\u201d provide ample justification for a finding of his knowing and intentional possession of the cocaine, we find no merit in Woodson\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Finally, we consider Woodson\u2019s conviction for attempting to impede Detective Carter in the performance of his duties. Former Code \u00a7 18.2-460(A) (1988) (now Code \u00a7 18.2-460(B) (Cum. Supp. 1992)) provided that \u201c[i]f any person, by threats, or force, knowingly attempts to intimidate or impede . . . any law-enforcement officer, lawfully engaged in his duties as such, ... he shall be deemed to be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d Woodson claims that he cannot be convicted of this charge because he \u201cwas not under arrest and was not the target of any investigation by Detective Carter\u201d and, therefore, had the right to \u201cresist an unlawful arrest.\u201d Here, however, the evidence was sufficient to justify the jury\u2019s conclusion that Carter was readily identifiable as a police officer, that he was attempting to question Woodson peacefully and without unnecessary force, and that Woodson armed himself with the intent to shoot Carter, if need be, to avoid submission to Carter\u2019s authority. Under those circumstances, the jury reasonably could have concluded that Woodson forfeited whatever right he had to resist Carter. <em>See Banner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 640, 647, 133 S.E.2d 305, 310 (1963) (\u201cAn illegal arrest of itself would not give the defendant the right to shoot or take the officer\u2019s life\u201d). Accordingly, we are of opinion that the evidence supports Woodson\u2019s conviction for attempting to impede Carter in the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">For these reasons, we will affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\"> The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>JUSTICE LACY,</author>\n<p id=\"A0d\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Woodson\u2019s appeal is premised on his assertion that the entire chain of events flowed from Officer Carter\u2019s approach of the Woodson vehicle. That approach, Woodson argues, was illegal under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, 392 </em>U.S. 1 (1968), because Officer Carter did not have any reasonable suspicion that Woodson was engaged in criminal activity. Although not addressed by the majority, this premise is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Woodson confuses a <em>Terry </em>investigatory stop with a police officer\u2019s right to approach individuals and ask questions. <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983); <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 191, 196-97, 413 S.E.2d 645, 648 (1992). In a <em>Terry </em>stop, the officer has the right to approach and detain individuals because he has a reasonable suspicion that they are engaging in some type of criminal activity. Here, Carter, like any police officer, had the right to approach a car parked on a public street for investigation purposes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Woodson is correct, however, that Carter\u2019s subsequent action ordering the vehicle\u2019s occupants to put their hands where he could see them, extends beyond mere inquiry. This demand was a show of authority reflecting Carter\u2019s intent to stop, detain, or seize the occupants of the Woodson vehicle. At that point, the encounter was within the category of an investigatory stop under <em>Terry. </em>Nevertheless, whether Carter had the requisite reasonable suspicion to make this demand is relevant only if, in fact, Carter\u2019s command constituted a seizure as Woodson contends. As concluded by the majority, Woodson was not seized until after he had reached for his gun. Carter\u2019s actions were clearly justified at that point, and did not violate Woodson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Woodson asserts that his conviction for obstruction of justice was improper because he had acted lawfully in the exercise of his right to resist an illegal arrest rather than to impede justice. This argument is also based on a flawed premise: that the only obstruction activity was Woodson\u2019s resistance to an allegedly unlawful arrest. As discussed above, there was no arrest until after the obstructive act, <em>i.e., </em>Woodson grabbing for his gun, and, therefore, the subsequent arrest was not illegal. Furthermore, Woodson forfeited whatever right he had to resist arrest prior to this point, as noted by the majority, by his chosen method of resistance. <em>Banner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 640, 647, 133 S.E.2d 305, 310 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>As the Commonwealth argued, Carter was involved in the execution of a search warrant and, as part of that duty, he was entitled to question other persons in the vicinity regarding the known criminal activity at the house. Carter had a right to approach the parked vehicle in discharging his duties of investigation. Woodson\u2019s actions in arming himself and \u201cfailing to cooperate\u201d with that investigation support the jury\u2019s finding that Woodson intended to, and did, impede Carter\u2019s investigation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
