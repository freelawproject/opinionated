Krantz filed an action at law' against Richard W. Nottke and Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), a labor union, to recover damages for their intentional interference with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>prospective contract as a pilot with United Airlines. Nottke, a resident of New York, who was served with process under the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over his person. Judge Thomas A. Fortkort sustained Nottke\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Later, Judge Jack B. Stevens sustained ALPA\u2019s demurrer that raised the preemption issue. Krantz appeals both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Because Krantz\u2019 action was dismissed without reaching the merits, we consider as true all the material facts properly pleaded in his motion for judgment, all facts impliedly alleged, and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from such facts. <em>Cox Cable Hampton Roads, Inc. v. City of Norfolk, </em>242 Va. 394, 397, 410 S.E.2d 652, 653 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Krantz, an airline pilot and ALPA member living in Vermont, participated in a strike against his employer, Eastern Airlines. However, Krantz later withdrew from the strike, applied for a job with United, and placed his name on the \u201crecall\u201d list at Eastern.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Upon Krantz\u2019 withdrawal from the strike, ALPA placed his name on a \u201cscab\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> list that contained the names of all Eastern pilots who did not support ALPA\u2019s strike at Eastern. The scab list was posted on various bulletin boards in a computer center electronic switchboard system (ACCESS) operated by ALPA from its offices in Herndon, Virginia. ACCESS is a closed computer communications system; ALPA members and staff with the necessary passwords are the only persons who could use ACCESS for communicating with ALPA members, broadcasting messages to various ALPA councils, and posting messages on various \u201cbulletin boards and forums.\u201d ALPA controls the contents of any such messages and removes any messages it deems inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">After a successful job interview with United, Krantz was given the impression that he would be hired, and United advised him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>he would be called soon for a final interview. On September 15, 1989, the day after Krantz\u2019 initial interview, Nottke, an Eastern pilot and ALPA member, recorded a message derogatory to Krantz on Nottke\u2019s personal computer in New York. In an attempt to prevent Krantz\u2019 employment by United, Nottke advised his fellow union members at United and elsewhere of Krantz\u2019 interview at United and urged them to \u201cPASS THE WORD\u201d that Krantz had withdrawn from the strike and was a \u201cscab.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Nottke then transmitted his message electronically to ACCESS. As a result of the publication of Nottke\u2019s message and ALPA\u2019S scab list, United received over 300 adverse comments about Krantz at its Flight Officer Employment Office in Denver, Colorado. Consequently, United terminated its negotiations with Krantz.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The strike later ended on November 22, 1989. Some time after the strike ended, in further retaliation for the failure of Krantz and other Eastern pilots to support the strike against Eastern, ALPA sought to prevent their future employment as pilots by printing 50,000 copies of its final Eastern scab list or \u201cblacklist\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and distributing them to all airlines, air freight carriers, and pilot training organizations. As a result of ALPA\u2019s publication of this blacklist, Krantz has been unable to obtain employment as an airline pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>Applicability of Long-Arm Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">First, we consider whether Nottke is within the reach of Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(3), the long-arm statute. In doing so, we recognize that \u201cthe function of our long-arm statute is to assert jurisdiction over nonresidents who engage in some purposeful activity in Virginia, to the extent permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Nan Ya Plastics Corp. </em>v. <em>DeSantis, </em>237 Va. 255, 259, 377 S.E.2d 388, 391, <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. 921 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">To resolve this issue, we first consider the elements of the asserted cause of action to determine the scope of the statute. The elements of a tortious interference with a contract are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">(1) the existence of a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy; (2) knowledge of the relationship or expectancy on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the part of the interferor; (3) intentional interference inducing or causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy; and (4) resultant damage to the party whose relationship or expectancy has been disrupted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><em>Chaves v. Johnson, </em>230 Va. 112, 120, 335 S.E.2d 97, 102 (1985). We are concerned with whether Nottke\u2019s activities in New York satisfied the third element of this tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In support of his claim that he committed no act in Virginia that subjects him to Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(3), Nottke cites a number of cases in which fraudulent or defamatory statements were generated in a foreign state and transmitted by telephone or mail to the forum state. In those cases, the courts decided that such activities were not \u201cacts\u201d in the forum jurisdiction within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(3) or an identical statute of another jurisdiction. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Costa-Gavras, </em>580 F.Supp. 1082, 1087 (S.D.N.Y. 1984); <em>St. Clair v. Righter, </em>250 F.Supp. 148, 150-51 (W.D. Va. 1966); <em>Weller v. Cromwell Oil Co., </em>504 F.2d 927, 931 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Margoles </em>v. <em>Johns, </em>483 F.2d 1212, 1221 (D.C. Cir. 1973). In these cases, the nonresidents may have completed their tortious acts in the foreign jurisdictions, although the damage occurred in some other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We need not decide whether those courts correctly limited the applicable long-arm statutes because we are dealing with a communication that alone was not a tortious act; some further act was required in the forum state to complete Nottke\u2019s act of tortiously interfering with Krantz\u2019 prospective contract. Specifically, the entry of Nottke\u2019s message on his computer in New York was only the beginning of his plan to block Krantz\u2019 employment. To execute his plan, Nottke needed other persons to communicate his message to United, Krantz\u2019 prospective employer. He intended those persons to be fellow ALPA members, especially United pilots, who, at Nottke\u2019s request, would transmit negative comments about Krantz to United and thereby block Krantz\u2019 prospective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Without the use of ACCESS, a Virginia facility, Nottke could not have obtained those recruits, and there would have been no interference with Krantz\u2019 prospective contract, the third required element for a <em>prima facie </em>showing of this tort. <em>Chaves, </em>230 Va. at 120, 335 S.E.2d at 102. Thus, Nottke\u2019s use of ACCESS in Virginia as a means of furthering his plan to block Krantz\u2019 employment was \u201can act . . . in this Commonwealth\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>This brings us to the question whether our construction of Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1(A)(3) would offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)). <em>See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 471-72 (1985). In our opinion, the facts alleged indicate that Nottke has engaged in a purposeful activity in Virginia, and has had the minimum contact necessary for Krantz to maintain his action in the Commonwealth. <em>See Keeton </em>v. <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>465 U.S. 770, 779 (1984) (transmitting libelous material into foreign state injuring nonresident plaintiff); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Erwin-Wasey, Inc., </em>460 F.2d 661, 664 (1st Cir. 1972) (telephoning and mailing intentionally deceptive material from foreign jurisdiction into forum state).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Accordingly, we hold that subjecting Nottke to the personal jurisdiction of a Virginia court does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d Therefore, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Nottke for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>Preemption Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Next, we consider ALPA\u2019s contention that federal law preempts Krantz\u2019 common-law right to sue ALPA for its alleged tortious interference with his prospective employment with United. In doing so, we bear in mind that if Congress has not stated explicitly that state law is preempted, courts will sustain a state cause of action \u201cunless it conflicts with federal law or would frustrate the federal scheme, or unless the courts discern from the totality of the circumstances that Congress sought to occupy the field to the exclusion of the States.\u201d <em>Malone v. White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504 (1978) (administration of employee pension plans). <em>See Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 23 (1987) (state employment benefit plan not preempted by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In this case, we are presented with a union\u2019s retaliatory conduct against a member who withdrew from the strike and was seeking employment from a stranger to the strike. The conduct in question took place both during and after the strike. Although the record does not disclose the period after the strike in which ALPA continued to publish its scab list or blacklist, at oral argument, counsel for Krantz and ALPA indicated that ALPA continued publication for 14 months after the strike ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ALPA contends that there is no time restriction upon the publication of its blacklist. Indeed, in oral argument, its counsel opined that it could use this form of \u201cself help\u201d 140 months after the strike ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">And according to ALPA, blacklisting is not expressly \u201caddressed\u201d by federal law, but such conduct that \u201cfalls within the broad area as to which [the Railway Labor Act] requires uniformity of regulation. That broad area includes, in particular, strike-related conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Initially, we do not agree that blacklisting is not \u201caddressed\u201d by federal law. A number of federal cases, brought under the NLRA, have addressed the issue of a union\u2019s retaliatory blacklisting of an employee in an attempt to restrict or prevent the employee\u2019s future employment. Indeed, some of these cases involve blacklisting in retaliation for the employee\u2019s nonsupport of a strike, as in this case, and they indicate that such blacklisting is <em>proscribed </em>by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) (1988). <em>Pacific American Shipowners Ass\u2019n, </em>98 N.L.R.B. at 586, 639-40; <em>see Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. </em>v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, </em>485 U.S. 568, 581 n.5 (1988); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>759 F.2d 1161, 1170 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 946 (1985); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Bell Aircraft Corp., </em>206 F.2d 235, 236-37 (2d Cir. 1953); <em>Western Gillette, Inc., </em>201 N.L.R.B. 662 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Moreover, ALPA cites no cases in which preemption has been applied to state court actions such as this one. It argues nonetheless that publication of its scab list is a part of the \u201cself-help\u201d activities countenanced in <em>Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>394 U.S. 369 (1969) and <em>Peterson, </em>759 F.2d at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">However, neither <em>Jacksonville Terminal </em>nor <em>Peterson </em>supports ALPA\u2019S position.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Jacksonville Terminal </em>involved conduct (secondary picketing) that is recognized by federal law. And <em>Peterson </em>simply stands for the proposition that in cases where a plaintiff asserts a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>federally protected employee\u2019s right, his remedy for the violation of that right is limited to that provided by federal law. Because he was only an <em>applicant </em>for employment, Krantz has no federally protected right. <em>See Nelson v. Piedmont Aviation, Inc., </em>750 F.2d 1234, 1237 (4th Cir. 1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1116 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">We have considered the federal policy proscribing such blacklisting, the fact that Krantz has no remedy under federal law, and the interest of the states in protecting citizens\u2019 legitimate employment rights. And we fail to see that state enforcement of Krantz\u2019 cause of action against ALPA will conflict with federal law, frustrate the federal scheme, or enter into a field that Congress sought to occupy to the exclusion of the states, in violation of the principle articulated in <em>Malone, </em>435 U.S. at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining ALPA\u2019S demurrer on the grounds of preemption. Therefore, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In conformity with our ruling on the issues involved here, we will remand the case against Nottke and ALPA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> Code \u00a7 8.01-328.1 (A) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">(3) [clausing tortious injury by an act or omission in this Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-12\"> A \u201cscab\u201d is variously defined as a \u201cmean, contemptible person: SCOUNDREL\u201d and \u201ca member of a union who refuses to strike or returns to work before a strike has ended.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2022 <em>(1986).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\"> If a list of non-striking employees is disseminated by a union to prospective employers of any of the non-strikers, it is also described as a blacklist. <em>Pacific American Shipowners Ass'n, </em>98 N.L.R.B. 582, 586 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> Nor do the other cases cited by ALPA support its contention. <em>Lodge </em>76, <em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>427 U.S. 132 (1976) (unsuccessful attempt by employer to invoke state unfair labor practice statute as bargaining tool in unresolved labor dispute); <em>Guss v.
