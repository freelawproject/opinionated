This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">On March 27, 1991, appellant Sandra L. Renner filed a motion for judgment against appellees James H. Stafford, Jr., M.D., John H. Lowder, M.D., and their professional corporation, Winchester Women\u2019s Specialists. The plaintiff alleged that she had been Stafford\u2019s patient for \u201cobstetric care.\u201d She asserted that during the course of treatment, he prescribed \u201cthe drug Danocrine for endometriosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The plaintiff alleged that she \u201cdid not have endometriosis\u201d and that the defendants \u201cdeviated from the accepted standard of medical care in making the diagnosis of endometriosis and instituting a protracted course of Danocrine therapy.\u201d She further alleged that in \u201cJanuary 1989,\u201d she \u201cdeveloped pseudotumor cerebri (benign) and intracranial hypertension secondary to the Danocrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Additionally, the plaintiff alleged that as a proximate result \u201cof the deviation from the accepted standard of medical care,\u201d she \u201cdeveloped intracranial pressure, diplopia, papilledema and headaches as well as other numerous acute and chronic problems.\u201d She also asserted that she had incurred \u2018 \u2018unnecessary medical expenses, pain and suffering, both physical and mental,\u201d for which she sought recovery in damages against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>In an \u201canswer and grounds of defense,\u201d the defendants denied the material allegations of the motion for judgment. Later, after the plaintiff had responded to 62 requests for admissions propounded by the defendants, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment asserting the bar of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">In that motion, the defendants noted that the plaintiff, on November 30, 1990, \u201cappropriately\u201d had filed a notice of claim pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-581.2, a provision of the Medical Malpractice Act. The defendants asserted, however, relying on the responses to requests for admissions, that the defendants undertook a continuous course of treatment of the plaintiff that ended at the latest \u201cin the early part of November, 1988.\u201d Therefore, according to the summary judgment motion, the November 30, 1990 notice tolling the applicable two-year statute of limitations was untimely, and the action is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">According to the defendants, the \u201cPlaintiff contends that her alleged injury from the Danocrine was not discovered until early January, 1989.\u201d Nonetheless, the defendants asserted, the statute of limitations began to run, at the latest, from a date in early November 1988, when plaintiff\u2019s Danocrine treatment ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Following a hearing at which the trial court considered the pleadings, the responses to requests for admissions, and the argument of counsel, the court granted the motion for summary judgment, finding \u2018 \u2018that the applicable Statute of Limitations has lapsed as to these Defendants.\u201d We awarded the plaintiff an appeal from an April 1992 order dismissing the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A trial court may enter summary judgment only if no material fact is genuinely in dispute. Rule 3:18. The summary judgment rules and the discovery rules, while not intended to substitute a new method for trial when an issue of fact exists, were adopted to permit trial courts to end litigation at an early stage provided it <em>clearly </em>appears that one of the parties is entitled to a judgment in the case as made out by the pleadings and the parties\u2019 admissions. <em>Carson </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>245 Va. 135, 139-40, 427 S.E.2d 189, 192 (1993). But a trial court, in considering a motion for summary judgment, must adopt those inferences from the facts that are most favorable to the nonmoving party, unless such inferences are strained, forced, or contrary to reason. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, the trial court is not permitted to adopt inferences from the facts that are most favorable to the moving party.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>On appeal, the defendants maintain that the trial court correctly granted the motion for summary judgment. They note that every action for personal injuries must be brought \u201cwithin two years after the cause of action accrues,\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-243(A). They point to Code \u00a7 8.01-230, which provides that a \u201ccause of action shall be deemed to accrue and the prescribed limitation period shall begin to run from the date the injury is sustained in the case of injury to the person . . . and not when the resulting damage is discovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The defendants then embark on a detailed analysis of the plaintiff\u2019s responses to the requests for admissions and put their own interpretation on the facts to posit a theory of recovery that is at odds with the plaintiff\u2019s theory set forth in the motion for judgment. A recital of the facts contained in the responses is unnecessary; it is sufficient to state that the defendants rely upon plaintiff\u2019s admissions that she continued to suffer menstrual cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding while under Stafford\u2019s care to conclude that plaintiff suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d between October 1987 and early November 1988 when Stafford was prescribing the \u201cdanocrine therapy.\u201d But that is not the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and neither the motion for judgment nor the plaintiff\u2019s responses to requests for admissions \u201cclearly\u201d establishes that to be the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">According to the plaintiff, she is not alleging that defendants were negligent in failing to alleviate the problems for which Stafford initially undertook to treat her, namely, menstrual cramps and heavy menstrual bleeding. Rather, plaintiff argues, her allegations of fact furnish a basis for a finding, based upon medical evidence yet to be presented, (1) that Stafford negligently prescribed medication (Danocrine) inappropriate for the plaintiff\u2019s condition, (2) that the prolonged use of this medication caused plaintiff to develop conditions such as pseudotumor cerebri and intracranial hypertension, and (3) that such conditions did not occur until January 1989. This date, the plaintiff contends, was when she was \u201cinjured,\u201d when the cause of action accrued, and when the statute of limitations began to run. We agree with the plaintiff that her allegations properly may be so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In determining when the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d was sustained, the crucial question in cases like this, when the date of the wrongful act possibly does not coincide with the date of the resulting harm to the plaintiff, is: When was the plaintiff hurt? The answer to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>question must be found mainly in the medical evidence. <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp., </em>221 Va. 951, 958-59, 275 S.E.2d 900, 905 (1981). <em>See Scarpa </em>v. <em>Melzig, </em>237 Va. 509, 379 S.E.2d 307 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Here, given the circumstance that the medical evidence supporting the plaintiff\u2019s theory has not been developed fully, the record is incomplete on that question, and the trial court prematurely ruled on the issue. Manifestly, there are material facts genuinely in dispute. The plaintiff is entitled to prove, if she can, that she sustained no \u201cinjury,\u201d no \u201cpositive, physical or mental hurt,\u201d in the language of <em>Locke, </em>221 Va. at 957, 275 S.E.2d at 904, until January 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment; it will be annulled and the case will be remanded for further proceedings, without prejudice to the defendants\u2019 right to reassert the bar of the statute of limitations after full development of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
