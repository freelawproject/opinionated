Vol.). It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">A. As used in this section, a \u201cpreferred provider subscription contract\u2019 \u2019 is a contract that specifies how services are to be covered when rendered by providers participating in a plan, by nonparticipating providers, and by preferred providers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">B. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-4218 and 38.2-4221, any nonstock corporation may, as a feature of its plan, offer preferred provider subscription contracts pursuant to the requirements of this section that limit the numbers and types of providers of health care services eligible for payment as preferred providers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">C. Any such nonstock corporation shall establish terms and conditions that shall be met by a hospital, physician or other type of provider listed in \u00a7 38.2-4221 in order to qualify for payment as a preferred provider under the subscription contracts. These terms and conditions shall not discriminate unreasonably against or among health care providers. No hospital, physician or type of provider listed in \u00a7 38.2-4221 willing to meet the terms and conditions offered to it or him shall be excluded. Differences in prices among hospitals or other institutional providers produced by a process of individual negotiations with the providers or based on market conditions, or price differences among providers in different geographical areas shall not be deemed unreasonable discrimination.

Mandated types of providers listed in \u00a7 38.2-4221 and types of providers whose services are required to be made available and which have been specifically contracted for by the holder of any subscription contract shall, to the extent required by \u00a7 38.2-4221, have the same opportunity as do doctors of medicine to qualify for payment as preferred providers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">E. Preferred provider subscription contracts shall provide for payment for services rendered by nonpreferred providers, but the payments need not be the same as for preferred providers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">St. Mary\u2019s Hospital of Richmond, Inc. (St. Mary\u2019s), filed a bill of complaint against Blue Cross, alleging that Blue Cross discriminated against St. Mary\u2019s in the negotiation of a preferred provider subscription contract and seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief. St. Mary\u2019s asked the trial court to declare that Blue Cross had violated Code \u00a7 38.2-4209(C) and to enjoin any future violations of the statute. St. Mary\u2019s also asked the court to order Blue Cross to establish terms and conditions that St. Mary\u2019s could meet in order to qualify as a preferred provider and to accept St. Mary\u2019s as such a provider. Blue Cross, by its answer, denied that it had discriminated against St. Mary\u2019s or had violated the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-4209(C). Blue Cross also asserted, as an affirmative defense, that ERISA preempted St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The trial court, following a four-day <em>ore terms </em>hearing, ruled that (1) the requirements of Code \u00a7 38.2-4209 were not preempted by ERISA, and (2) Blue Cross had not violated Code \u00a7 38.2-4209(C) either in its initial offer of terms and conditions to St. Mary\u2019s or in its subsequent negotiations with St. Mary\u2019s. However, because the five-year terms of certain new preferred provider subscription contracts exceeded the three-year period set forth in Blue Cross\u2019 initial proposal, the trial court enjoined Blue Cross from operating the PPO in the Area after April 30, 1994, the expiration date of the initial proposed three-year term. Both Blue Cross and St. Mary\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">As part of the operation of its health services plan, Blue Cross markets a PPO, under the name of \u201cKeyCare,\u201d in various areas of the Commonwealth. The PPO consists of a network of health care providers who have contracted to render care at discounted rates and is designed to contain health care costs. The KeyCare plan is not available to individual subscribers directly, but is available only to employee groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Blue Cross encourages patients to use preferred providers by imposing a penalty of approximately 30% on patients who use non-preferred providers. Although patients have the right to choose their providers, a patient who receives services from a non-preferred provider must pay the additional charge therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The incentive for becoming a preferred provider is an anticipated increase in patient volume. Consequently, in order for a PPO to be successful, the network of providers must be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">For a number of years, Blue Cross has offered its KeyCare PPO to employee groups in the Area. Effective April 30, 1991, however, all prior subscription contracts were to expire. Therefore, Blue Cross had to establish a new network of preferred providers (PPO I) and enter into new contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Consequently, on December 11, 1990, Blue Cross sent its PPO I proposal to all acute care, psychiatric, and specialty care hospitals in the Area. The proposal consisted of a \u201cPPO I Network Hospital Agreement\u201d and a cover letter transmitting the proposal. In the cover letter, Blue Cross notified each hospital that (1) acceptance of the proposal without modification on or before January 25, 1991, would guarantee a hospital\u2019s inclusion in the new network of preferred providers; (2) if terms or conditions were modified or rejected by a hospital, Blue Cross had the option of not negotiating further with that hospital, in which case, that hospital would be excluded from the network; (3) further negotiations, should they occur, did not guarantee inclusion in the network; (4) a hospital desiring to submit a counterproposal could do so on or before January 25, 1991; and (5) if a hospital was not included in the network, another opportunity for inclusion would not be offered until May 1, 1994, three years after the expiration of all existing contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The proposal contained both price and nonprice terms and conditions. All hospitals providing similar services were offered identical nonprice terms and conditions. The price terms, however, varied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>between hospitals. In developing the price differential, Blue Cross took into account historical differences among payment levels and the types of cases for which the respective hospitals provided care.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Twenty-seven hospitals received proposals, and thirteen accepted the terms and conditions without modification. St. Mary\u2019s, Henrico Doctors\u2019 Hospital (Henrico Doctors\u2019), Chippenham Medical Center (Chippenham), and Johnston-Willis Hospital (Johnston-Willis) were among the hospitals that rejected the initial terms and conditions. These four hospitals, however, did send Blue Cross separate counterproposals, and Blue Cross elected to pursue negotiations with all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">For approximately two months, Blue Cross and St. Mary\u2019s engaged in serious negotiations. As negotiations progressed, Blue Cross and St. Mary\u2019s were able to agree on almost all of the non-price terms and conditions: With respect to the price terms, Blue Cross offered St. Mary\u2019s an increase of 33.82% over the gross payment that St. Mary\u2019s was receiving under the existing contract for inpatient services and an increase of more than 40% over the terms in Blue Cross\u2019 initial proposal. At the insistence of St. Mary\u2019s, Blue Cross agreed that payment be calculated as a percentage of St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 charges, rather than on the basis of a fixed price per case, which Blue Cross preferred. St. Mary\u2019s, however, rejected Blue Cross\u2019 price term proposal, insisting upon an increase of almost 90% over the gross payment under the existing contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">On March 3, 1991, St. Mary\u2019s proposed limiting the network of hospital providers. Under this proposal, St. Mary\u2019s would accept an incrementally larger discount as more hospitals were excluded. The greatest discount that St. Mary\u2019s proposed was payment of 74% of charges for inpatient services, provided Henrico Doctors\u2019, Chippenham, Johnston-Willis, and four other hospitals were excluded from the network of preferred hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Blue Cross rejected this proposal because it believed that St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 proposed discount of 26% was not sufficient to justify the exclusion of Henrico Doctors\u2019, Chippenham, and Johnston-Willis, as those three hospitals historically had provided about 42% of Key-Care inpatient admissions. Blue Cross, thereupon, asked St. Mary\u2019s to make its best counterproposal before March 29, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">On March 28, 1991, St. Mary\u2019s submitted two additional proposals to Blue Cross. One offer proposed a full network and greater discounts to St. Mary\u2019s, provided St. Mary\u2019s received additional patient volume. This proposal was unacceptable to Blue Cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>because it \u201chad no mechanism for steering\u201d additional patients to St. Mary\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 other proposal did not contain specific price terms. Instead, St. Mary\u2019s offered to match the price terms as finally submitted by Henrico Doctors\u2019. Unbeknownst to St. Mary\u2019s, however, the proposal of Henrico Doctors\u2019 offered one price if St. Mary\u2019s were included in the network and a lower price if St. Mary\u2019s were not included in the network. Blue Cross reasoned that it was impossible for St. Mary\u2019s to match the Henrico Doctors\u2019 price proposal. Not having received an acceptable offer from St. Mary\u2019s by the March 29, 1991 deadline, Blue Cross did not include St. Mary\u2019s in the network.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">During the same two-month period, Blue Cross also was negotiating with Hospital Corporation of America (H.C.A.), owner of Henrico Doctors\u2019, Chippenham, and Johnston-Willis. On March 6, 1991, Blue Cross raised the possibility of limiting the network to these three hospitals. Shortly thereafter, H.C.A. proposed a subscription contract that limited the network and that provided for a five-year term, decreases in reimbursement rates, and a fixed price per case. Blue Cross accepted this proposal, and a basic agreement was reached on March 27, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Before reaching the merits of this case, we first must address Blue Cross\u2019 contention that St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 claims are preempted by ERISA. Section 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), provides that ERISA \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee benefit plan . . . .\u201d However, \u00a7 514(b)(2)(A) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A), provides that, with one exception, ERISA shall not \u201cexempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\u201d The one exception, found in \u00a7 514(b)(2)(B) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(B), the so-called \u201cdeemer clause,\u201d states that no employee benefit plan \u201cshall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer ... or to be engaged in the business of insurance ... for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies [or] insurance contracts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">St. Mary\u2019s advances two arguments in response to Blue Cross\u2019 preemption claim. First, St. Mary\u2019s asserts that Code \u00a7 38.2-4209 does not relate to any employee benefit plan. Second, St. Mary\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>argues that, even if the statute does relate to an employee benefit plan, the statute would not be preempted because it regulates insurance. We will focus our attention upon St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 second argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724 (1985), is similar to the present case. At issue in <em>Metropolitan Life </em>was a Massachusetts statute, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 175, \u00a7 47B (West Supp. 1985), which required that certain minimum mental-health-care benefits be provided a Massachusetts resident who was insured under a general health insurance policy or an employee health-care plan that covered hospital and surgical expenses. 471 U.S. at 727. This type of statute, commonly known as a mandated-benefit law, first appeared in the early 1970s. One question presented was whether the Massachusetts statute was preempted by ERISA. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that the Massachusetts statute, as applied, is a law that regulates insurance, within the meaning of \u00a7 514(b)(2)(A) of ERISA, and, therefore, is not preempted under \u00a7 514(a). <em>Id. </em>at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Justice Blackmun, speaking for a unanimous Court, stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">To state the obvious, [the Massachusetts statute] regulates the terms of certain insurance contracts, and so seems to be saved from pre-emption by the saving clause as a law \u201cwhich regulates insurance.\u201d This common-sense view of the matter, moreover, is reinforced by the language of the subsequent subsection of ERISA, the \u201cdeemer clause,\u201d which states that an employee-benefit plan shall not be deemed to be an insurance company \u201cfor purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies, <em>insurance contracts, </em>banks, trust companies, or investment companies.\u201d \u00a7 514(b)(2)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(B) (emphasis added). By exempting from the saving clause laws regulating insurance contracts that apply directly to benefit plans, the deemer clause makes explicit Congress\u2019 intention to include laws that regulate insurance contracts within the scope of the insurance laws preserved by the saving clause. Unless Congress intended to include laws regulating insurance contracts within the scope of the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>saving clause, it would have been unnecessary for the deemer clause explicitly to exempt such laws from the saving clause when they are applied directly to benefit plans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 740-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Additionally, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Massachusetts statute was, in reality, a health law and not a \u201ctraditional insurance law\u201d intended to be saved by \u00a7 514(b)(2)(A) of ERISA. <em>Id. </em>at 741. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he presumption is against pre-emption\u201d and nothing in ERISA \u201cpurports to distinguish between traditional and innovative insurance laws.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Code \u00a7 38.2-4209 is a part of the Insurance Code and regulates the manner in which a PPO may be established and operated under a preferred provider subscription contract. The purposes of a PPO are to achieve lower costs for insureds and to maximize an insured\u2019s freedom of choice among health care providers. Thus, applying the \u201ccommon-sense\u201d approach articulated in <em>Metropolitan Life, </em>we conclude that Code \u00a7 38.2-4209 \u201cregulates insurance\u201d within the meaning of ERISA\u2019s exception to its preemption clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, Code \u00a7 38.2-4209 has not been preempted by ERISA. We also find support for our conclusion from decisions of other courts. <em>See, e.g., Blue Cross Hospital Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frappier, </em>681 S.W.2d 925 (Mo. 1984) (en banc), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>472 U.S. 1014 (1985), <em>upon remand, </em>698 S.W.2d 326 (Mo. 1985) (en banc); <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r of State of Maryland </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins., 296 </em>Md. 334, 463 A.2d 793 (1983). <em>Contra HCA Health Services of Va., Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>803 F.Supp. 1132 (E.D. Va. 1992); <em>Stuart Circle Hosp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Health Management, </em>800 F.Supp. 328 (E.D. Va. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">St. Mary\u2019s contends that the trial court erred in finding that Blue Cross did not \u201cdiscriminate unreasonably\u201d against St. Mary\u2019s in violation of Code \u00a7 38.2-4209(C). St. Mary\u2019s asserts that Blue Cross dealt more favorably with H.C.A., on behalf of Doctors\u2019 Hospital, Chippenham, and Johnston-Willis, than it did with St. Mary\u2019s. In support of this assertion, St. Mary\u2019s claims that \u201cBlue Cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>never negotiated St. Mary\u2019s limited network offers, but . . . did negotiate and consummate a limited network with [Henrico Doctors, Chippenham, and Johnston-Willis].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not think that a fair reading of the record supports St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">No useful purpose would be served by again recounting the voluminous evidence. A few observations will suffice. Blue Cross\u2019 negotiator testified that he advised St. Mary\u2019s that Blue Cross would consider any of St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 limited network offers \u201cat any point in time throughout the whole process.\u201d Blue Cross\u2019 negotiator further testified that St. Mary\u2019s and Blue Cross never were able to consummate an agreement because St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 price terms were unreasonably high. Additionally, St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 chief negotiator testified that Blue Cross\u2019 personnel had treated St. Mary\u2019s fairly, and that they were honest, reasonable, and professional in their negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">After hearing four days of testimony <em>ore terms, </em>the trial judge stated his findings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">I find from the evidence that the negotiations between Blue Cross and St. Mary\u2019s were conducted in good faith throughout the negotiating process. I do not find any unreasonable discrimination on the part of Blue Cross. The fact that they eventually negotiated a limited network proposal with H.C.A. did not discriminate against St. Mary\u2019s. St. Mary\u2019s had the opportunity to be a part of the network as late as March 26 and 27th. For reasons that they deemed appropriate they opted not to accept the last proposal by Blue Cross. The evidence indicates to me that if they had accepted the last offer then both St. Mary\u2019s and H.C.A. would have been in the network.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Where, as here, a trial court hears evidence <em>ore terms, </em>a reviewing court is bound by the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Yamada </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>243 Va. 426, 430-31, 416 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1992). Furthermore, the reviewing court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the party prevailing at trial. <em>Ravenwood </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Towers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woodyard, </em>244 Va. 51, 57, 419 S.E.2d 627, 630 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Blue Cross, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not err in finding that Blue Cross did not discriminate unreasonably against St. Mary\u2019s, in violation of Code \u00a7 38.2-4209(C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Blue Cross also contends that the trial court erred in voiding the last two years of the contract with H.C.A., on behalf of Henrico Doctors\u2019, Chippenham, and Johnston-Willis. Blue Cross asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court\u2019s injunction was not based upon a justiciable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">St. Mary\u2019s brought the present case under the declaratory judgment statute. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-184 to -191. In such cases, circuit courts are empowered to make \u201cbinding adjudications of right\u201d in cases of \u201cactual controversy\u201d involving an \u201cantagonistic assertion and denial of right.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-184. The controversy, therefore, must be one that is \u201cjusticiable,\u201d meaning a controversy in which there are \u201cspecific adverse claims, based upon present rather than future or speculative facts, [that] are ripe for judicial adjustment.\u201d <em>City of Fairfax </em>v. <em>Shanklin, </em>205 Va. 227, 229, 135 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1964); <em>accord Reisen </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>225 Va. 327, 331, 302 S.E.2d 529, 531 (1983). Thus, the declaratory judgment statute does not authorize courts to render advisory opinions or decide moot or speculative issues. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In <em>Shanklin, </em>a taxpayer brought a declaratory judgment proceeding asking the court to declare that certain sections of a city\u2019s zoning ordinance were invalid insofar as they purported to confer upon the board of zoning appeals authority to issue special use permits for the construction of apartments. 205 Va. at 227-28, 135 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>774. Although it was agreed that \u201c \u2018[n]o specific case regarding apartment usage within the City is involved in [the] cause,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 230, 135 S.E.2d at 776, the trial court ruled that the challenged sections of the ordinance were invalid, <em>id. </em>at 228, 135 S.E.2d at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment, we rejected the taxpayer\u2019s contention that, because he had the right to attack the authority of the board of zoning appeals after it had made a decision, he also had the right to challenge its authority before such a decision was made. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 135 S.E.2d at 776. We concluded that the suit \u2018 \u2018merely sought an advisory opinion, or a decision upon a moot question, or an answer to a speculative inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231, 135 S.E.2d at 776. We explained some of the problems that such a decision could cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">Too much is here left to speculation. The board may never again be called upon to act regarding an application for a special use permit for apartments. Or, if someone does apply, and the plaintiff opposes the application, the board may decide the case in the plaintiffs favor. Or, if the board grants such a permit, the apartments may be in a location in the city which would not aggrieve the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Similar problems could result from the trial court\u2019s ruling in the present case. The ruling is based upon-speculation because no one can say with reasonable certainty what facts may exist or what the law may be in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Additionally, \u201c[c]ourts cannot afford [declaratory] \u2018relief\u2019 when they lack the power to bind all parties to the controversy.\u201d <em>Erie Insurance Group </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>240 Va. 165, 170, 393 S.E.2d 210, 212 (1990). In the present case, therefore, the trial court was without jurisdiction to issue the injunction because Henrico Doctors\u2019, Chippenham, and Johnston-Willis, who are \u201cparties to the controversy,\u201d are not before the court and would not be bound by the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court\u2019s injunction is not based upon a justiciable claim. Consequently, the trial court erred in granting the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In conclusion, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in Record No. 920173, holding that the trial court did not err in ruling that Blue Cross did not discriminate unreasonably against St. Mary\u2019s, in violation of Code \u00a7 38.2-4209(C).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In Record No. 920146, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to its ruling that Code \u00a7 38.2-4209 has not been preempted by ERISA, and we will reverse the portion of the judgment that enjoined Blue Cross from operating the PPO I after April 30, 1994, and enter final judgment in favor of Blue Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\n<em>Record No. 920173: Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>Record No. 920146: Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\"> Since oral argument in the present case, the Supreme Court decided <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Greater Washington Board of Trade, </em>61 U.S.L.W. 4039 (Dec. 14, 1992). This case, however, does not involve ERISA\u2019s insurance saving clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\"> The insurance exception is sufficient to decide this issue. Therefore, we do not decide whether Code \u00a7 38.2-4209 \u201crelate[s] to any employee benefit plan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b52-8\"> In full network offers, potential preferred providers propose discounts, not knowing whether other potential providers will be excluded from the network. In limited network offers, potential providers, knowing that some providers will be excluded from the network, propose larger discounts in anticipation of greater patient volume.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\"> In its second assignment of error, St. Mary\u2019s states the following: \u201cThe trial court erred by failing to hold that Blue Cross\u2019 discrimination in favor of the HCA Hospitals [Doctors\u2019 Hospital, Chippenham, and Johnston-Willis] is not protected under Va. Code \u00a7 38.2-4209(C) because it was not the product of individual price negotiations between Blue Cross and a single provider.\u201d Having concluded that Blue Cross did not discriminate unreasonably against St. Mary\u2019s (St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 first assignment of error), we see no reason to address this assignment of error. In other words, the second assignment of error is subsumed in the first.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\"> We do not consider the merits of St. Mary\u2019s\u2019 Assignment of Error No. 3, alleging that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence portions of certain depositions, or of Assignment of Error No. 4, alleging that the court erred in admitting into evidence Blue Cross Exhibits 101 and 104. The trial court stated that it would not consider or rely upon this challenged evidence in arriving at its decision. Thus, assuming the evidence was inadmissible, any error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
