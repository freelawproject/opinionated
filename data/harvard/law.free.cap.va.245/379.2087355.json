Mrs. Gunter\u2019s holographic will, dated September 13, 1985, and containing six holographic codicils, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>was probated in the Circuit Court of Henrico County on January 31, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">On July 26, 1991, the executors of Gunter\u2019s will filed a suit to construe several provisions of the will and codicils, the pertinent provisions of which follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\n<em>Article Two</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">I leave my entire estate in trust for my husband Eugene Douglas Gunter his lifetime, if he survives me. If my husband does not survive me \u2014 [t]hen I direct that all my personal and real estate be sold and the net proceeds be added and disposed of as part of my Trust Resid[u]ary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\n<em>Article Three</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">All the rest, residue, and remainder of my property, real and personal Trust, I give, devise, and bequeath to the hereinafter named Trustees herein referred to as my Trustees, to be held[,] administered and di[s]posed of by them upon the following Trusts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">A. [Payment of all net income to husband if he survives with power to invade corpus for husband\u2019s support and maintenance.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">B. Upon the death of my husband should he survive me, or upon my death should he not survive me, my Residuary Trust as then constituted shall be reduced and disposed of as follows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">(1) There shall be paid over and delivered to the following named persons if they are then living, that is, living at my husband\u2019s death should he survive me or living at my death should he not survive me, the amount designated for them as follows\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">[Bequests of $10,000 each to Mollie West Boissieux, Robert Lee Hines [,Jr.] and Twyla Willey Gunter, and $10,000 to Herman and Clara Faye West <em>\u201cwilled as one.\u201d]</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>(2) The Remainder of my Residuary Trust be paid over in equal shares to such of the following named persons who are living at my husband\u2019s death should he survive me, or living at my death should he not survive me. [The same five individuals as those in the preceding paragraph are named, with the Wests designated as \u201cHerman and Clara Fay[e] West.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The will gave the trustees and executors \u2018 \u2018in addition to all other powers granted by law ... the powers set forth in Section 64.1-57 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, as in force at the date of this will, which powers in whole are by this reference incorporated herein.\u201d Code \u00a7 64.1-57(l)(b), in effect when the will was executed, authorizes executors and trustees to \u201csell . . . any and all investments and property, either real, personal or mixed which may be included in . . . the trust or estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In various codicils, Mrs. Gunter revoked some bequests, conditioned other bequests, and made additional bequests. She also gave options to purchase personal property to Robert L. Hines, Jr. On a date not shown in the record, but apparently before September 3, 1988, Mollie West Boissieux died, and Mrs. Gunter effectively revoked the provisions for her by lining out her name. On September 3, 1988, Mrs. Gunter added a codicil to her will which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">After all my bills - expenses - gifts and etc. settled -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">The money that is left over I want it equally divided among the following people</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">Herman West</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-V\">Sara Rigel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2i\">Robert Hines[, Jr.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">Twyla Willey [Gunter]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">On January 5, 1991, Mrs. Gunter revoked the September 3, 1988 bequest to Herman West by dating and initialling her act of drawing a line though West\u2019s name as it appeared in the codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The total appraised value of Mrs. Gunter\u2019s estate was $690,012, and was comprised of $366,822 in corporate stocks, $53,190 in tangible personal property, and her residence and lot, appraised at $270,000. The chancellor ruled that Mrs. Gunter \u2018 \u2018intended for her estate to be held in trust for the benefit of her husband until his death. Upon his death her estate was to be converted (\u2018reduced\u2019) to cash and distributed to the remaindermen.\u201d The Wests appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Established rules govern our construction of these testamentary documents.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">[T]he paramount rule in testamentary construction is that the intention of the testator controls. ... In ascertaining that intention, a court must examine the will as a whole and give effect, so far as possible, to all its parts. Although the language in a will may be obscure and uncertain, if the testator\u2019s intention is ascertainable, his intention will prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>Thomas v. Copenhaver, </em>235 Va. 124, 128, 365 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The Wests claim that Mrs. Gunter intended \u201ctwo different dispositions of her assets, depending on whether she was or was not survived by her husband.\u201d This premise is based primarily upon the Wests\u2019 construction of the word \u201creduced\u201d in Article Three B.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The Wests note that if Mr. Gunter did not survive Mrs. Gunter, \u201cshe clearly directed that all of her personal and real estate be <em>sold </em>and the net proceeds be <em>added and disposed </em>of as part of her Trust Residuary [as cash].\u201d Under those circumstances, the Wests implicitly recognize that Clara Faye West would have received nothing from the residuary trust because the September 3, 1988 codicil effectively removed her as a legatee, and Herman West would have received nothing from the residuary estate because of Mrs. Gunter\u2019s deletion of his name from the September 3, 1988 codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">However, the Wests contend that if Mr. Gunter were to survive Mrs. Gunter, as he indeed did, then Mrs. Gunter\u2019s use of the word \u201creduced\u201d in Article Three manifested an intent not to have her entire estate converted to cash, but merely to \u2018 \u2018reduce or diminish the Residuary Trust by first distributing $10,000 to each of the named individuals (Clause B(l)) and then the remaining cash and other personal and real estate [noncash property] would then be paid over in equal shares to the same named individuals [as set forth in Clause (B)(2)].\u201d Thus, the Wests reason that because the residuary estate was not to be converted to cash for distribution (as it would have been had Mr. Gunter died first), only such cash as was in the residuary trust estate at the termination of Mr. Gunter\u2019s life interest could be the subject of the September 3, 1988 codicil. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the Wests argue that this codicil does not affect the bequest in Article Three B(2) and they continue to share in the noncash portion of the residuary estate. We do not agree.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The verb \u201creduce\u201d has at least 14 definitions. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1905 (1986). Depending upon the context in which it is used, it can mean \u201cto diminish in size, amount, extent, or number\u2019 \u2019 or it can mean \u2018 \u2018to transpose from one form into another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Article Three B read alone might support the Wests\u2019 interpretation Of the word \u201creduced,\u201d when the entire will is read in context, several considerations lead us to conclude that Mrs. Gunter intended it to mean a transposition or conversion of one form of assets into another \u2014 a conversion into cash, as the trial court held.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In the first place, the Wests\u2019 construction creates a patent inconsistency between Mrs. Gunter\u2019s directions in Articles Two and Three for the liquidation of her residuary estate should she survive her husband. Article Two directs that <em>all </em>her estate be sold and disposed of as part of the trust residuary in that event, yet the Wests claim that under the same circumstances, Article Three <em>limits </em>the assets to be converted to cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Inconsistencies in testamentary documents \u201care not looked upon with favor and the court should undertake, wherever it is possible, to reconcile conflicting provisions, keeping in mind always this elementary rule, the testatrix\u2019s intentions control.\u201d <em>Whittle v. </em>Roper, 156 Va. 407, 413, 157 S.E. 827, 829 (1931). If the word \u201creduced\u201d is construed to mean converted or \u201creduced\u201d to cash, that construction harmonizes the liquidation provisions of Articles Two and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Secondly, were the Wests\u2019 contention adopted, the quantum of their suggested cash and noncash residuary estates would depend upon whether the fiduciaries decided to convert the residence and personal property to cash during Mr. Gunter\u2019s life, as they were authorized to do under the provisions of Code \u00a7 64.1-57(1)(b). Under the Wests\u2019 construction, the cash from any such sales would vest in those parties named in the September 3, 1988 codicil rather than in those parties named in Article Three B(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">If the fiduciaries had such a power, they could have eliminated the Article Three B(2) residuary estate simply by selling all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the so-called noncash property. Such an action would be analogous to the exercise of a power of appointment, and we have said that \u201cthe will must reflect with certainty the donor\u2019s intent to create [such] a power.\u201d <em>Leach </em>v. Hyatt, 244 Va. 566, 569, 423 S.E.2d 165, 168 (1992). This will does not \u201creflect with certainty\u201d any such intent on Mrs. Gunter\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Finally, we do not agree that the other testamentary provisions relied upon by the Wests are sufficient to overcome Mrs. Gunter\u2019s obvious and dominant intent to delete Herman West and Mollie West Boissieux as legatees of her Article Three B(2) residuary trust and to add Sara Rigel as a legatee with Robert L. Hines, Jr., and Twyla Willey Gunter. Accordingly, we conclude that Mrs. Gunter intended her fiduciaries to convert her residuary estate into cash for distribution upon the death of Mrs. Gunter or her husband, whichever outlived the other, and that she did not intend to divide her residuary estate into cash and noncash portions, as the Wests contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Because the residuary estate was to be converted to cash, we also conclude that the September 3, 1988 codicil effectively disposed of what Mrs. Gunter described as \u201cthe Remainder of my Residuary Trust,\u201d and revoked the designation of the legatees named in Article Three B(2) by naming other legatees who would take such portion. Since Mrs. Gunter revoked the provision for Herman West, those legatees are Sara Rigel, Robert Hines, Jr., and Twyla Willey Gunter.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-9\"> In view of our holding, we do not reach the Wests\u2019 additional claim that the trial court also erred in failing to rule that they receive separate shares in noncash property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
