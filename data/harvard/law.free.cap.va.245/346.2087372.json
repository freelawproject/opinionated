The plaintiff alleged that during surgery performed upon her at the hospital, \u201cinstruments were used which were not adequately sterilized.\u201d The plaintiff asserted that the defendant, acting through its agents, servants, and employees, negligently failed to adhere to the appropriate standard of care in assuring sterility of the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">As a result, the plaintiff alleged, she sustained \u201cpain, suffering, anguish, inconvenience, and discomfort.\u201d She claimed that she underwent \u201cmedical procedures that have been unpleasant, distasteful, painful, debilitating, and worrisome.\u201d She further asserted that she has suffered \u2018 \u2018increased anxiety in the extreme . . . and has been otherwise subjected to emotional distress inflicted upon her by the acts and omissions herein complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">In its grounds of defense, the defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. Subsequently, however, in responses to requests for admissions, the defendant conceded that it negligently failed in its duty to properly sterilize the instruments and that it negligently failed to warn the plaintiff\u2019s surgeon about the unsanitary instruments. The defendant also admitted pretrial that a Medical Malpractice Review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Panel, when considering the plaintiffs claim against the defendant, unanimously concluded that the evidence supported a finding that the defendant failed to comply with the appropriate standard of care and that such failure was a proximate cause of the alleged damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in a February 1992 jury trial, the court below sustained the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. The basis of the motion was that the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s evidence, as a matter of law, failed to establish any physical injury to plaintiff sufficient to support a claim of emotional distress.\u201d The plaintiff appeals from the April 1992 summary judgment order dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The question presented is whether the trial court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s motion to strike and in entering summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The factual record in this appeal is comprised of the responses to requests for admissions and a Rule 5:11(c) written statement; we do not have the benefit of a transcript of the trial testimony. From the information we have been provided, however, there appears to be little conflict in the facts at this stage of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">On October 12, 1989, the plaintiff entered the defendant hospital for a planned overnight stay for the purpose of having carpal tunnel surgery performed on her right wrist. About three months earlier, she had similar surgery on her left wrist at the same hospital. That surgery was uneventful and involved a one-night hospital stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">While in the recovery room on October 12, the surgeon advised the plaintiff there was \u201ca possibility she had been operated on with unsterile instruments.\u201d Apparently, the nurse in charge of the autoclave used to sterilize the instruments negligently monitored the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The plaintiff \u201cexperienced an immediate fear of several diseases.\u201d She asked to be administered \u201can HIV test\u201d and \u201casked about the possibility of getting AIDS.\u201d She feared infection, dying, and being unable to be \u201caround\u201d her family or to \u201ctouch\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">While the surgeon felt there was \u2018 \u2018very little risk\u2019 \u2019 of viral infection occurring, his \u201cbig concerns\u201d were that plaintiff could develop \u201cHepatitis B, HIV, Staph virus and Tetanus.\u201d Accordingly, he asked an infectious disease specialist to treat the plaintiff in the hospital. This physician ordered that plaintiff receive antibiotics intravenously. According to the plaintiff, the physicians \u201creferred to blanket coverage, to get any germ she might come in contact with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The plaintiff remained hospitalized until October 15 for treatment, necessitated by use of the \u201cpoorly sterilized or unsterilized instruments.\u201d During this period, the plaintiff experienced migraine headaches (a preexisting condition), nausea, and vomiting. The intravenous line had to be removed and replaced when \u201cit began to bum.\u201d She received \u201cpain shots\u201d every four to six hours. She had blood drawn \u201cfrequently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Upon release from the hospital, the plaintiff was told that she must have \u201can HIV test\u201d in six months \u201cbefore she was out of the woods\u201d with reference to developing that virus. The plaintiff had this test after six months and it was negative. She stated that, in the interim, \u201cI was scared to death; I didn\u2019t want to contaminate people or be a burden on anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Following the hospitalization, several additional medications were prescribed for the plaintiff. For the next several days, she was unable to \u201ckeep medication down\u201d; she vomited continuously. Her mouth, nose and sinuses became \u201craw,\u201d and she experienced fever, sweating, and chills. She developed vaginal discharge caused by \u201cthe strong antibiotic\u201d prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The medical testimony showed that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201csymptom complex was attributable to Pseudomembranous Enterocolitis which in her case was a side effect of the antibiotics, which were prescribed for her as a consequence of the use of the unsterile instruments.\u201d The testimony was that the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms and problems resulted from the \u201cantibiotic therapy\u201d that was \u201cnecessarily prescribed\u201d for the plaintiff \u201cas a result of the hospital\u2019s negligence.\u201d One physician testified that it was \u201creasonable\u201d for the plaintiff \u201cto be in some fear of infection for six months.\u201d In fact, however, the plaintiff did not develop any disease from the surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Confronted with this evidence, the defendant persuaded the trial court that this routine malpractice action based on professional negligence was actually a suit based solely upon a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. In ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, as a matter of law, did not establish \u201cany physical injury to plaintiff sufficient to support a claim of emotional distress,\u201d the trial court adopted the defendant\u2019s theory. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The defendant\u2019s argument actually is a contention that the plaintiff sustained no direct physical injury, only emotional disturbance. But the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, at the very least, establishes a prima facie case of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The term \u201cinjury\u201d means \u201cpositive, physical or mental hurt to the claimant.\u201d <em>Scarpa </em>v. Melzig, 237 Va. 509, 512, 379 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1989) (quoting <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp., </em>221 Va. 951, 957, 275 S.E.2d 900, 904 (1981)). Clearly, as a result of the hospital\u2019s use of inadequately sterilized instruments, the plaintiff sustained positive, physical and mental hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">As the direct result of the wrong, the plaintiff\u2019s body was invaded by intravenous tubes, needles administering \u201cpain shots,\u201d and instruments used to withdraw blood. She experienced the physical pain and discomfort of headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills and unusual sweating; she developed a \u201craw\u201d mouth, nose, and sinus. Her \u201csymptom complex\u201d was due to enterocolitis, a side effect of the antibiotic therapy \u201cnecessarily prescribed\u201d because of the hospital\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In addition to the physical pain and discomfort, the plaintiff sustained, as a direct result of the wrong, mental anguish and emotional distress in the form of fear for her own well-being and worry about possible contamination of friends and family.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In sum, to argue that the plaintiff established mere emotional disturbance absent physical injury is to ignore the evidence in this case; the defendant\u2019s motion to strike should not have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Consequently, the judgment in favor of the defendant will be reversed and the case will be remanded for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
