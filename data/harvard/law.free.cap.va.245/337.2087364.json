Cibula, was time-barred. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \u201c[t]he evidence in this record leads unerringly to the conclusion that Allied is estopped from invoking the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Cibula v. Allied Fibers &amp; Plastics, </em>14 Va. App. 319, 326, 416 S.E.2d 708, 712 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In its petition for appeal to this Court, Allied contended that the Court of Appeals erred (1) in holding that the Commission applied an \u201cimproper standard\u201d to the question whether Allied was equitably estopped from invoking the statute of limitations, (2) in finding that the case did not present a matter of conflicting evidence or a dispute concerning the Commission\u2019s findings of fact, and (3) in refusing to hold that Cibula had failed to preserve the estoppel question for appeal purposes. Determining that the holding of the Court of Appeals regarding an \u201cimproper standard\u201d presented a matter of significant precedential value, Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B), and that all three of the claims of error should be reviewed, we awarded Allied an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Upon consideration of Allied\u2019s contentions, we find there is no error in the judgment under review. Accordingly, we will adopt the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion as our own and affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
