It is here claimed in support of the writ that petitioner is held illegally, for the reason that the complaint is void on its face, and petitioner is held without reasonable or probable cause. There is no merit in the petition. Sections 1548-1551 of the Penal Code authorize the holding of petitioner pending the arrival of the sheriff from the state of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">The application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
