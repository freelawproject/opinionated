That there was no evidence that- while defendant was in said house he did commit theft, larceny or any felony whatsoever. \u2019 \u2019 There was evidence that the defendant was discovered in the house that was occupied by the complaining witness and her family; that he was there without her consent and without her knowledge until he disclosed his presence by making a noise; that upon her hearing a noise on the stairs in her house, she looked to see who it was and saw the defendant and that the defendant said to her: \u201cDon\u2019t make any noise; don\u2019t holler, God damn it, or I will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>The evidence in this case against the defendant is amply sufficient to sustain the implied finding of the jury that his entry into the house of the complaining witness was an entry made with intent to commit the crime of larceny. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Espalian, </em>92 Cal.
