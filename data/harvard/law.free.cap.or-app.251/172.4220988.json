On appeal, father contends that the trial court erred in determining that the children\u2019s best interests are served by the relocation. As amplified below, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that relocating to Utah is in the children\u2019s best interests. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if there is any evidence in the record to support them. <em>Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick, </em>248 Or App 539, 541 n 1, 273 P3d 361 (2012). Accordingly, deferring to the trial court\u2019s express determination that the testimony of mother and her witnesses was credible, we state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, supplemented with uncontroverted information from the record. <em>Id. </em>at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Mother and father, who were never married, have two children. In early 2009, at the time of the hearing concerning the proposed relocation, their son, S J, was seven years old, and their daughter, SA, was five years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Initially, the parties \u2014 and their children, after they were born \u2014 lived in California. Before the children were born, while the parties were living together, father was arrested and convicted of assaulting mother. Although father was again arrested for assaulting mother in 2004, he was not convicted. With regard to that incident, mother explained that, at father\u2019s request, she signed a declaration calling into question aspects of the police report. Specifically, mother testified that the declaration \u201cgave question to what was in the police report, saying that maybe he didn\u2019t kick me, maybe it was a chair that fell on me, maybe the door was busted off the hinges because the hinges were bad, not because of pushing out the door, things of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Eventually, in June 2005, mother moved with the children to Oregon. Mother helped father move nearby a few months later but indicated to him that their romantic relationship was over. Father settled in Vancouver, Washington. The parties had an informal agreement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>mother would retain custody of the children and father would have parenting time. Mother testified that father would see the children \u201cfor a night or two every week, every other week. It was rather sporadic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In October 2005, an incident occurred during one of father\u2019s visits that caused mother to leave the state with the children. In the two or three days before the visit, SA\u2014 who was about a year old \u2014 had been sick and had been to the doctor for antibiotic injections. On the day of the visit, SA was scheduled to go to the doctor again. Mother initially suggested that father cancel the visit because SA was sick, but she ultimately agreed to the visit after father agreed to take SA to the doctor. When father did, the doctor recommended that SA go to the hospital. Father called mother and told her that he was taking SA to the hospital, but he would not tell her which hospital. Father also told mother that he would not be returning the children to her. Mother called local hospitals but could not find SA because father had restricted the release of SA\u2019s information. Mother also called the police and an attorney. The next day, mother was able to determine where SA was, and she went to the hospital and found SA, who was ready to be discharged. Mother held SA in her arms and refused to release her to father. Tensions mounted between mother and father. Eventually, hospital security, child services, and the police responded. To resolve the conflict between the parties\u2014 who, as noted, had only an informal custody agreement at that time \u2014 the police allowed mother to retain SA, whom she was holding, but allowed father to take S J.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Although father had previously only had short visits with the children, he kept S J, who was about two and one-half years old. After 10 days, mother went to father\u2019s home and pushed her way past father\u2019s wife to retrieve SJ. Thereafter, she took both children to California and then to Utah. For approximately six months, mother ensured that father had no contact with the children. However, mother testified that, during that period, she had one conversation with father in which he \u201csaid something very threatening and alarming to me, basically implying that if I were dead, he would automatically have custody of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Mother was eventually arrested in Utah, and the children were placed in father\u2019s care for approximately three months. Mother ultimately pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor criminal charges in Washington, custodial interference in the second degree, RCW 9A.40.070, and criminal trespassing in the first degree, RCW 9A.52.070. Except for the three-month period that the children were in father\u2019s care, mother has had custody of the children and has functioned as their primary parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In 2007, the parties\u2019 informal arrangement had been replaced by a formal parenting plan in a stipulated judgment. In general, under that plan, father had parenting time every other weekend, alternating holidays, and for a period in the summer. Since the 2007 plan has been in effect, father has regularly exercised his parenting time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other things, he and the children spend their time together camping, fishing, and playing games.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Nevertheless, at times, father has demonstrated an unwillingness to perform parenting tasks during his time with the children. For example, in May 2008, father failed to take the children to their dental appointments, which caused a disagreement between the parties that resulted in a complete breakdown in communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In caring for the children, mother has received extensive financial and emotional support from her extended family, including her parents, who lived nearby in Oregon but moved to Utah eight months before the hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of the hearing, mother and the children lived in a small apartment in the Portland area. Although mother worked part time at various positions including waitressing, her annual earnings had never exceeded $12,000 and she never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>independently made a salary sufficient to support herself and the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">For that reason, mother\u2019s parents consistently supplemented her income.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On average, mother\u2019s parents have given her approximately $750 each month to help her support the children. Although they intend to continue that support as long as possible, mother\u2019s father, Lasser, has been diagnosed with stage four non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which is incurable and will likely necessitate his retirement within a couple of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Moreover, mother\u2019s extended family provided, in effect, a safety net for mother and the children that served to buffer stressful events. For example, Lasser testified that there were times when father \u201c[went] out of his way to be uncooperative\u201d and suddenly canceled his parenting time or failed to pick up the children so that mother could go to work. In order to prevent mother from losing her job, Lasser testified that, on more than one occasion, his wife had had to \u201crun to Portland to baby-sit [at the] last minute.\u201d Because mother\u2019s parents lived nearby and were involved in the children\u2019s care, the children saw their grandparents often and are bonded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Although mother had at least one serious personal relationship after moving to Oregon, she never married. Father, on the other hand, married in 2006. At the time of his marriage, his wife had a son from a previous relationship, and, by the time of the hearing in this case, father and his wife had two children together \u2014 a daughter who was three years old and a son who was one year old.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>father regularly exercised his parenting time, SJ and SA are bonded to him as well as his new wife and their siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Bluntly, mother and father\u2019s relationship is acrimonious, as is mother\u2019s relationship with father\u2019s wife. A detailed recitation of the parties\u2019 grievances and the points of conflict is unnecessary in this context. It is sufficient to note that they often have major conflicts about minor issues that last for months. In the words of the trial court, mother and father\u2019s relationship is a \u201chigh conflict\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Although the parties\u2019 contentious relationship has not resulted in further abuse against mother, in February 2008 \u2014 approximately a year before the hearing in this case \u2014 father was convicted of assaulting a female friend.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That assault \u2014 and father\u2019s subsequent arrest \u2014 occurred during his parenting time, while the children were asleep in another room, after father and his wife had been out drinking with friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Because father was in custody and unavailable to take the children home, father\u2019s wife e-mailed mother and asked her pick up the children. Father\u2019s wife did not tell mother about father\u2019s arrest because she felt that mother \u201cdidn\u2019t need to know about it\u201d and \u201c[b]ecause [she] had a feeling [that mother] would use it against [them].\u201d Further, when asked whether she would want to know if her children were in the care of someone who was drunk and who had been arrested for assault, father\u2019s wife replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201cI would want to know about it, but I wouldn\u2019t expect my ex-husband to tell me about it. In fact, he hasn\u2019t before. He\u2019s been arrested in front of my son before and I just accept that he\u2019s his dad and if I find out things, I find them out, and I go to the courts if I have to if I feel that my son is in danger and take care of it that way. I don\u2019t expect him to tell me because I know he\u2019s not going to.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Father acknowledges that his abusive behavior was caused, at least in part, by his alcoholism. Specifically, father testified, \u201cI broke the law, I drank, I was mentally, physically, abusive ***.\u201d However, by May 2008, father testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>he had \u201cdecided to quit all that.\u201d Specifically, father testified that he stopped drinking and that he is in counseling and regularly participating in various programs \u2014 including Alcoholics Anonymous \u2014 that have helped him learn \u201c[h] ow to live life, how to handle problems, conflict resolution, communication, [and] forgiveness of others.\u201d Father\u2019s pastor testified that father and his family attend church regularly and that the quality of father\u2019s parenting is \u201con the rise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">As previously noted, mother\u2019s parents moved to Utah approximately eight months before the hearing in this case. Shortly after they moved, mother notified father of her intent to relocate with the children to Utah, and she filed a motion to show cause why the parenting plan should not be modified to allow her to do so. In response, father filed a motion opposing the relocation and seeking to change custody of the children, which mother opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Significantly, at the hearing concerning the parties\u2019 motions, father clarified that he was seeking custody of the children only if mother were to move without them, which mother said she would not do. For that reason, the focus of the hearing was on mother\u2019s motion to modify the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In that regard, mother explained that relocating to Utah is in the children\u2019s best interests for two interrelated reasons. First, mother had received an offer to become a print broker with a Utah-based company that produces family films. A print broker is primarily responsible for outsourcing the company\u2019s printing projects. According to Gregory Cope, the film company\u2019s vice president, to succeed as a print broker an individual must have \u201cgood people skills,\u201d an \u201cunderstanding of print and print media,\u201d and a willingness to \u201croll her sleeves up and work hard.\u201d Mother has worked for Cope before, and both he and Lasser believe that mother has those skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Lasser, who expects to retire within a couple of years due to his deteriorating health, currently holds the print broker position and would be responsible for mother\u2019s training, which he estimated would take about one year. Although Lasser was allowed to telecommute for the company \u2014 that is, to work for the company while living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>in places other than Utah \u2014 Cope testified that allowing mother to telecommute was not his preference. And, Lasser explained that he did not start telecommuting until he had \u201cyears of face-to-face experience with the customers and the vendors and everybody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Unlike mother\u2019s previous part-time jobs, the print broker position is full time. According to Cope, the position has a starting annual salary of between $30,000 and $35,000, which could grow over time to $60,000. As mother explained, this job opportunity would significantly improve her and the children\u2019s standard of living and allow her to provide them with opportunities to pursue activities in which they are interested. The move is, in her words, \u201cthe first step in just getting a solid standing for the rest of our li[ves].\u201d As Lasser reiterated, \u201c[t]his (job] is an opportunity\u201d for mother; it will provide her with the best opportunity \u201cto stand on her own two feet and make a living for herself and her children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Second, mother will have the support of her parents as well as other extended family members in Utah.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In Utah\u2014 as they did when they lived in Oregon \u2014 mother\u2019s parents intend to provide the financial and emotional support to which mother and the children have grown accustomed and which will be particularly beneficial as mother transitions into full-time employment. According to Lasser, several relatives will be available to provide childcare and, as a result, mother will have lower, if any, daycare expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">For example, if mother is permitted to relocate, her parents will allow her and the children to live in a townhome that they own. Once mother is settled and able to make the monthly payments on her own, mother\u2019s parents intend to turn the title to the townhome over to mother. As mother testified, the children \u201clove the house\u201d where they would each have a bedroom and a small backyard in which to play.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Moreover, as mother testified, the children have missed their grandparents since their grandparents moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to Utah. If mother is allowed to move there, mother\u2019s parents will again help care for the children. As mother explained, in Oregon, she transported the children to many of their activities (i.e., \u201cswimming classes, gymnastics, dance class, art class, soccer, tennis\u201d); however, in Utah, even though she would be working full time, the children could continue in their various activities because she would have help transporting them and with other childcare responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Unlike mother\u2019s parents and extended family, who intend to support mother and the children if they are allowed to move to Utah, father is not in a position to support mother as a parent if she is required to stay in Oregon. As previously described, the parties\u2019 contentious relationship has not allowed for positive coparenting. Father candidly acknowledged that, at the time of the hearing, despite his attempts to change some of his own behaviors, he was not yet in a position to cooperatively coparent with mother. Specifically, during the hearing, the following exchange occurred between mother\u2019s attorney and father:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cQ. If [mother] stays here, how are you going to be more supportive to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201cA. I\u2019m just going to keep calling. I\u2019m putting the kids first, no matter what. I put all my selfish wants and desires aside. If I don\u2019t believe she is doing something right, I\u2019ll tell her about it and that\u2019s all I can do. I can\u2019t make her do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">\u201cQ. So she has no family here, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">\u201cA. *** No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">\u201cQ. <em>So here she and the children have you, right?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">\n<em>\u201cA. The children have me.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">\u201cQ. <em>But [mother] doesn\u2019t really have you to support her, to be supportive of her, does she ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">\u201cA. <em>No.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Against that evidentiary backdrop, the trial court explained that mother\u2019s \u201cproposed move to Utah with the children is intended to improve her standard of living, her residence and her employment and will place her in closer proximity to her extended family.\u201d In particular, the court noted that, not only does mother have a \u201cgenuine desire * * * to be closer to her father\u201d who \u201chas stage [four] non[-] Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma,\u201d but she also has a desire for the children to be closer \u201cto [their grandfather] and grandmother as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The court acknowledged how \u201cemotional and difficult\u201d the issues in the case were \u201cfor the two parents and for extended family.\u201d Further, the court explained that there was no way to reach an \u201ceffective[ ] * * * compromise\u201d because \u201cthere isn\u2019t a way for both parties to succeed in getting what they want ***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Ultimately, the trial court determined that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to relocate to Utah. Accordingly, the trial court granted mother\u2019s motion to modify the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In explaining its ruling, the court noted, among other things, that both mother and father had, at times, \u201cbehaved badly and exercised poor judgment.\u201d Specifically, the court explained, \u201cMother has exercised poor judgment in the incident with [SJ]. She behaved badly. She garnered a criminal conviction out of that. I would note it would be this Court\u2019s finding, however, that father also behaved badly and exercised poor judgment in that incident with [SJ] and [SA].\u201d Further, the court commented that there are many problems with the parties\u2019 relationship. Nevertheless, the trial court found that \u201c[mjother has abided by and large with the parenting order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The court further explained that it had concerns about father\u2019s willingness to perform parenting tasks during his time with the children and his ability to behave appropriately whether or not the children were with him. Apparently referring to father\u2019s failure to take the children to dental appointments and the communication breakdown with mother that occurred thereafter, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u201cWhen you are a parent, you are a parent all the time. Parenting time is for the benefit of kids. Parents do things with and for their children during the time that they are parents, which is 365 days of the year. So it is difficult for me to understand doing an occasional errand or taking a child to an appointment as being an imposition on a parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">\u201cI have some difficulty with that, but just note it is my sense that it is the law of the [Sjtate of Oregon that parent[s] are parents all the time and should behave accordingly, whether they are with their children or not with their children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Relatedly, the trial court expressed concern about father\u2019s ability to maintain consistent and positive relationships, explaining that father</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cnow has five biological children with three different women, never was married to [mother], is married to his current wife but the first child was born prior to the marriage and his first child, who is somewhat older[,] is a child he has no contact with. So, in terms of stability and ability to have consistent positive relationships, it appears to me that [Gather has shown by behavior that that is difficult for him and will continue to be a challenge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Moreover, the court rejected father\u2019s contentions concerning mother\u2019s inability to maintain a stable lifestyle, noting that \u201csome of the things that father brought up in evidence and in argument regarding [the] stability of [mjother are frankly, more true of [Gather than of [m]other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The court was also concerned about father\u2019s history of domestic violence. Specifically, the court noted father\u2019s history \u201cas to mother\u201d \u2014 namely, as previously described, 251 Or App at 173, his conviction for assaulting her sometime before the children were born. Further, with regard to the incident in 2008 in which father was convicted of assaulting a female friend, the trial court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201cit [was] extremely concerning *** that [Gather\u2019s wife admitted to lying regarding [Gather\u2019s arrest for assault and domestic violence, and that she seemed to view this as acceptable and perhaps even expected behavior. As she indicated that if something like this were to happen with her ex-husband, she would not expect anybody to volunteer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>that information and she would simply just go ferret it out somehow.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">However, the gravamen of the court\u2019s reasoning was that \u201cthe stability and employment\u201d of a primary, custodial parent such as mother \u201cis a critical piece of the child\u2019s success in life.\u201d In that regard, the court explained that relocating to Utah would be in the children\u2019s best interests for two interrelated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">First, mother has a \u201cbona fide * * * offer\u201d for a job in Utah, with a starting annual salary of between $30,000 to $35,000 and the potential for growth over time to $60,000. The court explained that the circumstances surrounding mother\u2019s job offer were \u201cunique.\u201d Specifically, the court stated that mother would \u201cfill a job that her father is vacating due to his health issues\u201d and that \u201cher father is in a position to assist with her training and orientation.\u201d According to the court, that job in Utah will improve the standard of living for mother and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Second, mother\u2019s extended family in Utah\u2014 particularly her parents, to whom the children are emotionally bonded \u2014 will provide mother and the children with the financial and emotional support that they need, particularly as mother transitions to working full time in her new position. In particular, the trial court found that mother had been \u201cfinancially and emotionally very tied to that family in Utah\u201d and anticipated that mother would continue to look to those family members for the support that she needed to provide a stable environment for the children. Significantly, unlike mother\u2019s extended family in Utah, the court noted that father was not in a position to \u201csupport [m]other as a parent\u201d if she were required to stay in Oregon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the court explained, mother and father had a \u201chigh conflict\u201d relationship and, for that reason, their coparenting had not been \u201cparticularly successful.\u201d Moreover, the court reasoned that, \u201cwithout some very significant changes,\u201d improvement was unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In sum, the court reasoned that \u201cthe multiple benefits that are afforded by [mjother\u2019s move outweigh the detriment of giving up an alternating parenting schedule to the children.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted mother\u2019s motion to modify the parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Consistently with its oral ruling, the court entered a supplemental judgment modifying the parties\u2019 parenting plan to allow mother to move with the children to Utah. Because the school to which mother proposes to send the children is on a year-round schedule, they will be in school for 45 school days and then have 15 school days off. They will also have a four-week vacation in the summer. Because of the children\u2019s school schedule, the parenting plan provides, in pertinent part, that father shall receive a total of eight weeks of parenting time each year:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cFather\u2019s parenting time shall then be determined by the school breaks and he shall be entitled to up to two (2) weeks during each major school break where [blather\u2019s two (2) weeks would not exceed two thirds (2/3) of the full school break for a total anticipated number of eight (8) weeks of uninterrupted parenting time each year. If the number of major school breaks meeting these criteria is less than four (4) in any school year, then [blather shall be entitled to additional parenting time added to another school break to which [blather\u2019s total parenting time would not exceed two thirds (2/3) of the total school break in order to ensure that he is able to exercise a total of eight (8) weeks or approximately fifty-six (56) days of parenting time each year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Further, the parenting plan requires mother to make the children available for phone calls or video chats twice each week. Father appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">On appeal, the parties essentially reiterate the contentions that they raised to the trial court. For his part, father contends that the trial court\u2019s best interests determination was erroneous for two reasons. First, relying on our decisions in <em>Herinckx and Matejsek, </em>231 Or App 50, 218 P3d 137 (2009), <em>Fedorov and Fedorov, </em>228 Or App 50, 206 P3d 1124, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 42 (2009), and <em>Cooksey and Cooksey, </em>203 Or App 157, 125 P3d 57 (2005), father asserts that, although mother may have demonstrated that relocating was in <em>her </em>best interests, she did not demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that it was in the <em>children\u2019s </em>best interests. Second, father asserts that, because his parenting time will be less frequent and because the quality of his parenting time will suffer if the children are with him during the work week rather than on weekends, \u201cthe move will not [be] in their best interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Mother remonstrates that \u201c[t]he children\u2019s interests were better served by the move to Utah\u201d because \u201c[m]other would have greater employment prospects\u201d in Utah and the children \u201cwould enjoy the physical, financial and emotional assistance of [m]other\u2019s extended family.\u201d For those reasons, and because the children\u2019s relationship with father can be \u201cadequately * * * preserved by the parenting schedule that was orderedt,]\u201d the trial court correctly \u201cruled that[,] in this high conflict case[,] the multiple benefits that are afforded by [m]other\u2019s move outweigh the detriment of giving up an alternating parenting schedule to the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In determining whether to modify a parenting plan to allow a custodial parent to relocate with a child, the trial court \u201cmay consider only the best interests of the child and the safety of the parties.\u201d ORS 107.102(4)(b). Before examining the legal principles that govern that determination, we begin by identifying the appropriate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Historically, in equitable cases such as this one, our review has been <em>de novo. </em>In other words, we have \u201cindependently assess[ed] and evaluate[d] the evidence,\u201d <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Frazier, </em>152 Or App 568, 572, 955 P2d 272, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 305 (1998), and have \u201creweigh[ed] the facts and reassess[ed] the persuasive force of the evidence,\u201d <em>Marvin Wood Products v. Callow, </em>171 Or App 175, 180, 14 P3d 686 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">As pertinent to the dispositive issue in this case, in <em>Cooksey, </em>we explicitly held that the then-extant version of ORS 19.415(3)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> mandated that we review a trial court\u2019s best interests determination <em>de novo. </em>Specifically, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">\u201c[W]e review the trial court\u2019s best interests determinations <em>de novo. </em>ORS 19.415(3). There is, to be sure, some very strong phrasing in the cases concerning the \u2018discretion\u2019 of. trial courts to make such determinations. <em>See, e.g., Meier </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>[and Meier, </em>286 Or 437, 446, 595 P2d 474 (1979)] (relocation decisions are \u2018weighted with the presumption that the court has properly exercised its judicial discretion in determining what is for the best interest of the child\u2019); <em>Willey [and Willey, </em>155 Or App 352, 355, 963 P2d 141 (1998)] (\u2018Determining whether to impose a [relocation] restriction is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019). Giving such phrasing literal import, however, cannot be reconciled with the statute that controls our standard of review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><em>Cooksey, </em>203 Or App at 172 (fifth brackets in <em>Cooksey).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In 2009, the legislature amended ORS 19.415(3)\u2014 on which our holding in <em>Cooksey </em>had been predicated \u2014 to make <em>de novo </em>review in equitable cases <em>discretionary </em>rather than mandatory. Specifically, ORS 19.415(3)(b) now provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">\u201c[u]pon an appeal in an equitable action or proceeding other than an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, the Court of Appeals, acting in its sole discretion, <em>may </em>try the cause anew upon the record or make one or more factual findings anew upon the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">(Emphasis added.) In light of that amendment, we must revisit the issue of the proper standard of review of a trial court\u2019s best interests determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In doing so, however, we are not writing on a clean slate. As we explained in <em>Cooksey, </em>the Supreme Court, in <em>Meier, </em>addressed the standard by which an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s best interests determination. Specifically, in <em>Meier, </em>the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he determination whether to permit or prohibit removal of the child from the state is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, the paramount consideration being the best interests of the [c]hild.\u201d 286 Or at 445 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court further explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">\u201c[i]t is also well-settled in Oregon that in making the determination of the best interests of the child, the trial judge is in a far better position to weigh the various factors which enter into the problem, and his decision should not lightly be disturbed by a court on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Further, following the 2009 amendments to ORS 19.415(3), we have indicated, in related contexts, that, when a trial court makes a determination that is based on the court\u2019s assessment of multiple factors under the particular facts and circumstances of a given case, that determination is properly reviewed for abuse of discretion. For example, in <em>Nice v. Townley, </em>248 Or App 616, 620, 274 P3d 227 (2012), we considered a trial court\u2019s award of custody. As we explained in <em>Nice, </em>in determining the custody of a child, a trial court is required to consider the factors in ORS 107.137(1), which, as we describe below, 251 Or App at 188, are the same factors that the trial court was required to consider in this case. 248 Or App at 621. Noting that \u201c[a] trial court exercises discretion in making a custody award and is in a better position than an appellate court to weigh the factors that enter into that determination,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 620-21, we ultimately held that \u201cthe trial court failed to properly exercise its discretion in making its custody determination under ORS 107.137 because it failed to properly consider the preference in ORS 107.137(l)(e) in favor of the primary caregiver,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Meier </em>and our reasoning in <em>Nice, </em>we conclude that, unless we exercise our discretion to review <em>de novo, </em>our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s best interests determination is for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, we will reverse only if a trial court\u2019s discretionary determination is not a legally permissible one. <em>See McCollum v. Kmart Corporation, </em>228 Or App 101, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>113-14, 207 P3d 1200 (2009), <em>vac\u2019d, on other grounds, </em>347 Or 707, 226 P3d 703 (2010) (\u201c\u2018Abuse of discretion,\u2019 as a legal term of art, means that the court\u2019s action or decision was not \u2018within the range of legally correct discretionary choices\u2019 and did not produce a \u2018permissible legally correct outcome.\u2019\u201d <em>(quoting State v.

Specifically, ORS 107.137(1) provides that, in making a best interests determination, the court \u201cshall consider the following relevant factors,\u201d none of which, alone, is dispositive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201c(a) The emotional ties between the child and other family members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201c(b) The interest of the parties in and attitude toward the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c(c) The desirability of continuing an existing relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201c(d) The abuse of one parent by the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201c(e) The preference for the primary caregiver of the child, if the caregiver is deemed fit by the court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\u201c(f) The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child. * * *\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The court\u2019s discretion is also informed by \u201cthe legislative directive to, in reviewing a parenting plan, \u2018recognize the value of close contact with both parents and encourage, when practicable, joint responsibility for the welfare of [the] children and extensive contact between the minor children *** and the parties.\u2019 ORS 107.105(1)(b).\u201d <em>Maurer and Maurer, </em>245 Or App 615, 628, 262 P3d 1175 (2011) (brackets in original). Further, Oregon has a public policy preference to \u201c[a]ssure minor children of frequent and continuing contact with parents who have'shown the ability to act in the best interests of the child,\u201d ORS 107.101(1), and to \u201c[e]ncourage such parents to share in the rights and responsibilities of raising their children,\u201d ORS 107.101(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the dispositive issue in this case \u2014 that is, whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that relocating to Utah was in the children\u2019s best interests. At the outset, we note that father does not contend that, in making its best interests determination, the trial court failed to consider the factors in ORS 107.137(1) or the public policy to ensure a child\u2019s frequent contact with his or her parents.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Instead, father contends that the trial court\u2019s best interests determination was legally erroneous because (1) mother demonstrated only that relocating was in her best interests and not the children\u2019s and (2) his parenting time will be less frequent and the quality of that time will be diminished. For the reasons explained below, we reject both of father\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We begin with father\u2019s contention that mother demonstrated only that relocating was in her best interests and not the children\u2019s. In support of that contention, he relies on our decisions in <em>Herinckx, Cooksey, </em>and <em>Fedorov, </em>in which the custodial parents were not allowed to relocate because they had failed to demonstrate that relocating was in their children\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Contrary to husband\u2019s assertion, however, this case is materially distinguishable from <em>Herinckx, Cooksey, </em>and <em>Fedorov, </em>because there is evidence that relocating to Utah will benefit the children and mother\u2019s ability to care for them. As the trial court explained, because mother \u2014 the custodial and primary parent \u2014 has a \u201cbona fide *** job offer\u201d in Utah, mother and the children\u2019s standard of living will improve if they move to Utah. Moreover, as the court reasoned, the children would be better served by living near mother\u2019s extended family because (1) the children already had established relationships with mother\u2019s extended family; (2) mother\u2019s extended family had and would continue to provide emotional and financial support to mother and the children; and (3) father was not in a position to \u201csupport [m]other as a parent\u201d if she were required to stay in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In those respects, this case is similar to <em>Maurer. </em>In <em>Maurer, </em>the mother proposed relocating with the parties\u2019 children from Lake Oswego to California. 245 Or App at 617. The mother sought to relocate because she had job opportunities that were unavailable in Oregon and she had extended family in California, including her parents and brother, to whom the children were close and who could provide childcare while the mother was working. <em>Id. </em>at 618-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Ultimately, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s determination that relocating to California was in the children\u2019s best interests. <em>Id. </em>at 616. We reasoned that, because the mother was motivated to move by the need to find employment and because the proximity to her extended family \u2014 to whom the children were bonded \u2014 would benefit the children, \u201cthe move ha[d] significant benefits not only for mother, but also for the children.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Although our review in <em>Maurer </em>was <em>de novo, </em>our reasoning underscores the permissibility of the trial court\u2019s reasoning in this case. Thus, we reject father\u2019s contention that mother demonstrated only that relocating to Utah would be in her best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Father also contends that the trial court\u2019s best interests determination was legally erroneous because, if the children are allowed to relocate to Utah with mother, he will have less frequent parenting time and the children will also have less frequent contact with their siblings and father\u2019s wife, with whom they are bonded and have positive relationships. Relatedly, father is concerned that the quality of his parenting time will suffer as well. Specifically, he contends that, because his parenting time will essentially be determined by the children\u2019s school calendar, the children will necessarily \u201cspend part of their time at [his] home in day care, and without [him], [his wife] or their siblings present for a good portion of the day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Despite father\u2019s concerns about the frequency and quality of his parenting time if mother is permitted to relocate with the children to Utah, the trial court modified the parenting plan to allow father parenting time with the children approximately four times per year, for extended two-week visits. Although the trial court recognized that the children\u2019s relationships with father, their siblings, and father\u2019s wife may suffer in some respects because of their relocation, it determined, as set forth above, that \u201cthe multiple benefits that are afforded by [m]other\u2019s move outweigh the detriment of giving up an alternating parenting schedule to the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Reduced to its fundamental core, father\u2019s appellate contention is that the trial court\u2019s best interests determination was legally erroneous because the trial gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>too little weight to the policies designed to ensure that the noncustodial parent has frequent parenting time. <em>See </em>251 Or App at 189 (describing those policies). However, we conclude that, on this record, the trial court\u2019s determination that the benefits of the move to the children outweighed the costs was not an abuse of discretion. It was a legally permissible determination, justified by reason and evidence. <em>McCollum, </em>228 Or App at 113-14; <em>Forsi, </em>194 Or App at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">As the trial court reasoned, the move can give the children the stability and support that they need. Mother and the children have had limited income; mother has worked, but her work has been part time and she has not made more than $12,000 a year. As a result, mother and the children have been financially dependent on others. The move will put mother and the children on a path to firmer financial ground and, thereby, provide them significant immediate and long-term benefits. The move will make it possible for them to achieve economic self-sufficiency. As the trial court observed, \u201cthe stability and employment\u201d of a primary, custodial parent such as mother \u201cis a critical piece of the child\u2019s success in life.\u201d On this record, the trial court could reasonably determine that the move \u2014 and the associated job opportunity and family support \u2014 would provide the children with the financial and emotional support that would put them in the best possible position, under the circumstances, to succeed in life.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Of course, as the trial court recognized, the move will have costs for the children; most significantly, it will alter their time with father, his wife, and their siblings. The trial court considered the costs of the move, and, after reasonably focusing on the fact that father was not in a position to support mother as a parent and had difficulty maintaining stable and consistently positive relationships, determined that the benefits of the move outweighed the costs. That determination was not outside the bounds of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In sum, whether it is in the best interests of a child to relocate with the custodial parent is a determination that we generally review for abuse of discretion. To be sure, on any particular constellation of facts (even uncontroverted facts), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>rational factfinders, weighing the pertinent considerations differently, may ultimately make different \u2014 albeit legally permissible \u2014 determinations as to what is in a child\u2019s best interests. Here, the trial court assessed the required statutory considerations and determined that it is in the children\u2019s best interests to relocate to Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> Although mother has not interfered with father\u2019s parenting time, she has not always facilitated phone contact between father and the children and does not always respond to father\u2019s e-mails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\"> In addition to mother\u2019s parents, mother\u2019s sister and niece lived in Oregon, as did her brother and sister-in-law.
