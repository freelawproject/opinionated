J.</author>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Defendant appeals her conviction for possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), ORS 475.894, assigning error to the denial of her motion to suppress evidence of that offense. She contends that that evidence was obtained as the result of an unlawful seizure of her person following a traffic stop of a car in which she was a passenger. As explained below, we conclude that defendant was unlawfully seized in that, as of the time of the stop, the totality of the circumstances did not support reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed methamphetamine. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The trial court rendered extensive and detailed findings regarding the circumstances material to the suppression motion, and we recite the facts consistently with those findings. On August 17, 2007, Corporal Ruble of the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office was on patrol in Riddle at 1:45 a.m. He saw a car in which defendant was a passenger cross over the center line three times and, consequently, initiated a traffic stop for failure to drive within a lane. ORS 811.370(l)(a). Ruble approached the car and asked for both the driver\u2019s license and registration and proof of insurance and for defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. As he was obtaining those documents, Ruble, who was a certified drug evaluator, noticed that defendant was exhibiting various physical manifestations consistent with recent drug use. Specifically, defendant was \u201cvery \u2014 extremely fidgety,\u201d her movements were \u201cvery fast and random,\u201d her pupils were \u201clarger than normal,\u201d and she was \u201cvery talkative.\u201d Based on those observations, coupled with his training and experience, Ruble believed that defendant was \u201cobviously under the influence of a [central nervous system] stimulant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">After obtaining defendant\u2019s and the driver\u2019s licenses and other documents, Ruble returned to his patrol car, where he contacted dispatch. The ensuing records check indicated no \u201cwants or warrants.\u201d Ruble then returned to the car, returned the licenses and other documents, and asked the driver to step out of the car. He told the driver that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance and asked if there were drugs or weapons in the car. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the driver responded in the negative, Ruble obtained the driver\u2019s consent to search the car. During the ensuing search, Ruble found a duffle bag, which defendant identified as hers. Ruble then asked for, and obtained, defendant\u2019s consent to search the bag. Inside that bag was a small tin can containing small bags that contained a \u201cwhite crystal-like substance,\u201d which proved to be methamphetamine. After Ruble advised defendant of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendant made inculpatory statements pertaining to her possession of the methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine. She moved to suppress the contents of the duffle bag and her inculpatory statements. In support of that motion, defendant argued that (1) Ruble stopped defendant by obtaining her driver\u2019s license; (2) that stop was unlawful because, as of the time that he obtained her license, Ruble lacked reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal conduct (specifically, possession of a controlled substance); and (3) defendant\u2019s consent to the search of the duffle bag was the unattenuated product of that unlawful stop. With respect to the asserted lack of reasonable suspicion, defendant argued, alternatively if imprecisely, that (a) Ruble\u2019s observations that led him to believe that she was under the influence of a controlled substance occurred <em>after </em>he stopped her and, therefore, could not justify the stop; and (b) in all events, even if defendant were under the influence of a controlled substance, that, without more, was insufficient to support objectively reasonable suspicion that she \u201cwas in <em>possession </em>of illegal drugs at the time of the stop.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The state remonstrated that Ruble\u2019s observations of defendant\u2019s manifestations of recent drug use antedated any stop and supported reasonable suspicion of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. The state further, and alternatively, asserted that defendant\u2019s consent was not the result of any exploitation of any stop (lawful or otherwise) because Ruble was, in all events, going to ask for defendant\u2019s consent because of the observations he made of her.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Ruble testified at the ensuing suppression hearing. One aspect of his testimony is especially pertinent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the trial court\u2019s disposition and our review. After Ruble explained why he believed, based on his observations, that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: *** [W]hat is the correlation between her being under the influence and her being in violation of a drug law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201c[RUBLE]: People who usually are under the influence had to obviously take the methamphetamine. It\u2019s very common that they have pipes, needles, syringes, paraphernalia with them when they are under the influence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: And *** how have you discovered that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201c[RUBLE]: Through my training and experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">In opposing suppression, the state\u2019s sole theory pertaining to possession of a controlled substance was one of <em>present </em>possession \u2014 that is, that, given Ruble\u2019s testimony relating to possession of paraphernalia, Ruble had reasonable suspicion, as of the time that he obtained and ran the records check on defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, that defendant possessed methamphetamine in the form of residue on implements or paraphernalia in her possession. The state did not advance (at least in any cogent sense) and rely on a theory of <em>immediate past possession </em>\u2014 that is, that, given that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance, that circumstance supported reasonable suspicion that defendant had just committed the crime of possession of methamphetamine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The trial court denied suppression, reasoning that Ruble, based on his extensive drug recognition experience and expertise, could reasonably determine that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>was under the influence of a controlled substance. Further, again relying on Ruble\u2019s testimony, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">\u201cOfficer Ruble, who has extensive experience in drug investigations * * * indicated that individuals on methamphetamine have to ingest the substance and often have on them pipes, syringes and needles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cHere the Defendant was under the influence currently of a [central nervous system] stimulant and it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the Defendant was in possession of the instrumentalities used to ingest the substance itself <em>which contained evidence of the crime itself, methamphetamine, such as the residue.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201cAnd it is a fair inference from [Ruble\u2019s] testimony that she would have either \u2014 very commonly he indicated that individuals in that situation had on them, and I think it\u2019s a fair reading and understanding of his testimony, it\u2019s very common for people under the influence of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, to have the items used to ingest that, including needles, syringes or pipes, <em>which could contain the controlled substance itself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\u201cThe Court finds thatthese are common sense conclusions from the officer\u2019s testimony and that he believed in the situation that based upon his training and experience and his observations at the time that an individual under the influence of a [central nervous system] stimulant <em>would have substance with them, including or as part of the delivery system, whether it\u2019s a syringe, needle or pipe.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">(Emphases added.) Thus, and consistently with the state\u2019s advocacy of a \u201cpresent possession\u201d theory of reasonable suspicion, the trial court\u2019s <em>sole </em>rationale for determining that Ruble\u2019s stop of defendant was supported by reasonable suspicion was that a person \u201cunder the influence of a [central nervous system] stimulant would have the substance with them, including or as part of the delivery system, whether it\u2019s a syringe, needle or pipe.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was subsequently convicted, following a jury trial, of possession of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>On appeal, as before the trial court, defendant advances arguments pertaining to the timing and alleged unlawfulness of the stop and to the relationship between the purportedly unlawful stop and her consent to the search of the duffle bag that yielded the methamphetamine and other inculpatory evidence. However, her current arguments vary from her former in some respects. For example, although defendant argued to the trial court that she was stopped when Ruble \u201cobtained\u201d and \u201cretained\u201d her license, on appeal she asserts that \u201cdefendant was stopped when Ruble <em>asked for her driver\u2019s license, </em>or, in the alternative, when he obtained the license and conducted a records check.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Proceeding from that first, alternative (\u201casked for\u201d) proposition \u2014 which was never raised before the trial court \u2014 defendant contends that, as of the time Ruble requested her license, he had not yet observed her manifestations of drug use, and, thus, even if those observations could otherwise support reasonable suspicion (which she disputes), they occurred <em>after </em>the \u201cstop.\u201d Defendant also contends \u2014 reprising her position before the trial court \u2014 that, even if the stop did not occur until after Ruble obtained her identification for use in the records check, Ruble\u2019s antecedent observations were insufficient to support reasonable suspicion of possession of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The state, for its part, also varies \u2014 or, more precisely, supplements \u2014 its contentions before the trial court. In addition to reiterating its position that Ruble had reasonable suspicion with respect to <em>present </em>possession of a controlled substance (in the form of methamphetamine residue on paraphernalia likely in defendant\u2019s possession), the state now alternatively posits that, at least, there was reasonable suspicion that defendant <em>\u201crecently unlawfully possessed </em>a controlled substance * * * just as the presence of someone else\u2019s blood on a person\u2019s hands might support a reasonable suspicion that the person was involved in an unlawful, violent act.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state does not explicitly cast that \u201crecent past possession\u201d rationale as an alternative basis for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We begin by addressing two preliminary matters whose resolution will clarify and simplify the essential question properly presented for our review. Both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>those matters are the products of the parties\u2019 ostensible supplementation of their contentions (or, at least, their coherently developed contentions) before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The first is defendant\u2019s appellate assertion that she was stopped merely by Ruble\u2019s <em>request </em>for her driver\u2019s license \u2014 as opposed to the stop occurring (as defendant argued to the trial court) when Ruble \u201cobtained\u201d and retained her license. Even assuming that the former contention could be deemed to have been somehow ambiently preserved for our review, it fails. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>245 Or App 186, 191, 263 P3d 344 (2011) (\u201c[Although an officer effects a stop by asking a person for identification and then contacting dispatch to \u2018run\u2019 the information, or by asking and retaining identification for investigatory purposes, merely asking for identification, in the absence of other circumstances manifesting a show of authority, does not amount to a stop.\u201d (Citations omitted.)); <em>State v. Harper, </em>197 Or App 221, 235, 105 P3d 883 (2005) (\u201cAlthough a request for identification does not, by itself, transform an encounter into a stop, an officer\u2019s retention of a person\u2019s identification for investigatory purposes during questioning restrains the person from leaving and, therefore, constitutes a stop.\u201d (Citation omitted.)). Here, Ruble did not engage in any show of authority materially distinguishable from the conduct of the officers in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Harper. </em>Accordingly, and consistently with our precedents, the stop in this case occurred when Ruble obtained and retained defendant\u2019s license to run the records check.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The second \u201cdeck-clearing\u201d matter relates to the state\u2019s alternative \u201crecent past possession\u201d theory of reasonable suspicion. As noted, the state does not expressly denominate that contention as an alternative basis for affirmance \u2014 but that is, functionally, precisely what it is. That is, the state proffers that contention \u2014 which was never cogently presented or developed before the trial court \u2014 as an alternative ground for affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of suppression, in the event that we reject the \u201cpresent (methamphetamine residue on retained paraphernalia) possession\u201d rationale, which was the trial court\u2019s sole basis for determining that the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>We decline, as a prudential matter, to address and decide that proffered alternative basis for affirmance. As we have noted elsewhere, \u201c[u]nder <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001), our consideration of an alternative basis for affirmance is a matter of prudential discretion and not compulsion.\u201d <em>Biggerstaff v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 46, 56, 245 P3d 688 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">We so decline in this instance because, frankly, the state\u2019s belated and still-cursory contention may well implicate an ostensible unresolved tension between and among decisions of this court bearing on the proper relationship between evidence that a person is presently under the influence of a controlled substance and either probable cause or reasonable suspicion of possession of a controlled substance. <em>Compare, e.g., State v. Blount, </em>143 Or App 582, 589, 924 P2d 860, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 488 (1996) (highly experienced officer\u2019s observations that the defendant appeared to be under the influence of methamphetamine, in combination with the defendant\u2019s location and lack of alternative explanation that \u201csomeone other than [the] defendant had introduced the methamphetamine into [the] defendant\u2019s body,\u201d established probable cause to arrest for possession of methamphetamine; as matter of objectively reasonable belief, officer was entitled to infer that the defendant had probably \u201cpossessed methamphetamine before introducing it into his body\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>with State v. Morton, </em>151 Or App 734, 739, 951 P2d 179 (1997), <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 521 (1998) (officer lacked reasonable suspicion that the defendant passenger had unlawfully possessed marijuana, notwithstanding the officer\u2019s observations of the defendant\u2019s appearance and behavior that were consistent with being under the influence of marijuana),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>and State v. Lavender, </em>93 Or App 361, 363, 364, 762 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>1027 (1988) (holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that experienced officer\u2019s observations that the defendant was \u201cunder the influence of either methamphetamine or cocaine\u201d did not, by itself, establish probable cause \u201cto believe that [the defendant] had committed a crime\u201d). <em>Accord State v. Holcomb, </em>202 Or App 73, 75, 78, 121 P3d 13, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>203 Or App 35, 125 P3d 22 (2005) (officer lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant who was not under the influence of a controlled substance but who had track marks on her arm \u201cindicative of intravenous drug use\u201d; explaining that \u201cthe state\u2019s position on this record, if accepted, would effectively sanction nonparticularized, status-based stops of habitual drug users\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 78 n 2 (reserving issue of \u201cwhether, or to what extent, the assessment of reasonable suspicion would differ if the person subjected to the stop were under the influence of a controlled substance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In short, the state\u2019s present, almost parenthetical, alternative contention implicates matters that are far from parenthetical. Even assuming that the development of the factual record before the trial court would not have been materially affected if that contention had been raised initially, <em>see Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc., </em>331 Or at 659-60, the fact remains that to address that contention meaningfully would require us, in the first instance\u2014 without legal record development or any real assistance from the parties \u2014 to decide difficult, nuanced, and systemically significant issues. We respectfully decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We proceed to the crux of the dispute: At the time that Ruble obtained defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license to run the records check, was that stop supported by reasonable suspicion that defendant <em>presently </em>possessed methamphetamine? When deconstructed, the trial court\u2019s resolution of that question rests on five interlocking premises:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">(1) Defendant was under the influence of a central nervous system stimulant <em>{e.g., </em>methamphetamine);</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">(2) People who are under the influence of methamphetamine commonly also possess the implements or paraphernalia of methamphetamine use;</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>(3) Those implements are commonly retained and reused;</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">(4) Because those implements are retained and reused, they will bear evidence of prior uses; and</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">(5) That retained evidence of prior use will include traces of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The first two of those premises are based expressly on Ruble\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing, including his recitation of his training and expertise as a certified drug recognition evaluator, his observations of defendant, and his experience in drug-related investigations. The last three of those premises are inferences derived, in turn, from Ruble\u2019s testimony and, successively, from one another. If the premises collectively are impermissibly speculative, or if any of the premises is individually insupportable, the stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion. <em>See generally State v. Bivins, </em>191 Or App 460, 466-71, 83 P3d 379 (2004) (addressing \u201cstacking of inferences\u201d in context of review of denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal and concluding that \u201cthe state\u2019s evidence falls on the side of speculation, not reasonable inference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In many of our opinions addressing the legal sufficiency of multiple, inferentially interdependent premises to support a conclusion, the metaphorical motif has been \u201ca bridge too far.\u201d That is, in a classic \u201cstacking of inferences\u201d sense, the totality of the construct is too tenuous and attenuated to produce the requisite result with the requisite degree of (nonspeculative) confidence. <em>See, e.g., Bivins, </em>191 Or at 466-71. To some extent, that analysis could apply here. Although the first premise (that defendant was under the influence of a central nervous system stimulant) is solidly grounded in Ruble\u2019s drug recognition evaluation expertise, even the second premise (that persons under the influence of <em>methamphetamine </em>commonly possess implements of <em>that </em>use) partakes both of unamplified \u201ctraining and experience\u201d data<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and of an implicit assumption, <em>viz., </em>that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>was under the influence of methamphetamine, as opposed to some other central nervous system stimulant (e.g., cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In all events, the third premise (that persons under the influence of methamphetamine will not only <em>possess </em>implements of methamphetamine use but will also <em>retain </em>the implements of recent use) is innately inferential. Ruble did not expressly testify as to retention and reuse; rather, such an inference can only be derived from what is implicit in his testimony and, especially, the juxtaposition of the first sentence of his pertinent response (\u201cPeople who usually are under the influence had to obviously take the methamphetamine.\u201d) with the second (\u201cIt\u2019s very common that they have pipes, needles, syringes, paraphernalia with them when they are under the influence.\u201d). A reasonable person could so construe Ruble\u2019s testimony, but that construction is hardly patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">That leaves the final two interdependent premises\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that retained implements of recent methamphetamine use will bear evidence of prior uses and that the evidence (for purposes of reasonable suspicion of <em>present </em>unlawful possession of methamphetamine) will include detectable traces of methamphetamine. And it is at this point that the applicable motif shifts from \u201ca bridge too far\u201d to \u201ca bridge never built.\u201d Nothing in Ruble\u2019s testimony (which was the only evidence proffered in the suppression hearing) substantiates the first of those propositions, much less the dispositive final premise. Nothing in that testimony refers to methamphetamine traces or residue on implements in users\u2019 possession, much less the frequency of that occurrence (if, in fact, it does occur). Thus, even if one could somehow posit\u2014 based on some sort of \u201ccommon experience\u201d \u2014 that, unless cleaned, implements and utensils often bear traces of prior use <em>{e.g., </em>dried mud on a spade or encrusted mustard on a spreading knife), there is absolutely no basis in this record from which one can infer, without resorting to speculation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>that that generic proposition applies specifically to methamphetamine use, yielding an objectively reasonable prospect that implements of recent use will bear or contain detectable traces of the controlled substance. <em>That </em>\u201cbridge\u201d was never \u201cbuilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The trial court thus erred in concluding that Ruble\u2019s stop of defendant was supported by reasonable suspicion because Ruble could reasonably have concluded that defendant \u201cwas in possession of the instrumentalities used to ingest the substance itself which contained *** methamphetamine, such as the residue.\u201d Further, defendant\u2019s consent to search the duffle bag occurred dhring the course of that unlawful stop, establishing the \u201cminimum factual nexus\u201d between the unlawful stop and the evidence (including the derivative inculpatory statements) that defendant seeks to suppress. <em>See State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 34-35, 115 P3d 908 (2005).
