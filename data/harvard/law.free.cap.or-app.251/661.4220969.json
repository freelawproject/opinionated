Perez-Chi, </em>241 Or App 344, 255 P3d 497 (2011), <em>vac\u2019d, </em>351 Or 403 (2011), for reconsideration in light of <em>State v. Lopez-Minjarez, </em>350 Or 576, 260 P3d 439 (2011). In our prior decision, we reversed and remanded defendant\u2019s convictions for felony murder and robbery because the trial court had given the jury the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d jury instruction that we had held to be legally erroneous in <em>State v. Lopez-Minjarez, </em>236 Or App 270, 286-87, 237 P3d 223, <em>modified on recons, </em>237 Or App 688, 240 P3d 753 (2010), <em>aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>350 Or 576, 260 P3d 439 (2011). <em>Perez-Chi, </em>241 Or App at 345. On reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s overriding analysis in <em>Lopez-Minjarez, </em>we adhere to our prior disposition and again reverse and remand defendant\u2019s convictions for felony murder and robbery. In adhering to our prior disposition, we affirm defendant\u2019s remaining convictions, remand for resentencing, and dismiss the state\u2019s cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In <em>Lopez-Minjarez, </em>the defendant had been convicted of burglary, kidnapping, second-degree assault, aggravated murder, and two counts of felony murder for which the predicate felonies were burglary and kidnapping. 350 Or at 579. The defendant\u2019s testimony established that he participated, along with his father, in the burglary, kidnapping, and assault of the victim, but the defendant claimed that he had not participated in his father\u2019s act of murdering the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 580-81. The defendant claimed that he had been in the bathroom of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant when his father drove the victim to a remote location and shot him. <em>Id. </em>at 581. The state\u2019s theory was that it did not matter who had murdered the victim, because the defendant was sufficiently involved to be criminally responsible for the resulting crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201c[a] person who aids and abets another in committing a crime *** is also criminally responsible for any act or other crime that [was] committed as a natural and probable consequence of the planning, preparation, or commission of the intended crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The Supreme Court began its analysis by agreeing with this court that the \u201cnatural and probable consequences\u201d jury instruction was an affirmative misstatement of the law. <em>Id. </em>at 583; <em>see also </em>236 Or App at 282. The court then went on to determine that the trial court\u2019s error in giving that instruction was harmless with respect to the defendant\u2019s burglary conviction, because that conviction was chronologically \u201cfirst in time\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">\u201cSaid another way, in this case, the jury could not have found the burglary to have been a natural and probable consequence of an earlier crime that defendant had aided in committing, because there was no earlier crime in the sequence of charged criminal acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 586. The court then concluded that the instruction had not been harmless with respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction for assault, but that it was harmless with regard to his conviction for kidnapping, because the defendant \u201cconceded his direct participation in that crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587. The court also concluded that the instruction was not harmless with respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder. <em>Id. </em>at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The court then turned to the defendant\u2019s convictions for felony murder, and it concluded that the erroneous instruction had prejudiced the defendant with respect to those convictions. As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cIn this case, defendant was charged with two counts of felony murder based on defendant or his father having caused the victim\u2019s death in the course of and in furtherance of, respectively, defendant\u2019s commission of first-degree burglary and first-degree kidnapping. As we have described, the erroneous instruction did not affect defendant\u2019s convictions on those charges. Having found defendant guilty of burglary and kidnapping, the evidence would have permitted the jury to further find that a participant in those underlying felonies (either defendant or his father) caused the victim\u2019s death in the course of and in furtherance of the underlying felonies. If the jury did so find, defendant was guilty of felony murder, and the jury\u2019s verdicts on felony murder would be consistent with Oregon law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201cBut the fact that the jury could have convicted defendant of felony murder on a proper legal theory, given these facts, is not a complete answer to the harmless error issue. The question remains whether the jury also could have convicted defendant of felony murder on a legally incorrect theory, pursuant to the erroneous natural and probable consequences instruction. We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that the jury could have done so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\">\u201cAs noted, felony murder requires the jury to find that a participant in one of several specified felonies caused the victim\u2019s death * * * \u2018in the course of and in furtherance of the crime that the person was committing or attempting to commit[.]\u2019 ORS 163.115(l)(b). The requirement that the homicide be in the course and furtherance of the predicate felony is a familiar concept from the common-law crime of felony murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201cWhether the felony was completed, terminated, or withdrawn from \u2014 any of which can be sufficient to break the causal connection between the felony and the homicide\u2014 generally depends on whether the homicide is incidental to the felony or part of a continuing sequence of events. *** That determination ordinarily is a question of fact for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201cHere, if the jury believed defendant\u2019s testimony, the jury could have found that defendant\u2019s participation in the predicate felony offenses (burglary and kidnapping) ended when defendant got out of the truck at McDonald\u2019s and his father drove away with the victim. In effect, defendant could have been found to have withdrawn from the felony in a way sufficient to break, at least for his direct responsibility for felony murder, the series of otherwise continuous events that culminated in the victim\u2019s death. Under a correct understanding of the law, the jury, if it so concluded, then would have acquitted defendant on the felony murder charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">\u201cThe erroneous instruction, however, could have led the jury to nevertheless find defendant guilty by concluding that, although defendant did not commit felony murder because he withdrew from the underlying felony, his father independently continued the felony and committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the victim\u2019s murder in the course of it, thus committing felony murder. The jury could have further concluded that the father\u2019s felony murder was the natural and probable consequence of defendant\u2019s earlier participation in the felonies, for which the jury had found defendant responsible either as a principal or an accomplice. The jury, using the erroneous instruction, then could have found defendant criminally responsible for the felony murder that his father committed. If the jury reasoned through the felony murder charges in that way \u2014 which it could have on this record-\u2014 the jury\u2019s verdict would be based on a legally incorrect theory. The erroneous instruction was therefore prejudicial to defendant on the felony murder convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 588-91 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In this case, defendant was convicted of burglary, robbery, and two counts of felony murder. On remand, neither party contests our prior conclusion that giving the challenged instruction was harmless with regard to defendant\u2019s conviction for burglary. That conclusion is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>LopezMinjarez </em>because, here, the burglary was \u201cfirst in time\u201d in the sequence of charged criminal acts. <em>See </em>350 Or at 586. Accordingly, we adhere to our prior disposition of that conviction. Neither have the parties disputed the effect of giving the erroneous instruction on defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery. We adhere to our prior conclusion that giving the erroneous instruction was not harmless as to that conviction. The robbery occurred after the burglary in the sequence of charged criminal conduct and, unlike in <em>LopezMinjarez, </em>defendant\u2019s testimony here did not unequivocally concede his direct participation in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Instead, the parties have focused their arguments on whether there is sufficient evidence in the record from which the jury could have found that defendant \u201cwithdrew\u201d from the crimes of robbery and burglary underlying his felony murder convictions before his codefendant killed the victim. In the state\u2019s view, the record is not susceptible to such an inference; defendant contends otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We will reverse a conviction if an incorrect jury instruction \u201ccreated an erroneous impression of the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>that, if the jury had believed defendant\u2019s version of the facts, would have affected the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Pine, </em>336 Or 194, 210, 82 P3d 130 (2003). Thus, to assess whether giving the erroneous instruction was harmless with respect to the felony murder convictions, we must determine whether the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on those charges could have been based on the theory of criminal responsibility contained in the instruction. <em>Lopez-Minjarez, </em>350 Or at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The relevant facts were hotly contested at trial, but to determine whether the error in instructing the jury could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict on the particular charges at issue here, we describe defendant\u2019s evidence and theory of the case. Defendant and his codefendant, Absalon Pechcanul, entered the victim\u2019s home and went to the victim\u2019s bedroom, where Pechcanul began searching for money. Defendant had known the victim for years and testified that he considered him a friend. Defendant testified that, after they entered the bedroom, he asked Pechcanul what he was doing, and Pechcanul answered: \u201cNone of your business.\u201d According to defendant, Pechcanul began asking defendant about money and he had replied \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d more than once. During that interaction, Pechcanul noticed the victim sitting up in his bed. Defendant testified that, at that point, \u201cI turned. I was turning to leave the room.\u201d As defendant was doing so, he heard Pechcanul tell the victim, \u201cI told you.\u201d Defendant turned around and saw Pechcanul pointing a gun at the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Defendant testified that he had not known that Pechcanul had a gun until that moment. When he saw the gun, defendant testified that he \u201cstarted walking\u201d toward Pechcanul, because \u201cI thought he was going to hurt my friend,\u201d the victim. As defendant was walking toward him, Pechcanul shot the victim. Defendant fell to the floor next to the victim\u2019s bed, and Pechcanul proceeded to shoot the victim again; the victim\u2019s body fell from the bed onto defendant as he lay on the floor. Defendant testified that, as the victim was being shot, the victim said \u201chelp me Victor. Absalon shot me.\u201d Defendant then saw Pechcanul pointing the gun at him. Defendant \u201cjust turned around. I was shaking and just walk[ed] out of the room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>The completion of, or the withdrawal from, the underlying felony are both sufficient to break the chain of causation required to convict a defendant for felony murder. <em>Lopez-Minjarez, </em>350 Or at 590. Although the jury was not required to believe defendant\u2019s testimony, based on that testimony, the jury could have found that defendant had withdrawn from the robbery before Pechcanul shot the victim. Although defendant ultimately did not leave the room, according to his testimony, he turned back only after the victim awoke, at which point Pechcanul pulled out his gun. Based on defendant\u2019s testimony, the jury also could have found that the burglary \u2014 which was charged as an entry with intent to commit theft \u2014 was complete before Pechcanul shot the victim. Accordingly, although it is possible that the jury convicted defendant under a correct understanding of the law, it nevertheless could have found that the murder was committed not \u201cin the course of and in furtherance of\u2019 the burglary and robbery, but, instead, was the \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">On appeal, convictions for felony murder (Counts 5 and 6) and robbery (Count 8) reversed and remanded; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed. Cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
