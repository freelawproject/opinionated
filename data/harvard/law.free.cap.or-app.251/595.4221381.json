Defendant argues that the state presented no evidence of where he committed the offense, where he resided at the time of the offense, or where he was subsequently arrested. We conclude that, on the record before us, the state failed to establish venue. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant was required to register as a sex offender based on a juvenile adjudication for conduct that, if committed by an adult, would have constituted sexual abuse in the third degree. In late March 2009, defendant was residing at DePaul Treatment Center in Multnomah County. He registered the treatment facility\u2019s address as his residence on March 31. That same day, he left the treatment facility. There was no evidence of his whereabouts for the following 21 days. On April 21, he was arrested and ultimately lodged in the Inverness Jail in Multnomah County. The record does not reflect where defendant was arrested or which law enforcement agency effected the arrest. Defendant remained in the Inverness Jail until at least May 11. On that date, Officer Reagan of the Portland Police Bureau \u201ccontacted [defendant] at jail *** [and] re-registered him at Inverness Jail, using that address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Defendant was subsequently charged with failure to report as a sex offender. The indictment alleged that defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201con or between March 31, 2009 and May 11, 2009, in the County of Multnomah, State of Oregon, being a person who was required by law to report in person, as a sex offender, *** within 10 days of a change of residence, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>changed residence, and having knowledge of the reporting requirement, did unlawfully and knowingly fail to report in person, as required, to an appropriate agency or official * * * <em>\u00bb</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">At trial, after the prosecution had rested its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the state had failed to prove venue in Multnomah County. Defendant asserted that \u201cthey have no idea where [defendant] was during the intervening period of time,\u201d that is, the time between leaving the treatment facility and landing in jail. Further, defendant argued that, under <em>State v. Macnab, </em>222 Or App 332, 194 P3d 164 (2008), the factfinder could not properly infer that defendant remained in Multnomah County during the \u201ctime he was supposed to register and did not register.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The state responded that a factfinder could permissibly infer that defendant continued to live in Multnomah County during that time period because defendant had \u201cconsistently lived\u201d there before that period and was jailed there afterward. In addition, the state argued that the period of time during which defendant was unaccounted for was a mere three weeks, whereas in <em>Macnab </em>it was three years. Thus, the state asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to think that he set up residence in another [county] during that three-week period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The trial court framed the issue like so: \u201c[T]he question is, where is the crime of not registering committed?\u201d The court reasoned that, \u201cwherever you are after you haven\u2019t registered on a change of address, you are committing the crime, sort of on a continuous basis.\u201d Thus, because defendant was in jail in Multnomah County for a portion of time while he was \u201cout of compliance,\u201d the court concluded that venue could be established in Multnomah County. It consequently denied defendant\u2019s motion. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>On appeal, defendant renews his argument that the state failed to prove venue. He relies principally on <em>State v. Depeche (A139293), </em>242 Or App 155, 163, 255 P3d 502 (2011), which held that the crime of failure to report as a sex offender occurs \u201cliterally at midnight on the tenth day after defendant changed his residence\u201d and that venue therefore lies in whichever county the defendant was located at that time. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the state adduced no direct evidence showing where he was at midnight on April 10. Nor, according to defendant, did the state present facts from which defendant\u2019s location could be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The state, in its brief, argues only that \u201cthere was evidence that defendant committed the offense in Multnomah County because defendant was in a jail located in Multnomah County for 20 [days] of the 30-day period that he failed to register as a sex offender.\u201d In other words, the state adopts the trial court\u2019s reasoning that the crime of failure to report as a sex offender is committed on an ongoing basis after the 10-day grace period expires and defendant has failed to register. Thus, in the state\u2019s view, venue can be established anywhere defendant is located after he fails to timely register.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The state also argues, for the first time at oral argument, that defendant committed two separate offenses of failure to report as a sex offender: first, when he left the treatment facility and failed to register within 10 days (by the end of the day on April 10) and, second, when he was sent to jail and failed to register within 10 days (by the end of the day on May 1). The state argues that, because there was evidence establishing that the second of those offenses occurred in Multnomah County, and because the indictment could be read to encompass that offense, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. For the following reasons, we reject the state\u2019s first argument and conclude that its alternate argument was not properly raised or developed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Venue is a material allegation that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Macnab, </em>222 Or App at 335. In evaluating whether the state met that burden, <em>\u201cwe </em>review the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational finder of fact could find that the state had established venue beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and ORS 131.305(1) provide that, in general, venue is proper in the county in which the offense is committed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If it cannot readily be determined in which county the crime took place, ORS 131.325 provides that \u201ctrial may be held in the county in which the defendant resides, or if the defendant has no fixed residence in this state, in the county in which the defendant is apprehended or to which the defendant is extradited.\u201d However, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the factual predicate for alternative venue under ORS 131.325, that is, the state must prove that it could not readily be determined where the offense was committed. <em>State v. Massei, </em>247 Or App 30, 37, 268 P3d 774 (2011); <em>see also Depeche (A139293), </em>242 Or App at 164 n 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The offense of failure to report as a sex offender is set out at ORS 181.599(1), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">\u201cA person who is required to report as a sex offender and who has knowledge of the reporting requirement commits the crime of failure to report as a sex offender if the person fails, as required by ORS 181.595, 181.596, 181.597, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">\u201c(c) Report following a change of residence * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">ORS 181.595 and ORS 181.596 establish sex offender registration requirements for various categories of offenders.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Because defendant stipulated that he was required to register as a sex offender, it is not apparent from the record which statute applies. <em>Compare </em>ORS 181.595(2)(a)(C) (applicable to offender released, discharged, or paroled from a correctional facility), <em>with </em>ORS 181.596(2)(b) (applicable to offender discharged, released, or placed on probation by the court). Nonetheless, the pertinent provisions of those statutes are materially indistinguishable. Both ORS 181.595(3)(b)(A) and ORS 181.596(4)(b)(A) require a qualifying sex offender to \u201creport, in person[,] * * * [w]ithin 10 days of a change of residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Here, the state presented evidence that defendant moved out of the treatment facility on March 31. That was a \u201cchange of residence\u201d triggering the 10-day period in which defendant was required to register a new address. <em>See State v. Cox, </em>219 Or App 319, 323, 182 P3d 259 (2008) (holding that \u201cchange of residence\u201d is complete, and 10-day reporting period begins to run, upon moving out of a prior residence). The state also presented evidence that defendant did not register within 10 days of that move. However, the state presented no direct evidence of where defendant was located at the expiration of that 10-day period. As we held in <em>Depeche, </em>that is the moment that the crime is committed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 242 Or App at 163 (failure to report \u201coccurs in whichever county the defendant is when the time period expires and the defendant has not reported \u2014 that is, at the moment the conduct constituting the crime occurs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\u201c[T]o the extent that the state suggests that an offender * * * commits separate offenses of failing to register simply by being present in multiple counties after having failed to register, we [also] rejected that argument in <em>[Depeche].\u201d Massei, </em>247 Or App at 34. In other words, the crime of failure to report as a sex offender is not an ongoing crime, and defendant\u2019s presence in jail in Multnomah County for a period of time after he had failed to register on April 10 does not establish venue in that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Nor are there sufficient circumstantial facts from which a factfinder could infer that defendant was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Multnomah County at the time he committed the offense on April 10. The fact that defendant\u2019s previous address was in Multnomah County, coupled with the fact that defendant ultimately resurfaced in Multnomah County some three weeks later, does not support a reasonable inference that he was in Multnomah County when the crime was committed. We similarly declined to make such an inference in <em>Macnab. </em>There, the defendant resided in Benton County a year before the offense occurred and also resided in that county two years after the offense occurred. The state argued that it was reasonable to infer that the defendant continued to live in the county during the intervening time; that is, the state sought to establish venue by relying \u201con an assumption of residential inertia \u2014 that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we may safely assume that people do not move.\u201d 222 Or App at 337. We concluded that \u201c[t]here is no evidentiary basis for the assumption\u201d and held that, in the absence of other evidence of the defendant\u2019s whereabouts, a rational factfinder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant continued to live in Benton County. <em>Id.; see also Massei, </em>247 Or App at 36 (evidence that the defendant had registered in Polk County the year before the offense, coupled with evidence that she was arrested in Polk County several weeks after the offense, was \u201ctoo speculative to support a finding of venue\u201d in that county). Here, too, the state relies on defendant\u2019s assumed inertia in order to establish defendant\u2019s location at the time of the offense. That assumption requires too great an inferential leap and cannot satisfy the state\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The state does not advance any argument that it has established venue under the alternative venue provision in ORS 131.325, and, in any event, there was no evidence of where defendant resided on the date of the offense or where he was apprehended. Thus, the state failed to prove venue for the offense committed by defendant on April 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Finally, we come to the state\u2019s alternative theory that defendant committed separate offenses of failure to report as a sex offender and that the second of those offenses was adequately charged and proved in Multnomah County. That argument implicates nuanced legal issues, including questions of statutory construction. Does involuntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>placement in jail qualify as a \u201cchange of residence\u201d within the meaning of ORS 181.599 and related statutes? Does every \u201cchange of residence\u201d trigger the reporting requirement and form the basis for a new offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">As noted, the state did not rely on its alternative theory below. Nor did it develop that argument in its brief. Normally, we do not address new contentions raised for the first time at oral argument. <em>State v. Rivera-Negrete, </em>233 Or App 96, 102, 224 P3d 702 (2009) (\u201cWe will not entertain a new argument asserted for the first time during oral argument before this court.\u201d). Nor do we usually address arguments that are not adequately developed on appeal. That is especially true here, where the state\u2019s new contention raises further, unaddressed questions. The state has not cited the applicable statutes, let alone addressed the interpretive questions inherent in its alternative theory of defendant\u2019s guilt. Thus, even assuming that the state could properly rely on its new theory on appeal, <em>see State v. Burgess, </em>240 Or App 641, 251 P3d 765, <em>rev allowed, </em>351 Or 318 (2011) (declining to affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction on an alternative theory where the state did not advance that theory below), we decline to reach the merits of its argument. Accordingly, because the state failed to establish venue, we must reverse defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\"> The sex offender reporting statutes referenced in this opinion, including ORS 181.599, ORS 181.595, and ORS 181.596 (set out in part below), were amended in 2009 and again in 2011. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2009, ch 204, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, 8, 10; Or Laws 2009, ch 713, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 5, 5a, 15, 21, 24; <em>see also </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 675, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8; Or Laws 2011, ch 547, \u00a7 36.

The state, too, reiterated its argument that \u201cit\u2019s a reasonable inference that he was in Multnomah County during that short time period.\u201d The trial court ultimately determined that, given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>defendant\u2019s otherwise consistent presence in Multnomah County, it was \u201cwithin the jury\u2019s scope to infer that the violation took place in Multnomah County.\u201d Accordingly, it denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> <em>Depeche </em>was decided after the initial briefing in this case.
