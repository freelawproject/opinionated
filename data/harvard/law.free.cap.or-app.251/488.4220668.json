DHS moved for summary judgment, arguing that (1) plaintiffs failed to timely provide DHS with their tort claims notice; (2) plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the statute of limitations; and (3) plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim was barred by the statute of ultimate repose. DHS prevailed on all grounds. We conclude that there are genuine issues of fact for trial regarding whether plaintiffs timely served their tort claims notice and brought a portion of their post-adoption claim; however, we also conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim and parts of their post-adoption claim are barred by the statute of ultimate repose. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Because the trial court granted DHS\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we state the facts most favorably to plaintiffs, the nonmoving parties. <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 408, 939 P2d 608 (1997). Blanca was born in Mexico in 1990. In 1993, Blanca\u2019s birth parents or other relatives brought Blanca into the United States illegally from Mexico. Blanca was then abused by her biological mother, causing DHS to seek and to obtain custody of Blanca. DHS then placed Blanca in the foster care of Lisa and her then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>husband. On October 23, 1996, an Oregon court terminated the parental rights of Blanca\u2019s biological parents, a decision partly based on findings that Blanca had suffered serious abuse in their care.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">While Blanca was in foster care, defendant Dunn was the primary DHS caseworker assigned to Blanca\u2019s case. Defendant Dillner was the DHS caseworker responsible for pursuing Blanca\u2019s American citizenship. On behalf of Blanca, and while DHS was responsible for her care, Dillner prepared and submitted two forms, an 1-360 Petition for Special Immigrant and an 1-485 Application to Register Permanent Resident or Adjust Status, to the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), currently known as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Dillner filed the applications with INS to establish Blanca\u2019s legal residency in the United States, a prerequisite for citizenship. Unfortunately, DHS\u2019s attempt to file the legal residency applications was unsuccessful because of mistakes by DHS employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Once the parental rights of Blanca\u2019s biological parents were terminated, Lisa and her then husband sought to adopt Blanca. Lisa requested that DHS complete the citizenship process for Blanca before the adoption was finalized. Though DHS had been unable to secure citizenship for Blanca, it informed Lisa that Blanca could establish citizenship either through adoption or a court order identifying permanent foster care for Blanca as the permanency plan. While Lisa was Blanca\u2019s foster parent, DHS advised Lisa that Blanca would automatically obtain citizenship once Blanca was adopted because her adoptive parents, Lisa and her then husband, were United States citizens. At no point did DHS explain to Lisa that any further steps were necessary for Blanca to become a citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In May 1999, Blanca\u2019s adoption was finalized. Blanca was then eight years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In 2000, DHS represented to Lisa that, because of the passage of the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 (CCA), codified in relevant part at 8 USC sections 1431 and 1433, Blanca would automatically become a citizen through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>her 1999 adoption.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> DHS also explained to Lisa that, if Blanca needed proof of her citizenship, then Blanca\u2019s new birth certificate, evidence of Lisa\u2019s and her then husband\u2019s citizenship, and the adoption decree would be sufficient under the CCA. Based on DHS\u2019s representations, Lisa and Blanca assumed that Blanca was a United States citizen since her adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In 2006, Blanca applied for a driver\u2019s permit, but her application was denied because her Social Security card had her former last name instead of Catt. Blanca sought to update her Social Security record and to obtain a new card with the name Catt, but the Social Security Administration denied her request because Blanca\u2019s adoption certificate and adoption judgment were insufficient proof of her citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">To obtain adequate proof of Blanca\u2019s citizenship, Lisa filed an N-600 Application for Certificate of Citizenship with USCIS in February 2007. USCIS sent Blanca a letter dated August 2, 2007, denying her request for a certificate of citizenship because Blanca\u2019s original entry into the United States was illegal and Blanca was never lawfully admitted to the United States as a permanent resident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to USCIS\u2019s letter, to obtain United States citizenship for Blanca, Lisa would be required to file an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative, so that Blanca would first become a lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>permanent resident, a prerequisite to citizenship. After receiving USCIS\u2019s letter, Lisa believed that \u201cit was only a matter of paperwork, fees, and time to establish Blanca as a citizen\u201d and it was her \u201cjob * * * to correctly process the paperwork that DHS failed to do correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">On or around November 6, 2007, Lisa filed an 1-130 form with USCIS to request permanent resident status for Blanca. Because the 1-130 form allowed Lisa to petition on behalf of Blanca until Blanca turned 21 years old, Lisa was unaware that, if Blanca\u2019s immigration forms were not processed before Blanca turned 18 years old, she would be subject to \u201cpenalties.\u201d Sometime after June 2009, Lisa was approved to act as Blanca\u2019s agent for her immigrant visa petition, and Lisa paid the fees required for the immigrant visa in September 2009. At that time, Lisa continued to believe that it was \u201cjust a matter of time and more paperwork before Blanca would get an immigrant visa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Also in September 2009, for the first time, Lisa contacted immigration attorneys to assist her with Blanca\u2019s immigrant visa application. An immigration attorney advised Lisa that, because Blanca was over 18 years old and considered an illegal alien, she would need to leave the United States and remain in Mexico for a minimum of three years until a visa was issued to her. The immigration attorney also advised Lisa that, after Blanca turned 19 years old in October 2009, the three-year bar to reenter the United States would increase to 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">On October 6, 2009, plaintiffs sent DHS a tort claims notice that alleged that DHS and its agents had acted negligently and attached a copy of a complaint; DHS received the notice. Plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Multnomah County Circuit Court on October 7, 2009, before Blanca\u2019s nineteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Plaintiffs brought two separate claims for negligence against DHS.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, in plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>claim, as stated in their second amended complaint, they alleged that DHS owed a special duty to plaintiffs and breached that duty when DHS (1) \u00a3\u00a3fail[ed] to properly process Blanca\u2019s permanent residency documentation such that Blanca would become a permanent resident of the United States as a Special Immigrant Juvenile[] ***\u201d; (2) \u00a3\u00a3fail[ed] to properly and timely refile\u201d Blanca\u2019s permanent residency documentation; (3) \u00a3\u00a3fail[ed] to advise [Lisa] and Blanca * * * of the consequences of [DHS\u2019s] failure to obtain permanent residency status for Blanca\u201d; (4) \u00a3\u00a3fail[ed] to advise [Lisa] and Blanca to seek permanent residency status for Blanca before she attained the age of 18\u201d; and (5) made \u201cfalse representations as to Blanca\u2019s citizenship status.\u201d In their post-adoption negligence claim, plaintiffs alleged that DHS was similarly negligent after the adoption was final, with only slight variations from the allegations in their preadoption claim: (1) instead of alleging that DHS failed to properly process the permanent residency documents, plaintiffs alleged that DHS failed to determine whether the applications were successful; (2) instead of alleging that DHS failed to advise plaintiffs of the consequences of the failure to obtain legal permanent residency for Blanca, plaintiffs alleged that DHS failed to tell plaintiffs about the failure; and (3) plaintiffs alleged that DHS also made false representations about Blanca\u2019s permanent residency status and her citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">DHS moved for summary judgment, providing three separate arguments as to why plaintiffs\u2019 claims for relief fail as a matter of law. First, DHS argued that plaintiffs failed to timely provide their tort claims notice as required by ORS 30.275. Second, DHS argued that plaintiffs\u2019 claims for relief are barred by the statute of limitations. DHS asserted that plaintiffs\u2019 action accrued on August 2, 2007, when Lisa received the letter from USCIS indicating that Blanca was not a citizen, and that plaintiffs waited too long \u2014 until October 2009, over two years later \u2014 to provide notice and file their action. Lastly, DHS argued that plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim for relief was barred by the statute of ultimate repose, because DHS\u2019s alleged negligence occurred more than 10 years before plaintiffs filed their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The trial court issued three separate letter opinions in response to DHS\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In its first letter opinion, the trial court granted DHS\u2019s motion for summary judgment on both claims after concluding that, once USCIS had sent the August 2, 2007, letter to Blanca denying her request for certificate of citizenship and plaintiffs had received it, \u201cplaintiffs discovered that defendants were responsible for the injuries that plaintiffs had suffered\u201d and this was sufficient \u201cto trigger the tort claim notice and statute of limitations periods.\u201d The trial court also concluded, alternatively, that plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim was barred by the statute of ultimate repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Plaintiffs asked the trial court to reconsider its rulings. They argued that, even if plaintiffs had discovered their injury in August 2007, Blanca\u2019s tort claims notice was timely because ORS 12.160 tolls claims for minors. Before the trial court entered judgment consistently with its first letter opinion, the court issued a second letter opinion, ruling that Blanca\u2019s preadoption claim survived because she filed her complaint before the limitations period had expired, and Blanca was not required to provide DHS with a tort claims notice for its actions while she was in the state\u2019s custody. However, the court did not address whether the statute of ultimate repose applied. In the trial court\u2019s third letter opinion, it determined that the statute of ultimate repose barred plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim. The trial court then granted DHS\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered a general judgment dismissing all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs assign as error the trial court\u2019s ruling granting summary judgment in favor of DHS. We apply the familiar standard of review: summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact for trial, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ORCP 47 C; <em>Brehm v. Caterpillar, Inc., </em>235 Or App 274, 278, 231 P3d 797, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 245 (2010). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Brehm, </em>235 Or App at 278 (quoting ORCP 47 C). And if there is no issue of material fact in dispute, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling for errors of law. <em>Oregon Southwest, LLC v. Kvaternik, </em>214 Or App 404, 413, 164 P3d 1226 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 390 (2008).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201cThere is no genuine issue of material fact if, \u2018based upon the record before the court viewed in a manner most favorable to the adverse party, no objectively reasonable juror could return a verdict for the adverse party on the matter that is the subject of the motion for summary judgment.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Plaintiffs reprise their three major arguments in the trial court on appeal. First, they argue that they gave timely notice of their tort claims. Blanca contends that the time period for giving notice was tolled for her until she turned 19 years old, and both plaintiffs argue that they discovered an actionable injury in September 2009, once they learned that Blanca was required to leave the United States and to remain in Mexico for years before a visa allowing her to reside in the United States could be issued to her. Second, plaintiffs argue that they timely commenced their action against DHS, arguing that, under the discovery rule, they filed their complaint within two years of discovering their actionable injury in September 2009. Plaintiffs contend that, at least, issues of material fact exist for trial as to when plaintiffs discovered the existence of an actionable injury. Lastly, plaintiffs assert that the statute of ultimate repose did not bar plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim because DHS had a continuing duty to establish Blanca as a citizen until she turned 18 years old. Plaintiffs also assert that an \u201cactive, continuous relationship\u201d of trust existed between DHS and plaintiffs until Blanca turned 18 years old and that that relationship inhibited plaintiffs from timely recognizing the existence of their claims, thereby tolling the application of the statute of ultimate repose. We address plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">A. <em>Timeliness of the Tort Claims Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA) requires that a person seeking to file an action against a public body provide timely notice of his or her intent to do so. ORS 30.275. That section of the OTCA provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201c(1) No action arising from any act or omission of a public body or an officer, employee or agent of a public body within the scope of ORS 30.260 to 30.300 shall be maintained unless notice of claim is given as required by this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u201c(2) Notice of claim shall be given within the following applicable period of time, <em>not including the period, not exceeding 90 days, during which the person injured is unable to give the notice </em>because of the injury or <em>because of minority, </em>incompetency or other incapacity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">\u201c(a) For wrongful death, within one year after the alleged loss or injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">\u201c(b) <em>For all other claims, within 180 days after the alleged loss or injury.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\u00abH? * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201c(8) The requirement that a notice of claim be given under subsections (1) to (7) of this section does not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201c(a)(A) The claimant was under the age of 18 years when the acts or omissions giving rise to a claim occurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201c(B) The claim is against the Department of Human Services or the Oregon Youth Authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201c(C) The claimant was in the custody of the Department of Human Services pursuant to an order of a juvenile court under ORS 419B.150, 419B.185, 419B.337 or 419B.527, or was in the custody of the Oregon Youth Authority under the provisions of ORS 419C.478, 420.011 or 420A.040, when the acts or omissions giving rise to a claim occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">ORS 30.275 (emphasis added). The purpose of the notice period is to allow \u201cthe public body to investigate the claim while the evidence is still fresh and allow[] the public body speedily to correct the defect, if any, out of which the claim allegedly arose.\u201d <em>Perez v. Bay Area Hospital, </em>315 Or 474, 482, 846 P2d 405 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Under the OTCA, the applicable notice period depends on whether the injured person seeking to bring an action against a public body or employee is an adult or a minor. A competent adult plaintiff must provide notice of a claim within 180 days of the actionable injury; however, this 180-day notice period is extended for minors for a period \u201cnot exceeding 90 days, during which the person injured is unable to give the notice *** because of minority[.]\u201d ORS 30.275(2). Thus, according to the plain language of ORS 30.275(2), minors have 270 days after the discovery of their alleged injury or loss to give the public body or employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>notice of tort claims. <em>See also Perez, </em>315 Or at 483 (holding that notice of a child\u2019s claim was untimely when not provided within 270 days after alleged loss or injury, even though the child had no guardian <em>ad litem). </em>Blanca, however, initially contends that ORS 30.275(2) does not govern in her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">1. <em>Tolling based on Blanca\u2019s minority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Blanca contends that the period for a minor to provide a notice of tort claims under the OTCA is controlled by ORS 12.160, a tolling provision concerning the time for persons under a disability to bring a tort action, rather than ORS 30.275(2). In part, ORS 12.160 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201c(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, if a person is entitled to bring an action that is subject to the statutes of limitation prescribed by ORS 12.010 to 12.050, 12.070 to 12.250 or 12.276, and at the time the cause of action accrues the person is a child who is younger than 18 years of age, <em>the statute of limitation for commencing the action is tolled for so long as the person is younger than 18 years of age.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201c(2) The time for commencing an action may not be extended under subsection (1) of this section for <em>more than five years, or for more than one year after the person attains 18 years </em>of age, whichever occurs first.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">(Emphasis added.) Although Blanca\u2019s claims are subject to the statute of limitations in the OTCA for bringing most claims against a public body or public officers and employees, ORS 30.275(9), Blanca contends that the emphasized text in ORS 12.160 establishes that the tort claims notice period was tolled until she turned 19 years old, by which time she had provided DHS notice of her post-adoption claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Blanca relies primarily on <em>Baker v. City of Lakeside, </em>343 Or 70, 82-83, 164 P3d 259 (2007), for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\"><em>Baker </em>concerned whether, in amending the OTCA in 1981, the legislature intended to exempt claims under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the OTCA from the rule that an action is commenced on the day the complaint is filed if the plaintiff serves process on the defendant within 60 days. 343 Or at 72. From <em>Baker, </em>Blanca concludes that ORS 12.160 tolls the time for commencing an action against a public body until the sooner of two events, which in this case is \u201cone year after the person attains 18 years of age.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 82 (stating in <em>dicta </em>that claims subject to the two-year limitations period in the OTCA would be tolled for minors under ORS 12.160). She then argues that, just as the limitations period in ORS 30.275(9) is tolled for minors pursuant to ORS 12.160, the legislature intended tolling of the time for providing a tort claims notice, which is a prerequisite to her action against DHS. Blanca suggests that, without parallel tolling of the time for providing a tort claims notice, the tolling of the limitations period for minors often is, practically speaking, meaningless. Thus, Blanca concludes, because the time for filing a tort claims notice was tolled until she turned 19 years old, her notice to DHS was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">At the same time, Blanca attempts to distinguish <em>Perez, </em>a case concerning whether the 270-day notice period provided in ORS 30.275(2) was tolled until the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the injured minor. Although the Supreme Court concluded that the purpose of allowing minors to have an extra 90 days to provide notice of tort claims \u201cis to recognize a minor\u2019s legal disability and permit the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem,\u201d </em>315 Or at 482, it concluded that, to give meaning to the 90-day extension, the 270-day period is not tolled indefinitely pending the appointment of a guardian <em>ad litem. Id. </em>at 483. Consequently, the minor\u2019s notice in <em>Perez </em>was untimely. <em>Id. </em>Blanca argues that <em>Perez </em>does not control this case because the court did not consider the inconsistency between a 270-day notice period in the OTCA, regardless of the minor\u2019s age at the time of injury, and ORS 12.160, which tolls the limitations period for a minor to commence a tort action until up to one year after the minor attains the age of 18 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">We agree with DHS that, even if there is some inconsistency between ORS 30.275(2) and ORS 12.160, the legislature expressly specified in the OTCA that the notice period is tolled for a period \u201cnot exceeding\u201d 90 days due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>minority. Nothing in the text of that statutory provision suggests that an additional tolling period will apply for minors. In addition to the specificity of the OTCA, the purpose of the notice requirement, recognized in Perez, 315 Or at 482, supports application of the relatively short 270-day notice period.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We also note that the Supreme Court has previously described the interplay between ORS 30.275(2) and ORS 12.160. In <em>Bradford v. Davis, </em>290 Or 855, 861-62, 626 P2d 1376 (1981), the court described the time requirement for providing notice of claims under the OTCA as being independent of the extension of time allowed to minors to commence an action under ORS 12.160:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">\u201cIt is consistent with the remedial policy of the Tort Claims Act to assume that the legislature meant to assure local governments of an early opportunity to investigate claims even by minors, but that thereafter the extension of time to commence an action generally provided to minors and incapacitated persons by ORS 12.160 would apply to the same kinds of actions when brought against a public defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that, under ORS 30.275(2), minors are required to give notice of a tort claim to a public body and its employees within 270 days of the discovery of their alleged injuries, and ORS 12.160 does not toll this notice period.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">2. <em>Tolling based on the discovery rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Having decided that ORS 12.160 did not toll the period for Blanca to provide a tort claims notice to DHS for her post-adoption claim, we turn, next, to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that both Blanca\u2019s and Lisa\u2019s tort claims notice periods were tolled by the discovery rule. As previously noted, the 180-day notice period for adults, and the 270-day notice period for minors, begins to run from the date of the \u201calleged loss or injury.\u201d ORS 30.275(2). This accrual date, however, can be tolled under the discovery rule. <em>Adams v. Oregon State Police, </em>289 Or 233, 238, 611 P2d 1153 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Under the discovery rule, the notice period begins to run when \u201cthe plaintiff <em>knows </em>or, in the exercise of reasonable care <em>should know, </em>facts that would make an objectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>reasonable person aware of a substantial possibility that * * * an injury occurred, the injury harmed one or more of the plaintiff\u2019s legally protected interests, and the defendant is the responsible party.\u201d <em>Edwards v. DHS, </em>217 Or App 188, 197, 175 P3d 490 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis added). The question of whether a plaintiff, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have discovered that she was injured by the tortious act of another is ordinarily a \u201cfactual question for determination by a jury.\u201d <em>Kaseberg v. Davis Wright Tremaine, LLP, </em>351 Or 270, 278, 265 P3d 777 (2011); <em>see Stevens v. Bispham, </em>316 Or 221, 228, 851 P2d 556 (1993) (\u201cDepending on the case, the question of when harm occurs may be a question of fact or a question of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The trial court concluded as a matter of law that plaintiffs discovered their injury in August 2007, upon their receipt of the letter from USCIS. The question before us, then, is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiffs discovered or should have discovered a legally cognizable <em>injury </em>\u2014 i.e., harm, causation, and tortious conduct \u2014 within 180 days (Lisa) or 270 days (Blanca) of their providing their tort claims notice to DHS in October 2009. On appeal, the parties dispute what constitutes plaintiffs\u2019 harm and when plaintiffs discovered or should have discovered that harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In DHS\u2019s view, the harm plaintiffs alleged that they suffered was Blanca\u2019s lack of legal permanent resident status and United States citizenship. DHS asserts that plaintiffs were actually aware that they suffered their harm when they received the August 2007 letter from USCIS informing them that \u201cBlanca [was] not a citizen or legal permanent resident of the United States[,]\u201d making plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims notice untimely.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Plaintiffs argue that, although they became aware that Blanca was not a legal permanent resident or citizen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>when they received the August 2007 letter, they were not aware of their harm until they were informed by the immigration attorney, in September 2009, that Blanca was unable to become a permanent resident \u2014 a requirement for citizenship \u2014 without leaving the United States and remaining in Mexico for three years, initially, and then 10 years once Blanca turned 19 years old. In other words, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, the harm to which DHS subjected plaintiffs was the prospect of Blanca\u2019s removal and exclusion from this country and separation from her home and family for at least a decade before she could become a legal permanent resident. In light of that harm, plaintiffs contend that, at the very least, the date by which they were obligated to provide a tort claims notice to DHS is a jury question. DHS\u2019s rejoinder is that, although plaintiffs were further harmed by Blanca being required to leave the United States once she reached the age of majority, that is not a separate actionable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Although we agree with DHS that, in part, plaintiffs alleged that Blanca\u2019s lack of citizenship, stemming from the failed application for legal permanent resident status, was a harm, we agree with plaintiffs that this case involves a different harm as well. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged two different harms. One was to Blanca\u2019s right to citizenship and a second harm was to Blanca\u2019s right to remain in the United States, without being subjected to deportation proceedings, without being required to travel to Mexico to apply for an immigrant visa, and without being subjected to exclusion from this country for a decade or more to obtain legal permanent residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">With regard to the first type of harm, plaintiffs alleged that, had DHS properly filed the 1-360 and 1-485 forms, Blanca would have become a permanent resident and her initial illegal entry into the United States when she was three years old would have been waived. That, in turn, would have allowed her to become a United States citizen immediately had she applied for naturalized citizenship before she reached age 18. Plaintiffs alleged economic harm, including the legal expenses for immigration counsel and the financial consequences of Blanca\u2019s inability to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>lawfully employed or to receive financial aid to <em>go </em>to college, and extreme emotional distress as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">But plaintiffs also alleged that DHS\u2019s initial improper filing of Blanca\u2019s permanent residency documents (and failure to refile them) and its misleading of Lisa subjected Blanca to \u201cthe necessity of departing [from] the United States\u201d and \u201cthe 10-year bar to reentry to the United States\u201d when she does so. Plaintiffs alleged that they suffered extreme emotional distress due to the fear and uncertainty that came with Blanca\u2019s status as an illegal alien in the United States and the anguish that she would be subject to deportation to Mexico, exclusion from the United States, and lengthy separation from her home and family. In other words, as plaintiffs\u2019 expert explained, Blanca and Lisa were harmed because Blanca was subject to deportation and needed to depart and to remain outside the United States for at least 10 years in order to be allowed to return to the United States legally, absent a waiver based on extreme hardship. That is a separate actionable harm from Blanca\u2019s lack of citizenship. <em>Cf. Gaston v. Parsons, </em>318 Or 247, 260, 864 P2d 1319 (1994) (informed consent claim against doctor was untimely because the plaintiff knew that he had not been informed that a risk of surgery was loss of use of his arm, but claim that doctor negligently performed surgery, although related to consent claim, involved a separate harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">DHS also argues that plaintiffs merely allege that they suffered additional damages, relying on cases in which we have stated that a tort claim \u201c\u2018accrues from the date the injury is, or should have been discovered, not from the time the full extent of damages is ascertained.\u2019\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>217 Or App at 198 (quoting <em>Raethke v. Oregon Health Sciences Univ., </em>115 Or App 195, 198, 837 P2d 977 (1992), <em>rev den, </em>315 Or 442 (1993)). DHS\u2019s argument misses the mark, given our holding that plaintiffs alleged two different harms.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Based on plaintiffs\u2019 second theory of harm, a reasonable jury could easily find on this record that, when they received the letter from USCIS in 2007, neither plaintiff actually knew of the harm, that is, Blanca\u2019s possible removal and the requirement that she leave and remain outside this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>country for at least a decade in order to enter legally. When plaintiffs received the letter, Lisa believed that \u201cit was only a matter of paperwork, fees, and time to establish Blanca as a citizen\u201d and that it was her \u201cjob * * * to correctly process the paperwork that DHS failed to do correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">As instructed by the USCIS letter, Lisa filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative to establish Blanca\u2019s permanent residency, applying for an adjustment of status, and later applied for an immigration visa. Lisa\u2019s application indicated that she believed that she could obtain an adjustment of Blanca\u2019s status. At that point, based on DHS\u2019s prior statements that Blanca was automatically a citizen once she was adopted, plaintiffs believed that it was a matter of paperwork to correct Blanca\u2019s citizenship status. Moreover, based on the Petition for Alien Relative, plaintiffs believed they could file that paperwork for Blanca until she turned 21. In her affidavit, Lisa stated, \u201cI was not aware that there would be penalties for Blanca when she was no longer a minor as form 1-130 (Petition for Alien Relative) allowed me to petition [for] my unmarried child up to age 21.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">As previously noted, the August 2007 letter did not indicate that Blanca would have to leave the country if she was not a legal permanent resident before she turned 18 years old. The fact that the letter informed plaintiffs that Blanca was not a citizen or a legal resident does not necessarily imply that she would have to leave the country if she did not obtain legal residency by the age of 18. Lisa testified that, until September 2009, when she contacted the immigration attorney, she did not understand that (1) \u201cBlanca would be subject to a 3-year, and later a 10-year exclusion if citizenship paperwork was not processed by her attaining age 18 or 19\u201d; and (2) even if Blanca did leave the country for the minimum period of time, \u201cthere was no guarantee that the *** government would actually issue Blanca a visa.\u201d Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, a reasonable jury could conclude that they were unaware of their harm until September 2009, when Lisa obtained immigration counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Although DHS focuses on plaintiffs\u2019 actual knowledge of cognizable harm in 2007, to the extent that DHS contends that plaintiffs should have discovered their claims by seeking legal advice about the consequences of Blanca\u2019s lack of legal permanent resident status and citizenship once they received the letter in 2007, we conclude that is an issue of fact for trial as well. Whether the plaintiff has a duty to inquire about facts that might disclose the existence of an actionable injury at any particular point in time is, generally, a factual question for the jury. <em>Cole v. Sunnyside Marketplace, LLC, </em>212 Or App 509, 521, 160 P3d 1 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 558 (2008). When a plaintiff has a duty to inquire, the jury must determine the point in time when the plaintiff reasonably should have learned that the elements of an actionable injury exist. <em>Greene v. Legacy Emanuel Hospital, </em>335 Or 115, 123, 60 P3d 535 (2002) (if a plaintiff acquires information that \u201conly would cause a reasonable person to inquire whether legally cognizable harm has occurred, the period of limitations would commence at some later point when, after inquiry, the facts reasonably should disclose the existence of an actionable injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">In this case, a reasonable jury could find that, when plaintiffs received the USCIS letter, they did not have a duty to retain an expert, such as a lawyer, to investigate whether they had a claim against DHS related to Blanca\u2019s legal permanent resident status and citizenship and instead acted reasonably by attempting to rectify the situation with immigration authorities. At the time, plaintiffs did not know that Blanca would be subject to years of exclusion from the United States after she turned 18 years old in order to obtain a legal immigrant status in the United States. Plaintiffs had no knowledge of facts indicating that what they thought was Blanca\u2019s relatively easy pathway to legal residency and citizenship was available to her only while she was a minor. The letter from USCIS did not indicate that Blanca would be subject to any immigration penalties; rather, the letter indicated that Lisa was able to act on behalf of Blanca until Blanca was 21 years old and suggested to Lisa that she would be able to correct Blanca\u2019s immigration status. Lisa believed she could correct Blanca\u2019s citizenship status by following USCIS\u2019s instructions without the aid of an attorney. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>cannot say, as a matter of law, that it was unreasonable for plaintiffs to make that assumption and that plaintiffs had an immediate duty to investigate a potential claim against DHS by hiring an immigration lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">We also reject DHS\u2019s argument that, even if plaintiffs were not aware of each specification of negligence relevant to their two claims for relief, their obligation to provide a tort claims notice arose when they became aware of a substantial possibility that they had \u201csuffered <em>some </em>harm as a result of\u2019 DHS\u2019s alleged negligence. <em>Cairns v. Dole, </em>195 Or App 742, 751, 99 P3d 781 (2004) (emphasis in original). DHS notes that plaintiffs were at least aware of some harm \u2014 that Blanca was not an American citizen\u2014 contrary to what DHS had led plaintiffs to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In making that argument, DHS overlooks the import of a second distinct type of harm: Blanca was subject to deportation proceedings, was required to travel to Mexico to apply for an immigrant visa, and was subject to exclusion from this country for a decade or more to obtain legal permanent resident status. <em>See Gaston, </em>318 Or at 260, (\u201c[W]hen two different legally protected interests are at stake, awareness of a violation of one interest does not put a plaintiff on notice as a matter of law of the possible violation of other distinct legally protected interests. Each claim must be analyzed separately to determine if a plaintiff knew or should have known facts that would make a reasonable person aware of a substantial possibility that the legally protected interest had been invaded.\u201d). As previously noted, the summary judgment record reflects evidence from which a jury may conclude that there was a second harm and that plaintiffs acted reasonably when they did not consult an immigration attorney upon receipt of the letter from USCIS in 2007. On this record, a jury must decide the question; we simply cannot say, as a matter of law, that plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge of Blanca\u2019s lack of permanent residency status and citizenship in 2007 triggered the time for providing a tort claims notice concerning the second harm to plaintiffs. Accordingly, the trial court erred in entering summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>judgment in favor of DHS for lack of a timely tort claims notice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">B. <em>Timeliness of the Complaint Under the Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">DHS argues that, even if plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not barred because their tort claims notice was untimely, their claims are nonetheless barred by the statute of limitations, ORS 30.275, because they discovered their claims in August 2007 but filed this action more than two years later, in October 2009. Like the notice period, the statute of limitations can also be tolled by the discovery rule. <em>Stephens v. Bolman, </em>314 Or 344, 349-50, 838 P2d 600 (1992), <em>rev dismissed, </em>324 Or 177 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">DHS\u2019s statute of limitations arguments rely on the same case law and are essentially the same as their arguments that plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims notice was untimely served. As previously explained, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, when plaintiffs should have discovered their actionable injury based on the harm to Blanca\u2019s right to remain in the United States. DHS is not entitled to summary judgment on that portion of plaintiffs\u2019 claims for failing to timely commence the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">C. <em>Statute of Ultimate Repose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Finally, plaintiffs also assign as error the trial court\u2019s alternative ruling that plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim is barred by the statute of ultimate repose. The statute of ultimate repose, ORS 12.115, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">\u201c(1) In no event shall any action for negligent injury to person or property of another be commenced more than 10 years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">DHS asserted and prevailed on its contention that plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim is barred because DHS\u2019s alleged negligent acts occurred more than 10 years before plaintiffs filed their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Unlike the statue of limitations, the discovery rule does not toll the statute of ultimate repose, because it was intended \u201cto provide an overall maximum upper limit on the time within which a tort action could be brought, regardless of the date of discovery or of any other circumstances.\u201d <em>Josephs v. Burns &amp; Bear, </em>260 Or 493, 498, 491 P2d 203 (1971), <em>overruled on other grounds by Smothers v. Gresham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or 83, 23 P3d 333 (2001). But when a plaintiff\u2019s claim is based on violations of a defendant\u2019s continuing, mandatory duty that occurred within the 10-year period, the claim is not barred by the statute of ultimate repose and, therefore, is timely. <em>Little v. Wimmer, </em>303 Or 580, 585, 739 P2d 564 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Relying on <em>Little, </em>plaintiffs contended that DHS had such a continuing duty to them until Blanca turned 18 years old, and so the statute of ultimate repose was inapplicable. The trial court rejected that argument, concluding that, although</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201cplaintiffs did establish certain duties that the state owed the plaintiffs, *** [the court] do[es] not find that those duties are by their terms capable of absorbing the state\u2019s pre-adoption, [discrete] acts of the alleged negligence into a larger, overarching duty that expired only when Blanca reached majority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Plaintiffs also argued that the statute of ultimate repose was tolled because they had a continuous relationship of trust with DHS. The statute of ultimate repose can be tolled by an \u201cactive, continuous relationship\u201d between the defendant and the plaintiff during the period when an action is permitted such that, because of the \u201crelationship of trust and confidence\u201d between the parties, the plaintiff is not in a position to recognize the existence of a claim against the defendant. <em>Cavan v. General Motors, </em>280 Or 455, 457-58, 571 P2d 1249 (1977). The trial court rejected that argument, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">On appeal, plaintiffs reiterate their two arguments as to why their preadoption claim is not barred by the statute of ultimate repose. We first address the continuing-duty argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>1. <em>Continuing Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">As noted above, evidence of a continuous, mandatory duty can be used to avoid the applicability of the statute of ultimate repose. <em>Little, </em>303 Or at 585. In <em>Little, </em>the plaintiffs brought an action against the state for negligent design, construction, and maintenance of a state highway. 303 Or at 583. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligent design and construction were barred by the statute of ultimate repose because the conduct giving rise to those claims occurred 10 years before they filed their complaint. <em>Id. </em>However, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligent maintenance of a highway, including negligent failure to remedy a dangerous condition and failure to warn, were not time-barred because the state had a statutorily mandated, continuing duty to supervise and control the maintenance oil the highway after its construction and through the date of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 585. Plaintiffs argue that <em>Little </em>is analogous to this case. Specifically, they contend that DHS owed mandatory duties to plaintiffs in the form of care, supervision, and services, because Blanca was placed in DHS\u2019s custody before she was adopted, and DHS\u2019s duties continued up until Blanca turned 18 years old, even after her adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">DHS counters that plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Little </em>is misplaced. We understand DHS\u2019s argument to be that plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim is not properly based on violations of a continuing duty on the part of DHS, but, rather, it is based on DHS\u2019s alleged negligent acts that occurred more than 10 years before the action was commenced and that DHS failed to correct before Blanca was adopted. According to DHS, in those circumstances, the statute of ultimate repose bars plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim unless plaintiffs can show a relationship of trust; and, because there is nothing in the record that would permit the conclusion that the parties were in a relationship of trust, plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim is barred. For the following reasons, we agree with DHS that <em>Little </em>does not apply and reject plaintiffs\u2019 continuing, mandatory duty argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Plaintiffs specifically rely on <em>former </em>OAR 413-130-0170(1) (9/17/96), an administrative rule regarding post-adoption services, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cFreeing a special needs child for adoption through [DHS] presupposes a commitment by the agency to the child until the child reaches the age of 18 years or emancipation, whichever comes first. [DHS] assumes an obligation to the child, the adoptive parent(s) and to the family as a whole to maintain the placement through the delivery of adoption preservation services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The term \u201cspecial needs\u201d includes a member of an ethnic, racial, or cultural minority\u201d that includes Hispanics. Because Blanca is Hispanic, her family was eligible for post-adoption services. <em>Former </em>OAR 413-130-0020(2)(c) (9/17/96). Families that were eligible for post-adoption services could access services provided by DHS, other agencies, or community services, \u201csuch as counseling, adoptive parent\u2019s support group, family resource or unity meeting, respite care, temporary out-of-home care or residential treatment[.]\u201d <em>Former </em>OAR 413-130-0180(2) (9/17/96). Plaintiffs note that Blanca and her family received post-adoption services from DHS in the form of a subsidy and health insurance benefits for Blanca until she reached 18 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Plaintiffs also rely on other administrative rules that require DHS to verify a child\u2019s citizenship for certain services, such as foster care or adoption assistance, that, in turn, are reserved for children who are citizens or \u201cqualified aliens.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that, because Blanca was in foster care and received adoption assistance (in the form of preadoption and post-adoption subsidies), DHS was required to verify Blanca\u2019s citizenship status. Plaintiffs also cite OAR 413-215-0411(2)(b)(H) (10/17/08), an administrate rule that requires a private adoption agency, licensed by DHS, to itemize the \u201c[ljikely charges of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u201d to the adoptive family, arguing that DHS should be held to an analogous duty to disclose costs and consequences of any likely actions by the USCIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Based on those rules, plaintiffs conclude that DHS had a continuous duty to secure citizenship for her. According to plaintiffs, because DHS \u201cknew that Blanca\u2019s citizenship status had not been finalized,\u201d it had a continuous duty, until Blanca turned 18, to provide services to ensure Blanca would become a citizen in order to \u201cpreserve\u201d her adoption. Plaintiffs argue that the statute of ultimate repose was not triggered until plaintiffs stopped receiving post-adoption services when Blanca turned 18 years old, 11 months before they filed their complaint; therefore, their preadoption claim is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><em>Little </em>is inapplicable. Unlike the defendant in <em>Little, </em>DHS was not required, under the statutes or administrative rules cited by plaintiffs, to establish Blanca\u2019s citizenship after she was adopted. Although plaintiffs received some financial subsidies from DHS after she was adopted because Blanca was a qualified \u201cspecial needs child,\u201d none of the rules on which plaintiffs relies created a <em>mandatory </em>duty that DHS secure Blanca\u2019s citizenship to preserve her adoption. Specifically, with respect to OAR 413-130-0040(3)(c) (7/1/08), on its face, the rule concerns verification of either citizenship or \u201cqualified alien\u201d status for eligibility for certain benefits, not a duty to secure citizenship or legal permanent resident status. In addition, pursuant to OAR 413-100-0210(2)(h), a \u201cqualified alien\u201d includes a child such as Blanca who \u201chas been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty in the United States\u201d and who otherwise satisfies the requirements of the immigration statute relating to the treatment of certain battered aliens. Accordingly, even assuming that OAR 413-130-0040(3)(c) (7/1/08) applied to the subsidies provided to plaintiffs, the rule did not require DHS to verify that Blanca was in fact a citizen if she was a \u201cqualified alien.\u201d Furthermore, although DHS was required to provide post-adoption services, DHS did not assume an obligation to provide all post-adoption services possible to help \u201cpreserve\u201d an adoption, including establishing a child\u2019s citizenship. Rather, DHS had discretion as to which services were made available to adoptive families based on its resources. <em>See OAR </em>413-130-0180 (9/17/96) (\u201cPost legal adoptive services will be determined by the availability of [DHS] and community resources.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Nor does plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on other administrative rules show that DHS assumed any <em>continuing, </em>mandatory duty owed to plaintiffs. As DHS highlights, OAR 413-130-0040(3)(c) (7/1/08), the administrative rule that obligates DHS to verify a child\u2019s status either as a citizen or a \u201cqualified alien\u201d for eligibility to receive certain services, was not in effect until 2008, well after Blanca\u2019s 1999 adoption. Similarly, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, under OAR 413-215-0411(2)(b)(H) (10/17/08), DHS, like private adoption agencies, had a continuous duty to plaintiffs to disclose the costs and consequences of any likely action by USCIS. Assuming DHS had an analogous requirement, any duty to provide Lisa and her then-husband, a prospective adoptive family, with information regarding the cost of Blanca\u2019s adoption was breached in the 1990s. The duty runs to <em>prospective </em>adoptive families; the text of the rule does not suggest that the agency has a continuous duty to provide that information <em>after </em>families adopted children. <em>See </em>OAR 413-215-0411(2)(b) (10/12/08) <em>(\u201cBefore providing an adoption service </em>to a prospective adoptive parent, the adoption agency must itemize and disclose in writing to the parents the estimated fees and expenses the parent will be changed[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)). Accordingly, none of the administrative rules that plaintiffs cite establishes that DHS had the continuing, mandatory duty to establish Blanca\u2019s citizenship or permanent residency, which, according to plaintiffs, avoids the application of the statute of ultimate repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">2. <em>Relationship of Trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The resolution of the continuing duty issue leads to plaintiffs\u2019 second, tolling-based argument concerning the statute of ultimate repose. Absent an ongoing relationship of trust between the parties, \u201cthe legislature did not intend the statute [of ultimate repose] to be circumvented by allegations that subsequent to the fundamental wrong, a continuing duty existed to rectify the results of such wrong.\u201d <em>Josephs, </em>260 Or at 501-02. In this case, plaintiffs contend that they had such a relationship of trust with DHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Plaintiffs argue that they were dependent on DHS for care and services even after Blanca\u2019s adoption, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>because Blanca was an abused, special needs child. Plaintiffs analogize the parties\u2019 relationship to a doctor-patient relationship. <em>See Cavan, </em>280 Or at 458 (in <em>dicta, </em>explaining that the doctor-patient relationship might create a relationship of trust). Plaintiffs argue that, just as a patient relies on a doctor\u2019s assurances, they relied on DHS\u2019s assurances that, after the adoption Blanca would become a citizen because of DHS\u2019s position of authority. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that they relied on DHS\u2019s representation to them in 2000 that, after the passage of the CCA, Blanca would become an American citizen because her adoptive parents were American citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">DHS contends that, after Blanca\u2019s adoption was complete, the parties were not in an ongoing relationship of any significance that would have prevented plaintiffs from recognizing their alleged injury, as described in <em>Cavan, </em>280 Or at 457-58. Although plaintiffs received financial subsidies after Blanca was adopted, DHS contends that, as a matter of law, that did not create a relationship of trust that tolled the statute of ultimate repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We agree with DHS that the parties did not have an ongoing relationship of trust that extended years after the adoption. In 2000, DHS conferred with Lisa and explained that, after the passage of the CCA, Blanca would automatically become a citizen because her adoptive parents were United States citizens. There is no evidence of any other communications between the parties from 2000 to 2009. Plaintiffs point only to the payments they received from DHS and the existence of some administrative rules as their evidence that they had a relationship of trust with DHS after Blanca was adopted. That evidence, however, would not permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that there was \u201can active, continuous relationship\u201d of trust between the parties, at least between 2000 and 2009 after Lisa\u2019s communications with DHS ceased, such that plaintiffs were unable to recognize the existence of a cause of action. <em>See Rutter v. Neuman, </em>188 Or App 128, 136-37, 71 P3d 76 (2003) (explaining that there was \u201cno evidence of any conversations, correspondence, or other communications\u201d for years and that nothing demonstrated the existence of the sort of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201crelationship of trust and confidence with the defendant\u201d that the <em>Cavan </em>court held was necessary to toll the statute of ultimate repose). At best, Lisa trusted DHS when it told her that Blanca was a citizen in 2000, but thereafter, Lisa, as Blanca\u2019s parent, acted without consultation with or guidance or interference from DHS on any matter, including matters related to Blanca\u2019s immigration status. The statute of ultimate repose was not tolled, and plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claims, which were more than 10 years old when plaintiffs filed their complaint, are barred.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In light of the foregoing, the trial court correctly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 preadoption claim, which pertains to alleged negligent acts by DHS that occurred before Blanca\u2019s adoption, more than 10 years before plaintiffs filed their complaint. We also accept DHS\u2019s argument that some of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning DHS\u2019s negligent acts are, in effect, alleged failures to remedy past and time-barred negligent conduct in applying for Blanca\u2019s legal permanent resident status and, therefore, are also barred by the statute of ultimate repose. To the extent that plaintiffs allege such time-barred negligent acts in their post-adoption claim, those specifications of negligence are no longer actionable. What remains at issue are other negligent acts specified in plaintiffs\u2019 post-adoption claim, such as negligent misrepresentations in 2000, that allegedly resulted in the penalties Blanca has experienced, namely, her need to depart the United States with an exclusion from the United States for 10 years before she can apply for a visa to reenter this country legally. Whether plaintiffs timely asserted such allegations of negligence through their tort claims notice to DHS and by filing this action is a question for the jury, because there is a factual question as to the date plaintiffs knew or should have known that they had suffered harm to Blanca\u2019s right to remain in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> For clarity, we refer to the individual plaintiffs by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> Defendants on appeal include DHS employees Dunn and Dillner. We refer to defendants collectively as \u201cDHS\u201d unless the context requires otherwise. Other defendants unrelated to DHS were dismissed from the action before the summary judgment proceedings at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\"> Section 320 of the CCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c(a) A child horn outside of the United States automatically becomes a citizen of the United States when all of the following conditions have been fulfilled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201c(1) At least one parent of the child is a citizen of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\u201c(2) The child is under the age of eighteen years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">\u201c(3) The child is residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">\u201c(b) Subsection (a) of this section shall apply to a child adopted by a United States citizen parent if the child satisfies the requirements applicable to adopted children under section 1101(b)(1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">8 USC \u00a7 1431. Thus, if Blanca had been lawfully admitted for permanent residency, she would have been eligible for citizenship automatically after the enactment of the CCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b514-13\"> The August 2007 letter incorrectly stated that Blanca\u2019s \u201cApplication for Citizenship\u201d was denied when the application was actually for a <em>certificate </em>of citizenship, not an application for citizenship.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> In their complaint, plaintiffs allege a single claim of negligence, but the parties and the trial court have treated it as two separate claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\"> The trial court ruled, and it is undisputed on appeal, that Blanca was not required to give DHS a tort claims notice for her preadoption claim, because all of the requirements for dispensing with notice in ORS 30.275(8) are met in this case: Blanca was under the age of 18 when the claimed negligence occurred, the claim is against DHS, and she was in DHS\u2019s custody at the time of the negligent acts. Thus, the parties dispute whether Blanca\u2019s tort claims notice was timely only as to her post-adoption claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> In part of their response, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred when it imputed Lisa\u2019s knowledge of the August 2007 letter to Blanca. Plaintiffs contend that Blanca was 17 years old when the letter was received and that there is nothing in the record to suggest that Blanca read the letter or understood the consequences resulting from the information in the letter. However, the letter from USCIS was addressed to Blanca, and, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, Lisa\u2019s affidavit affirmatively states that Blanca was aware that she was not a citizen of the United States after she received the August 2007 letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b529-11\"> Plaintiffs do not seriously defend the timeliness of their notice of tort claims based on Blanca\u2019s lack of citizenship. Plaintiffs knew in 2007 that Lisa had asked DHS to finalize American citizenship for Blanca and yet Blanca lacked citizenship, contrary to DHS\u2019s representations. The trial court did not err in dismissing the portion of plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on that theory of harm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> <em>See </em>OAR 413-100-0120(3)(b) (verification of child\u2019s U.S. citizenship status for foster care eligibility); OAR 413-100-0210(1), (2) (an eligible child for foster care must be a \u201cUnited States citizen\u201d or a \u201cqualified alien\u201d); OAR 413-100-0460(1) (12/29/95) (the child must be a United States citizen to be eligible for medical assistance); OAR 413-130-0040(3)(c) (7/1/08) (the child must a United State citizen or a \u201cqualified alien\u201d to be eligible for adoption assistance); OAR 413-130-0045(1) (7/1/09) (adoption assistance is limited to United States citizens).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\"> Plaintiffs raised two additional arguments as to why the statute of ultimate repose should be tolled. Those arguments rely on case law that is not controlling in Oregon. Because the case law is unpersuasive in light of Oregon law, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 arguments without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
