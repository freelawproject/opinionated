Bias, </em>241 Or App 647, 250 P3d 974 (2011), we reversed defendant\u2019s conviction on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Relying on our decision in <em>State v. Rainoldi, </em>236 Or App 129, 235 P3d 710 (2010), we concluded that the trial court should have instructed the jury that the state was required to prove a culpable mental state with respect to defendant\u2019s status as a felon. The Oregon Supreme Court has since reversed our decision in <em>Rainoldi </em>and held that \u201cORS 166.270 exhibits a clear legislative intent to dispense with the culpable mental state requirement as to the element that a defendant \u2018has been convicted of a felony.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Rainoldi, </em>351 Or 486, 506, 268 P3d 568 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In the wake of its decision in <em>Rainoldi, </em>the Supreme Court allowed the state\u2019s petition for review of our decision in <em>Bias, </em>vacated that decision, and remanded for reconsideration. On remand, we now conclude, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s superseding construction of ORS 166.270, that the trial court did not commit instructional error, and we therefore affirm defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
