For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">I. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">To give necessary context to this dispute, we begin with a discussion of the statutory scheme established by the Liquor Control Act (the Act), ORS chapter 471; ORS 474.105; ORS 474.115; <em>see </em>ORS 471.027, and, in particular, the applicable licensing provisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The OLCC is authorized by the legislature \u201c[t]o control the manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation, importation and delivery of alcoholic liquor in accordance with [the Act].\u201d ORS 471.730(1). It has the power and duty \u201c[t]o grant, refuse, suspend, or cancel licenses and permits for the sale or manufacture of alcoholic liquor, or other licenses and permits in regard thereto[.]\u201d ORS 471.730(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>A person who is not licensed under the Act may not \u201csell, solicit, take orders for or peddle alcoholic beverages.\u201d ORS 471.405(3). Moreover, \u201c[n]o licensee shall sell or offer for sale any alcoholic beverage in a manner, or to a person, other than the license permits the licensee to sell.\u201d ORS 471.405(1). Significantly, under ORS 471.406:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201cAny prohibition on the sale of alcoholic beverages provided for in this chapter includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">\u201c(1) Soliciting orders for alcoholic beverages or receiving orders for alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u201c(2) Keeping alcoholic beverages for sale or exposing alcoholic beverages for sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u201c(3) Delivering alcoholic beverages for value or in any way other than purely gratuitously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201c(4) Peddling alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">\u201c(5) Keeping alcoholic beverages with intent to sell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">\u201c(6) Trafficking in alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">\u201c(7) For any consideration, promised or obtained, directly or indirectly or under any pretext or by any means, procuring alcoholic beverages, or allowing alcoholic beverages to be procured, for any other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The Act authorizes various types of licenses, two of which are most pertinent to the issues raised in this case: (1) the \u201coff-premises sales license,\u201d which, as noted, is referred to as an \u201cO license,\u201d ORS 471.186; and (2) the \u201cwholesale malt beverage and wine license,\u201d ORS 471.235. As discussed below, 251 Or App at 335, 338, GOI holds an O license (jointly with the store operator) for each individual GOI retail store and, as of October 2008, also has an O license for its Clackamas warehouse. GOI does not have, and never has had, a wholesale malt beverage and wine license.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">ORS 471.186 establishes the O license. Subsection (1) of that statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">\u201cThe holder of an off-premises sales license may sell factory-sealed containers of wine, malt beverages and cider.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The holder of an O license may also provide \u201csample tastings\u201d on the licensed premises with the approval of the OLCC, ORS 471.186(2), and \u201cmay deliver wine or cider that is sold under the privileges of the license to retail customers in this state\u201d as long as \u2014 among other restrictions \u2014 such deliveries are \u201cmade only for personal use and not for the purpose of resale,\u201d ORS 471.186(5), (5)(b). In addition, ORS 471.305 provides that \u201c[t]he sale of alcoholic liquors under any license issued by the [OLCC] authorizing retail sales by a licensee shall be restricted to the premises described in the license, but deliveries may be made by the licensee to customers pursuant to bona fide orders received on the licensed premises prior to delivery.\u201d \u201cPremises\u201d or \u201clicensed premises\u201d is defined to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201ca location licensed under [chapter 471] and includes all enclosed areas at the location that are used in the business operated at the location, including offices, kitchens, rest rooms and storerooms, including all public and private areas where patrons are permitted to be present. \u2018Premises\u2019 or \u2018licensed premises\u2019 include areas outside of a building that the commission has specifically designated as approved for alcoholic beverage service or consumption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">ORS 471.001(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Wholesale malt beverage and wine licenses are governed by ORS 471.235. That license allows, among other activities, \u201cthe importation, storage, transportation, wholesale sale and distribution to licensees of the [OLCC].\u201d ORS 471.235(1). The licensee \u201cmay not sell any alcoholic liquor for consumption upon the licensed premises.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Also of significance to this case are the so-called \u201ctied-house\u201d provisions, ORS 471.392 - 471.400, which, the OLCC contends, \u201cprevent licensees from combining the features of one type of license with the features of another type of license, as well as from entering into certain business arrangements with other licensees.\u201d In particular, and subject to a myriad of exceptions not relevant here,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ORS 471.394 provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201ca person licensed under the provisions of [chapter 471] may not sell alcoholic liquor at both retail and wholesale,\u201d ORS 471.394(1), and a manufacturer or wholesaler is prohibited from having any interest, \u201cfinancial or otherwise,\u201d in the \u201cpremises, equipment, business or merchandise\u201d of a retail licensee, and vice versa, ORS 471.394(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">For purposes of the tied-house provisions, an O license is a retail license. ORS 471.392(2) (\u201c\u2018Retail licensee\u2019 means the holder of a full or limited on-premises sales license, an off-premises sales license or a temporary sales license.\u201d). A \u201cmanufacturer or wholesaler\u201d is defined, in part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201c[a] person holding a brewery license issued under ORS 471.220, a winery license issued under ORS 471.223, a grower sales privilege license issued under ORS 471.227, a distillery license issued under ORS 471.230, a wholesale malt beverage and wine license issued under ORS 471.235 or a warehouse license issued under ORS 471.242.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">ORS 471.392(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Finally, ORS 471.030(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cThe Liquor Control Act shall be liberally construed so as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201c(a) To prevent the recurrence of abuses associated with saloons or resorts for the consumption of alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">\u201c(b) To eliminate the evils of unlicensed and unlawful manufacture, selling and disposing of such beverages and to promote temperance in the use and consumption of alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\u201c(c) To protect the safety, welfare, health, peace and morals of the people of the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">We take the facts, which are undisputed, from the OLCC\u2019s final order. <em>See Jefferson County School Dist. No. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>509-J v. FDAB, </em>311 Or 389, 393 n 7, 812 P2d 1384 (1991) (unchallenged findings of fact are the facts for purposes of judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s final order). We begin by quoting verbatim the OLCC\u2019s findings regarding GOI\u2019s wine purchasing, storage, and delivery system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">\u201cGOI purchases wine at wholesale from suppliers licensed by the OLCC. GOI stores the wine at its Clackamas facility until it delivers the wine to retail stores that operate under the trade name Grocery Outlet. These retail stores each have separate off-premises retail sales licenses held jointly by the store operator and GOI. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201cThe operators of the Grocery Outlet retail stores operate the stores under contracts with GOI. The operators receive wine from GOI\u2019s Clackamas facility and sell the wine at retail under 31 separate off-premises retail sales licenses held jointly with GOI and the operators of individual stores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cGOI retains title to the wine transported from GOI\u2019s Clackamas facility to the 31 Grocery Outlet retail stores until the wine is sold by the retail store. At that time, title is transferred to the retail customer. The proceeds of the sale of wine are at all times the property of GOI, subject to the right of the independent store operator to receive a commission. No money is transferred from the retail store to GOI until after the wine is sold to the public. The retail store operator is paid only after the wine is sold to the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">(Paragraph numbering, record citations, and footnotes omitted.) The OLCC also found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201c[p]ursuant to the contract between GOI and its independent store operators, \u2018GOI procures, distributes and consigns merchandise.\u2019 The independent store operator is responsible, \u2018as consignee of GOI merchandise, for the operation of the retail store and for the safe and efficient handling and sale of GOI merchandise. *** Operator is not an employee of GOI, nor is Operator a franchisee, partner, reseller or owner with GOL\u2019 Operators receive, as a commission from GOI, a percentage of the store\u2019s gross margin, generated from the sale of merchandise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">(Omission in original; record citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>GOI maintained this purchasing and delivery system, using its Clackamas facility<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or similar locations to receive and store wine and beer, for over 20 years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 1986, the OLCC acknowledged that GOI\u2019s business model was permissible: in particular, the OLCC wrote, in a May 20, 1986, letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">\u201c[N]othing in the method of distribution of beer and wine by [GOI] suggests any conflict with the Liquor Control Act or Administrative Rules of this state. Our understanding is that the [GOI] warehouse merely consigns, and does not sell beer and wine to retail stores. We further understand that there is no fee or charge associated with the delivery of beer and wine to the retail stores.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Questions about GOI\u2019s system began to surface in 2005, and, in 2007, counsel for the Oregon Beer and Wine Distributors Association (OBWDA), sent an e-mail message notifying its members of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cThe [OLCC] no longer allows the central warehousing of wine by a retailer. The [OLCC] determined that wine may only be delivered to a licensed retail account, and the retail license does not allow the retailer to transport wine or beer from one licensed location to another, even if the two locations are owned by the same entity. Malt beverages also may not be delivered to a central warehouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201cThe new law on direct delivery of wine by an out-of-state winery to an Oregon retailer also has a specific provision in it that the wine must be delivered to a licensed retail location, not a central warehouse. As with wine or beer delivered by an Oregon winery, brewery or wholesaler, the beverages may not be transported by the retailer from one licensed location to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">\u201cPlease review your delivery practices and determine if you are delivering product to a central warehouse. If so, please end the practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Shortly thereafter, GOI\u2019s wholesale distributors refused to process orders for delivery to GOI\u2019s Clackamas facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>On January 30, 2008, the OLCC sent a letter to GOI\u2019s counsel, confirming that \u201cit has been the OLCC\u2019s position for at least the past several years that the practice of central warehousing of alcoholic beverages by retailers is not authorized under Oregon law.\u201d Recognizing, however, that GOI could \u201creasonably have relied\u201d on the 1986 letter that \u201cseems to authorize the practice,\u201d the OLCC stated that it would not take any enforcement action against GOI or its suppliers for 90 days. Distributors then resumed delivering wine to GOI\u2019s Clackamas facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In April 2008, GOI applied for a temporary O license for the Clackamas facility, which GOI proposed to open for retail sales to the public on Fridays for two to three hours, but which would also receive and store products for other GOI locations. In a letter dated May 9, 2008, the OLCC informed GOI that that \u201cthe warehouse activities being proposed at the Clackamas location are not consistent with the O license privileges\u201d and that, \u201c[i]n order to operate under an O license, [GOI] would need to discontinue the warehouse activities at the Clackamas location and conduct only retail sales at that location.\u201d The OLCC also extended the deadline for compliance to July 26, 2008. Before that deadline, GOI filed an action in Clackamas County Circuit Court and obtained an injunction preventing the OLCC from taking any adverse action against GOI based on the positions taken by the OLCC in its January 30 and May 9, 2008, letters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>On October 14, 2008, the OLCC issued a letter indicating its approval of GOI\u2019s application for an O license at the Clackamas facility, subject to the following restriction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">\u201cThis license allows the sale of alcoholic beverages only at retail directly to the consumer for off-premises consumption. It does not authorize activities associated with the wholesale sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages to other licensed premises. Specifically, the following are prohibited: storing alcoholic beverage products except for products that will be sold to consumers at this location; wholesale sale of alcoholic beverage products (this means selling product to a person who will not consume the product but instead intends to resell it); and transportation or distribution of alcoholic beverage products to other licensed premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">However, based on the Clackamas County Circuit Court\u2019s injunction, the OLCC agreed \u201cnot to take action to enforce this restriction until after the conclusion of any administrative proceeding involving this restriction, including any appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">GOI timely requested a contested case hearing on the January 30 and May 9,2008, OLCC letters (the charging documents) and with respect to the restrictions imposed on the O license for the Clackamas facility. The matters were consolidated for hearing, and OBWDA was granted permission to participate as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary determination, and, after oral argument on the motions, the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a proposed order recommending that the OLCC authorize GOI to continue the purchasing and delivery practices described above and grant GOI\u2019s application for an unrestricted O license at the Clackamas facility. The ALJ rejected the OLCC and OBWDA\u2019s argument that GOI was, through its activities at the Clackamas facility, operating as an unlicensed wholesaler in violation of the statutory tied-house prohibitions, in particular, ORS 471.394(1), which, as noted, generally proscribes the sale of \u201calcoholic liquor at both retail and wholesale.\u201d The ALJ also concluded that nothing in the Act \u201cspecifically prohibits a retail licensee from storing wine at an unlicensed location for eventual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>sale at licensed premises\u201d; therefore, GOI was not required to obtain a separate license for the Clackamas facility, and, concomitantly, the restrictions imposed on GOI\u2019s O license were not necessary or justified under OAR 845-005-0355.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Both OBWDA and the staff of the OLCC registered objections to the proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The OLCC issued a final order that rejected the conclusions reached by the ALJ. It explained that, under the \u201cthree-tier\u201d regulatory system established by the legislature, involving distinct separations among manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers, and including the tied-house provisions, \u201c[n]o license may be used in a way that would allow the holder of that license to perform activities that are the province of another license in another tier[.]\u201d Consistently with that fundamental premise, and invoking as well the purposes of the Act, the OLCC concluded that (1)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">\u201c[b]y using the Clackamas warehouse facility as a distribution hub for wine to its 31 Oregon locations, [GOI] is engaging in wholesale alcohol sales in violation of ORS 471.405 (selling alcohol in a manner \u2018other than the license permits the licensee to sell\u2019) and ORS 471.394 (prohibition on selling at both wholesale and retail)\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">and (2) the restrictions that the OLCC imposed on the O license for GOI\u2019s Clackamas facility are appropriate under OAR 845-005-0355 because they are needed to \u201cprevent GOI from conducting activities that are outside the scope of the O license and are reserved to licensed wholesalers.\u201d Consequently, the OLCC\u2019s final order granted the OLCC\u2019s and OBWDA\u2019s motions for summary determination, denied GOI\u2019s, and ordered that \u201c[GOI] is not authorized to continue its business practice of receiving and storing wine at the Clackamas facility and delivering it to [GOI] retail stores throughout Oregon for sale to the general public.\u201d The final order also granted GOI an O license for the Clackamas facility subject to the restrictions described above. GOI seeks judicial review of that final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On review, GOI asserts that the OLCC erred in concluding that GOI\u2019s wine distribution system is not authorized and, as a result, the OLCC also necessarily erred in approving the restrictions in the O license issued for the Clackamas facility. GOI challenges each of the three bases for the OLCC\u2019s conclusion that GOI\u2019s wine-purchasing and distribution system is not permitted, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201c([1]) the storage and distribution of wine are activities which are outside of the privileges of the O retail license and are reserved to wholesale licensees; ([2]) GOI\u2019s activities with respect to wine may not be conducted from an unlicensed location; and ([3]) the Tied House laws, in particular ORS 471.394, prohibit GOI, as a retail licensee, from engaging in the wholesale sale and distribution of wine to other retail outlets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">It also argues that, absent a statutory prohibition against it, the OLCC\u2019s 2008 policy on \u201ccentral warehousing\u201d of wine constitutes a rule under ORS 183.310(9), \u201cwhich can only be adopted by formal rulemaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We review the dispute in this case, which turns on the meaning of various provisions in the Act, for legal error. ORS 183.482(8)(a). As explained below, we agree with the OLCC that GOI\u2019s practice of storing wine at its Clackamas facility and distributing it to GOI stores is prohibited by its O retail licenses for its stores and, therefore, that the license restrictions for the Clackamas facility are appropriate. That conclusion necessarily also negates GOI\u2019s argument regarding the requirement for formal rulemaking. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">As an initial matter, GOI contends that the OLCC\u2019s analysis is flawed generally because it is driven by the \u201cthree-tier system\u201d concept, rather than actual statutory text. More specifically, GOI contends that the OLCC\u2019s underlying premise \u2014 that activities not specifically permitted by the statute governing the O retail license, such as, as relevant here, \u201cstorage,\u201d \u201ctransportation,\u201d and \u201cdelivery,\u201d are reserved for other tiers and therefore prohibited by the O license \u2014 is, first, not supported by statutory authority and, second, contradicted by the fact that, as acknowledged by the OLCC, some level of those activities <em>are </em>allowed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>an O retail license. For example, as GOI points out, and the OLCC acknowledges, O licensees unavoidably \u201cstore\u201d some quantity of wine as a component of their retail operations, even though ORS 471.186 does not specifically authorize \u201cstorage.\u201d Similarly, as noted above, O licensees are expressly authorized to engage in some delivery or transportation of wine. <em>See </em>ORS 471.186(5); ORS 471.305; OAR 845-006-0390. Moreover, GOI contends, such an interpretation of the scheme \u201cwould lead to utterly absurd results\u201d; for example, as noted by the ALJ, the \u201cretail sales license statutes also [do] not expressly authorize holders to <em>purchase </em>the alcoholic beverages to be sold at retail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The OLCC and OBWDA, on the other hand, contend that the OLCC\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme is correct. Focusing on the text and context of the Act\u2014 including the legislative embodiment of a three-tier system and the enactment of the tied-house provisions \u2014 the OLCC contends that \u201cthe legislature intended to keep separate the activities of retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers and to allow their overlap only where expressly authorized.\u201d Thus, in the OLCC and OBWDA\u2019s view, the Act \u201cprohibits] any activity that is not expressly authorized.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) It follows that, because GOI has failed to identify any statutory authority for \u201cus[ing] its Clackamas facility for storage, transport, or delivery of wine to retail locations for resale,\u201d it is acting unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In short, GOI takes the overarching position that activities not specifically prohibited by the Act are allowed, while the OLCC and OBWDA contend that privileges not expressly granted to a particular license by the Act are prohibited. Neither of those absolutes withstands serious scrutiny. However, we need not reconcile the parties\u2019 absolutist positions in order to decide this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">As mentioned, ORS 471.405(1) provides that \u201c[n]o licensee shall sell or offer for sale any alcoholic beverage in a manner, or to a person, other than the license permits the licensee to sell.\u201d In turn, ORS 471.406 \u2014 while not strictly a definition of the word \u201csell\u201d \u2014 establishes the breadth of <em>\u201c{&amp;\\nyprohibition </em>on the sale of alcoholicbeverages\u201d otherwise provided for in chapter 471 (emphasis added); that range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>includes a variety of activities that would not necessarily be encompassed under an ordinary understanding of the word.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> ORS 471.405(1) is such a \u201cprohibition\u201d \u2014 it expressly bans the sale of alcoholic liquor \u201cin a manner, or to a person, other than the license permits the licensee to sell\u201d and it appears in chapter 471. Thus, by virtue of ORS 471.406, ORS 471.405(l)\u2019s \u201cprohibition on sale\u201d beyond what is permitted by the pertinent license includes, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201c[k]eeping alcoholic beverages with intent to sell.\u201d ORS 471.406(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The word \u201csell,\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cintent to sell,\u201d undoubtedly invokes the ordinary meaning of the term \u2014 it is not itself a \u201cprohibition on the sale\u201d of alcohol contained in chapter 471; moreover, to conclude otherwise would be endlessly circular \u2014 thus, the prohibition against selling wine \u201cin a manner, or to a person, other than the license permits the licensee to sell\u201d includes keeping wine with the intent to \u201cgive up to another for money or other valuable consideration or to hand over or transfer title to.\u201d <em>Ban v. OLCC, </em>196 Or App 545, 552, 102 P3d 744 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">GOI readily acknowledges that it is engaged in retail selling of wine at each of the independently operated GOI stores <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that it stores wine for those sales at its Clackamas facility. Nonetheless, GOI contends that the wine held at the Clackamas facility is not kept with the intent to sell, \u201cbut rather is simply kept in storage pending a decision to move it to a retail location.\u201d That argument is without merit. Given the undisputed findings in this case, there can be no question that GOI purchases the wine and stores it in the Clackamas facility for the purpose of \u201cgiv[ing it up] to another\u201d \u2014 the consumer in the store \u2014 in exchange \u201cfor money\u201d or \u201ctransfer[ring] title.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That the wine is stored for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>a time until the decision is made to move it to a particular location does not speak to a different \u201cintent.\u201d The question, therefore, reduces to whether that prohibited activity is otherwise permitted by GOI\u2019s licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">We conclude that it is not. An O license permits its holder to \u201csell factory-sealed containers of wine,\u201d ORS 471.186(1); to provide \u201csample tasting\u201d on the licensed premises with the OLCC\u2019s approval, ORS 471.186(2); and to \u201cdeliver\u201d wine to retail customers for personal use, ORS 471.186(5). Under ORS 471.305, an O licensee is also permitted to deliver wine to customers \u201cpursuant to bona fide orders received on the licensed premises prior to delivery.\u201d And, the OLCC\u2019s rules permit an O licensee to transport wine from a licensed wholesaler\u2019s premises back to the retailer\u2019s licensed premises. <em>See </em>OAR 845-006-0390 (authorizing \u201cdock sales\u201d of wine). Thus, those activities are \u201cpermitted\u201d by the O license; others \u2014 to the extent they are encompassed within the meaning of \u201csales\u201d in ORS 471.406 (and not otherwise allowed under other provisions of the Act) \u2014 are prohibited.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In addition, ORS 471.305 further provides that \u201c[t]he sale of alcoholic liquors under any license issued by the [OLCC] authorizing retail sales by a licensee <em>shall be restricted </em>to the premises described in the license.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because, as we have discussed, a prohibition on the sale of alcohol in chapter 471 includes \u201c[k]eeping alcoholic beverages with intent to sell,\u201d ORS 471.406(5), it follows\u2014 reading ORS 471.305 in conjunction with ORS 471.406(5)\u2014 that that activity is restricted to the licensed premises. The term \u201clicensed premises\u201d is defined to include \u201call enclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>areas at the location that are used in the business operated <em>at the location, </em>including offices, kitchens, rest rooms and <em>storerooms.\u201d </em>ORS 471.001(10) (emphasis added). Thus, each of GOI\u2019s licenses permit it to \u201ckeep wine with the intent to sell it\u201d only on the premises described in that license. That includes the O license for the Clackamas facility: under that license, GOI is permitted to keep wine at the facility only for sale at that facility. In sum, we conclude that the OLCC did not err in determining that GOI\u2019s practice of storing wine at its Clackamas facility and transporting it for sale at its retail stores was not permitted and that, consequently, the restrictions on GOI\u2019s O license for the Clackamas facility were lawful.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Our conclusion in that regard also disposes of GOI\u2019s argument regarding the need for formal rulemaking. Specifically, GOI\u2019s thesis is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\"><em>\u201c\\a\\bsent a statutory prohibition </em>[on GOI\u2019s practice of storing wine at its Clackamas facility and transferring it to its retail stores], the OLCC\u2019s new position on \u2018central warehousing\u2019 constitutes [a rule under ORS 183.310(9)], which can only be adopted by formal rulemaking (assuming the OLCC even has the authority to adopt such a rule).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">(Emphasis added.) As just explained, GOI\u2019s practice is prohibited by ORS 471.405(1), ORS 471.406, and ORS 471.305. Accordingly, we reject GOI\u2019s thesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The OLCC did not err in (1) ordering that GOI is not authorized to continue its practice of receiving and storing wine at its Clackamas facility for delivery to GOI retail stores and (2) granting GOI an O license for its Clackamas facility with the restrictions described.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> Clackamas Grocery Outlet Warehouse and Grocery Outlet, Inc., are each named as petitioners in this case; however, according to GOI\u2019s brief, Clackamas Grocery Outlet Warehouse is a location owned by Grocery Outlet, Inc., and not a separate entity. We refer to petitioners collectively throughout his opinion as GOI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\"> As described in more detail below, 251 Or App at 335, the stores are owned or leased by GOI but are operated by independent store operators under contract with GOI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\"> Some of the statutes cited in this opinion have been amended since the events that gave rise to this review occurred. However, none of those amendments affects our analysis in this case; therefore, for convenience, we cite the current versions throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-15\"> In contrast, a \u201cfull on-premises sales license\u201d permits the holder to \u201csell by the drink at retail wine, malt beverages, cider and distilled liquor\u201d generally to \u2018be consumed on the licensed premises.\u201d ORS 471.175(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"> For example, the prohibition in subsection ORS 471.394(1) against selling at both retail and wholesale does not apply to some \u201cmanufacturer or wholesaler\u201d licensees <em>\u201cto the extent that retail sales are authorized by the statutes establishing the privileges of [the] license.\u201d </em>ORS 471.396(1) (emphasis added). To illustrate: A person holding a winery license is defined as a manufacturer or wholesaler under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ORS 471.392(l)(a). However, the statute establishing the winery license, ORS 471.223, also allows the licensee to \u201csell wines or cider at retail directly to the consumer for consumption on or off the licensed premises,\u201d ORS 471.223(l)(c), and to \u201csell malt beverages at retail for consumption on or off the licensed premises,\u201d ORS 471.223(l)(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> GOI did not hold any OLCC license for the Clackamas facility until 2008, when, as described below, 251 Or App at 337-38, GOI received a temporary O license for that facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b358-11\"> In 2008, GOI stopped using this system for storing and transporting beer to GOI retail stores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b359-5\"> The injunction was later amended to allow OLCC to issue an O license to GOI with the restrictions described in a letter dated October 14, 2008, 251 Or App at 338, and to allow GOI to appeal those restrictions though the appropriate administrative and legal venues. The OLCC and GOI also stipulated to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cThe OLCC will not take the position, in the pending administrative proceeding or any administrative proceeding stemming from the OLCC\u2019s action on [GOI\u2019s] pending license application or in any appeal from such administrative proceedings!!,] that [GOI] is not authorized to store wine and beer at a central location and ship it thereafter to other locations because of the restrictions contained [in the O License for the Clackamas facility]. In addition, if it is determined by final administrative or appellate decision in the [proceedings that a standard, unrestricted \u2018O\u2019 License allows a licensee to engage in storage and shipping of beer or wine to other locations, then the OLCC will remove the restrictions from the Restricted \u2018O\u2019 License issued to Grocery Outlet.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\"> That rule allows the OLCC to place restrictions on a license in certain circumstances, including when, for example, the restriction \u201cis in the public interest or convenience,\u201d OAR 845-005-0355(l)(e); one of the factors relevant to that determination is \u201cthe need to eliminate or prevent conditions that have contributed to or that the [OLCC] reasonably believes will contribute to liquor or criminal law violations by the licensee[,]\u201d OAR 845-005-0355(2)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> <em>Cf. Ban v.

At that time, title is transferred to the retail customer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> That conclusion is borne out by the context of the statute. In particular, and in contrast to the O license, activities such as \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201ctransportation\u201d are \u201cpermitted by the license\u201d in the context of <em>other </em>licenses established under the Act. For example, the following licenses all explicitly allow some storage and transportation activities: wholesale malt beverage and wine license, ORS 471.235; brewery-public house license, ORS 471.200; brewery license, ORS 471.220; winery license, ORS 471.223; grower sales privilege license, ORS 471.227; and warehouse license, ORS 471.242. This further demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent not to permit such activities under an O license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\"> GOI does not contend that, even if, as we have concluded, the OLCC correctly ruled that GOI\u2019s operation is not permitted, the license restrictions are nonetheless unwarranted for some other reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
