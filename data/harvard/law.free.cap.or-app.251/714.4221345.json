J.</author>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">After a trial to the court, defendant was convicted of one count of fourth-degree assault. ORS 163.160. She appeals the resultant judgment, raising three assignments of error. We reject defendant\u2019s first assignment of error without discussion but, because we agree with defendant that the trial court erred in refusing to permit the complainant\u2019s cousin, Torres, to testify regarding his opinion of the complainant\u2019s truthfulness, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">This case arises from an interaction between defendant and her 17-year-old daughter, the complainant, which culminated in the complainant being struck in the face with a large cooking spoon. Defendant was charged with fourth-degree assault and waived jury trial. Her case was tried to the court. At trial, defendant testified that the spoon had slipped from her hand accidentally as she was gesturing at the complainant. The complainant, on the other hand, testified that defendant had intentionally thrown the spoon at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">During her case-in-chief, defendant called Torres, the complainant\u2019s second cousin. He was in the house on the evening of the incident in question. Torres testified that he had known the complainant all his life, that the two of them \u201cused to hang out a lot,\u201d and that he frequently was present in the house where defendant and the complainant lived. Based on Torres\u2019s knowledge of the complainant, defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony regarding his opinion of the complainant\u2019s truthfulness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Do you remember her saying that she hated [defendant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201c[TORRES]: Yeah. Yeah. I can remember her plenty of times saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">\u201c[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m going to object and move to strike, Your Honor, nonresponsive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">\u201c[TORRES]: [The complainant is] a drama queen. That\u2019s what she does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">\u201c[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Again, I\u2019m going to move to strike that as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: In your opinion, is [the complainant] prone to over-exaggeration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">\u201c[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m going to object, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201c[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, this goes to the truthfulness of [the complainant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think it\u2019s improper character evidence. I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: In your opinion, do you consider [the complainant] to be truthful?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-12\">\u201c[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Again, I\u2019m going to ask that he lay the proper foundation and admonish the witness that the only thing he can answer is yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I\u2019ll sustain the objection. You need to lay a foundation for character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-14\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: One moment, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Um-hum (affirmative).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-16\">\u201c[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: I apologize, Your Honor, but I thought I had laid that when I established Mr. Torres\u2019 knowledge of [the complainant] being \u2014 knowing each other for their whole life and the amount of time that they spend together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, I think you\u2019ve established familiarity with her, but to lay a foundation, there\u2019s very specific questions that have to be asked regarding character, and I haven\u2019t heard them yet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-18\">Defense counsel made no further argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-19\">Ultimately, the court found defendant guilty and stated in a letter opinion that its decision came down to a credibility determination. The court believed the complainant\u2019s testimony that defendant threw the spoon at her and did not believe defendant\u2019s testimony that the \u201cspoon accidentally \u2018flew\u2019 out of her hand while she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>gesturing.\u201d Accordingly, the court entered a judgment convicting defendant of fourth-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Defendant asserts on appeal that \u201cthe trial court erred first when it held that Torres\u2019 opinion about [the complainant\u2019s] tendency to over-exaggerate was improper character evidence, and second when it held that although defendant established Torres\u2019 familiarity with [the complainant], defendant did not establish the requisite foundation for the evidence.\u201d The state, for its part, asserts only that defendant failed to preserve her claims of error and, therefore, this court should not consider them. Specifically, the state asserts that, even if Torres should have been permitted to answer defendant\u2019s question \u201cabout whether the [complainant] was prone to exaggeration,\u201d defendant \u201cis not entitled to relief because she made no offer of proof on what Torres\u2019 answer to the question would have been.\u201d In addition, the state argues that, although defendant told the court that she thought she had established the proper foundation for the opinion evidence, she did not preserve her contention because she \u201csaid nothing when the trial court ruled that Torres\u2019 familiarity with the victim was insufficient foundation for his opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">To preserve error when a trial court excludes testimony, a defendant must make an offer of proof unless the substance of the evidence to be offered is apparent from the context. OEC 103(1)(b) (\u201cError may not be predicated upon a ruling which *** excludes evidence unless a substantial right of a party is affected\u201d and \u201cthe substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.\u201d); <em>State v. Bowen, </em>340 Or 487, 500, 135 P3d 272 (2006), <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1214 (2007) (\u201cTo assure that appellate courts are able to determine whether a trial court erred in excluding evidence and whether that error was likely to have affected the trial\u2019s result, an offer of proof ordinarily is required to preserve error when a trial court excludes testimony.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 501 (considering whether the \u201crelevance of the desired testimony was apparent from the context\u201d); <em>State v. Smith, </em>319 Or 37, 43, 872 P2d 966 (1994) (\u201c[E]rror may not be predicated on a ruling excluding evidence unless the substance of the evidence was made known to the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>by offer of proof or was apparent from the context within which the question was asked.\u201d); <em>Schacher v. Dunne, </em>109 Or App 607, 610 n 1, 820 P2d 865 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 74 (1992) (error in excluding evidence is preserved if the substance of the evidence was apparent from the context); <em>see also State v. Wirfs, </em>250 Or App 269, 274, 281 P3d 616 (2012) (rejecting the contention that the defendant was required to make an offer of proof to preserve a claim that the trial court erred in excluding evidence \u201cbecause the trial court and the prosecutor were aware of the substance of the testimony that defendant would elicit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Here, although the state is correct that defendant failed to make an offer of proof, because the substance of Torres\u2019s testimony regarding the complainant\u2019s tendency to \u201cover-exaggerate\u201d was apparentfromthe context, we conclude that defendant\u2019s claim of error is sufficiently preserved for our review. As noted, the court sustained the state\u2019s objection to defendant\u2019s query regarding whether, in Torres\u2019s opinion, the complainant was \u201cprone to over-exaggeration.\u201d The relevant context was this: immediately before defendant solicited Torres\u2019s opinion on that point, Torres stated that the complainant had said \u201cmany times\u201d that she hated defendant. He then spontaneously commented that the complainant was a \u201cdrama queen.\u201d The court struck those comments as nonresponsive to defense counsel\u2019s questions. Defense counsel responded to the court\u2019s ruling by asking Torres a question to elicit the information that had just been stricken \u2014 that is, whether the complainant tended to over-exaggerate. Given that Torres had, essentially, just given his answer to that question in the stricken comment, the substance of the excluded testimony is apparent from the context in which the question was asked: Torres considered the complainant to be a \u201cdrama queen\u201d or, in other words, believed that she tended to exaggerate. In light of that context, we reject the state\u2019s contention that, because she did not make an offer of proof, defendant failed to preserve her claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Furthermore, we reject the state\u2019s assertion that \u201c[djefendant\u2019s argument about foundation is * * * not preserved.\u201d The requirement that, to be raised on appeal, an issue \u201cordinarily must first be presented to the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>is well-settled in our jurisprudence\u201d and is \u201cprudential in nature.\u201d <em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 219, 191 P3d 637 (2008). \u201cThe purpose of preservation is to ensure fairness to an opposing party, by giving the trial court the chance to consider and rule on a contention, and allowing the opposing party to respond.\u201d <em>Wirfs, </em>250 Or App at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Here, the purposes of preservation were clearly met. Defendant attempted to elicit from Torres his opinion on the complainant\u2019s truthfulness by asking first whether, in Torres\u2019s opinion, the claimant was prone to over-exaggeration and then whether, in his opinion, the complainant was truthful. The state objected to that line of questioning, asserting that defendant was required to \u201clay the proper foundation.\u201d The court agreed with the state\u2019s contention and sustained the objection. Defendant responded by informing the court that she believed she had laid the necessary foundation \u2014 that Torres and the complainant had known \u201ceach other for their whole life and the amount of time they spend together.\u201d The court rejected that position and informed defendant that, although she had established Torres\u2019s familiarity with the complainant, she had not asked the specific questions necessary to lay a foundation for Torres\u2019s opinion on the complainant\u2019s truthfulness. Under those circumstances, both the state and the court were aware of defendant\u2019s position and the trial court had a chance to consider the issue. Therefore, defendant\u2019s argument was properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We turn to the substance of defendant\u2019s arguments, noting that the state offers no argument regarding (1) whether the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Torres\u2019s opinion on the complainant\u2019s truthfulness was correct on the merits or (2) whether any error likely affected the verdict. Defendant contends that the court erred when it concluded that evidence regarding the complainant\u2019s truthfulness was \u201cimproper character evidence\u201d and that she had not laid a foundation for that evidence. She further asserts that the court\u2019s error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Our \u201cstandard of review under OEC 608(1) is for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>172 Or App 142, 150, 18 P3d 438, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 559 (2001). \u201cIn that context, \u2018discretion\u2019 refers to the authority of the trial court to choose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>among several legally correct outcomes.\u201d 172 Or App at 150-51 (quoting <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000)). Under the circumstances presented here, we agree with defendant that the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Pursuant to OEC 608,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201c(1) The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201c(a) The evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201c(b) Evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\"><em>See also </em>OEC 404(2)(c) (addressing the admissibility of evidence regarding the character of a witness); OEC 405(1) (in cases where character evidence is admissible, proof may be made by reputation or opinion testimony). Thus, \u201c[u]nder OEC 608(1), the credibility of a witness may be impeached or bolstered in the form of opinion or reputation testimony showing that the witness\u2019 character with respect to truthfulness is good or bad.\u201d <em>State v. Odoms, </em>313 Or 76, 82, 829 P2d 690 (1992). \u201cA person\u2019s character with respect to truthfulness means that person\u2019s propensity to tell the truth in all the varying situations of life.\u201d <em>State v. Marshall, </em>312 Or 367, 372, 823 P2d 961 (1991). The evidence at issue here \u2014 Torres\u2019s views on the complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness \u2014 is, thus, proper character evidence pursuant to OEC 608(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">\u201c[Underlying the provisions of OEC 608(1) is the requirement that a foundation be laid before an opinion about a character trait is admissible.\u201d <em>Maxwell, </em>172 Or App at 152. That foundation is laid by a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">\u201c \u2018showing that the witness has either sufficient acquaintance with the reputation of the person in the relevant community or sufficient personal contacts with the individual to provide a basis for an opinion regarding that person\u2019s character. The contact must have been recent enough so that there will be a current basis for the testimony.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-11\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Laird C. Kirkpatrick, <em>Oregon Evidence, </em>166-67 (3d ed 1996)). Here, as noted, the court ruled that defendant had not established a sufficient foundation for admission of Torres\u2019s testimony regarding the complainant\u2019s character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>for truthfulness because she had not asked him certain questions (not specified by the trial court). However, all that was required was a showing of adequate contacts between Torres and the complainant for Torres to form a current personal opinion of the complainant\u2019s character for truthfulness. <em>See id. </em>at 153. The trial court found that defendant had established Torres\u2019s familiarity with the complainant, and that was correct. Torres had known the complainant his whole life and testified that he had spent significant time with her, including seeing her after the incident at issue. Under the circumstances, defendant laid an adequate foundation for the admission of Torres\u2019s testimony. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Furthermore, we cannot conclude under the circumstances presented here that there is \u201clittle likelihood that the [trial court\u2019s error in excluding the testimony at issue] affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 33, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). The court\u2019s decision in this case came down to a determination of credibility. The court accepted the complainant\u2019s testimony regarding the incident in question and rejected the testimony of defendant. It stated that it found the complainant\u2019s testimony believable and that her motive to lie was negligible. Under those circumstances, the court\u2019s exclusion of evidence regarding the complainant\u2019s character for untruthfulness was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
