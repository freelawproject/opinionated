In his sole assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because a police officer unlawfully induced him to engage in the charged conduct and, thus, the state did not disprove his defense of entrapment under ORS 161.275. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Where a defendant raises the defense of entrapment, \u201cthe state has the burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d ORS 161.055(1); <em>see also State v. Murphy, </em>21 Or App 630, 535 P2d 779 (1975). In reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994). Because of the allocation to the state of the burden of proof on defendant\u2019s entrapment defense, that inquiry includes the additional question of whether a rational trier of fact could have found that the state disproved the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. McMullen, </em>34 Or App 749, 752, 579 P2d 879 (1978). \u201cWhen * * * a defendant [moves for a judgment of acquittal] at the close of the state\u2019s case, \u2018the appellate court must consider all the evidence ***\u2019\u201d adduced at trial. <em>State v. Bilsborrow, </em>230 Or App 413, 418-19, 215 P3d 914 (2009) (citing <em>State v. Gardner, </em>231 Or 193, 195, 372 P2d 783 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In the early morning on April 18, 2009, defendant was perusing on his computer the \u201ccasual encounters\u201d section of the website Craigslist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant clicked on an advertisement entitled \u201cLooking for the right hookup\u2014 w4m.\u201d That advertisement read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201cI have tried this before but could not find the right man to come thru. Im looking for some green or X for my kitty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Im a horny thing looking for a hookup. Are you that guy that can step up? Lets make this happen 2nite. Kisses.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">What defendant did not know was that the advertisement had been posted by Officer Hahn as part of his regular police duties. Defendant responded by e-mail at 6:34 a.m., writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An11\">\u201cMy names Jesse, I\u2019m 26 5\u2019 10 D&amp;D free. *** Let me know if you are interested.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Hahn, using the fictitious name \u201cCindy Newsom,\u201d responded to defendant at 6:36 a.m., writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cWell you sound good so far but I didnt see that have some bud[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] or X for me? Do you have either an enuf to get with me 2nite?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Approximately three hours later, defendant replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201cI have the bud couldn\u2019t find the X. Let me know if you are still interested. Please send a pic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Later that day Hahn answered, \u201cI am still interested if you can come up with enuf bud to fuck me, can you make it happen[?]\u201d The next day, April 19, defendant replied to Hahn: \u201cGot the bud if you are still interested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Because Hahn was off duty for three days, he did not resume his e-mail exchange with defendant until April 22, at 10:34 p.m., writing, \u201cIm still lookin sweety. You wanna hook upstill? Im up alnight.\u201d At 11:20 p.m., defendant replied, \u201c[H]ell yeah you got a pic?\u201d Two minutes later, Hahn wrote back, \u201cSo wut r u lookin 4? Name ur game. The pic, im the one in the middle with the hat.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Over the next four hours, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">Defendant: \u201cdamn your hot i\u2019m down for whatever smoke a little bud and see what happens. I also have xanax, valium[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">Defendant: \u201chey sexy i am up and would love to kick it. you still down?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">Hahn: \u201cHey, u still there or wut\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">Defendant: \u201cthat sounds cool all i have is a dime. Im going to call my twin to pick up a 20 sack is that enough? I would love to smoke and have some bomb sex. Text me[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">Defendant: \u201cHello sex for bud sonds good to me how much do you need? waiting ti hear back from you[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">Defendant: \u201cWell damn did I just get all this weed for nothing?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">Defendant: \u201cWell let me know if you want to do this another time. Waited but never heard back. I bought a shit load of weed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">On April 23, Hahn wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">\u201cIm up early and off to work but Im still down for when i get off 2nite. If you want to make it an alnighter or multiple sex then it will be an ounce. U got a shit load so make it worth it? Deal?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">That evening, the following exchange occurred over a six-hour period.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-14\">Defendant: \u201csounds like a deal. What time and where? I may be able to get some e as well. You are not a cop?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-16\">Hahn: \u201cOh yeah, we can chill at my place since Ive had a couple shots already and my sis is out of town. Hit me back[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-17\">Defendant: \u2018Yeah i wanna come over. 1 is a little late but sounds ok. Anyway to meet earlier? What is your addy? You are not a cop? Do you have another pic?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-18\">Hahn: \u2018You wanna come over say lip then, I will head home now then, let me know wut ur driving so i can watch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>4 ya, house is easy to miss. Not a cop by the way, u bring the condoms then. Here is a couple good ones I havent shared with others. U will like\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">Defendant: \u201cLets say 11:45 send me your addy. I am driving a white Honda Accord.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">Hahn: \u201cu get the E to?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">Defendant: \u201cabout to try and get it. might be a little late.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">Defendant: \u201cjust got the e u still want to do this?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Later, on the evening of April 24, defendant drove to the address that Hahn had given him. When defendant arrived, Hahn, who had been waiting in his police cruiser, pulled defendant over, had him step out of the car, and gave him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Hahn asked defendant what he was doing, and defendant told him he was there to \u201cmeet a girl named Cindy that he had met on Craigslist.\u201d Hahn then asked defendant if he had any controlled substances with him, and defendant handed over a prescription pill bottle that contained less than an ounce of marijuana. Hahn asked defendant \u201cwhere the ecstasy was, because he said he was bringing it.\u201d Defendant told him that it was at the bottom of the pill bottle; Hahn found one pill there, wrapped in plastic.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant was arrested and charged with, among other offenses, possession of a Schedule I controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">After the state concluded its case-in-chief at trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that, \u201c[fjrom the record here, there\u2019s no record that [defendant] was predisposed at all to possessing this ecstasy. In fact, all the evidence points to the contrary of that.\u201d The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">In his own defense, defendant testified that he had used Craigslist to meet people because of his anxiety, for which he had been prescribed Valium and Xanax. Defendant testified that, on the morning of April 18, he had sent replies to \u201cabout eight different ads\u201d and that the reply that he sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>to Hahn \u201cis like the same generic reply that I sent to every ad.\u201d He testified that he had never bought Ecstasy before and that he didn\u2019t have any marijuana when he replied to the ad, but \u201cthis being Portland * * * I knew that somehow I could find it.\u201d According to defendant, he went to downtown Portland on April 23 \u201cand looked for people that played the part, like the baggy clothes, and \u2014 just kind of asked. * * * I was specifically looking for marijuana at that time. I did ask about the X, but it was \u2014 it\u2019s not really completely what I was looking for.\u201d After Hahn gave him an address, defendant went to downtown Portland again and spent \u201clike about 20 minutes, searching, like asking people, and then bought what \u2014 for $20, what I thought was [EJcstasy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">On cross-examination, defendant testified that, in the past, he had received replies to his e-mails in the \u201ccasual encounters\u201d section of Craiglist from women who had asked, \u201c[D]o you think you can afford me?\u201d According to defendant, he had replied, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t do that, or stuff like that.\u201d The prosecutor then asked defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">Prosecutor: \u201cSo when the officer in this case said that he wanted drugs and controlled substances in exchange for sex you didn\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, no. That\u2019s not for me,\u2019 you continue with the correspondence, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">Defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Defendant admitted volunteering to provide the officer with Valium or Xanax. Defendant testified that he had not purchased any marijuana until April 23, when he bought a \u201c20 sack,\u201d a quantity of marijuana that, according to defendant, cost $20. Defendant explained his e-mail asking the officer how much marijuana he needed by saying, \u201c[T]hink about it this way. I\u2019m not going to go get something if I know that I\u2019m not meeting someone. * * * I\u2019m not going to go and spent $20, and \u2014 that I don\u2019t have, or something like that, if I know I\u2019m not meeting someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The prosecutor then asked defendant about his final e-mails with the officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">Prosecutor: \u201cApril 23rd, 6:24pm on Thursday. Do you see that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">Defendant: \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Prosecutor: \u201cYou say, \u2018it sounds like a deal. What time? May be able to get some E, as well.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">Defendant: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">Prosecutor: \u201cNow, at that point, that\u2019s not a response to the officer asking you yet again, is it? If you refer to page 12, at the very top, that\u2019s what the officer said. Does it, again, ask you there if you have any E, or anything like that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">Defendant: \u201cAt the top of page 12?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">Prosecutor: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">Defendant: \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">Prosecutor: \u201cSo, you just volunteered it there, you might be able to get some E, as well, correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">Defendant: \u201cBecause that\u2019s what the person said they wanted at the beginning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Defendant admitted that he used marijuana \u201cmonths before\u201d he replied to the officer\u2019s ad, despite his claim that he was \u201cdrug and disease free.\u201d The prosecutor asked defendant to explain the e-mail in which he had written, \u201cI would love to smoke and have some bomb sex.\u201d The prosecutor asked, \u201c[S]o, you were \u2014 -you\u2019re indicating that you\u2019re willing to use drugs, despite saying that you\u2019re drug and disease free, correct?\u201d Defendant answered, \u201c[Y]eah.\u201d Defendant was convicted by the jury; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">On appeal, defendant contends that, \u201c[b]ecause the state failed to offer evidence sufficient [to prove] that defendant was predisposed to criminally possess a Schedule I controlled substance before \u2018Cindy\u2019 propositioned having sex with him if he obtained it for her,\u201d the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. Defendant relies on several federal court cases for the corollary proposition that, because \u201cthe relevant time frame for assessing a defendant\u2019s disposition comes before he has any contact with government agents,\u201d the state failed to meet its burden because it presented no such evidence. The state replies that \u201cthe record contains sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could find that the police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>merely afforded defendant an opportunity to unlawfully possess [BZP],\u201d and, thus, \u201cthe officer did not induce defendant\u2019s criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The parties\u2019 contentions present a question of the proper interpretation of ORS 161.275. Our goal is to determine the intended meaning of the statute by examining its text in context, along with relevant legislative history and, if necessary, other aids to construction. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">ORS 161.275 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201c(1) The commission of acts which would otherwise constitute an offense is not criminal if the actor engaged in the proscribed conduct because the actor was induced to do so by a law enforcement official, or by a person acting in cooperation with a law enforcement official, for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against the actor in a criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201c(2) As used in this section, \u2018induced\u2019 means that the actor did not contemplate and would not otherwise have engaged in the proscribed conduct. Merely affording the actor an opportunity to commit an offense does not constitute entrapment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether defendant was \u201cinduced\u201d within the meaning of ORS 161.275(2). The legislature has defined the term \u201cinduced,\u201d but it has not defined the terms that, taken together, make up that definition. Accordingly, we give those component terms their ordinary meanings. \u201cContemplate,\u201d as pertinent here, means \u201cto have in view as a purpose : anticipate doing or performing : plan on : intend, plan.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>491 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cOtherwise,\u201d as used in ORS 161.275(2), is an adverb modifying the verb \u201cengaged\u201d in the phrase \u201cwould not otherwise have engaged in the proscribed conduct.\u201d When so employed, \u201cotherwise\u201d is defined as \u201cin different circumstances : under other conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1598. Finally, ORS 161.275(2) provides that \u201c[m]erely affording the actor an opportunity to commit an offense does not constitute entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">From the statutory text, we discern two aspects of \u201cinduced\u201d that the state must disprove beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>doubt. First, the state must disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not \u201ccontemplate\u201d the proscribed conduct \u2014 that is, that the defendant did not \u201chave in view as a purpose,\u201d \u201canticipate doing or performing,\u201d or plan on or intend the proscribed conduct. That aspect of inducement focuses on the defendant\u2019s subjective mental state when he or she interacts with the law enforcement official.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Second, the state must disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cwould not otherwise have engaged in the proscribed conduct\u201d \u2014 that is, that, under other conditions or in different circumstances, the defendant would not have acted as he or she did. The final sentence of ORS 161.275(2) qualifies the second inquiry. In examining the defendant\u2019s interactions with law enforcement, the trier of fact must determine whether the official\u2019s actions constituted \u201cmerely affording the [defendant] an opportunity to commit an offense.\u201d Thus, even if, in a particular situation, the defendant might not have engaged in the proscribed conduct on his own initiative, the defendant has not been induced if the law enforcement official\u2019s actions \u201cmerely afforded * * * an opportunity\u201d that the defendant decided to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">With that understanding of the text of ORS 161.275(2), we turn to its statutory context. <em>See Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171. We construe statutes in light of the preexisting law at the time of their enactment. <em>See, e.g., Comcast of Oregon II, Inc. v. City of Eugene, </em>346 Or 238, 254, 209 P3d 800 (2009) (\u201c[W]e must be mindful of *** settled law as part of our analysis of statutory context.\u201d). Later judicial decisions, because they were not available for consideration by the legislature at the time of enactment, do not bear on the meaning of the statutory text. <em>See Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 418-19, 939 P2d 608 (1997). In short, we construe ORS 161.275 in light of the common law of entrapment as it existed in Oregon when that statute was enacted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">ORS 161.275 was enacted as part of the Revised Criminal Code in 1971. In the Commentary to the Proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Oregon Criminal Code, the Criminal Law Revision Commission noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-3\">\u201cSection 35 [later enacted as ORS 161.275] restates the doctrines of entrapment which have been recognized in Oregon case law <em>(e.g., State v. Lebrun, </em>245 Or 265, 419 P2d 948, <em>cert den, </em>386 US 1011 (1966); <em>State v. Murray, </em>238 Or 567, 395 P2d 780 (1964); <em>State v. Beeson, </em>106 Or 134, 211 P 907 (1923)).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Commentary to the Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report, \u00a7 35, 34 (July 1971). During the drafting of the revised code, the members of the commission agreed that section 18 (later renumbered as section 35) was based on the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the then-existing federal common law of entrapment in <em>State v. Lebrun, </em>245 Or 265, 419 P2d 948, <em>cert den, </em>386 US 1011 (1966), specifically the court\u2019s reliance on two decisions from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Dec 13, 1969, 31-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>Lebrun, </em>the defendant had been convicted of unlawful possession of morphine and argued that he had been entrapped. 245 Or at 266. The issue on review was whether the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction that \u201can illegal act by the defendant could not warrant a conviction if he were entrapped unless he was previously suspected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266-67. The defendant had been approached in a bar by an acquaintance, Gast, who introduced him to an undercover police officer. Gast asked the defendant about narcotics, and the defendant replied that he had a supply of\u2019'good\u2019 narcotics\u201d and would sell some to the officer, who had offered to buy them. The defendant was arrested when he met the officer to sell him the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 272. The defendant argued that he had been entrapped as a matter of law, because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant was engaged in criminal conduct when he offered to buy drugs from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The Supreme Court began its analysis by setting out the definition of entrapment described in <em>Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 US 435, 445, 53 S Ct 210, 77 L Ed 413 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>'\u201c*** It is well settled that decoys may be used to entrap criminals, and to present opportunity to one intending or willing to commit crime. But decoys are not permissible to ensnare the innocent and law-abiding into the commission of crime. When the criminal design originates, not with the accused, but is conceived in the mind of the government officers, and the accused is by persuasion, deceitful representation, or inducement lured into the commission of a criminal act, the government is estopped by sound public policy from prosecution therefor. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><em>Lebrun, </em>245 Or at 267 (quoting <em>Sorrells, </em>287 US at 445; omissions in <em>Sorrells). </em>The court explained that \u201c \u2018reasonable suspicion,\u2019 as we view it, is only an element \u2014 an important one it may be \u2014 in the consideration of the ultimate question where evidence of entrapment comes into the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268. The court observed that, in <em>Sorrells,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201cthe [United States] Supreme Court said that to determine the question of entrapment both the conduct of the officers and the \u2018predisposition and criminal design of the defendant are relevant!.] * * * The controlling question * * * is \u2018whether the defendant is a person otherwise innocent whom the government is seeking to punish for an alleged offense which is the product of the creative activity of its own officials[.]\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">245 Or at 268 (quoting <em>Sorrells, </em>287 US at 451). The court ultimately rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">\u201c[n]othing in these statements of the law requires the conclusion that previous suspicion (meaning, we assume, that the accused was a violator of the particular statute involved or some similar statute) or reasonable ground for such suspicion, is an indispensable part of the prosecutor\u2019s proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The court then examined two federal decisions, <em>United States v. Becker, </em>62 F2d 1007 (2d Cir 1933), and <em>United States v. Sherman, </em>200 F2d 880 (2d Cir 1933):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">\u201cAnd so Judge Learned Hand in <em>[Becker, </em>62 F2d at 1008,] in considering what would \u2018excuse\u2019 instigation by an officer, said: \u2018The only excuses that courts have suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>so far as we can find, are these: an existing course of similar criminal conduct; the accused\u2019s already formed design to commit the crime or similar crimes; his willingness to do so, as evinced by ready complaisance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">\u201cAgain, Judge Hand in [Sherman, 200 F2d at 882] said that in cases of alleged entrapment two questions of fact arise: \u2018(1) did the agent induce the accused to commit the offence charged in the indictment; (2) if so, was the accused ready and willing without persuasion and was he awaiting any propitious opportunity to commit the offence.\u2019 Elaborating on his earlier statement in the <em>Becker </em>case, above quoted, Judge Hand said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">* * As we understand the doctrine it comes to this: that it is a valid reply to the defense, if the prosecution can satisfy the jury that the accused was ready and willing to commit the offence charged, whenever the opportunity offered. In that event the inducement which brought about the actual offence was no more than one instance of the kind of conduct in which the accused was prepared to engage; and the prosecution has not seduced an innocent person, but has only provided the means for the accused to realize his preexisting purpose. The proof of this may be by evidence of his past offences, of his preparation, even of his \u2018ready complaisance.\u2019 Obviously, it is not necessary that the past offences proved shall be precisely the same as that charged, provided they are near enough in kind to support an inference that his purpose included offences of the sort charged.\u2019 <em>[Sherman,] </em>200 F2d at 882.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\"><em>Lebrun, </em>245 Or at 269-270 (omission in <em>Sherman-, </em>footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">After surveying the pertinent cases, the court concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cThe instant case affords a good illustration why such an instruction as the defendant requested should not be given. The defendant is the same Phillip LeBrun whose conviction of larceny in an office was reversed by this court because his confession to that crime was erroneously admitted in evidenced] * * * The property he was convicted of stealing was narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201cThe defendant\u2019s testimony is not convincing in cold print and evidently was not believed by the jury. The whole record presents a picture, not of a man who was overpersuaded by the police into committing a crime which he otherwise would not have committed, but of one ready, able and willing to seize the opportunity to make a sale of the narcotics in his possession. Yet, it could have been found by the jury that at the time the negotiations commenced Officer Giani did not suspect the defendant of being a law violator or have reasonable cause for such suspicion. Those elements should not be a prerequisite to the prosecution\u2019s reply to a defense of entrapment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>Lebrun </em>and the cases on which the court relied there confirm that, when ORS 161.275(2) was enacted, evidence of a defendant\u2019s past offenses, of his preparation, even of his \u2018\u201cready complaisance\u2019\u201d was relevant to the question of whether a defendant contemplated or would not otherwise have engaged in the conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 269 (quoting <em>Sherman, </em>200 F2d at 882). Moreover, the court endorsed the principle that \u201c\u2018it is not necessary that the past offences proved shall be precisely the same as that charged, provided they are near enough in kind to support an inference that his purpose included offences of the sort charged.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270 (quoting <em>Sherman, </em>200 F2d at 882).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Criminal Law Revision Commission relied on those principles in enacting ORS 161.275(2). The commission thus adopted the view that the determination whether a defendant contemplated or would not otherwise have engaged in the proscribed conduct is not limited to whether the defendant contemplated the precise conduct with which he or she ultimately was charged. What the defendant contemplated need only be \u201c\u2018near enough in kind to support an inference\u2019\u201d that the defendant\u2019s \u201c\u2018purpose included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>offences of the sort charged.\u2019\u201d <em>Lebrun, </em>245 Or at 270 (quoting <em>Sherman, </em>200 F2d at 882). Furthermore, a defendant\u2019s \u201c\u2018ready complaisance\u2019\u201d is also relevant to whether or not he or she was induced \u2014 that is, if the defendant readily accepted a decoy\u2019s offer to commit an offense, a trier of fact may infer that he or she has not been induced. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Becker, </em>62 F2d 1008). Put another way, it is more likely that a law enforcement official\u2019s actions \u201cmerely constituted affording [the defendant] an opportunity to commit an offense,\u201d ORS 161.275(2), if the defendant readily agreed to engage in the charged conduct or conduct that is near enough in kind to the charged conduct to support an inference that he or she contemplated the charged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Later decisions construing ORS 161.275 are consistent with those principles. In <em>State v. Davis, </em>14 Or App 422, 430, 512 P2d 1366 (1973), we upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on entrapment. In that case, an undercover agent had learned from an informant that a heroin sale was going to take place at an apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 424. The agent went to the apartment, where he met the informant and the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The agent told the defendant that he was interested in buying heroin, and the defendant asked how much he wanted. <em>Id. </em>Not knowing how much heroin the defendant had, the agent asked for two bags. <em>Id. </em>The defendant handed the agent two bags, and the agent gave him $20 in return. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the defendant was not entitled to an entrapment instruction because the defendant had agreed to the transaction and also had implicitly understood that the price for the two bags of heroin was $20. <em>Id. </em>at 429-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>State v. Gunn, </em>15 Or App 174, 175, 515 P2d 187 (1973), is also instructive. There, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that he had been entrapped as a matter of law. In that case, the defendant and two companions were hitch hiking in Portland when they were picked up by two undercover police officers. The officers asked the defendant if he knew where \u201cthey could obtain some marihuana or hashish,\u201d and the defendant directed them to an address, went inside, and returned to the car with two grams of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>hashish. <em>Id. </em>at 176. We concluded that the defendant had not been entrapped because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">\u201c[ilmmediately upon being asked by undercover police officers whether he could assist them in obtaining drugs, and without any other inducement, defendant directed them to a source and actively participated in the exchange of hashish for money. At most, this evidence raises a question of fact, not one of law; and the trier of fact was not required to resolve that question in defendant\u2019s favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In light of that case law and our textual analysis of ORS 161.275(2), we examine the evidence in this case. As noted, defendant argues that the only evidence that showed any unlawful predisposition on his part was his possession of a small amount of marijuana. Defendant argues that he only possessed the substance that he believed to be Ecstasy \u201cafter several days of suggestive emails, and only after \u2018Cindy\u2019 asked him repeatedly to obtain it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Although the inquiry under ORS 161.275(2) focuses on defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind when he first interacted with Hahn, the circumstances of that interaction and their later exchange are relevant insofar as they illuminate defendant\u2019s state of mind at the outset. Significantly, defendant clicked on an ad that explicitly proposed an exchange of drugs for sex. Although defendant testified that he did not read the ad before replying, the jury would not be required to believe him. Moreover, after defendant sent what he called his \u201cstandard reply\u201d and received a second e-mail from Hahn mentioning \u201cbud or X,\u201d defendant did not end the communication. Instead defendant replied, three hours later, \u201cI have the bud couldn\u2019t find the X.\u201d From that exchange, which took place within a three-hour period in which the first three e-mails were exchanged within five minutes, a rational trier of fact could find that defendant was predisposed to possess Ecstasy. That defendant claimed he was drug and disease free does not undermine that inference: regardless of whether a trier of fact believed defendant, it could be found that he was predisposed to possess drugs, not for personal use, but as a medium of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Defendant\u2019s statements throughout the e-mail exchange also reinforced the inference that he was predisposed to commit the charged conduct. Like the defendant in <em>Davis, </em>defendant\u2019s statements indicated implicit knowledge of the cost and commonly exchanged quantities of controlled substances. Importantly, and contrary to defendant\u2019s reading of the record, he reintroduced the topic of Ecstasy into the exchange in his April 23 e-mail in which he stated, \u201cI may be able to get some e as well.\u201d Before then, defendant and the officer were corresponding about the marijuana that defendant claimed he was purchasing and how much marijuana would be sufficient to consummate their encounter. Indeed, early on in the e-mail exchange, defendant had offered to provide Hahn with Xanax and Valium, both of which are controlled substances. Hahn had never mentioned either substance. Thus, the evidence permitted an inference that defendant was willing to possess large amounts of marijuana <em>and </em>other controlled substances, including substances of the kind he was charged with possessing. In short, the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that the state disproved defendant\u2019s entrapment defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Craigslist is a website where users can post advertisements to which interested parties can respond by e-mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b369-12\"> According to Officer Hahn, who testified at the hearing, \u201cgreen\u201d is slang for marijuana, \u201cX\u201d is slang for Ecstasy and \u201ckitty is slang for vagina.
