J.</author>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Petitioner, an inmate at Two Rivers Correctional Institution, challenges a \u201cNotice of Rights\u201d form that officials from the Department of Corrections (department) provide prior to inmate disciplinary proceedings. In an earlier case brought by the same inmate and involving a notice of rights form provided by the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (board), this court held that, as petitioner argued, the notice amounted to a rule that had not been properly promulgated according to the procedures required under the Administrative Procedures Act (the APA), ORS chapter 183; we concluded that the notice was therefore invalid. <em>Smith v. Board of Parole, </em>250 Or App 345, 284 P3d 1150 (2012) <em>(Smith I). </em>In the present case, petitioner challenges a different notice from a different agency, also regarding inmate hearing rights, for the same reason. This time, we reach a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Before January 2008, the board provided inmates with a \u201cNotice of Rights\u201d form. That form was included as an exhibit in the board\u2019s administrative rules. In January 2008, following an amendment to ORS 183.413 requiring state agencies to provide parties to contested cases with specified information regarding their rights at such hearings, the board repealed the exhibit and all references in its administrative rules to a notice of rights for inmates. Thereafter, in September 2009, the board provided inmates with differently worded notices. It was one such board notice that petitioner successfully challenged in <em>Smith I, </em>arguing that it fit the APA definition of \u201crules\u201d but had not been promulgated as such under the APA. 250 Or App at 347. The state responded that, because the notice was addressed to a specific individual, it was not a rule at all, but \u201clike an order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. We rejected that argument, holding that the notice was of general applicability and future effect. <em>Id. </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">In the present case, petitioner challenges the notice that is now provided by the <em>department </em>(as opposed to the board) to inmates before <em>disciplinary </em>hearings (as opposed to hearings regarding release dates). Once again, petitioner argues that the notice is not a valid rule because it fits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>the APA definition of a \u201crule\u201d but was not promulgated according to the procedures required by the APA. The state\u2019s first argument is not unlike the one we rejected in <em>Smith I: </em>The notice of rights is not a \u201cdirective, standard, regulation or statement of general applicability^]\u201d ORS 183.310(9). We find no reason to depart from the holding in <em>Smith </em>7; this notice, like the one in <em>Smith I, </em>is not an order or something \u201clike an order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The notice of rights in this case, however, is not a rule. ORS 183.310(9)(f) provides that the term \u201crule\u201d for purposes of the APA does not include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">\u201cMules of conduct for persons committed to the physical and legal custody of the Department of Corrections, the violation of which will not result in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\">\u201c(A) Placement in segregation or isolation status in excess of seven days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201c(B) Institutional transfer or other transfer to secure confinement status for disciplinary reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">\u201c(C) Disciplinary procedures adopted pursuant to ORS 421.180.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">In <em>Smith v. OSP, </em>113 Or App 386, 387, 832 P2d 1270 (1992) <em>(Smith II), </em>we held that a directive announcing priorities of inmate access to the prison library was not a rule under what is now ORS 183.310(9)(f), thereby implying that the rule was a \u201crule[ ] of conduct.\u201d If that directive qualified as a \u201crule of conduct,\u201d surely the notice of rights does as well, in particular the provision stating, \u2018You may waive/decline your right to attend your hearing. <em>Inappropriate behavior could also warrant your exclusion from participation in the hearing. </em>In such cases, the hearing will be conducted in your absence and you will be notified in writing of the decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the notice of rights that petitioner challenges is not a rule for purposes of the APA because, like the library priority rule in <em>Smith II </em>(and unlike the notice of rights at issue in <em>Smith I) </em>it is a rule of conduct, violation of which does not result in disciplinary sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Petition for judicial review dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
