LUBA upheld the county\u2019s decision based on a county ordinance and ORS 215.130(5), both of which provide that, when a nonconforming use is discontinued or interrupted for a certain period of time, the right to continue the nonconforming use is lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Petitioner argues that a vested right cannot be abandoned by operation of law and asks us to reconsider our decision in <em>Fountain Village Development Co. v. Multnomah Cty., </em>176 Or App 213, 31 P3d 458 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 411 (2002), in which we held that a vested right to construct a nonconforming use may be lost by abandonment, interruption, or discontinuance. Petitioner argues that our decision in <em>Fountain Village </em>ignored key differences between vested rights and nonconforming uses that necessitate treating them differently in this context. In <em>Fountain Village, </em>we explicitly characterized vested rights as \"inchoate nonconforming uses\u201d and held that \u201c[n]othing in Oregon\u2019s case law or statutes precludes subjecting vested rights to develop property to the same limitations that apply to nonconforming uses generally[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221. We decline to revisit that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
