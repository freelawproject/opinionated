Giles (now Hetty W. Lawless) administered on the estate of Thomas B. Giles, deceased, with the defendant as her surety. She passed several accounts, showing balances, of which the distributive share of James Giles was $99 05, including rents for 1839-40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">The plaintiff offered to prove the value of the rents received by the administratrix, for 1841-42. This was objected to, on the ground that the plaintiff could not recover any rents received by the administratrix <em>before </em>the settlement of an account before the register, except after an appeal; nor eohld he recover for rents received <em>since </em>the last settlement, otherwise than by citing the administratrix to settle a further account before the register.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-6\"><em>Mr. Cullen, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAH\">contended that the register had no power to compel an administrator to account for rents. The Orphans\u2019 Court will not entertain an appeal to charge the administrator with <em>rents. </em>Prior to 1837, the bond did not cover them. (2 <em>Harr. Rep. </em>5, <em>State use of Brown </em>vs. <em>Brown; </em>9 <em>Del. Laws, </em>163.) But this act does not compel the administrator to receive the rents ; nor give the register any power to make him account for them. It was so decided by the Orphans\u2019 Court, at the last term. In <em>State use of Jefferson </em>vs. <em>Waples, </em>the old Court of Common Pleas decided that even money or goods received by an administrator might be recovered in an action on the bond, though no account had been passed before the register.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-7\"><em>Mr. Layton </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6HZ\">As to the case cited from the Orphans\u2019 Court at the last term, it was where the administrator received the rents as an heir-at-law, and not as administrator. The Orphans\u2019 Court refused to charge him with rents <em>as administrator, </em>which the party, being both heir and administrator, received and never acknowledged as administrator.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-10\"><em>Layton, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajn\">moved a nonsuit.\u20141.

The pleas are non est factum; payment; set-off and limitation. How does it support any of these pleas, to show that another person, Mrs. Hetty Giles or Mrs. Hetty Lawless, has supported or paid money to the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b267-8\">Layton.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AtW\">It already appears in the case that Cornelius Waples is the surety in the administration bond of Hetty W. Giles, (now Lawless) and we offer a payment or set-off by her against this action of her child, against her surety. The pleas, if drawn out, would state this. A payment by a principal is a good defence for the surety; and it would be ruinous to sureties, if payments by the principal could not be given in evidence for them. <em>(Dig. </em>98 ; 1 <em>Harr. Rep., </em>324.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b267-9\"><em>Mr. Cullen, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"ABd\">This evidence is not admissible under the plea of <em>payment, </em>which is something given by the defendant and received by the plaintiff in payment or part payment of a sum due. It cannot be set off, because it is not due in the same right. But has the mother the right to expend all a child\u2019s property in his maintenance and support. Has a party a right to charge the child at all for maintenance, if able to support it ? And there is no evidence here of the mother\u2019s inability. This would be to dispense with guardians, and to give the mother larger rights over the minor\u2019s property than even a guardian. . It does not appear; and cannot appear, at law, that Cornelius Waples is a surety. If the mother does not choose to charge her child for maintenance, has another person a right to do so, even if he be the surety ? How does it appear that she wishes to set up a claim out of the little property of her \u00f3hild, for his board and clothing. She has passed no such ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>.count: and presented no claim. As to the case cited from 1 <em>Harr. Rep., </em>324, no.objection was made to the admissibility of the evidence of maintenance and support in that case; and the point was not made; if it had been made the objection must have been sustained.</p>\n<author id=\"b267-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AeRq\">refused the nonsuit, without hearing argument contra.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Mr. Layton\u2019s argument was, that the act of 1837, extending the condition of an administration bond to rents, did not cover rents, <em>unless the condition of the bond expressly included it. </em>(1 <em>Ch. Plead. </em>209.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The defence offered a set-off of maintenance, support and education of the plaintiff, a minor child of Thomas B. Giles, by Hetty W. Giles, their mother; the administratrix, and for whom this defendant was surety. This was objected to.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b268-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>Cullen </em>and <em>Houston, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b268-9\"><em>Layton </em>and <em>Layton, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b268-4\">\n<em>Mr. Layton</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AhX\">now offered the record of a reference and award for $87 51; and judgment, in a suit by this plaintiff against James W.

Giles.</p>\n<author id=\"b268-3\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AQbB\">ruled out the evidence, notwithstanding the case of the State use of Cannon <em>vs. </em>Cannon\u2019s adm\u2019r., (1 <em>Harr. Rep., </em>324,) where this question does not seem to have been made. In reference to the question itself, the court had no doubt. Evidence of a payment or set off by another person, not a party to this suit, cannot be allowed under the plea of payment or set off <em>in </em>this case; which, though in short, could not be drawn out otherwise than as a set-off or payment by Cornelius Waples.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><em>The Court </em>asked if it was proposed to follow up the record by proof that the judgment against Lawless and wife had been paid; to which it was replied that no such evidence could be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\"><em>The Court </em>then ruled it out as inadmissible, under any pleas in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Verdict for plaintiff $154 84.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
