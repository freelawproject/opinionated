That such a house was a nuisance at common law, its tendency being to corrupt the neighborhood.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-4\">Judge Harrington</author>\n<p id=\"AmZ\">charged the jury that the keeping of a common gaming house was a nuisance at common law, and as such indictable under section 2860, of the <em>Code. </em>The offence was the causing and procuring many persons to resort to such a house, for the purpose of gaming, and for the defendant\u2019s profit, either directly upon the game itself, or the incidental sale of oysters or other things. Such a house is an encouragement to idleness, cheating and other corrupt practices; tends to produce public disorder by congregating many people ; and to draw the young and unwary from the paths of virtue. A disorderly house is a nuisance, if the persons there assembled annoy the neighborhood by loud noises, cursing or swearing ; a gaming house is also a nuisance if it hold out inducements and attractions to bring together persons in such numbers, or so often, as to make it injurious to the public, and dangerous to the neighborhood, by drawing the sober and industrious into habits of idleness and vice, and corrupting the young and unwary. One of the witnesses in this case, who stood over the gaming table, was a youth of tender years, and to such persons the example and influence of such a house, if they were generally brought within its demoralizing influence, would he far worse than would be the mere disturbance of a neighborhood, by any amount of noise or unseasonable mirth. Yet that was a nuisance ; and so was such a gambling house though kept by a private person. But it must be of such a general or Common character as <em>thus </em>to amount to a nuisance, or it is not an indictable offence; for a private person may allow gaming in his house, without being guilty of a nuisance. Tavern keepers and keepers of ale houses or victualling houses, are under a more stringent rule by the provisions of section 930 of the <em>Code, </em>which makes it an indictable offence for such persons to suffer <em>any game </em>to be played in or about the house, upon which <em>any thing </em>is betted. But the defendant was not indicted as a keeper of a victu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ailing house, and could only be convicted as the keeper of such a private house, as amounted to a common -gaming house and a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The defendant was acquitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
