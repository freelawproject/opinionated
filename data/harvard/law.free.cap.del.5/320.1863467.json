Abraham Daizey died after January, 1848; the widow rented the land to Henry Hudson, for one year; cultivated it herself the second, and rented it out to another person the third year. The trespass complained of, was moving a fence in April of the year when Hudson tilled the farm, under rent from the widow; she being in the house. The question was, whether plaintiffs could recover in this action ; the defendant insisting that being out of possession, plaintiffs could not maintain trespass. (1 <em>Harr.

The action is for an injury to the possession; and the form of remedy is not merely arbitrary, but necessarily arising from the nature of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Verdict for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
