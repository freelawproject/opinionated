The plaintiff offered pretensions which were objected to for want of notice. The sheriff proved that he gave notice to the defendant of laying down pretensions on a certain day. The parties and surveyor met at the time appointed and commenced the survey. Before closing they adjourned until the next Tuesday. On that day no one went, it being rainy. The sheriff and surveyor and plaintiff met, on the next day, and made the survey, without any further notice to the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Alg\">\n<em>Mr. Bates</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJN\">objected to the admissibility of the plots on this ground, and because it did not appear that the surveyor was sworn.
