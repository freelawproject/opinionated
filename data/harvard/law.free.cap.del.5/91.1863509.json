This cause was, therefore, tried before the Chancellor and Judges Harrington, Milligan and Wootten.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AlF5\">Bayard.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxH\">The case depends on the construction of the will of John Elliott, and on the question whether Mary Inslee, his daughter, took any vested interest under the devise to her. The cardinal principle is the intent of the testator, which is to be ascertained, not by conjecture, but on certain rules of construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-6\">1. All parts of the will must be taken together, so as to form a whole if possible; but if different parts clash and cannot be recon-oiled, the last clause must prevail; differing therein from deeds. [6 <em>T. R. </em>314; 2 <em>Taunt. </em>109; 1 <em>Swanst. </em>29; 18 <em>Ves. </em>421; 6 <em>Vesey </em>100; <em>Selw. </em>158, 163.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\">2. Events happening subsequent to the date of the will cannot vary its construction. [11 <em>Ves. </em>457.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-9\">The legacies are in the alternative; to pay Mary Inslee, <em>if she become a widow ; </em>and if she does not become a widow, then to her two children, to be paid to them at their age of twenty-one years. This necessarily limits the bequest to Mary Inslee, to her becoming a widow <em>before her children came of age.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-11\">Both the legacies cannot vest; one must yield to the other. If Mary Inslee became a widow before the children came of age, she would be entitled to the money; if the children came of age before she became a widow, the legacy vested in them, and they could recover it. When, therefore, their right to it became perfect, the prior inconsistent bequest failed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-12\">If there had been no time fixed for the payment of the money to the grandchildren, both devises might have stood; but the devise to them at age necessarily limits the previous devise to their mother, if she became a widow, to the time before payment of the legacy to the mother.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AO6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>Bayard, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ARI\"><em>Layton, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-3\">Layton.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP6\">The argument of Mr. Bayard goes too far. If his construction be the correct one, it entirely defeats the will of John Elliott, for by it neither Mary Inslee nor her children would be entitled. They could not be entitled on their coming at age merely, so as to d\u00e9feat the bequest to their mother, in case she should <em>at any_ time </em>become a widow; and if she was not entitled on her becoming a widow, neither she nor her children could be entitled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmA\">The children would be entitled only on the death of their mother, a feme covert, and also on their attaining full age. The heir at law cannot be disinherited, unless by express words or necessary implication. [6 <em>Cruise\u2019s Dig. </em>173; <em>Prec. Ch. </em>473.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMm\"><em>Mr. Bayard </em>replied.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AYf\">Judgment.The court being of opinion that the devise to Mary Inslee, the daughter of the testator, she having become a widow, thereupon took effect and became vested, it is therefore considered and adjudged by the court that the judgment of the Superior Court be and the same is hereby in all things affirmed, the record remanded and the costs in error be paid by the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
