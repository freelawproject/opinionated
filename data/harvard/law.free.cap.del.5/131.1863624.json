After the issuing this execution, and before the levy, Kinney sold and delivered the boy to N. &amp; W. B. Horsey, who had no knowledge of the execution. The boy was afterwards levied upon and sold by the sheriff to one Lewis Jefferson, who immediately transferred him to plaintiff, who was a son in law of Daniel Knowles, a negro trader, and who had until recently lived in the State of Ohio. Jefferson was not present at the sale; and soon after left the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">A witness was asked if Jefferson also was a negro trader; which, though objected to, was allowed; and the answer was that he bore that character.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-8\"><em>Mr. </em>Cullen.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWo\">Jefferson bought the boy as the agent of Taylor, and transferred the bill of sale at once. He has no interest in this suit; his character cannot be in issue in it. Though the purchase of a negro with intent to export him unlawfully frees the negro, it is a question between the negro and purchaser, not between the purchaser and another.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Cullen, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-12\"><em>Saulsbury </em>and <em>Layton, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-4\"><em>The </em>Court:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae\">The testimony may be irrelevant, or it may be followed up so as to make it relevant. The criminal law of the State prohibits the sale of a slave to a person residing out of the State, or to a person residing in the State, who intends to export him unlawfully; and the purchase of a slave with such unlawful intent, frees the negro. A foreign purchaser could not, in violation of this law, maintain an action in our courts for such a slave; nor could a purchaser within the State, who bought with intent unlawfully to export him, maintain an action for the slave. In such case the courts refuse to aid in carrying out a fraud on the law itself. And on the question of the <em>intent </em>with which a person bought a slave, his general character as a negro trader is relevant, and admissible in evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-5\"><em>Mr. Saulsbury </em>moved a nonsuit,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFk\">on the grounds\u20141. That the assignment of the bill of sale to Taylor was dated five days <em>before </em>the sheriffs sale; and 2. that the property declared for was not the property proved; the declaration being for a negro <em>man, </em>and the proof of a boy eight or ten years old.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Cullen.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afh\">1. The action is in trover; the bill of sale is not declared on; a question of property is pending; a sale of the negro is proved; a public sale; by the sheriff; the fact of a bill of sale subsequently made, reciting the sal\u00e9; and yet it is all to be nothing because a mistake in the date of the bill of sale cannot be corrected according to the fact. 2. The term \u201cman-slave\u201d is indicative of gender and not of age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\"><em>Mr. Layton </em>replied :\u2014</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\">But the court refused the nonsuit on both grounds taken by Mr. Cullen.</p>\n<author id=\"b140-9\"><em>The </em>Court:</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">The writ of fi. fa. binds the debtor\u2019s property from the time of its issue, so as to avoid any transfer of property, even before actual levy; though it may not give the sheriff such a right of property as to enable him to maintain trover- or replevin, until actual levy.</p>\n<p id=\"Ane\">The plaintiff finally had a verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
