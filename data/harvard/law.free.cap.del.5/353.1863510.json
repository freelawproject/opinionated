SPARKS <em>vs. </em>JOHN P. ZEBLEY.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b361-7\">Foreign attachment against one of several partners quashed, the others being residents.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">Foreign attachment case. Bail in $500. Sheriff returns \u201cnulla bona; afterwards attached lands, &amp;c., on the 17th of November, as per inquisition.\u201d Buie on plaintiff to show his cause of action; and to show cause why the attachment should not be quashed, being issued against a resident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">On showing cause, it appeared that the cause of action was on a promissory note, given by Joseph Scott &amp; Co., and indorsed to plaintiff; the company, consisting of three partners, viz: Scott, Zebley and another. The other two partners were residents of the State, Zebley was a non-resident.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-10\"><em>Mr. </em>Patterson.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac6\">The action will not lie against Zebley, one of the partners, alone; and we can- avail ourselves of the plea, before entering bail. It is a summary statutory proceeding, and must be subject to be met summarily by what would amount to a good plea. <em>(Chi. Pl., </em>41; 1 <em>Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev., </em>153, <em>n., </em>1, 291, <em>n., </em>4; 2 <em>Ib., </em>707.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-11\"><em>Mr. </em>Bates.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQc\">The proceeding is irregular; the taking an objection, without appearing. I waive this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-12\">2. The rule that all the partners shall be sued together is founded, not on the nature of the liability, but on grounds of convenience. It is the several, as well as the joint, obligation of the partners. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>defendant may plead the want of it in abatement; but he must suggest the names of the partners not sued. The objection, therefore, cannot be made in this form. (5 <em>Burr. Rep., </em>2611; 1 <em>Pet. Rep., </em>811.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-7\"><em>Patterson, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-8\"><em>Bates, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-4\">3. But whether one of several partners can be sued alone at the common law or not, he may by the express provision of our act of assembly. \u201c All contracts by several shall be joint and several, unless otherwise expressly stipulated.\u201d <em>(Digest, </em>225.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b362-5\">There is nothing in the nature of a partnership contract to make it differ from other contracts in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Rule absolute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
