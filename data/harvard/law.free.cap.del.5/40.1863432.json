(1 <em>Oh. PI. </em>574-5.) Nothing can be set-off which may not be sued for. Here the set-off alledges a debt due from Smith <em>and wife; </em>but the married woman could not create such a debt; her contract would not bind her. (8 <em>T. Rep. </em>545, Marshal <em>vs. </em>Rutten, 2 <em>Wm. Blac. </em>1286; <em>Cro. Jac. </em>645; 1 <em>Taunt. Rep. </em>212.) Suit against husband and wife, on a contract with the wife dum sola, but alledging a promise after marriage held bad. (16 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 281; 2 <em>Chitt. Rep. </em>697; 18 C. <em>&amp; R. </em>460; 10 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress. </em>558; 21 <em>Eng. C. L. </em>128; 2 <em>Esp. N. P. </em>594; <em>Bull N. P. </em>179.) If the subjects of this set-off were in a declaration, it would be bad on general demurrer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-4\">Huffington.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMI\">All the counts in the declaration, after setting out the note to the wife dum sola, alledge promises to husband and wife. If the set-off of promises to husband and wife be not proper, the declaration is improper, and the demurrer attaches to this defect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b49-5\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A2h\">stopped <em>Mr. Bayard, </em>in reply. On a note given to a married woman, the husband may join her or sue alone; if he join her, his separate debt cannot be set off, and the subject of this plea is the separate debt of the husband; for the wife could not bind herself by such contracts. Possibly a claim founded on a contract by the wife dum sola, might be set off in' such a case as this; for that would be a joint obligation against a joint demand; as to which see 10 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress. </em>558.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Judgment for demurrant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
