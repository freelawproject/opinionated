Helen Street, late Helen Sloane, being dead, at the time of the making of the will of Hugh Smith, the devise to her was a void devise. (4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., </em>526; 4 <em>Bac. Ab., title Legacies, </em>391; 1 <em>Bro. Ch. Rep., </em>84, <em>Maybank </em>vs. Brooks; 9 <em>Vez., </em>575; 1 <em>Harr.

And as to cases of legacies and devises, <em>(Roper on Legacies, </em>320; <em>Plowd., </em>340; 6 <em>Cru. Dig., </em>163, \u00a7 20, &amp;c.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">2. That the estate devised in the first instance to Helen Sloane, was an estate <em>in fee simple, </em>qualified by subsequent words, and reduced to an estate <em>in fee tail. </em>(6 <em>Cru. Dig., </em>266-7; 1 <em>Harr. Rep., </em>439 ; 2 <em>Blk. Com., </em>101; 6 <em>Cru. Dig., </em>220; 3 <em>Yates, </em>187; 6 <em>Binn. </em>97; 6 <em>Johns., </em>185; 1 <em>Wash.

A republication of a will, after the death of a devisee in tail, will not give any estate to the issue in tail. (6 <em>Cru. Dig., </em>168, \u00a7 28, 29; 4 <em>Term Rep., </em>601, <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Kett.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">4. That by the death of Helen Sloane, in the life time of the testator, the property devised to her did fall back, or remain in the estate of said testator, as undivided property. (4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., </em>526; 4 <em>Bac.

This is answered by determining another question, viz: did they take by <em>descent, </em>or did they t\u00e1ke by purchase ?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The word <em>heirs, </em>is sometimes a word of <em>limitation, </em>and at others only a word of <em>description.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Wherever it is employed to define the character of the estate, or to limit its operation, it is then a word of <em>limitation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">In the present case, it is only used as a word of <em>description, </em>referring merely to the persons who were to enjoy the estate of the testator, upon the death of his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">Helen Sloane, the mother of plaintiffs, died in the life time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>testator, and as to her, the devise was absolutely void. Her children, therefore, could not claim through her, but they take directly from the testator himself; in other words, they take by purchase, and were entitled to an estate in fee. Had their mother, Helen Stone, lived until the decease of Hugh Smith, she would have taken only an estate tail; the estate in fee first given to her, having been reduced by the subsequent words of limitation. But she dying before the will went into operation, it was as to her an invalid devise, and her children took in equal moities and in fee, hot through her by descent, but directly from Hugh Smith, the testator, by virtue of the devise.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b207-5\"><em>Raybold </em>and <em>Comegys, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b207-6\">Layton, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">It is the judgment of this court, therefore, that the plaintiffs are entitled, each in fee, to an undivided moiety of that part of the estate which was devised to Helen Sloane; and they direct a judgment to be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
