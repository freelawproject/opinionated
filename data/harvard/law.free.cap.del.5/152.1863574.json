Brick and others, to lay out a road from Long Point, across lands of Elizabeth Morris and Rebecca Corse, <em>or </em>across lands of Isaac Short, to Duck creek, as the commissioners'might judge best. The commissioners returned a road across land of Elizabeth Morris and Rebecca Corse, to which Isaac Short filed the following exceptions, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxF\">1. That the road was laid across land to which he claimed title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZP\">2.

A remote interest, such as that of the occupant or owner of a tavern, that might be affected by the new road, is not such an interest as is contemplated. It may be otherwise in the case of vacating or changing an old road. But in case of a new road, in regard to the persons returned as having an interest, it might operate unjustly to confine the \"parties to the finding of the return; and if a party not named in the return will make an affidavit and support it by competent evidence, that he is the owner or possessor of any part of the land through or along which the road runs, he will be entitled to a review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
