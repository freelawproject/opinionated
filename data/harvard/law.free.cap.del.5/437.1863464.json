They insisted that the papers should be specified, in order that they might know not only their materiality, but ascertain what diligence had been used to procure them; that they might produce them if in their power, or that the affiant might be subjected to criminal liability in case he swears falsely. They said, by reference to the practice in continuing causes for inability to procure the attendance of witnesses, it was constantly required that the names of the witnesses should be disclosed; and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>under circumstances, that the matters to be proved by the witnesses shall be disclosed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-5\">Rogers, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-6\"><em>J.
