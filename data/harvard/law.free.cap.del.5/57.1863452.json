Talley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATI\">Isaac Grubb testified that he wrote the will and wrote the testator\u2019s name, he being unable to write. Neither of the witnesses could write, and Grubb wrote their names also. The will, signatures and all, were in his handwriting. The legatees were his nephews. He proved that the testator was perfectly sane; that he made no suggestions to him whatever, and that he had no known relatives.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-4\">Benjamin P. Lenderman,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArR\">one of the witnesses to the will, positively denied that he had ever signed it by his mark, or had ever attested any will of McCoy\u2019s. He remembered the time Grubb and Talley were at McCoy\u2019s;\u2014Grubb was up in McCoy\u2019s room; that he went for Talley at McCoy\u2019s request, and Talley went for Grubb. He saw no paper like a will, and hear,d nothing about it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">The will was shown to this witness, with his name and mark to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">Witness.\u2014That is not my mark. I never saw that paper. I never put my mark to any paper in- the presence of Andrew McCoy or Isaac Grubb.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-7\">Elihu Talley,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaLC\">the executor of the will and father of the devisees, proved that Benjamin Lenderman came after him to go to Andrew McCoy\u2019s. He went, and McCoy asked him to write his will. He declined because he did not know how; but offered to go for any one. McCoy would name. He mentioned Isaac Grubb, and then witness went for him. Grubb read the will to McCoy,\u2019 and asked him if it was right. He said yes. There was some talk about <em>the </em>witnesses. McCoy made his mark in the presence of Lenderman and this witness and Grubb, and Lenderman also made his mark in their presence. The will was sealed up and delivered to this witness by McCoy\u2019s orders. This was seventeen or eighteen years before the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The case was submitted without argument, and the jury found in favor of the will.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
