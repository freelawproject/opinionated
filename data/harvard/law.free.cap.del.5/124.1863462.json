Itjis not an instrument of evidence. \u2022 It is different as to a witness. He may be cross examined, and apart of his testimony may be received and a part rejected. Not so \u00f3f a book as evidence. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>distinguishing between correct and incorrect charges; if any are shown to be false, the book is not evidence as to any. This is a rule not only of necessity, but of policy. A party relying on his own book exclusively to prove his demand, ought to have no benefit of it, if any part be false. The act of assembly <em>makes, </em>the book evidence, if \u201cregularly and fairly kept;\u201d not otherwise.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-9\"><em>Gordon, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-10\"><em>Johnson, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>Mr. Gordon</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeA\">denied this, and said he had proved the case apart from the book, by the evidence of a promise to pay the account rendered ; and there was a count- on an account stated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AI6\">charged the jury, that a book of accounts regularly and fairly kept, together with the plaintiff\u2019s oath, is <em>competent </em>evidence as to matters properly chargeable in an account, the <em>credit </em>to be left to the jury; and the discrediting any item of the account does not render the book incompetent as a medium of evidence, though it might or might not (as the jury should determine,) <em>discredit </em>the whole account, and render the book of no avail. If some of the entries are falsified, it may operate to discredit the whole account, or only a part; according to the weight which the jury shall give to the contradicting evidence; weighing at the same time the corroborating evidence; such as the evidence of a promise to pay the balance appearing on the account, after inspection of the items. This is evidence upon which a plaintiff may recover, under the count for an account stated, if the jury think it sustains that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
