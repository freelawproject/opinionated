He had issued two citations, and had two returns of non est inventus. He revived the question started in <em>Jeans </em>vs. <em>Milford, </em>3 <em>Harr. Rep., </em>48, as to the mode of .proceeding where the plaintiff below will not appear to the appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">He said that in many other cases the court had held two returns of \u201cnihil\u201d or of \u201cnon est,\u201d as equivalent to a citation; and some such rule was necessary in this case, to proceed in the appeal. The law secures the right of appeal to a defendant, which would be inoperative, unless there can be a mode of compelling the plaintiff to appear to the appeal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b429-7\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AOQd\">laid the rule as prayed, that the plaintiff declare by Thursday next, or judgment of non pros., treating him as cited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
