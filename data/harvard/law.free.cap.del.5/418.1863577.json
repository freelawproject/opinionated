He said it was a privileged communication, which, from policy, the wife is not allowed, to divulge, even after her husband\u2019s death. (1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>\u00a7 34, 8.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-16\"><em>Mr. Fisher </em>insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALe\">that it was not a privileged communication, because\u20141. The estate of Henry Cole was not interested in the question, as it was a controversy between creditors, and the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>had no interest which party received it; and, 2. If Henry Cole was interested, he might be called to testify against his interest, if the party chose to risk his testimony, and his declarations to the wife rested on the same footing. (1 <em>Phill. Pv., </em>70; 1 <em>Bill\u2019s Rep., </em>63.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-8\"><em>Saulsbury, </em>for the execution creditor.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-9\"><em>Pisher, </em>for the landlord.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-4\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AiB\">Communications between husband and wife are regarded as confidential and privileged, whenever brought in to charge the husband, either during his life, or his estate after his death. Though the husband, if alive, might charge himself by his own admissions in evidence by himself, or proved by another, policy protects him from such proof by the wife. If the witness has any knowledge of the relation of landlord and tenant, derived from any other source than the husband, she may prove it; but she will not be allowed to disclose the communications of her husband to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Proof was then offered of the occupation, and <em>rental value </em>of the house; to which,</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\"><em>Mr. Saulsbury </em>objected, on the ground that the claim of the landlord for rent out of proceeds of sale by execution, can be allowed only of such rent as could be destrained for, namely, money rent, or rent by shares reduced to a certainty. Compensation for use and occupation cannot be so deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\"><em>The Court </em>were of this opinion; and awarded the money to the execution creditor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
