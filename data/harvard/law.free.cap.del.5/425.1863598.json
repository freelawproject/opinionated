No admission was proved by Nancy Cono way, the other administrator;. nor was it distinctly proved that she was present and within hearing at the time this admission was made by her co-administrator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-4\">The plaintiff relied on this admission as taking the case out of the act of limitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\">There was some evidence on the part of the defendants that Isaac Conoway had sold lumber sawed by him for Spicer, and by Spicer\u2019s authority, amounting to $90 ; but it was proved in reply that the purchaser had not paid for it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-10\"><em>Cullen </em>and <em>Cullen, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-11\"><em>Saulsbury, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-6\">\n<em>Mr. Cullen</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuHS\">contended\u20141. That the admission was not sufficient to take the case out of the act of limitation, as a promise to pay could not be inferred from it; and 2. that an express admission by one of two administrators, would not bind the estate ; but it must be by all the administrators.

The reason was, that the declaration counted on a debt due from the estate and an implied promise by both the administrators to pay it, which was not proved by the admission of only one of the administrators.
