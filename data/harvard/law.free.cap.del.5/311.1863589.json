It cannot be implied from his continuing to work after full age.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b319-6\">A probate must be signed, as well as sworn to.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">This was an appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace in an action of assumpsit, for work and labor as a journeyman carpenter. The plaintiff made proof of the time and value of his work, and presented a probate sworn to, <em>but not signed; </em>and closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">The defence offered to prove that Chambers was an apprentice to Walker, under a contract with his mother, when he was put to apprenticeship, ratified by him after majority, to work one year after he came of age.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-9\">\n<em>Mr. Bayard</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AWPM\">objected to proof of such contract, even though ratified, as against policy. <em>The Court </em>admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-10\">He then contended before the jury, that if such a contract could be ratified, the ratification must be express, and not by implication. That continuing to work after full age, did not necessarily imply a working under, or ratification of, the contract.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-11\"><em>Mr. Whiteley, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abr\">contended that there was proof of express ratification. He also objected to the sufficiency of the probate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b319-12\">\n<em>Mr. Bayard</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acad\">admitted that the probate was insufficient, and produced another regularly signed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-13\"><em>The Court, </em>to the jury:</author>\n<p id=\"AtU\">The contract under which the plaintiff began his apprenticeship with Walker, does not hind him after full age. He was a minor, incapable of contracting. The mother had no power to bind him by any contract reaching beyond his full age. Yet such a contract is capable of ratification and may be made valid, by the ratification of the party, after he comes of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">There are some contracts made with infants, which are incapable of ratification, because they are against public policy; such are contracts for goods sold a minor to trade on during his minority. Others being for the minor\u2019s benefit may be confirmed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">We think this contract not such as is incapable of confirmation, because of any conflict with public policy. Such contracts as this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>may be for the minor\u2019s benefit; and therefore, may b\u00e9 ratified and confirmed by him. But such ratification must be express, and not by mere implication; and must be made with full knowledge of the party\u2019s rights. (2 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>293, \u00a7 376.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b320-5\"><em>Mr. Bayard, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b320-6\"><em>Mr. Whiteley, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The plaintiff had a verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
