REGISTER <em>vs. </em>THOMAS LAYMAN, Jr. and STEPHEN TOWNSEND.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-5\">After the affirmance of judgment on certiorari, a scire facias may issue in this courq on the recognizance to prosecute.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-6\">Scire Facias on a recognizance entered into on taking out a writ of certiorari to a justice\u2019s judgment. The pleas were performance and payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-7\"><em>Mr. Giuthrie </em>gave in evidence the recognizance, and the decision of the court affirming the judgment on certiorari. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-8\"><em>Mr. Rogers </em>made the question whether a scire facias could issue in such a case as this. There has been no practice such as this; no case in which the question has been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-9\">The writ of scire facias usually issues by virtue of an act of assembly. It must issue upon an entire record; and out of the court in which the record remains. Hence it is usually provided in case of a judgment in an appellate court that the record shall remain, in order to give that court jurisdiction for such a proceeding as this, as in the case of an appeal from a justice\u2019s judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-10\">On a certiorari the judgment of this court is one of affirmance, and the record is remanded. What is the further remedy in this court ? The party might as well take out an execution here, as to sue out a scire facias here to show cause why an execution should not issue. The remedy is by an action of debt on the recognizance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-15\"><em>Guthrie, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-16\"><em>Rogers, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-11\"><em>Mr. </em>Giuthrie.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWVC\">The scire facias is on the recognizance, and not on the judgment of affirmance. That is only evidence of the breach of the condition of the recognizance. The recognizance is a record of this court. <em>(Digest, </em>217, 358.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-12\"><em>Mr. </em>Rogers.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3S\">The only judgment to be executed in this court, is a judgment for costs; the rest remands the record to the justice for execution of the debt.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b357-13\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"APD\">held the scire facias to be a legal and proper remedy in the case. It is founded on a recognizance taken in this court, which is a record of this court, and the act of assembly, <em>(Dig. </em>217,) gives this form of remedy to execute recognizances generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">Verdict for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
