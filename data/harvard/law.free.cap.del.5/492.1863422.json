If these pipes were not, when carried off, the personal goods of Duncan &amp; Woolaston, they could not be stolen. As apart of the realty, they were not under the protection of the criminal law, so as to make the taking of them a felony. It was but a trespass. Whilst a part of the engine, which was itself a part of the building, they were a part of the building; and, if tbes taken and carried away, by one act of severance and separation, it did not come within the definition of larceny, not being a stealing and carrying away of <em>personal </em>property. But if they were severed by the defendant, or by another, at one time, so that they became personal property, and after they assumed this new character, were taken and carried away by him with a felonious intent, it was a case of 'larceny, and the prisoner ought to be convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Verdict\u2014guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
