WILLIAM D. GRIFFITH and sureties.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b117-7\"><em>A. </em>by will gave certain personal goods to his wife, and by a subsequent codicil revoking this, declared that \u201c his wife should have no part of his personal estate, more than the law <em>allowsheld </em>that the wife was entitled only to her third of the real estate.</headnotes>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b117-8\">Kent,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ANq\">October term, 1848.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHn\">This was an action of debt on a testamentary bond of William Griffith, against William D. Griffith, his executor, to recover the one-third part of the personal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-9\">The narr. set out the testamentary bond and recited the will of William Griffith, which gave the wife certain specific articles of personal property; and a codicil which revoked that part of the will and declared \u201c that his wife should have no part of his estate more than the law allows;\u201d averred the receipt of assets to a large amount, a third part of which belonged to the widow; and assigned as a breach the non-payment thereof, . &amp;c., to which the defendant demurred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-10\"><em>Mr. </em>Fisher.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUS\">The demurrer involves a construction of the, will. What is it that the law allows, out of the estate of a man who dies leaving a will ? Nothing but dower in his land; no part of his personal estate. It is not a case of intestacy, but a case where the testator shows his purpose that his wife should have no more than her dower out of his real estate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-11\"><em>Mr. </em>Layton.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auo\">The will must be construed by the known rules of law, which will ever control a particular intention. The fourth item <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of the codicil is to be read as if in the will, and means that the wife shall have such part of his estate as the law would allow, without a will; referring so the <em>intestate </em>law, and not to the act of 1816, concerning dower out of lands. [4 <em>Harr. Rep. </em>38.] The word \u201c estate\u201d refers to the personal as well as real property; and the law referred to by the testator was the intestate law, as well as the law of dower out of real estate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-6\"><em>Layton, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-7\"><em>Fisher </em>and <em>Smithers, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AVS\">\n<em>Mr. Smithers</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGn\">replied, that the will devised all the estate; first specifically, a certain portion of the personal property to the wife and the residue to his children; then, by codicil, revoking these bequests, the testator declares that his widow shall have no more of his estate than the law allows her; thus bequeathing all-the personal property an,d all the real also, except what the law allows the widow, to his children. This is not <em>giving, </em>as the counsel read the will, such part.of his real estate as the law directs; but it is taking away every thing which he had bequeathed to the wife; and shows the intention to take away every thing else, so far as the law would permit him. She should not have what he had before given her; nor should she have any thing else, more than the law allows. Now, the law allows the widow nothing in case of a man who disposes of his property by will, but one-third of the <em>real </em>estate; it is only in cases of intestacy that the law gives her a portion of the personal property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Judge Wootten delivered the judgment of the court, sustaining these general views in favor of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
