That property in slaves is a <em>qualified, </em>and not an <em>absolute </em>prpperty. That slaves are regarded by the laws of this country as human beings, having moral rights, and entitled to the protection of the laws. <em>(Law of Slavery, </em>1, 2; 4 <em>McCord Rep., </em>223; 2 <em>Over-tons Rep., </em>96; 1 <em>Harr.

That the Legislature, upon principles of humanity, and of sound policy, has the power to restrain the traffic in human beings; and to provide for the emancipation of slaves; and to prescribe the mode and the terms upon which the issue of manumitted slaves should be held by their owners. <em>(Canst.

Every act of the Legislature is prima facie constitutional; and this court will not decree and adjudge a legislative act to be void, on the ground of unconstitutionality, except in a clear case. (4 <em>Devereaux Rep., </em>1, <em>Holn </em>vs. Henderson; 6 <em>Cranch, </em>97,128, <em>Fletcher </em>vs. <em>Peek; </em>1 <em>Cow. </em>550, <em>exporte McCollem.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-5\">7. The. question whether a law is void for its repugnancy to the Constitution, is at all times a question of much delicacy, which ought seldom, if ever, to be decided in a doubtful case.
