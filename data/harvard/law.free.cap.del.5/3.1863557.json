A white oak, said to be the beginning bounder of Hobb\u2019s choice, was at the end of an old marked line of trees (which defendant claimed as the true line:) another white oak, standing several yards further east, and called by plaintiff the \u201c Cow horn bounder,\u201d was at the end of a more recently marked line, which he claimed to be the true line of Hobb\u2019s choice. The cow horn oak was marked externally; the defendant\u2019s white \u25a0 oak had no visible marks. By advice of Wm. B. Ewing, surveyor, it was cut down and split open, and near the heart four distinct rows of marks, three in' each row, were found, and one hundred and nineteen years\u2019 growth counted over them, making the oak eighteen or twenty years old when marked, if marked at the time of the patent. A section from the heart of the tree was produced in court, with a very distinct scar in it, covered by a large growth. . The date of the patent was 1714.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-9\">After the evidence was closed, and one of plaintiff\u2019s counsel had opened,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b11-10\">\n<em>Mr. Bayard</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnE\">declined to argue the cause for the defendant, and insisted on the jury taking it, either without or with a charge from the court, as the court should see fit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b11-11\">\n<em>Mr. Layton</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agg\">resisted this, and insisted on his right to address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>jury on the facts; which the court refused to allow, and the jury took the ease.
