Jane B. Spicer was the wife of Lewis Spicer, and was divorced hy this court, and the land occupied by appellant assigned to the wife hy the judgment in divorce. The defendant refused to pay her the rent; and she brought the action below against him for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\">The decree of divorce (April 13, 1844,) ordered one-third of the husband\u2019s land to be laid off by commissioners, to the wife, to hold for her life. The assignment was made the 21st of October, 1844, and confirmed the 26th of October, 1844.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-9\">William W. Morgan,\u2014Described the property laid off to Mrs. Spicer, under the decree of divorce. Theophilus Spicer was in possession in 1844, as a tenant of Lewis Spicer; the farm was good for one hundred hundred and fifty, to two hundred bushels of corn.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-10\">\n<em>Mr. Cullen</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arr\">claimed that Mrs. Spicer was entitled to the land and emblements from the date of the order laying it off, under the decree of divorce; by relation; after confirmation: that the pendency of the libel for divorce was notice to all the world; and the tenant was bound to take notice.

Rent due before transfer of the reversion does not go with it. Rent by the common law and usage in Sussex, is <em>due </em>when the grain is ripe and deliverable, and is due <em>on </em>the premises.
