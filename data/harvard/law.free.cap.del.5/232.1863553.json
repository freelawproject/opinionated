C. Windsor, Esq.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APk\">The first count was special, alledging that Hosea had recovered a judgment against George Culver, before Justice Hearn, and issued execution to constable Burton; and that West, who was the administrator of Culver, promised to pay the debt, if he was allowed to sell the goods. The second count was on a promise to the constable to pay the execution. This case was proved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-9\"><em>Mr. Saulsbury, </em>for defendant below, moved a nonsuit, on the following grounds:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-10\">1. The suit should have been against West, as administrator of Culver, as the goods released were goods of the deceased.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-11\">2. The promise was one to answer for the default of another, and should be in writing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-12\">3. If the promise was to pay Hosea, it was without consideration, as it was not proved that his execution was levied.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-13\"><em>Mr. </em>Layton, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-v\">1. Hosea could not have sued West, as the administrator of Culver; it was a personal undertaking. He had already a judgment that hound Culver\u2019s property through the execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-14\">2. This promise is not within the statute of frauds. It was not a promise to answer for the debt of another, but to pay a debt due from West himself, as administrator of Culver.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-15\">3. The promise to pay Hosea had the consideration of a release of the goods, then in Burton\u2019s hands, under Culver\u2019s execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-16\"><em>Mr. Saulsbury </em>replied.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b240-17\"><em>The </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AGO\">1. The suit was not against West, as administrator, and could not be. It was upon a promise by West personally, and not as administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">2. Neither is this a promise to answer for the default of another. The promise was not to Hosea to pay the debt or default of another; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>but a promise to Burton to indemnify him against Hosea\u2019s claim; or to pay the amount of Hosea\u2019s execution.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b241-6\">Layton,, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b241-7\">Salisbury, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">3. But such a promise, in either aspect of it, was not a promise which Hosea could sue upon. The suit must be in Burton\u2019s name, though the money, if recovered, would be for the use of Hosea; a recovery in this action would not protect West from a suit by Burton, nor Burton from a suit by Hosea.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The plaintiff was nonsuited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
