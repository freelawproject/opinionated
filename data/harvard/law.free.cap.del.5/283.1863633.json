Such amendments are not made under the statute of jeofails, but under the general authority of the court. (7 <em>Term Rep., </em>696; <em>1P. &amp; Duer. Pr., </em>601; <em>Ibid, </em>301.) Our act of assembly uses the words of the English authorities in allowing amendments tending to the furtherance of justice. It authorizes the court before whom a record is, even after judgment, \u201cto order any amendment that will tend to the furtherance of justice.\u201d (8 <em>vol., </em>67.) Judgment may be amended after error brought. Such judgment may be amended by changing it from \u201cde bonis propris\u201d to \u201c de bonis testatoris si,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c. (Dougl., 116; <em>Burr., </em>2730; <em>Sellon's Prac., </em>407.) So if the judgment do not say that the damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>occasione detentionis debiti were awarded ex assensu suo, it may be amended, though it has been assigned for error. Amendments allowed after argument on error. <em>(Str., </em>786.) After judgment the court below could not amend this judgment, but the record being before this court the judgment may be amended in the respects here excepted to, either under the English practice or under our Constitution and act of assembly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b292-7\"><em>Mr. </em>Bates, <em>jr., </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b292-8\"><em>Mr. </em>Bayard, for defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The only amendment necessary to perfect this judgment, is to insert the words \u201cby way of damages,\u201d and make the other corresponding alterations.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Judgment.\u2014It is therefore ordered by the Court of Errors and Appeals, that the judgment and decree in the'court below, upon the plea of nul tiel record, be and the same is hereby amended, by striking out the words \u201cto wit, the debt, interestandcosts,\u201d and inserting after the words \u201c record of the said judgment, \u201d the words \u201c and also interest thereon byway of damages,\u201d so that the judgment in that part hereby amended, will be in these words : \u201c his said debt mentioned in the record of said judgment, and also interest thereon by way of damages.\u201d And it is further ordered by the said court, that the order of the Superior Court, by which it was referred to the prothonotary to ascertain the amount of said judgment, and the amount ascertained by him under said order of reference, as also the several writs of execution, and all proceedings subsequent to said judgment, be and the same are hereby set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b292-6\">Judge Wootten dissented.</author>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
