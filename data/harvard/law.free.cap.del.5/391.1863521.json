For many purposes, a cestui que use is noticed by the court <em>as a </em>party, rules are laid on him in practice, even the rule security for costs, and there can be no objection of surprise or want of notice, to allow \u00e1 party already in court to assume his real position and character, whether as assignee or cestui que use, or by casting off such designation and standing as a party in Ms own right. And if such shifting of the character in which a party stands on the record, should operate by way of surprise to the defendant, in his preparation for present trial, he will be relieved by a continuance at the cost of the party applying for the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Amendment allowed; and the case continued, on payment of the costs of the term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
