Her slavery did not appear, either from the possession of her, or from her color. The presumption of law was the contrary, as freedom is presumed. Such presumption is not rebutted by the fact that the person was in the possession of, or rendering service to, another. He might be so as an hireling. His condition must, therefore, be shown, and where that appears to be evidenced by writing, the writing must be produced, as the best evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">But possession of a mere chattel is prima facie evidence of property, and has always been admitted, without further proof of property.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
