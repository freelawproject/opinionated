To this we have demurred. There is no such saving in the statute, or time given to renew suit on the reversal of a judgment for <em>defendant. </em>Section 10 of the act of limitation provides for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the case of a judgment for <em>plaintiff </em>being reversed.

' Is the plaintiff to begin a new suit? And if so, what if the statute has run in the mean time? A plaintiff is within the spirit of the act, though not within its terms. The reversal of ? judgment for the defendant in the court above, on the appeal of a plaintiff, might be a positive injury to the plaintiff, if he is to be barred in the mean time by limitation. There is no relief for this, unless the case is within the spirit of the saving of tire act of limitation. <em>(Dig. </em>898, <em>sec. </em>10.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-5\">\u201c Sec. 10. <em>Provided also, </em>That if in any action, judgment shall be rendered for the plaintiff, and the said judgment be afterward reversed, or verdict be given for the plaintiff and judgment be arrested, or judgment be given against the plaintiff on a plea in abatement, or the plaintiff or defendant die after writ sued and before the defendant\u2019s appearance; a new action may be brought upon the same cause of action at any time within a year after said reversal, arrest, abatement or death. This proviso however shall not avail, if the first action at the timo of bringing it were barred by this act; but if this act were pleaded in the first action and verdict thereupon found for the'plaintiff, such verdict shall be conclusive evidence that the first action was not at the time of bringing it barred by this act.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b17-6\"><em>The Court </em>stopped Mr. Cullen. There is no saving in the case of a reversal of a judgment for a <em>defendant, </em>and no need of one; and if there were such a saving, it would enable the plaintiff to bring successive suits indefinitely, as often as the judgment against the defendant\u2019is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">The remedy in this and all such cases is to proceed in the original suit, on a reversal by the Court of Appeals; and the plaintiff should have applied to that court for a procedendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">Judgment for demurrant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
