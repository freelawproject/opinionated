A paragraph written <em>below </em>the signatme of the testator, and of the attesting witness, though proved by one of the witnesses to have been so added, <em>before </em>the execution of liiti will, is not proved according to the statute.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-11\">Appeal from the decree of the register of Sussex county, in the matter of the will of George Goslee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The will was dated January 19, 1829; admitted to probate August, 10, 1835; proved again January 12, 1837; petition for review filed'September 4, 1851; decree October 18, 1851. The will was signed by mark\u2014witnesses, John Lowe, William H. Wales, Benjamin Collins and James Nicholson. There was a \u201c <em>nota bene,\u201d </em>written under the signature of the testator, (and also under the signatures of the attesting witnesses,) by the witness, Lowe, who wrote the will. It was as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-4\">\u201c N. B. Item, I give and bequeath unto Aaron Owens, all my personal property, I possess or hold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\">Test.\u2014The foregoing N.

Lowe proved their death and absence, that the will was regularly executed and published, and that the postcript, or N. B., was written by the express orders of the testator before execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\">The register admitted the will to probate, rejecting the \u201c nota bene;\u201d from which decree this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-8\">The exceptions were\u2014 L. That the petitioner, as the administrator/,of Elizabeth Bennett, late Elizabeth Owens, deceased, is not entitled to a review of said will. 2. That no review having been prayed for in her life time, by either her or her husband, and her husband still surviving her, and praying no review, it is now too late for such review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-9\"><em>Mr. Houston </em>argued the appeal for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASF\">and cited 6 <em>Cruise Dig., </em>49 ; <em>Jerman on Wills, </em>69, (6,) 77 ; <em>Lovelace on Wills, </em>159-60 ; 25 <em>Law Lib.; Modern Prob. of Wills, </em>200.

The former construction has been regarded as a refined and even scholastic stretching of the statute; the latter cannot be made without wresting the force of the word \u201c subscribe,\u201d and the apparent object of the law, in adding it to the word \u201c attested.\u201d It has also been regretted that the enlarged construction of the statute in reference to signing wills, had in a great measure defeated its purpose, which was to prevent frauds ; and this mischief would be still more extensive, if both the signing of the testator\u2019s name, and the attestation and subscription of the witnesses should be allowed to cover parts of the will below such signatures. Such is the present case. The \u201cN. B.,\u201d or clause disposing of the whole personal property, is below all the signatures, and is not <em>subscribed </em>by any but the witness, Lowe, in his attestation, evidently written after the will itself.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b377-4\"><em>Layton, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">Decree of the register affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
