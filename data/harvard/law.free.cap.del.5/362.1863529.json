The entire proof offered in reference to the character of this road is, that it is a public road. For obstructions to a public road, the remedy is by indictment. If one individual might maintain a private action for the obstruction of a public road, every person might. Such action cannot be maintained, without the allegation and proof of special damage. There is no such allegation or proof in this case, and the plaintiff must be nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">It is true that the plaintiff may, as he says, refuse to submit to the nonsuit, and go to the jury; but it will be a mere waste of time, as we shall charge the jury according to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The plaintiff submitted to a nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
