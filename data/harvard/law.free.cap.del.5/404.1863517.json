Tried at the June term, 1853, before the Chancellor, Chief Justice and Judge Wootten.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-8\">\n<em>Mr. Houston</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aln\">moved to dismiss the writ of error, on the ground that such writ would not lie to review a judgment of the Superior Court, sitting as an appellate court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-9\">The case was originally brought-before a justice of the peace, and taken up by appeal to the Superior Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-10\">\n<em>Mr. Layton</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2M\">said, that though true it is that a writ of error will not lie upon a writ of error, yet under our act of assembly the trial of cases brought into the Superior Court by appeal from a justice, is to be had just as if such cases were originally instituted there. <em>(Const., </em>13, 6, \u00a7 7; <em>Dig., </em>118.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-11\">\n<em>Mr. Houston</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AH1\">replied, that the jurisdiction of justices of the peace was specially delegated, and there could be no appeal from their judgment, unless it was expressly given by statute. No appellate jurisdiction can be founded on this, unless it be expressly given.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\">The Chancellor said, that before the Constitution of 1792, there was no appeal from a justice\u2019s judgment. By that Constitution the convention to carry out the injunction that \u201c trial by jury shall be as heretofore,\u201d gave the appeal and placed the case in the Superior Court, as an original case. And it is very proper that the right of appeal shall be preserved, since the enlargement of the justice\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Layton, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b413-6\">Houston, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b413-2\">The other judges concurred in refusing the motion to dismiss the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">The case was then argued by <em>Mr. </em>Layton, for plaintiff in error; and <em>Mr. </em>Houston, for the defendant in error; and the judgment below was finally affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
