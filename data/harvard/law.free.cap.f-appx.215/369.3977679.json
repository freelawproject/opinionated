The BIA\u2019s decision is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Alvarado urges that the motion to reopen to rescind the 1996 in absentia deportation order should have been granted because he never received notice of the deportation hearing. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that notice of the deportation hearing was mailed by certified mail to the address Alvarado provided and, thus, that the notice was sufficient. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252b(c)(1) and (c)(3)(repealed Sept. 30, 1996); <em>Matter of Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 27, 36-38 (BIA 1995). Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the denial of the motion to reopen to rescind the 1996 <em>in absentia </em>deportation order. <em>Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">Alvarado next contends that the BIA erred in upholding the denial of his motion to reopen to adjust status based on relief that was not previously available, specifically, his wife\u2019s recently approved I-140 visa application. He challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that the motion to reopen to adjust status was untimely under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23 on the ground that he never received notice of the deportation hearing. The argument fails for the reason previously stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
