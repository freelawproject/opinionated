Myers was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment and timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">On appeal, Myers argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing because counsel failed to: (1) call the court\u2019s attention to the fact that in the period pending sentencing Myers had completed a forty-week drug rehabilitation program, and (2) request a downward departure based on this conduct. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal, contending it is barred by the waiver of appellate rights in Myers\u2019 plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">When the Government seeks to enforce a waiver of appellate rights, and there is no claim that the Government breached the plea agreement, this court will enforce the waiver if the record establishes the defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to waive the right to appeal, and the issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168-69 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cAn appeal waiver is not knowingly or voluntarily made if the district court fails to specifically question the defendant concerning the waiver provision of the plea agreement during the Rule 11 colloquy and the record indicates that the defendant did not otherwise understand the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 461, 163 L.Ed.2d 350 (2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Myers does not contend that the district court failed to adequately question him concerning the appellate waiver at his guilty plea hearing or that he did not otherwise understand the significance of the waiver. Rather, assuming the validity of the waiver, Myers contends that the issue he raises is outside the scope of waiver. We agree. Myers\u2019 plea agreement explicitly reserves the right to appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the issue he seeks to raise on appeal is clearly outside the scope of the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Nonetheless, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not cognizable on direct appeal unless the ineffective assistance appears conclusively from the face of the record. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). Here, counsel\u2019s decision not to argue for a downward departure based on completion of the drug rehabilitation program was not unreasonable; rather, counsel\u2019s decision reflects a strategic choice. Therefore ineffective assistance of counsel does not appear conclusively from the record. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Accordingly, while Myers\u2019 waiver of the right to appeal does not preclude him from bringing his appeal based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim is nevertheless not cognizable on direct review. We therefore affirm Myers\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
