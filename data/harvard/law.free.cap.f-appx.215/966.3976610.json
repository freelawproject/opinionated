On appeal, Cooper argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), other than the characteristics of his criminal history. Cooper maintains that the district court\u2019s failure to articulate its consideration of any of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors presented by Cooper before imposing a Guidelines sentence did not satisfy the district court\u2019s statutory duty to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-23\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence and this Court\u2019s reasonableness inquiry are guided by the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. \u201c[TJhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. While a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not, <em>per se, </em>a reasonable sentence, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. The burden of estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>lishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788. The district court is not obligated to specifically address and analyze every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, the district court\u2019s statement that it has considered those factors is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Moreover, where the district court has considered permissible factors, we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Upon review of the record and the sentencing transcript, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the 57-month sentence is reasonable. The district court accurately calculated the Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months and imposed a sentence at the low end of that range. In reaching its decision, the court heard Cooper\u2019s arguments at sentencing and expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the circumstances of the offense, Cooper\u2019s criminal history, his lack of respect for the United States, and the danger Cooper posed to the community. The court also took into account Cooper\u2019s age and motivation for illegally reentering the United States, factors that Cooper contends call for a below-Guidelines sentence, but concluded that the sentence imposed better served the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Because the district court fulfilled its statutory duty to consider these factors, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
