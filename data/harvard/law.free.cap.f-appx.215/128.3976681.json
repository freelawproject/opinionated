Cole, Jr., a federal inmate incarcerated at USP Allenwood in Pennsylvania, appeals <em>pro se </em>from an order of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissing without prejudice his habeas petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In 1993, Cole was convicted after a jury trial of drug conspiracy, continuing criminal enterprise, and drug possession in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He was sentenced in 1994 to life imprisonment. This Court affirmed. In April 1997, Cole filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, in which he raised a claim that his conviction under section 846 should be vacated in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rutledge v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 292, 307, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996). The District Court vacated Cole\u2019s conviction for conspiracy, based upon <em>Rutledge, </em>but denied relief on Cole\u2019s other claims. This Court denied Cole\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability in an order entered on December 24, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">In September 2001, we denied Cole\u2019s application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. In November 2001, Cole filed another \u00a7 2244 application, purportedly presenting evidence to support two claims in his prior \u00a7 2244 submission, and adding a third claim that prosecutors bribed a witness to testify against him. This Court denied the \u00a7 2244 application in December 2001. In 2005, Cole submitted a third \u00a7 2244 application, claiming that his sentence was unlawfully enhanced in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that there was new evidence of his actual innocence that was not presented at his sentencing. We denied leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in February 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">In June 2006, Cole filed this \u00a7 2241 petition in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, asserting that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate the prior testimony of a government witness and that his sentence was unlawfully enhanced in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Cole contended that he should be permitted to pursue habeas relief through \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ineffective to attack his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The District Court summarily dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice, ruling that \u00a7 2255 could not be considered ineffective or inadequate to test the legality of Cole\u2019s sentence. Concluding that the petition could be considered only as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate the sentence, the District Court determined that Cole had to obtain leave from this Court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the appropriate court. Cole timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For essentially the same reasons set forth by the District Court in its Order entered June 23, 2006, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">As the District Court properly concluded, a \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge the validity of a conviction or sentence, unless such a motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 5. A \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only when \u201csome limitation of scope or procedure\u201d prevents a movant from receiving an adjudication of his claim. <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). \u201cSection 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The \u201csafety valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal because of an intervening change in the law. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120 <em>(citing In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997)) Such is not the case here. The exception identified in <em>In re Dorsainvil </em>is simply inapplicable, and Cole may not seek relief under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Because the \u00a7 2241 petition was properly dismissed and no substantial question is presented by this appeal, the Appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted and the District Court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Cole\u2019s letter motion to file a brief on the matter is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
