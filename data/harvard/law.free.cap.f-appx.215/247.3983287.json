The district court sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Rose appeals his conviction and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">On appeal, Rose first contends the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. In this regard, Rose specifically attacks the sufficiency of the evidence at trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he actually or constructively possessed the ammunition at issue in this case. Where, as here, the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, we must sustain the jury\u2019s verdict if there was substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) <em>(en banc). </em>We do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved any contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>Id. </em>at 862-63. After a careful review of the record, we find the jury\u2019s verdict was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Second, Rose claims that he is entitled to a new trial by reason of ineffective assistance of his trial counsel during counsel\u2019s cross-examination of government witness Tyisha Robinson. Because any ineffectiveness of Rose\u2019s trial counsel during his cross-examination of Tyisha Robinson does not conclusively appear from the face of the record, Rose\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.) (ineffective assistance of counsel claim not cognizable on direct appeal unless \u201clawyer\u2019s ineffective<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ness conclusively appears from the record\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Finally, Rose seeks vacature of his sentence and a remand for resentencing on the ground that the criteria the district court relied upon in sentencing him to a term of imprisonment exceeding by sixty-seven months the high-end of his otherwise properly calculated Sentencing Guideline range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment was not presented to the jury. Rose\u2019s sentencing challenge is without merit. We have previously set forth the steps that a district court should follow in sentencing a defendant <em>post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">First, a district court must \u201ccorrectly determine, after making appropriate findings of fact, the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432; <em>see also Green, </em>436 F.3d at 456.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">Next, the court must determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence within statutory limits that does serve those factors. In doing so, the district court should first look to whether a departure is appropriate based on the Guidelines Manual or relevant case law____If an appropriate basis for departure exists, the district court may depart. If the resulting departure range still does not serve the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), the court may then elect to impose a non-guideline sentence (a \u201cvariance sentence\u201d). The district court must articulate the reasons for the sentence imposed, particularly explaining any departure or variance from the guideline range. The explanation of a variance sentence must be tied to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and must be accompanied by findings of fact as necessary. The district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) in checklist fashion; it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-14\"><em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432-33 (internal quotation marks, alteration marks, and citations omitted). \u201cOur task in reviewing a <em>post-Booker </em>federal sentence is to determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing the reasonableness of a variance sentence such as we have here, we \u201cmust consider \u2014 in light of the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a) and any relevant guideline provisions \u2014 whether the district court acted reasonably with respect to (1) the imposition of a variance sentence, and (2) the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">After carefully reviewing the record in this case, we conclude the district court fully complied with our <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing analysis. Moreover, we conclude the district court acted reasonably with respect to the imposition of the variance and its extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">In conclusion, we affirm Rose\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Aur\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
