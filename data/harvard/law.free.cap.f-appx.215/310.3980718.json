Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Utley contends that his sentence is unreasonable. We note that while the sentence was substantially above the advisory guideline range of eight to fourteen months, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2000), it was within the applicable statutory maximum of two years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000). Additionally, the court considered the permissible 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006) factors when imposing sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Further, while the district court recognized the advisory guideline range, the court sufficiently explained its reasons for imposing a significantly longer sentence\u2014 Utley repeatedly violated the terms of his supervised release by testing positive for use of controlled substances on several occasions and by failing to undergo directed drug treatment. We conclude that the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
