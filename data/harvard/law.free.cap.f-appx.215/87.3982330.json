We once again deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-19\">Carroway filed suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging violations of his civil rights in connection with the open-court publicizing of his status as an informant on two separate occasions in the Superior Court of New Jersey. At the time of the incidents, Carroway appeared before the Superior Court in criminal proceedings against him. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed Carroway\u2019s complaint, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carroway appealed the district court\u2019s decision. This court later dismissed Carroway\u2019s appeal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Carroway v. State, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 564 (3d Cir.2006). During the pendency of his appeal, Carroway also submitted his first mandamus petition. We denied that petition, noting that the relief Carroway sought was well beyond the scope of mandamus relief. <em>See In re: David Carroway, </em>188 Fed. Appx. 69, 70 (3d Cir.2006). We further noted that, regardless of the relief sought, Carroway\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s decision was still pending, permitting him adequate means to seek the relief he desired. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-22\">Carroway has filed his current petition for writ of mandamus pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), asking this court to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-23\">\u2022 Direct the United States and New Jersey Attorneys General to conduct investigations of various due process violations in his case and implement all legal remedies required including a dismissal of criminal charges. (Pet. at 2,19.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-24\">\u2022 Reverse the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss his previous \u00a7 1983 claims and this court\u2019s holding affirming that decision. (Pet. at 6.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-25\">\u2022 Reduce the amount of bail that has been set by the state courts. (Pet. at 16.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-26\">\u2022 Order the Disciplinary Committee of the New Jersey Superior Court and the New Jersey Bar Association to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>disbar various attorneys and state and federal judges that have been involved with his proceedings. (Pet. at 17, 19.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Mandamus is an appropriate remedy in only the most extraordinary of situations and is traditionally used only to \u201c \u2018conf\u00edne an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976) (citations omitted); <em>see also Sporck v. Peil, </em>759 F.2d 312, 314 (3d Cir.1985). To justify use of such a remedy, a petitioner must show that he has (1) \u201cno other adequate means of obtaining the desired relief,\u201d and (2) a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>Haines v. Liggett Group Inc., </em>975 F.2d 81, 89 (3d Cir.1992) (citing <em>Kerr, </em>426 U.S. at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119). \u201cOnce these two prerequisites are met, the court\u2019s decision whether to issue the writ is largely one of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Kerr, </em>426 U.S. at 403, 96 S.Ct. 2119). \u201cFurther, because \u2018[wjhere a matter is committed to discretion, it cannot be said that a litigant\u2019s right to a particular result is \u201cclear and indisputable,\u2019 \u201d a writ of mandamus will only be granted for clear error of law.\u201d <em>Sporck, </em>759 F.2d at 314. Carroway has failed to make any of the prerequisite showings required to confer a writ of mandamus. The relief sought by Carroway is also well outside the scope of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Accordingly, we will deny Carroway\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-20\">. The district court found that all named defendants were immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment or judicial or prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
