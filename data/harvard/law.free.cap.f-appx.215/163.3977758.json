Because we agree with the District Court that the actions of Anthony Gieda and Robert Olecki, Jr. do not constitute state action, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The Mitchells owned and operated Mitchell\u2019s Restaurant, a Scranton, Pennsylvania establishment located on the first floor of a building owned by Dominick and Joyce Degilio. As part of the lease agreement for that space, dated January 3, 2002, the Degilio\u2019s agreed to allow the Mitchells to use some of their restaurant equipment in the conducting of their business and the parties agreed to work out a payment plan for the eventual purchase of the equipment by the Mitchells. Appellants\u2019 App. Vol. 2 at 4. By May 2003, the Degilios had arranged for the sale of the building to a third party. Prior to the closing, the Degilios sought payment for their equipment or, if that was not forthcoming, repossession.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Having failed to reach an agreement for the sale, the Degilios notified the Mitchells that on the morning of Saturday, May 31, 2003, they planned to repossess their equipment. Because the restaurant was closed on Saturdays, and because their lawyer advised them \u201cto stay away,\u201d the Mitchells did not plan to go to the restaurant that morning. Supp.App. at 23, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">On the morning of May 31, at approximately 8:00, Dominick Degilio and a group of friends, including Robert Olecki, Jr., his nephew by marriage, arrived at Mitchell\u2019s Restaurant. Olecki, a Scranton police officer, was off-duty at the time and was wearing his pajamas. The group waited for the Mitchells to arrive for approximately one hour. Then, sensing that \u201csomething was amiss\u201d because of the Mitchells\u2019 failure to appear, and not wanting to enter the building without the presence of a neutral, on-duty police officer, Olecki recommended that Degilio ask that an officer come to the restaurant. Supp.App. at 15, 41. As a result, Officer Anthony Gieda, an on-duty Scranton police officer, arrived on the scene as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d to \u201ckeep order.\u201d Appellants\u2019 App. Vol. 2 at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Degilio explained the situation to Gieda and presented him with a list of the equipment he planned to remove. Gieda indicated that Degilio could \u201c[g]o ahead\u201d with the repossession. Supp.App. at 15. Degilio continued to wait for the Mitchells, and, after some time, Gieda informed him that he had \u201cto make a decision\u201d about whether he planned to enter the restaurant, because otherwise Gieda needed to leave the scene to handle other matters. Supp.App. at 16. Degilio decided to enter the restaurant, gaining access using his set of keys. After a brief delay, the security alarm sounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">After the alarm had sounded for some time, Gieda disconnected it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Degilio and his party then began removing the equipment as Gieda looked on.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the Mitchells arrived at the restaurant. Gieda spoke to both of them, explaining that Degilio had been informed by his lawyer that he was allowed to repossess the equipment. After William Mitchell became upset, Gieda asked him to go outside, where he continued to talk to him about the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">The removal of the equipment took over an hour. Upon completion, Gieda left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>scene. The Mitchells were later forced to have their alarm repaired, and Gieda was reprimanded by his superiors for his actions regarding the alarm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The Mitchells brought this action in United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleging that Olecki, Gieda, and the City of Scranton deprived them of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and summarily and without a warrant seized their property, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by Magistrate Judge Malachy E. Mannion. In a thoughtful opinion, Judge Mannion granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The Court ruled that Olecki acted \u201csolely as a private party\u201d in helping his uncle, and that he did not in any way \u201chold himself out as a police officer,\u201d \u201cexercise[ ] any authority as a police officer,\u201d or display any \u201cindicia that he was acting in his official capacity.\u201d Mem. &amp; Order, dated Mar. 28, 2006 (\u201cM &amp; O\u201d), at 15. As for Gieda, the Court determined that he acted as a \u201cneutral peace officer\u201d because he did not assist in the repossession, intimidate the Mitchells, or \u201cotherwise use[] his authority to ensure compliance.\u201d M &amp; O at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is plenary. <em>Reese Bros., Inc. v. United States, </em>447 F.3d 229, 232 (3d Cir.2006). We \u201cmay affirm the district court\u2019s order if, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">In order to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \u201c \u2018a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harvey v. Plains Twp. Police Def't, </em>421 F.3d 185, 189 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988)). To satisfy the state action requirement, a plaintiff must show that the defendant \u201cused authority derived <em>from </em>the state in causing the alleged harm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Although police officers are undoubtedly state actors, <em>see Abbott v. Latshaw, </em>164 F.3d 141, 146 (3d Cir.1998), \u201ca police officer\u2019s purely private acts which are not furthered by any actual or purported state authority are not acts under color of state law,\u201d <em>Barna v. City of Perth Amboy, 42 </em>F.3d 809, 816 (3d Cir.1994); <em>see Screws v. United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 111, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945); <em>Pitchell v. Callan, </em>13 F.3d 545, 547-49 (2d Cir.1994), and an officer\u2019s presence at the scene of, and acquiescence in, a private repossession is not state action unless accompanied by affirmative intervention, aid, intimidation, or other use of power which converts him from a neutral third party to, in effect, an assistant of the repossessing party, see, <em>e.g., Harvey, </em>421 F.3d at 190-91; <em>Barrett v. Harwood, 189 </em>F.3d 297, 302-03 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>Abbott, </em>164 F.3d at 146-47; <em>Jones v. Gutschenritter, </em>909 F.2d 1208, 1213-14 (8th Cir.1990); <em>Booker v. City of Atlanta, </em>776 F.2d 272, 273-74 (11th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Coleman, 628 F.2d 961, </em>964 (6th Cir.1980); <em>Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit Corp., </em>613 F.2d 507, 513 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The Mitchells <em>argue </em>that the actions of Olecki and Gieda constituted state action because \u201cOlecki had previously arranged with his uncle ... to enter [their] restau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>rant and seize the leased equipment,\u201d and Gieda \u201cchose sides in imposing his will upon [them].\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 11-12. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">First, we have no trouble concluding that Olecki acted in a purely private capacity. On the morning in question, Olecki did not act with police authority, purport to act with such authority, or otherwise display any indicia of such authority. He was not on-duty at the time, he was not wearing his uniform, and he acted in the role of Dominick Degilio\u2019s nephew. His activities on the morning at issue were undoubtedly \u201cpurely private acts\u201d and therefore \u201cnot acts under color of state law.\u201d <em>Barna, </em>42 F.3d at 816.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As such, his part in the removal of equipment from the restaurant is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Second, although a somewhat closer question,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we agree with the District Court that Gieda acted solely as a neutral peace officer. The record is clear that Gieda was dispatched to a \u201ccivil matter\u201d to \u201ckeep order\u201d in the event that a violent confrontation ensued between the landlord and his tenants. Appellants\u2019 App. Vol. 2 at 20, 27. Upon arrival, Gieda did not order the repossession to take place, but, rather, explained that Degilio could \u201c[g]o ahead\u201d while expressly indicating that it was Degilio\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d to make as to whether to enter the restaurant. Supp.App. at 15-16. Gieda did not physically assist in the removal of the equipment and there is no testimony that he intimidated the Mitch-ells upon their arrival or otherwise deterred them from objecting to the repossession. Rather, he explained to them what was going on and only asked William Mitchell to step outside the restaurant when he became upset. All of these actions amount simply to acquiescence in the repossession and presence at the scene to prevent the onset of violence. <em>See, e.g., Abbott, </em>164 F.3d at 147; <em>Coleman, </em>628 F.2d at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The only act by Gieda that gives us pause is his disconnecting of the alarm at the Mitchells\u2019 restaurant. In the end, however, unlike threatening to arrest one who resists repossession, <em>see Abbott, </em>164 F.3d at 147, visiting a tenant alone and instructing him to quit the property, <em>see Howerton v. Gabica, </em>708 F.2d 380, 381, 384 (9th Cir.1983), or ordering a landlord to open an apartment door when she would not otherwise do so, <em>see Harvey, </em>421 F.3d at 190-91, Gieda\u2019s disconnecting of the alarm simply does not rise to the level of critical involvement which would support a finding of state action, <em>see Barrett, </em>189 F.3d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Given that Degilio had the keys to the restaurant and had already opened the door, it is clear that he could have accomplished the repossession with or without Gieda\u2019s assistance. No assertions have been made that Degilio would have refrained from repossessing the equipment had the alarm continued to sound. In addition, the disconnecting of the alarm did not in any way impede the Mitchells from objecting to the repossession, especially since they were aware of the time of the planned repossession and had, in fact, planned \u201cto stay away\u201d because they be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>lieved if Degilio entered the restaurant he would be \u201cbreak[ing][the] lease\u201d and therefore \u201cat fault.\u201d Supp.App. at 26. As such, Gieda\u2019s disconnecting of the alarm \u201cwas not significant since it contributed nothing to the remedy of self-help repossession\u201d which Degilio was \u201cfree to pursue\u201d in Gieda\u2019s \u201cabsence.\u201d <em>Sherry v. Assocs. Commercial Corp., </em>60 F.Supp.2d 470, 476 (W.D.Pa.1998) (Smith, J.), <em>aff'd, </em>191 F.3d 445 (3d Cir.1999).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In sum, we find that the actions of Olecki and Gieda do not constitute state action in aid of Degilio\u2019s repossession of equipment from Mitchell\u2019s Restaurant. As such, no action can lie against the City of Scranton. <em>See Barrett, </em>189 F.3d at 303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\">. It is unclear whether Gieda offered to disconnect the alarm or if Degilio requested that he do so. Appellants' App. Vol. 2 at 23; Supp.App. at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-16\">. The parties dispute Olecki\u2019s role in this phase of the repossession. Because we must view the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the Mitchells, we will take as true their allegations that Olecki entered the restaurant and helped remove equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">. Appellants' argument that Olecki\u2019s behavior was improper because he \"was present at [the Mitchells\u2019] restaurant solely at the request of his uncle\u201d and \"advised his uncle\u201d that an on-duty police officer should be present because \"something was amiss,\u201d <em>see </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 27, is puzzling and misplaced. If anything, these facts further buttress the conclusion that Olecki acted not as a police officer, but as a nephew who was attempting to assist his uncle. <em>See </em>M &amp; O at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\">. Perhaps acknowledging the limited role played by Gieda at the repossession, appellants argue that it is the \u201cconduct of Olecki that is even more shocking.\u201d Appellants' Br. at 27. As discussed above, Olecki\u2019s actions fall far short of constituting state action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b193-18\">. That Gieda was later reprimanded for disconnecting the alarm is irrelevant to the question of whether his action so significantly aided Degilio so as to constitute state action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
