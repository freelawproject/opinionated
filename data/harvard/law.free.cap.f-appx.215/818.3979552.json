Boone first argues that his sentence is unreasonable pursuant to the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He further argues that the disparity in punishment between those who view child pornography versus those who molest children is unreasonable, and that incarceration in his case is more harmful than helpful because there is no evidence that he poses a threat to the community. Boone next argues that the special condition of his release requiring him to submit to polygraph testing and other assessment instruments, violates his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because polygraph testing may force him to risk revocation of his supervised release in order to assert his privilege. Finally, Boone argues that the district court erred by imposing 210 months\u2019 imprisonment for each count to run concurrently, because his second charge, possession of child pornography under \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), carried a statutory maximum sentence of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have stated that the district court first must correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range. Then, using the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence, as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). The relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-17\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-18\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed [treatment];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 259-61, 125 S.Ct. at 764-66. There is no requirement, however, that the district court engage in a detailed, step-by-step analysis of every factor, as we have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the advisory guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>In <em>Scott, </em>we held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences. 426 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Upon review of the record and the sentencing transcripts, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error as to this issue. The district court adequately and properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in conjunction with Boone\u2019s personal history, the nature of the case and the purpose of sentencing. Therefore, the low-end sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">A district court\u2019s imposition of a special condition of supervised release is reviewed for abuse of discretion so long as the objection was preserved for appeal, and will be reversed only if we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the [district] court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>338 F.3d 1280, 1283 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted) (brackets in original). Boone objected to the condition of supervised release on Fifth Amendment grounds below, and, thus, it is preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">The United States Code allows the district court to impose any condition of supervised release it deems appropriate so long as it comports with the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). The Sentencing Guidelines permit the sentencing court to impose any conditions of supervised release that are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-14\">(1) reasonably related to (A) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (B) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) the need to provide the defendant with ... medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-15\">(2) involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth above and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(b). \u201cWhile the Sentencing Guidelines recognize that a condition of supervised release should not unduly restrict a defendant\u2019s liberty, a condition is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>not invalid simply because it affects a probationer\u2019s ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1089 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). A state may generally require a probationer to appear and discuss matters that affect his probationary status without violating the Fifth Amendment. <em>Minnesota v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 435, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1146, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984). Furthermore, we already rejected the argument that a condition of supervised release requiring polygraph testing violates the Fifth Amendment generally. <em>Taylor, </em>338 F.3d at 1284; <em>Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1092</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">A challenge to a condition of supervised release requiring polygraph testing \u201cis neither premature nor speculative\u201d because the defendant \u201cwill be subject to the challenged condition upon his release from prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1088. Although the condition itself is immediately appealable, \u201cspecific challenges to the <em>implementation </em>\u201d of polygraph testing may not necessarily be ripe. <em>Id. </em>at 1089 (emphasis in original). Thus, while the defendant retains a privilege against self-incrimination, he does \u201cnot present a cognizable Fifth Amendment claim\u201d when \u201cthere has been no potentially incriminating question or invocation of the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1091-92. Instead, a defendant may raise his Fifth Amendment claim \u201cwhen [he] is forced to testify over his valid claim of privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in requiring polygraph testing and other assessments as a condition of supervised release because Boone had an admitted history of viewing and distributing child pornography, as well as a troubled personal history. Thus, requiring polygraph testing to ensure compliance with his probationary terms is both reasonably related to Boone\u2019s offenses and history, and when reasonably applied, will not unduly burden his rights. Furthermore, Boone has not yet presented a cognizable Fifth Amendment challenge to the condition\u2019s implementation because he has not been released and no potentially incriminating questions have been asked. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">\u201c[W]e review the legality of a sentence <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1025 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Moriarty, </em>we vacated and remanded for clarification where the district court imposed a general sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum sentence for one of multiple counts because \u201csuch sentences are <em>per se </em>illegal in this circuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant who is convicted of violating \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) \u201cshall be ... imprisoned not more than 10 years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The maximum statutory sentence for count two, possession of child pornography, is 10 years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), yet the district court sentenced Boone to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment concurrent in each case. The government concedes, and we agree, that the district court erred in this regard. Accordingly, we vacate and remand as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED and REMANDED IN PART.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-14\">.
