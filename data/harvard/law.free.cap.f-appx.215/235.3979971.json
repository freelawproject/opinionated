Under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), Tillman was sentenced to the statutorily-mandated minimum sentence of 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>months of imprisonment. He appeals his sentence, arguing: (1) his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced because his prior convictions were not charged in the indictment or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) his sentence was also unconstitutionally enhanced because specific attributes of his prior convictions (i.e., that the offenses were \u201cviolent felonies\u201d committed on \u201coccasions different from one another\u201d) were not charged nor proven to a jury, and (3) his South Carolina conviction for failure to stop for a blue light was improperly treated as a predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">All of Tillman\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by controlling circuit precedent. Affirming the continued validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), this court has held that prior convictions may be used as the basis for an armed career criminal sentence and need not be charged in the indictment, admitted by the defendant during the plea colloquy, or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). This court has also ruled that the nature and occasion of prior offenses are facts inherent in the convictions and the government is not required to allege prior convictions in the indictment or submit proof of them to a jury. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 285-87 (4th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, in <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 390-91 (2003), we held that a conviction for failure to stop for a blue light pursuant to S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 56-5-750 constitutes a violent felony for enhancement purposes under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
