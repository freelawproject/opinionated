Howard claims (1) that he was simply a crew member; (2) he had no ownership interest in this substantial amount of drugs he was transporting, and he did not organize the venture; (3) there were more individuals than just the crew that participated in the drug smuggling; and (4) there was a captain on the vessel that was more culpable than him. He contends that these facts demonstrate that he was merely a pawn in the transportation of the drugs and, thus, that he should be granted a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-21\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). The defendant bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to a mitigating-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-22\">To determine whether a minor-role reduction applies, a district court first should measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which the defendant has been held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 940-41. This requires the district court to assess all probative facts of the defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 943. In cases where the defendant is a drug courier, relevant factual considerations include, but are not limited to: (1) the amount of drugs; (2) the fair market value of the drugs; (3) the amount to be paid to the courier; (4) the defendant\u2019s equity interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>in the drugs; (5) the defendant\u2019s role in planning the criminal scheme; and (6) the defendant\u2019s role in distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 945. The amount of drugs, in particular, is a material consideration in assessing the defendant\u2019s role, and \u201cmay be dispositive-in and of itself-in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Further, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">We agree with the district court that Howard failed to carry his burden under \u00a7 3B1.2. It is clear that his role in the offense was identical to the conduct for which he was held accountable, and he did not show that he was substantially less capable than other participants involved in the conspiracy. Howard was held accountable only for the 1,832 kilograms of cocaine that he helped to transport, a substantial amount of drugs. His role was not minor in the relevant conduct of possession and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine. Although there was a captain on board who may have played a more significant role, Howard brought forth no evidence at the sentencing hearing that the other crew members on board were more involved in the venture than he was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Howard next argues that his 135-month sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as required by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that he presented the district court with \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which the district court summarily addressed by stating that the sentence imposed was reasonable. He argues that the district court\u2019s failure either to discuss the factors that he presented or to elaborate on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors it considered suggested that the district court arbitrarily rejected the factors or did not adequately consider them. He claims that the district court only considered the guidelines in fashioning his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Generally, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s sentence, imposed after consulting the guidelines and considering the factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a), for reasonableness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). In sentencing a defendant, the factors that a district court should consider include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and provide needed correctional treatment; (4) the applicable guideline range; (5) the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; and (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(7). A district court need not explicitly consider every single \u00a7 3553(a) factor in order for the sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). In fact, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Further, although there is no <em>per se </em>presumption that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable, \u201c[rjeview for reasonableness is deferential ... and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The record reflects that the district court adequately and properly considered the \u00a7 3533(a) factors and, thus, complied with <em>Booker. </em>Before imposing the sentence, the district court heard Howard\u2019s arguments in mitigation and then sentenced him to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was at the low end of his guideline range. The district court explicitly acknowledged that it had considered the advisory guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining that the sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. And as we stated in Scott, 426 F.3d at 1330, the district court was not required to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">We find that (1) the district court did not clearly err in denying Howard\u2019s request for a \u00a7 3B1.2 mitigating-role reduction, and (2) the imposition of Howard\u2019s sentence reflected consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and Howard\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-23\">. 46 App. U.S.C., \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1006-7\"><em>. </em>The government argues that, because Howard did not object to the district court\u2019s failure to consider adequately the \u00a7 3553(a) factors below, we should review his reasonableness argument for plain error. Because Howard\u2019s argument fails under the more deferential reasonableness standard, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
