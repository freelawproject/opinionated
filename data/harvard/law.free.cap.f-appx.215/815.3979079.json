After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">A jury found Starks guilty on three counts of drug-related offenses. The jury also found that Starks\u2019s offenses involved 14.7 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">At sentencing, the district court also attributed 14.7 grams of cocaine base to Starks and used that drug quantity to calculate Starks\u2019s offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court also applied the guidelines career offender provision, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because Starks had two prior felony convictions for controlled substance offenses. With a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, Starks\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 360 months to life imprisonment. After resolving several objections by Starks that are not relevant to this appeal, the district court sentenced Starks to concurrent 360-month sentences on each count. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">Citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Starks argues that his 360-month sentence is unreasonable because the Sentencing Guidelines used to calculate his advisory guidelines range are \u201cpresumptively unreasonable.\u201d Starks, who is African American, bases his argument on what he calls \u201cconcessions\u201d made by the Sentencing Commission in a 2004 report entitled Fifteen Years of Guidelines Sentencing: An Assessment of How Well the Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals of Sentencing Reform. In the 2004 report, the Sentencing Commission examined, <em>inter alia, </em>disparities in sentences among minority groups. Starks asserts that the Sentencing Commission identified several guidelines provisions that had a disproportionate impact on African American offenders, including the career offender provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and the 100-to-1 crack to powder cocaine ratio in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Starks contends that the Sentencing Commission concluded that the harsher penalties associated with the career offender and cocaine ratio guidelines provisions were unjustified. The government does not dispute that these conclusions are contained in the Sentencing Commission\u2019s 2004 report, but contends that the report does not make Starks\u2019s sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">Because Starks raises these arguments for the first time on appeal, we review only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, \u201c[a]n appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018\u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Here, Starks fails to show error, let alone plain error. After <em>Booker, </em>the district court first must correctly calculate a defendant\u2019s advisory imprisonment range under the Sentencing Guidelines before determining an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360 (11th Cir.2006). In so doing, the district court is not free to disregard provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines because they have been the subject of criticism. Furthermore, once the advisory guidelines range has been properly calculated, the district court may not vary from that range based on a broad, categorical rejection of congressional sentencing policy reflected in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1364-68 (reversing district court\u2019s variance from advisory guidelines based on criticisms of 100-to-1 crack-to-cocaine ratio). Rather, the district court\u2019s variance from the advisory guidelines range must \u201creflectn the individualized, case-specific factors in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1369.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Starks cannot show that his sentence is unreasonable based solely on the generalized disparity concerns raised in the Sentencing Commission\u2019s 2004 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-11\">. The presentence investigation report (\"PSI\u201d) attributed 37.5 grams of cocaine base to Starks. The district court sustained Starks\u2019s objection to the PSI\u2019s drug quantity and found Starks responsible for 14.7 grams of cocaine base, consistent with the jury. However, the drug quantity attributed to Stark did not affect his guidelines calculations because, as a career offender convicted of an offense with a statutory maximum of life, Starks's offense level was set at 37, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-20\">. On appeal, Starks does not argue that his sentence is unreasonable based on individualized, case-specific factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Rather, Starks makes a sweeping challenge to these two provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines as \"presumptively unreasonable\u201d based on the policy concerns raised in the Sentencing Commissions 2004 report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
