Young\u2019s presentence report initially held him accountable for 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, the government agreed the readily provable drug quantity was between 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-18\">On May 6, 2004, the first day of Young\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government called FBI Agent Kevin Wevodau, who had interviewed people involved in the conspiracy, in order to establish an estimate of the drug quantity attributable to Young. Agent Wevodau testified that Melissa Lynn Martin, a co-defendant, stated that she made at least eight to ten trips with Young and Kevin Dowdy, another co-defendant, to New York to purchase about 60 grams of crack cocaine per trip.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Evaluat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ing Agent Wevodau\u2019s testimony regarding his conversation with Martin alone, the District Court stated, \u201cI\u2019m fairly satisfied that, by the most conservative estimate, that we have at least 598 grams of crack cocaine.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 11, 2004, the second day of Young\u2019s sentencing hearing, the District Court concluded that \u201cthere is sufficient indicia of reliability to support the amount of drugs that the Government wishes to attribute to this Defendant by conservative estimates.\u201d The District Court sentenced Young to 324 months of imprisonment. Young appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">We affirmed his conviction, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Young, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 107 (3d Cir.2005) (unpublished). At Young\u2019s re-sentencing hearing held on November 2, 2005, Young\u2019s counsel argued for a \u201csubstantially\u201d reduced sentence based, in part, on the disparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties in the sentencing guidelines. The District Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">Granted, that the guidelines were very harsh when we\u2019re dealing with crack cocaine, but that\u2019s what was intended by Congress, and I don\u2019t think that the Judges have a right to legislate, whether we agree or disagree, because that is basically not our role. But under <em>Booker, </em>because the guidelines are now advisory, they are, nevertheless, required to be considered by the Court, even under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a), that\u2019s one of the things of all the elements that are indicated in that statute, we are obligated by that legislation to give serious consideration to the guidelines in fashioning a sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">(App. 43A.) On remand, the District Court imposed a sentence of 210 months of imprisonment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We exercise jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327-28 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Young makes two arguments on appeal. First, he contends that his sentence is too severe, or \u201cgreater than necessary,\u201d because it was the result of an unreasonable disparity between the penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine under the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He states that if his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>case had involved powder cocaine, the quantity attributable to him would have yielded a total Offense Level of 31 and a minimum of 108 months. Young also complains that the evidence as to the quantity of crack cocaine was not reliable for several reasons. First, Agent Wevodau\u2019s testimony contained hearsay and the credibility of Agent Wevodau\u2019s interview subjects was dubious. Second, only two of the individuals interviewed by Agent Wevodau\u2014 Martin and Kowalski \u2014 testified at Young\u2019s trial, and their trial testimonies did not involve drug quantities attributable to Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Young\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because the sentencing guidelines\u2019 crack/powder cocaine disparity made his sentence too severe is without merit. Before <em>Booker, </em>we routinely upheld the disparity against constitutional attack, including equal protection, cruel and unusual punishment, and vagueness claims. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Frazier, </em>981 F.2d 92, 95-96 (3d Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>979 F.2d 317, 320 (3d Cir.1992), <em>superseded by statute as stated in United States v. Roberson, </em>194 F.3d 408, 417 (3d Cir.1999). After <em>Booker, </em>we addressed the issue of whether it is legal error for a District Court to believe that it had no discretion to impose a below-guidelines sentence on the basis of the crack/powder cocaine disparity. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 244 (3d Cir.2006). In <em>Gunter, </em>we held that \u201cdistrict courts may consider the crack/powder cocaine differential in the Guidelines as a factor, but not a mandate, in the post-<em>Booker </em>sentencing process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In this case, the District Court correctly applied our <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing process, which includes calculating a defendant\u2019s guidelines sentence in the same manner as it would have before <em>Booker. See Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247 (citing <em>United States v. King, </em>454 F.3d 187, 196 (3d Cir. 2006) and <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330). The District Court also did not suggest that applying the guidelines\u2019 penalties for crack cocaine was mandatory, rather it stated \u201cthe guidelines are now advisory.\u201d Thus, it reduced Young\u2019s <em>pre-Booker </em>sentence of 324 months, when the guidelines were mandatory, to 210 months under the post-<em>Booker </em>advisory regimen. The District Court\u2019s apparent consideration and application of the current statutory crack/powder cocaine ratio was an appropriate exercise of its discretion pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247 (citing <em>King, </em>454 F.3d at 194). Honoring Young\u2019s request of an even lower sentence based on a more \u201cjustified\u201d ratio would have flouted Congress\u2019 intent embodied in \u00a7 841 and the Commission\u2019s incorporation of this intent in the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247 (\u201c[Fjederal courts of appeal have unanimously held that ... sentencing courts may not craft their own ratio as a substitute for the 100:1 ratio chosen by Congress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Young\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable also overlooks the District Court\u2019s additional consideration of his background, including his history of drug use, his family situation, and his lack of criminal record, as well as the goal of achieving parity among his co-defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>The District Court took into account the firearm and leadership role enhancements, and imposed a sentence 114 months below the minimum guidelines range. Thus, we find that the District Court\u2019s consideration and application of the crack/powder cocaine ratio did not render Young\u2019s sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Young\u2019s second argument that the District Court erroneously found that 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine were attributable to him is also unpersuasive. The standard of proof for sentencing facts under the sentencing guidelines remains preponderance of the evidence. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330. We review the District Court\u2019s findings of fact on the issue of drug quantity for clear error. <em>United States v. Miele, </em>989 F.2d 659, 663 (3d Cir.1993). Before <em>Booker, </em>we held that using hearsay for sentencing purposes does not violate the Sentencing Reform Act. <em>United States v. Brothers, </em>75 F.3d 845, 848 (3d Cir.1996). \u201cThe sentencing court can give a high level of credence to hearsay statements, going so far as to \u2018credit hearsay evidence over sworn testimony, especially where there is other evidence to corroborate the inconsistent hearsay statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miele, </em>989 F.2d at 664). Further, <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for holding hearsay inadmissible at sentencing, especially as the Supreme Court did not invalidate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 259, 125 S.Ct. 738 (stating that \u201cwith [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) ] excised, ... the remainder of the Act satisfies the Court\u2019s constitutional requirements\u201d). The sentencing guidelines also permit a District Court to consider \u201crelevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable to trial.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 6A1.3(a). This includes reliable hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at cmt. (citing \u00a7 3661). However, both our precedent and the sentencing guidelines require that a sentencing fact have \u201csufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>Brothers, </em>75 F.3d at 848 (internal quotations omitted); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 6A1.3(a). We have directed District Courts to apply the sufficient indicia of reliability standard \u201crigorously,\u201d <em>Miele, </em>989 F.2d at 664, but have also recognized that \u201cin calculating the amount of drugs involved in a particular operation, a degree of estimation is sometimes necessary.\u201d <em>United States v. Paulino, </em>996 F.2d 1541, 1545 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">In this case, the District Court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that Young was responsible for 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. The District Court found sufficient indicia of reliability to support this amount of drugs, even by highly conservative estimates, based on \u201ca lot of testimony, over a period of time\u201d and on the fact that \u201cmuch of the evidence was alluded to at the trial.\u201d Even though Young asserts that only two out of the six individuals interviewed by Agent Wevodau testified at his trial, the District Court found these trial witnesses\u2019 exposure to cross examination was an \u201cimportant factor\u201d in its consideration of the evidence on the issue of drug quantity in Young\u2019s sentencing hearing. In addition to the trial record, the District Court had at its disposal the testimony of Agent Wevodau, which was notably specific both in the number and timing of the trips individuals involved in the conspiracy took with Young and in the quantity of drugs pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>chased during these trips,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and extensive argument from the government\u2019s and Young\u2019s attorneys during Young\u2019s sentencing and resentencing hearings. Thus, the record clearly supports the District Court\u2019s finding that 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms were attributable to Young. Accordingly, the District Court did not commit clear error, and we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\">. This amount yielded a base Offense Level of 38. Young\u2019s presentence report added two-level firearm and three-level managerial enhancements for a total Offense Level of 43. The resulting guideline sentence was life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-10\">. The second addendum to Young\u2019s presentence report incorporated this reduction and stated a total Offense Level of 41, yielding a sentence range of 324 to 405 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b115-20\">. Agent Wevodau also spoke to Dawn Phillips, Carl Laserre, Michelle Kowalski, Vince McHenry and Rosemary Lewis about trips they made with Young and Dowdy and, in some cases, also with Bernard Jones, another co-defendant, to New York to purchase crack cocaine. Agent Wevodau testified to the following. Phillips made six trips with Dowdy and Young during the spring to summer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>2001, purchasing 80 to 180 grams per trip. Laserre recounted four or five trips in mid-2001 with Dowdy, Jones and Young for purchases in the amount of two to three thousand dollars, or about 100 grams, per trip. Kowalski made two trips in summer of 2001 with Dowdy or Young for a baseball-sized quantity, or about 50 grams, per trip. Lewis acknowledged at least two trips with Dowdy and Young for an unspecified quantity. McHenry stated he made five trips with Dowdy and Young for an unspecified quantity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b116-6\">. At the conclusion of the first part of Young's sentencing hearing, the District Court asked both parties to submit estimates of drug quantity attributable to Young. The government\u2019s estimate, submitted to the District Court on May 11, 2004, \"involved at least 1,460 grams of crack cocaine.\u201d Young\u2019s brief contends, without pointing to a source, \u201d[o]n May 11, 2004, prior to the sentencing hearing, the United States stated that the maximum amount of crack attributable to Young was 150 grams to 500 grams.\u201d This statement by Young is contrary to the government's submitted estimate and to the record, which does not reflect a departure from the government\u2019s allegation that the readily provable quantity of 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms contained in the second addendum to Young\u2019s presentence report was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b116-13\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) contains drastically different punishments for crack and powder cocaine, requiring one hundred times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger inclusion in a particular sentencing range. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Id. </em>The United States Sentencing Commission adopted this sentencing disparity in the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">.
