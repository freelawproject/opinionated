The district court sentenced McAllister to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 851 (West 2000 &amp; Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>2006), and ordered it to run consecutively to the sentence imposed upon the revocation of his supervised release for a prior offense. McAllister\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal but challenging the adequacy of the plea colloquy and the consecutive nature of the sentence. McAllister was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Counsel questions whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting McAllister\u2019s guilty plea. Because McAllister did not move to withdraw his guilty plea, we review his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find no error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of McAllister\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114,119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Counsel also raises as a potential issue the consecutive nature of the sentence imposed by the district court. Because counsel failed to object in the district court, we review the claim only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>460 F.3d 550, 557 (4th Cir.2006) (discussing standard of review). We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to run the 120-month sentence consecutively to the sentence imposed upon the revocation of McAllister\u2019s supervised release. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.3 (c) &amp; comment. n. 3(C) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm McAllister\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
