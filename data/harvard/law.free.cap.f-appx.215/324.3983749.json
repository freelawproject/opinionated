Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 563-64 (5th Cir.1995). In reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we grant it \u201cgreat deference\u201d and do not disturb it unless we \u201ccannot find substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision or [find] that the Commissioner made an error of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-23\">Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, the Administrative Law Judge here relied on more than \u201cimpugning of the claimant\u2019s testimony\u201d and \u201cthe claimant\u2019s activities of daily living.\u201d The opinion below was supported by the medical examination of the plaintiff by Drs. Plummer and Malay in 2001. Dr. Plummer\u2019s report supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that the plaintiff is not disabled, and Dr. Malay\u2019s notes do not conflict with it. We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s decision to credit these reports rather than the 1991 examination by Dr. Cole, relied upon by the plaintiff. We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
