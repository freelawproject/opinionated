Because the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the petition, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">While incarcerated at the Moshannon Valley Correctional Facility in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, Tsoukalas filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The District Court dismissed the petition without prejudice, holding that the proper means by which Tsoukalas could challenge his conviction was through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Tsoukalas appealed, arguing that he filed the instant petition when the \u00a7 2255 motion he had previously filed proved \u201cinadequate and ineffective\u201d in challenging the constitutionality of his conviction. On appeal, Appellee has filed a motion for summary action, arguing that the District Court\u2019s dismissal should be affirmed because the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the underlying petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In <em>Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004), the Supreme Court clearly held that a \u00a7 2241 petition must be filed in the district having jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s custodian. 542 U.S. at 442, 124 S.Ct. 2711. In the case at bar, that is the Western District of Pennsylvania. Because the District Court therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition, we conclude that this appeal presents no \u201csubstantial question.\u201d <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 &amp; I.O.P. 10.6. We therefore grant Appellee\u2019s motion for summary action and will affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice of Tsoukalas\u2019 petition. <em>See Rumsfeld, 542 </em>U.S. at 451, 124 S.Ct. 2711.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
