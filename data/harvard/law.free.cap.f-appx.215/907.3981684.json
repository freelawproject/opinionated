We hold that it did not. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">On April 25, 2005, following 63-month federal prison sentence and while serving a 36-month term of supervised release, Sherman Lavan Douglas was arrested by Miami, Florida, police officers on state-law charges of burglary and robbery. He allegedly committed those crimes on February 9, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-25\">Also on April 25, 2005, acting on the news of Douglas\u2019s arrest, the United States Probation Office filed in the district court a petition to revoke Douglas\u2019s supervised release. Douglas\u2019s probation officer alleged that Douglas\u2019s conduct on February 9th violated the condition of his supervised release forbidding him from committing a crime while under supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-26\">On May 9th, the district court granted the probation officer\u2019s petition for action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>and issued a warrant for Douglas\u2019s arrest. He was arrested on June 1st. Meanwhile, on June 17th, after the State of Florida had dismissed the burglary and robbery charges against him, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Douglas for alleged Hobbs Act violations arising out of his February 9th conduct. As a result of the federal indictment, Douglas\u2019s probation officer filed a superceding petition for revocation on June 30th, referencing the new indictment and again alleging that Douglas had violated a condition of his probation by \u201cfailing to refrain from violation of the law.\u201d The district court scheduled a revocation hearing, but the hearing was continued several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Before the revocation hearing could be held, Douglas was tried on the federal charges. On March 27, 2006, a jury acquitted Douglas of conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act, but convicted him of substantively violating it. Douglas was not immediately sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Several weeks after his conviction, on April 19, 2006, the district court held the scheduled revocation hearing to determine if Douglas had violated a condition of his supervised release and, if so, to determine whether and how long he should be incarcerated for the violation. At the revocation hearing, Douglas\u2019s counsel stated that Douglas denied having violated the Hobbs Act; nevertheless, Douglas\u2019s counsel conceded that the Hobbs Act charges had been the subject of a lengthy trial and that Douglas had been convicted by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Probation Officer Stanley Branch testified at the hearing that he had filed the superceding petition to revoke Douglas\u2019s supervised release on the basis of the two-count federal indictment, which was returned against Douglas on June 17, 2005, and which was based upon an incident that had occurred on February 9, 2005. Branch testified that, in preparing to file the petition, he had viewed the indictment and other documents related to the case on the district court\u2019s electronic filing system. According to Branch, the electronic docket sheet indicated that Douglas had been convicted of the substantive Hobbs Act violation on March 27, 2006. The Government did not produce at the hearing a certified paper copy of the judgment against Douglas.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">Douglas objected to Branch\u2019s testimony about the March 27th conviction on the ground that such testimony constituted \u201chearsay\u201d or \u201cdouble hearsay\u201d because the Government could not produce a certified copy of the judgment. The district court overruled Douglas\u2019s hearsay objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">The district judge then requested that her law clerk access the electronic docket sheet in the case involving the 2005 Hobbs Act indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge reviewed the indictment and the jury verdict, which reflected that Douglas had been convicted of violating the Hobbs Act. On the basis of that information, the district court determined that the preponderance of the evidence established that Douglas had violated a condition of his supervised release, as alleged in Branch\u2019s petition. The court sentenced Douglas to 24 months in prison, to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed on Douglas for violating the Hobbs Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant has violated a condition of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). We are bound by the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Relying solely on our decision in <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357 (11th Cir. 1996), Douglas argues that, in order to find by a preponderance of the evidence that a releasee has violated a condition of his supervised release, where the Government and the district court rely exclusively on a judgment of conviction, it is <em>mandatory </em>that the Government tender into evidence a certified copy of the conviction. In <em>Hofierka, </em>we upheld the revocation of the appellant\u2019s supervised release, concluding that a judgment of conviction against the appellant on state-law charges, stemming from conduct the appellant engaged in while on supervised release, was sufficient evidence from which the district court could find a violation of the supervised release condition forbidding the appellant from committing a federal, state, or local crime. In so concluding, we stated: \u201cA certified copy of a conviction is proper evidence that a defendant violated a state or federal law and, thereby, violated a condition of his or her supervised release.\u201d <em>Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d at 363. By not tendering into evidence in this case a \u201ccertified copy\u201d of his conviction, Douglas argues that \u201c[t]he government failed to substantiate its claim and meet its burden of proof that Appellant violated the terms and conditions of his supervised release.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Every term of supervised release ordered by a federal district court carries with it, as a mandatory condition, a requirement that the defendant \u201cnot commit another Federal, State, or local crime during the term of supervision.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). If the district court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has violated a condition of his supervised release, the court may revoke the defendant\u2019s release and sentence him to prison. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). \u201cEvidence of a probation violation presented by the government must \u2018reasonably satisfy the judge that the conduct of the probationer has not been as good as required by the conditions of probation; evidence that would establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Holland, </em>874 F.2d 1470, 1472-73 (11th Cir. 1989) (quoting <em>United States v. Rice, </em>671 F.2d 455, 458 (11th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">According to Douglas, Branch\u2019s testimony regarding Douglas\u2019s indictment and conviction was hearsay and thus inadmissible in the revocation hearing. We have held that \u201c[although the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in supervised release revocation hearings, the admissibility of hearsay is not automatic\u201d because \u201c[d]efendants involved in revocation proeeed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>ings are entitled to certain minimal due process requirements.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 114 (11th Cir.1994). After overruling Douglas\u2019s hearsay objection to Branch\u2019s testimony, and after the Government indicated that it did not have a certified copy of Douglas\u2019s judgment of conviction, the district judge asked to look at the electronic docket sheet in the case against Douglas involving the Hobbs Act conviction. It is not clear from the record whether Douglas objected on hearsay grounds to the court\u2019s reliance on the judgment of conviction displayed on the electronic docket sheet, but we need not determine whether an electronic judgment of conviction is hearsay or whether it falls within a hearsay exception under the Federal Rules of Evidence. That is because, even assuming that an electronic record of a judgment of conviction is hearsay, the admissibility of such evidence depends not on an application of the Federal Rules of Evidence (which are inapplicable to revocation hearings) but on the district court\u2019s consideration of two factors: (1) the balance between the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him and the Government\u2019s reasons for denying the defendant that right; and (2) the reliability of the hearsay statement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Douglas does not argue on appeal, and did not argue in the district court, that the electronic record of his judgment of conviction is in any way unreliable. He argues only that the judgment relied upon by the court was not a \u201ccertified copy\u201d and that in this Circuit, under <em>Hofierka, </em>the Government in a revocation hearing must introduce into evidence a certified copy of the judgment of conviction. We disagree with Douglas\u2019s reading of <em>Hofierka </em>and hold that a judgment of conviction recorded in a district court\u2019s electronic filing system is a presumptively reliable indication of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">Because Douglas has offered no evidence to the contrary, we have no trouble concluding the electronic judgment relied upon by the district court in this case was sufficiently reliable to demonstrate that Douglas violated a mandatory condition of his supervised release. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court revoking Douglas\u2019s supervised release is</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-7\">. Douglas had previously pleaded guilty to one substantive Hobbs Act violation in 1998 and was on supervised release for that crime when he was arrested in April 2005, thus giving rise to the revocation proceedings that are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-12\">. Four months after the revocation hearing, Douglas was sentenced to serve 124 months in prison for the Hobbs Act violation. At the conclusion of the revocation hearing, Douglas asked the district court to give him credit against his 24-month sentence to reflect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>time that he had spent incarcerated since his arrest in June 2005. The district court denied Douglas\u2019s request, and Douglas objected. To the extent that Douglas attempts to challenge the district court\u2019s ruling on that issue in this appeal, any such challenge has been waived by his failure to address the issue in his opening brief. <em>See Peebles v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., </em>431 F.3d 1320, 1326 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b936-6\">. Douglas does not argue that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
