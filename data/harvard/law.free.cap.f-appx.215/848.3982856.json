Smith, Jr. (\u201cMr. Smith\u201d), a Delta employee, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the early morning hours of July 9, 2002. The Plan denied the benefits, concluding that Ms. Smith was not an eligible beneficiary because on the day of Mr. Smith\u2019s death, she did not \u201c[ljive in the Employee\u2019s household or only temporarily reside outside the Employee\u2019s household,\u201d as required by the Survivorship Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Ms. Smith contends that the Survivorship Plan\u2019s administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously in reaching this conclusion. After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">That grant of summary judgment is subject to \u201cplenary review,\u201d and this court applies the \u201csame legal standards as those controlling the district court.\u201d <em>Paramore v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>129 F.3d 1446, 1449 (11th Cir.1997). The Supreme Court of the United States has established three standards for reviewing a denial of benefits by an ERISA plan administrator: (1) <em>de novo </em>review where the plan does not grant discretion to the administrator, (2) arbitrary and capricious review where the plan does grant discretion to the administrator, and (3) heightened arbitrary and capricious review where the plan grants discretion to the administrator, but the administrator operates under a conflict of interest. <em>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number><em>v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 956-57, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989); <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1134 (11th Cir.2004). Here, the appellant does not suggest there was a conflict of interest and agrees that the plan grants discretion to the administrator; thus, as conceded by the appellant, we review the decision to deny benefits only under the arbitrary and capricious standard. This standard of review applies to \u201cboth the administrator\u2019s construction of the plan and concomitant factual findings with respect to each case.\u201d <em>Paramore, </em>129 F.3d at 1451. An \u201cadministrator\u2019s fact-based determinations will not be disturbed if reasonable based on the information known to the administrator at the time the decision was rendered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Under the provisions of the plan at issue, Ms. Smith was entitled to receive survivorship benefits as an eligible spouse only if, at the time of her husband\u2019s death, she (1) \u201c[l]ive[d] in [her husband\u2019s] household\u201d or (2) \u201conly temporarily reside[d] outside [her husband\u2019s] household.\u201d The Plan determined that neither criterion applied to Ms. Smith on the event date. Evaluating the first criterion, the Plan concluded that she did not live in her husband\u2019s \u201chousehold,\u201d defining that term under its discretionary authority to mean \u201cthose who dwell under the same roof and compose a family.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of Mr. Smith\u2019s death on July 9, Ms. Smith resided at the family\u2019s residence in Henry County, Georgia. Mr. Smith had been arrested at his home on July 5 on charges of battery and child cruelty after an incident of domestic abuse. He was released on July 8. That day, Ms. Smith sought and received a protective order making it illegal for Mr. Smith to stay at the Henry County residence or enter it without police escort. It is uncertain whether Mr. Smith established another residence in the few hours before his suicide, although he did list his parents\u2019 address in Cobb County, Georgia on an application for a checking account at the Delta Credit Union on the day of his release. He also retrieved some of his belongings from the Henry County residence (under the required police escort) the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Ms. Smith contends that she \u201c[l]ive[d] in [her husband\u2019s] household\u201d because she continued to reside at the Henry County residence and that Mr. Smith did not establish another household. We need not decide whether Mr. Smith successfully established another household; as the district court observed, nothing in the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201chousehold\u201d requires that a person have one. However, the Plan\u2019s definition does require that the employee and his or her spouse \u201cdwell under the same roof.\u201d It is clear that the protective order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>prevented Mr. and Ms. Smith from satisfying this condition. Accordingly, Ms. Smith failed to qualify under the first eligibility criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The second criterion presents a closer question. In order for the Plan to determine whether Ms. Smith \u201conly temporarily reside[d] outside [her husband\u2019s] household,\u201d it was necessary to divine the future intentions of Mr. and Ms. Smith. The Plan based its conclusion that the separation was not temporary on the following facts: (1) the extraordinary relief granted Ms. Smith by the protective order, which awarded her sole and exclusive use of the residence; (2) information provided by Mr. Smith\u2019s parents stating that their son was planning to see an attorney on July 10 to begin divorce proceedings; (3) information provided by Ms. Terri Martinez (Mr. Smith\u2019s previous wife) that Ms. Smith stated she would not take Mr. Smith back for fear that the Georgia Department of Family and Children\u2019s Services (DFACS) would remove her son if she moved back in with Mr. Smith; (4) information from the Delta Employees Credit Union showing that Mr. Smith changed his account address from the Henry County address to his parents\u2019 address and listed his mother as his nearest living relative, not Ms. Smith. Based upon this information, the Plan concluded that Mr. and Ms. Smith had permanently separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">We find no grounds for invalidating the Plan\u2019s determination as arbitrary and capricious. To be sure, Ms. Smith cites several facts that would permit reasonable minds to reach a contrary conclusion. First, it is true that Mr. Smith failed to take many steps normally associated with a permanent separation from one\u2019s spouse. He did not change his address with Delta\u2019s human resource department, change his telephone number, change his driver\u2019s license, forward his mail, or hire movers. Ms. Smith maintains that this evidence (or rather absence of evidence), when combined with the couple\u2019s history of fighting and reconciling, supports her view that there was no permanent separation. Still, it is not surprising that Mr. Smith accomplished little in the way of rearranging his affairs given the few hours he had between his release from jail and his death. The Plan was justified in placing greater weight on the steps Mr. Smith did take\u2014 such as changing the address on his credit union account, which evinced a desire to separate financially from his wife \u2014 than on the steps he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Second, Ms. Smith points to several objective facts tending to link Mr. Smith to the Henry County residence that he and Ms. Smith shared. For instance, the plan hired an investigator to determine the residence of Mr. and Ms. Smith at the time of Mr. Smith\u2019s death. The investigator\u2019s report, while not drawing a conclusion from the facts uncovered, does show that searches based on social security numbers, interviews with acquaintances, and other various searches showed that records still reflected that Mr. and Ms. Smith shared the same address. Also, Mr. Smith\u2019s death certificate lists the Henry County residence as his last address. Again, however, it is not surprising that the Smiths\u2019 brief separation was not yet found in the records and memories of those they came into contact with. Even if the investigator\u2019s report and the death certificate have the advantage of objectivity, they say little about the future intentions of Mr. and Ms. Smith. The Plan chose to rely instead on evidence like Mr. Smith\u2019s plans to see a divorce attorney and the changing of his credit union account address, which more directly reflect his intent to separate permanently from his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Third, and most significantly, Ms. Smith argues that the Plan acted arbitrarily and capriciously in crediting the self-serving statements made by Mr. Smith\u2019s parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>and by Ms. Martinez (whose minor child, fathered by Mr. Smith, now receives the Plan benefits in place of Ms. Smith and her son) over the more objective evidence recounted above.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Plan did not ignore the self-serving nature of these statements; rather, it expressly acknowledged the potential for bias and gave reasons for accepting their veracity nonetheless. In evaluating Ms. Martinez\u2019s statement that Ms. Smith said she would not take Mr. Smith back, the Plan specifically found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\">this statement indicative of Ms. Smith\u2019s intentions that she would no longer reside in the same household as Mr. Smith, and despite any potential bias that might exist on the part of Ms. Martinez, was credible information. The [Plan] noted that Ms. Martinez, a resident of Oklahoma, might not have otherwise been familiar with the term DFACS in the absence of Ms. Smith making such a statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">One could quibble with this reasoning. Ms. Martinez, who had ties to the state of Georgia through her former husband and father of her child, could have heard about DFACS through a source independent of Ms. Smith. And Ms. Martinez could certainly be viewed as having a substantial potential for bias. Yet this type of judicial second-guessing is exactly what the arbitrary and capricious standard is meant to curb. <em>See Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1137. As for the statement by Mr. Smith\u2019s parents that Mr. Smith planned to institute divorce proceedings, the Plan \u201cconsidered th[e] potential [for bias] in weighing the significance that should be placed on this assertion.\u201d The Plan has the discretion to make credibility determinations and to weigh conflicting evidence. <em>See Paramore, </em>129 F.3d at 1452 (upholding plan administrator\u2019s authority to evaluate conflicting medical evaluations). The Plan has given adequate and rational reasons for its decision to accept the truth of these statements. Furthermore, these statements do not operate in isolation. The protective order and Mr. Smith\u2019s changing of his credit union account address unquestionably buttress the conclusion that the separation was permanent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">Although Ms. Smith has presented many reasons for reaching a different conclusion from the one reached by the Plan, we cannot say that the Plan\u2019s decision was an unreasonable reading of \u201cthe information known to the administrator at the time the decision was rendered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1451. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-13\">. Mr. Lolley, Ms. Smith's natural-born son and Mr. Smith\u2019s stepson, is not independently eligible for benefits. He is eligible for benefits under the Delta Family Care Medical Plan if Ms. Smith is found to be eligible under the Survivorship Plan. Our discussion will therefore focus on her eligibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\">. We agree with the district court that this definition is a reasonable construction of the term and thus within the Plan's grant of discretionary authority. <em>See Hunt </em>v. <em>Hawthorne Assoc., Inc., </em>119 F.3d 888, 912 (11th Cir. 1997) (applying arbitrary and capricious standard of review where ERISA plan \u201ccontains express language conferring discretionary authority upon the administrator to construe its terms\u201d). In fact, the Plan\u2019s definition adopts verbatim the dictionary definition of the word \"household.\u201d <em>See </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 562 (10th ed. 1999) (\"those who dwell under the same roof and compose a family\u201d). Ms. Smith argues that the Plan's determination that the Smiths no longer constituted a household conflicts with state law on the definition of a marital household. <em>See Varnadoe v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>112 Ga.App. 366, 369, 145 S.E.2d 104 (1965) (noting that while husband and wife \"may temporarily sojourn to another place or abode, ... they are still a part of the same household so long as no action is taken to end the marital relationship\"). However, the Plan was not bound to follow state law when it defined the term \"household\u201d as used in the Plan provisions so long as its definition was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">. Neither Ms. Smith nor the Plan has cited any decision treating a plan administrator\u2019s discretion to consider statements made by potentially biased parties, nor have we uncovered one. We think a blanket prohibition on considering such statements would conflict with the deference owed to the plan administrator\u2019s conclusions under the arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>See Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1137.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-7\">. Ms. Smith contends that the Plan\u2019s determination was \"contrary to law\u201d because the ex parte protective order would automatically expire by operation of law unless it were made permanent after a hearing and order. See O.C.G.A. \u00a7 19-13-4(c). Thus, in her view, the Plan erred in considering the protective order \u2014 and the Smiths\u2019 separation \u2014 to be permanent. It is clear, however, that the Plan understood that the order was not permanent; it acknowledged that the order was scheduled to be reviewed on July 29, 2002. Moreover, the Plan did not base its decision on the understanding that the protective order was itself permanent, but merely on the finding that the order evinced the Smiths\u2019 intention to separate permanently. The order clearly supports such a finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
