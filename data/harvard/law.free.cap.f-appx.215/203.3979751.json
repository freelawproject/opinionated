We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Bokman\u2019s first contention is that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to Counts 3, 8, and 11. He asserts the government failed to prove he had actual knowledge that the purchaser had been convicted of a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d as required under \u00a7 922(d)(1). Rather, the informant who purchased the guns stated only that he was a \u201cfelon.\u201d Bokman notes that pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000), certain crimes that may otherwise qualify as felonies do not fall under the realm of \u201ccrimes[s] punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d such as unfair trade practices or antitrust violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. United Med. and Surgical Supply Corp., </em>989 F.2d 1390, 1401 (4th Cir.1993). The standard of review for a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal is \u201cwhether there is substantial evidence (direct or circumstantial) which, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would warrant a jury finding that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. MacCloskey, </em>682 F.2d 468, 473 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Even if Bokman did not \u201cknow\u201d that the informant had been convicted of a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d based on the informant\u2019s statement that he was a felon, \u00a7 922(d)(1) requires only that a defendant know or \u201chav[e] reasonable cause to believe\u201d that the buyer has been convicted of such a crime. The statements made by the informant during the firearm transactions fully support the jury\u2019s finding that Bokman had at least reasonable cause to believe that the informant had been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Bokman next argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(1) (2005). Bokman claims that he did not \u201cpossess\u201d a firearm in connection with the drug deals because the guns did not facilitate the narcotics transactions. Bokman contends that the mere fact that the transactions were simultaneous does not mean that the weapons were possessed in connection with the distribution of the drugs, and that the jury\u2019s acquittal on all 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000) charges supports his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">On appeal of the sentencing judge\u2019s application of the guidelines, we review factual determinations under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir. 1989). However, if the issue turns primarily on the legal interpretation of a guideline term, the standard \u201cmoves closer\u201d to de novo review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, for an offense involving drugs, a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by two levels if a dangerous weapon was possessed. This adjustment \u201cshould be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 comment. (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">The term \u201cin connection with\u201d is synonymous with \u201cin relation to\u201d, as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). <em>United States v. Blount, </em>337 F.3d 404, 411 (4th Cir.2003), <em>citing United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 (4th Cir.2001). To meet the \u201cin relation to\u201d requirement, the Government must prove that the firearm has \u201csome purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime ... the gun at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>must facilitate or have the potential of facilitating the drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266-67 (4th Cir.2000) (internal citations and quotations omitted). We have recognized that in narcotics .transactions, a drug purchaser often must persuade a dealer to sell him drugs through an offer to buy-other illegal goods, such as firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 267. When guns and drugs are sold together as part of a singular transaction, the firearms facilitate the drug transaction by making it possible for the buyer to convince the seller to take the risks inherent in selling contraband. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We also find unavailing Bokman\u2019s argument that his acquittal on the firearms charges precluded the court from considering his sales of firearms for sentencing purposes. Even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts may continue to consider acquitted conduct in determining the appropriate guideline range. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>399 F.3d 450, 454 (2d Cir.2005). In this case, there was sufficient evidence of three distinct transactions involving both firearms and illegal narcotics. Therefore, the district court properly enhanced Bokman\u2019s sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), for possession of a dangerous weapon during an illegal narcotics transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Bokman\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
