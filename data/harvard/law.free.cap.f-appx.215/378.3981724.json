Spells appeals the denial of a motion to suppress evidence discovered by federal agents during a search of his residence and subsequently used to support his convictions for possession of cocaine and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. Because the executing agents\u2019 reliance on the warrant was objectively reasonable, we apply the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule announced in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">In July 2003, DEA Task Force Agent Paul Toye was contacted by a confidential informant who reported that an individual from St. Bernard Parish made weekly deliveries of crack cocaine to Spells\u2019s residence located at <em>1524% </em>Barrone Street in New Orleans. The informant stated that Spells maintained a constant stockpile of crack cocaine and protected it with firearms that had been used to commit several New Orleans-area homicides by Spells\u2019s friend, Kevin \u201cDeuce\u201d Ellis.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">During Toye\u2019s investigation of the tip, another DEA agent, Paul Girior, independently corroborated that the multi-unit address was a well-known distribution point for crack cocaine. Toye then conducted a criminal history investigation and determined that Spells had two prior felony arrests for possession of crack cocaine and that a New Orleans resident named Kevin Ellis had felony arrests for distribution of crack cocaine and for carrying an illegal firearm during the commission of a crime. Finally, Toye was notified by a separate confidential informant, whose past information regarding narcotics investigations had proven reliable, that the first confidential informant was trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">The informant again contacted Toye on August 6, 2003, stating that Spells had received a fresh delivery of between fifteen and twenty pre-packaged plastic baggies containing crack cocaine earlier that morning. In response to this second tip, surveillance of the residence was established, and Toye obtained a search warrant. When agents confronted Spells outside of the residence, he admitted that his apartment contained contraband. A search subsequently revealed 130 grams of crack cocaine in several plastic baggies, a 9mm semi-automatic pistol with laser sight, two .40 caliber semi-automatic pistols, and a scoped, lever-action rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">Based on the fruits of the search, Spells was charged with possession with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Spells moved to suppress the narcotics and firearm evidence, arguing that the warrant affidavit was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ficient because it lacked any \u201cindicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. at 3421. After a suppression hearing, the district court denied Spells\u2019s motion. Spells entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion by first determining whether <em>Leon\u2019s </em>good-faith exception applies. <em>United States v. Sibley, </em>448 F.3d 754, 757 (5th Cir.2006). If so, we typically do not consider whether the warrant was adequately supported by probable cause and will affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>United States v. Flanders, </em>468 F.3d 269, 270 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the good-faith exception, \u201cevidence will be admitted if it is obtained by officers acting in objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a magistrate judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Pigrum, </em>922 F.2d 249, 252 (5th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s determination of the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s good-faith reliance on a warrant is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Cherna, </em>184 F.3d 403, 406-07 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Reliance on a warrant affidavit is reasonable if the affidavit is not \u201cbare bones.\u201d <em>See United States v. Restrepo, </em>994 F.2d 173, 188-89 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cBare bones\u201d affidavits are those containing \u201cwholly conelusory statements, which lack the facts and circumstances from which a magistrate can independently determine probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 321 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Here, the degree of detail provided by the informant\u2019s tip, when considered in conjunction with the corroborating information obtained by Agent Toye, demonstrates that the instant warrant affidavit is not \u201cbare bones.\u201d The informant provided detailed information on two separate occasions that included: the location of Spells\u2019s supplier; the frequency of the deliveries; the address of the residence at which Spells allegedly bagged and sold crack cocaine; a description of the contraband weapons possessed by Spells; and a specific description of the amount of crack cocaine delivered to Spells on the morning of August 6. Toye\u2019s independent investigation uncovered facts consistent with the informant\u2019s tip. More than conclusory statements bolstered the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The magistrate judge determined that the nature and quality of the information contained in Toye\u2019s warrant affidavit bore sufficient indicia of reliability to support a finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without evaluating the accuracy of that determination, we agree that Toye\u2019s affidavit was not \u201cbare bones\u201d and that his reliance on the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling was objectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>reasonable, and thus in good faith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When, as here, a warrant affidavit is not facially invalid, \u201cit is impossible to argue ... that an officer\u2019s reliance on it could be unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>958 F.2d 898, 905 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">For these reasons, the good faith exception applies, the district court correctly denied the motion to suppress, and the conviction is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">. In the presence of an officer\u2019s good-faith reliance on a warrant, we reach the probable cause issue only if the case involves \"a novel question\u201d of Fourth Amendment law. <em>United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 264, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2346, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (White, J., concurring)). This case presents no such question. <em>See id. </em>(whether facts alleged by an affidavit support a finding of probable cause does not raise a novel question of law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\">. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Privette, </em>947 F.2d 1259, 1262 (5th Cir.1991) (detail of an informant\u2019s statement or internal consistency of the statement with surrounding facts compensate for deficiencies in an informant\u2019s veracity); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>818 F.2d 345, 349 (5th Cir.1987) (particularly detailed information can serve as the basis for an informant\u2019s knowledge); <em>United States v. Farese, </em>612 F.2d 1376, 1379 n. 5 (5th Cir.1980) (suspect\u2019s criminal record is a valid consideration in the probable cause assessment) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-18\">. Because of our determination that <em>Leon\u2019s </em>good-faith exception applies, we do not reach the question whether the magistrate judge's probable cause assessment was accurate. <em>Restrepo, </em>994 F.2d at 187.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
