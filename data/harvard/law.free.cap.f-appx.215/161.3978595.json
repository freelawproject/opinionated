We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-30\">On June 23, 2005, Dutton filed his complaint against the defendant, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia Domestic Relations Division (\u201cCourt of Common Pleas\u201d or \u201cFamily Court\u201d), alleging that he disputes the amount of his child support obligation in arrears. Specifically, he asserted that his child support obligation was terminated in 1996, at which time he owed slightly more than $10,000.00, but according to the Court of Common Pleas, he owes more than $20,000.00; a bench warrant for him was issued on June 9, 2005. Dutton further contended that he had filed for bankruptcy protection on May 19, 2005, but he was told that bankruptcy law does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>not apply to Family Court. He sought the District Court\u2019s clarification on this issue of bankruptcy law. Dutton also filed a motion to enjoin the defendant from acting on the bench warrant pending the resolution of the matter. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Dutton then filed a motion to terminate the bench warrant, attaching a copy of an updated notice issued by the Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">By order entered November 17, 2005, the District Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. First, to the extent that Dutton brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the District Court held that the Court of Common Pleas is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to section 1983 liability. Second, the District Court held that the Court of Common Pleas is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. Finally, the District Court denied the motions to enjoin and terminate the bench warrant, declining to exercise jurisdiction under the <em>Younger </em>abstention doctrine. <em>See Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Dutton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) are subject to plenary review. <em>Moore v. Tartler, </em>986 F.2d 682, 685 (3d Cir.1993). We also exercise plenary review over the legal determination of whether the requirements for <em>Younger </em>abstention have been met, and, if so, we review for abuse of discretion the District Court\u2019s decision to abstain. <em>Yang v. Tsui </em>416 F.3d 199, 201 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Dutton does not contest the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Family Court is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We note our agreement with the District Court on this issue. <em>See Callahan v. City of Philadelphia, </em>207 F.3d 668, 673 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Regarding the District Court\u2019s Eleventh Amendment analysis, we agree that suits against a state are barred by the Eleventh Amendment\u2019s grant of sovereign immunity. Dutton argues that the Eleventh Amendment only protects the state from suits involving state matters and does not apply to the alleged bankruptcy law violations by the Family Court. Dutton provides no authority for his position, and indeed, he is mistaken. Notably, we have held that the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, which includes the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity as a state entity with respect to a federal claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act. <em>Benn v. First Judicial Dist. of Pa., </em>426 F.3d 233, 235 n. 1, 240-41 (3d Cir.2005). Such immunity functions as an absolute bar to suit. <em>See id. </em>at 241. We agree that the Family Court is immune from suit in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Lastly, Dutton disagrees with the District Court\u2019s application of the abstention doctrine of <em>Younger </em>in denying his motions to enjoin and terminate the enforcement of the Family Court bench warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Upon consideration of the arguments in Dutton\u2019s brief, and upon review of the District Court record, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">. In view of our disposition of this matter on the basis of immunity, we need not discuss the applicability of the abstention doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
