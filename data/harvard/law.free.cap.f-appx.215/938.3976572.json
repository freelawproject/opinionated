The victim managed to free one of her hands and begin striking the wall, which, together with her yelling at Maldonado to \u201cget off of\u2019 her, drew the attention of the sergeants who resided in the adjacent residence. Maldonado fled the scene, but was later identified by the sergeants.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">At sentencing, the district court applied a base offense level of 20, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4, with a two-level enhancement because the victim was physically restrained, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.3, for a total offense level of 22. With a criminal history category of I, Maldonado\u2019s guideline range would have been 41-51 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because the statutory maximum for the offense was 36 months\u2019s imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(2), the district court sentenced him to this term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">Maldonado first argues that, in order to have violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(2), a person must have violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242, which requires a \u201csexual act.\u201d Maldonado contends that the district court erred when it instructed the jury that only sexual contact was required. Maldonado further argues that, even if it was appropriate to convict him, the district court erred in sentencing him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(1) (which references 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241) rather than \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(2) (which references 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242), or \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(3) (which applies otherwise). Maldonado does not dispute that his conduct satisfied the statutory definition of \u201csexual contact.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Where a defendant fails to object to a jury instruction below, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1277 (11th Cir.2003). Maldonado did not object to the instruction below. To prevail, then, Maldonado must show \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three of those conditions are met, the court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. LeCroy, </em>441 F.3d 914, 930 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">A person commits the offense of abusive sexual contact, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(2), where he \u201cknowingly engages in or causes sexual contact with or by another person, if to do so would violate ... section 2242 of [Title 18] had the sexual contact been a sexual act.\u201d A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 occurs where a person \u201cknowingly (1) causes another person to engage in a sexual act by threatening or placing that other person in fear (other than by threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">The terms \u201csexual act\u201d and \u201csexual contact\u201d referred to in sections 2242 and 2244 are defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246. A \u201csexual act\u201d involves penile-genital contact, oral-genital contact, or genital penetration. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(2). \u201cSexual contact\u201d means \u201cthe intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">On appeal, Maldonado primarily argues that the government had to prove that a sexual act took place in order to convict him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(2), meaning that the district court erred when it instructed the jury that sexual contact alone could support a conviction. This argument is without merit. Section 2244 explicitly penalizes \u201csexual contact,\u201d not sexual acts. Section 2244(a)(2) then penalizes a particular kind of sexual contact: that where \u201chad the sexual contact been a sexual act,\u201d \u00a7 2242 would have penalized the sexual act. Section 2242 penalizes a sexual act obtained by means of fear or certain threats. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2242, 2244(a)(2). In sum, then, section 2244(a)(2) penalizes sexual contact obtained by means of fear or certain threats. Requiring the government to show a sexual act in addition to sexual contact would contradict the plain meaning of the statute, which penalizes sexual contact under the same circumstances described in \u00a7 2242 in the context of sexual acts. Maldonado\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions therefore fails, and his conviction under \u00a7 2244(a)(2) was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">Maldonado next argues that the base offense level of 16 in \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(2) should have been used to calculate Maldonado\u2019s guideline range, rather than the base offense level of 20 in \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(1). We review a sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number><em>novo. United States v. Anderson, </em>326 F.3d 1319, 1326 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The guideline provision for Maldonado\u2019s crime, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4, prescribes a base offense level of \u201c(1) 20, if the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a) or (b); (2) 16, if the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242; or (3) 12, otherwise.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4(a). The first base offense level refers to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, the aggravated sexual abuse statute. Aggravated sexual abuse occurs when the defendant \u201cknowingly causes another person to engage in a sexual act (1) by using force against that other person; or (2) by threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a). The second base offense level refers to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242, the sexual abuse statute, which is violated when, inter aha, the defendant \u201cknowingly ... causes another person to engage in a sexual act by threatening or placing that other person in fear (other than by threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The references to the sexual act statutes in the sexual contact sentencing guideline are used to specify the base offense levels for the various kinds of sexual contact. The application notes for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4 lay this out explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-7\">For purposes of subsection (a)(1), \u201cconduct described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a) or (b)\u201d is engaging in, or causing sexual contact with, or by another person by: (A) using force against the victim; (B) threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping ... For purposes of subsection (a)(2), \u201cconduct described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242\u201d is: (A) engaging in, or causing sexual contact with, or by another person by threatening or placing the victim in fear (other than by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping) ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4, comment., (n.2-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Maldonado was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(2), which makes reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242. This did not, however, preclude the district court from finding that he engaged in sexual contact under the circumstances specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court was entitled to find that, in addition to threatening or placing the victim in fear, as the jury found, Maldonado used force in order to engage in the abusive sexual contact, justifying the imposition of the higher base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment., (n.6) (stating that unless a guideline provision expressly requires that the defendant has been convicted under a particular statute, \u201cthe use of a statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require a conviction under the referenced statute,\u201d and using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4 as an illustration).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">The effect of Maldonado\u2019s conviction under section 2244(a)(2) was to constrain the district court to applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2(a) (instructing district court to \u201c[djetermine the offense guideline section ... applicable to the offense of conviction\u201d). But then, within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4, if the district court found that Maldonado has used force against the victim, it was required to apply the higher base offense level contained in \u00a7 2A3.4(a)(1), defined by reference to section 2241. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1(b) (instructing district court to determine base offense level \u201ccontained in the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>guideline ... in the order listed\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4 (listing base offense level 20 first). The district court therefore had to impose the higher base offense level if it found that Maldonado used force.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">We find that the district court did not clearly err in determining that Maldonado used force against the victim. Here, the evidence showed that, in the course of the abusive sexual contact, Maldonado threw himself on top of the prone victim, straddled her legs, and attempted to pin her arms. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Maldonado used force in order to engage in the sexual contact. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4, comment, (n.2-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Finally, Maldonado argues that the district court erred in applying a physical restraint adjustment. He argues that he did not physically restrain the victim because he only \u201claid over her.\u201d Maldonado notes that he did not grasp and hold down the victim\u2019s hands, and asserts that she did not attempt to forcibly remove him from her bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">If a victim was physically restrained in the course of an offense, then a two-level enhancement is to be applied to the offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.3. \u201c \u2018Physically restrained\u2019 means the forcible restraint of the victim such as being tied, bound, or locked up.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.1(K)). The use of the modifier \u2018such as\u2019 indicates that the illustrations of physical restraint are listed by way of example rather than limitation. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>32 F.3d 1512, 1518 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Maldonado pinned the victim to her bed while engaging in the abusive sexual contact. The district court therefore did not clearly err in finding that this constituted restraint. <em>See United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1166-67 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that there was physical restraint where \u201ctwo large men grabbed [the victims] and held them against their will\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Upon careful consideration of the briefs of the parties, and thorough review of the record, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, Maldonado\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-13\">. Maldonado argues in passing that the evidence was insufficient to show that he had the intent necessary for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(2). We have held that the failure to elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support of an argument on appeal acts as a waiver of the argument for appellate purposes. <em>See Flanigan\u2019s Enters., Inc. of Ga. v. Fulton County, </em>242 F.3d 976, 987 n. 16 (11th Cir.2001). Maldonado\u2019s cursory reference <em>to </em>a lack of intent failed to preserve the argument on appeal. Moreover, Maldonado\u2019s ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>gument is without merit. The statute is violated if the defendant \u201cknowingly engages in or causes sexual contact,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244, with sexual contact further defined as \u201cintentional touching\u201d of specified body parts \u201cwith an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3). There was ample evidence from which a jury could conclude that Maldonado satisfied all of these intent elements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
