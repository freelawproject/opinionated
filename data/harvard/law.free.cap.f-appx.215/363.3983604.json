As an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), Leal was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months of imprisonment; the district court sentenced him to 192 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-27\">Leal argues that the court erred in determining that his Texas convictions for burglary of a habitation were qualifying violent felony convictions for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). Leal acknowledges that this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992), but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-28\">Leal also contends that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional because it does not require a substantial effect on interstate commerce. This court has repeatedly held that the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not open to question. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir. 2001). In the alternative, Leal avers that the evidence was insufficient to establish an effect on interstate commerce. \u201c[E]vi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>dence that a gun was manufactured in one state and possessed in another state is sufficient to establish a past connection between the firearm and interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierson, </em>139 F.3d 501, 504 (5th Cir.1998). Leal concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he raises them here to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
