First, Whitaker argues that his sentence should not be increased based on a prior unrepresented misdemeanor conviction. Second, Whitaker argues that he was indicted for selling cocaine \u201cfrom his home and car in March of 2005,\u201d and that therefore other cocaine seized by police in 2004 was not part of the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d under the guidelines and should not have been considered at sentencing. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record as a whole, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">\u201cA district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines is subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>116 F.3d 870, 872 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">\u201c[W]here no sentence of imprisonment was imposed, a defendant charged with a misdemeanor ha[s] no constitutional right to counsel.\u201d <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 743, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 1925, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994) (citing <em>Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979)). In line with that rule, the Supreme Court has held that an \u201cuncounseled misdemeanor conviction, valid under <em>Scott </em>because no prison term was imposed, is also valid when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Nichols, </em>511 U.S. at 749, 114 S.Ct. at 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">According to the 2005 version of the sentencing guidelines, prior sentences of imprisonment of at least 60 days are assigned between two and three criminal history points, depending on length, and any other prior sentences <em>not </em>resulting in such imprisonment is assigned one criminal history point. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(a)-(c). The guidelines restrict the meaning of a \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d to cases where the defendant \u201cactually served a period of imprisonment\u201d or would have had the defendant not escaped, and expressly provide that \u201c[a] sentence of probation is to be treated as a sentence under \u00a7 4A1.1(c) unless a condition of probation requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>imprisonment of at least sixty days was imposed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 2). The guidelines also note that \u201c[p]rior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, background comment. Finally, the guidelines expressly include convictions for DUI in a defendant\u2019s criminal history. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In this case, as the court of conviction of the 2002 DUI did not impose a sentence of imprisonment on Whitaker, the district court did not err by giving Whitaker one criminal history point for that conviction. <em>Baker, </em>116 F.3d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">We review a district court\u2019s finding as to relevant conduct only for clear error. <em>United States v. Blanc, </em>146 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir.1998). If we \u201cdecide that the district court misapplied the [guidelines, a remand is appropriate unless we conclude[ ], on the record as a whole, that the error was harmless, <em>i.e., </em>that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-21, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Under the sentencing guidelines, two criminal history points are added to a defendant\u2019s criminal history if he \u201ccommitted the instant offense while [on] parole\u201d (among other things). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d). As used in sentencing, \u201cthe instant offense\u201d means \u201cany relevant conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, comment, (n. 4). \u201cActivity that meets the definition of relevant conduct ... must be fully taken into account.\u201d <em>See Blanc, </em>146 F.3d at 851 (discussing \u201crelevant conduct\u201d in the context of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">\u201cU.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 instructs district courts to consider not merely the charged conduct, but rather all \u2018relevant conduct\u2019 ____\u201d <em>United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). The guidelines define relevant conduct, in pertinent part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-13\">all acts and omissions committed ... or wilfully caused by the defendant^ as well as] all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of [a] jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense[J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1R\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1). Relevant conduct also includes \u201call acts and omissions described ... above that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2). Notably, the commentary to this guideline states that \u201cthe defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n. 2). We interpret the provisions of the relevant conduct guideline broadly. <em>United States v. Behr, </em>93 F.3d 764, 765 (11th Cir.1996). \u201c[Sentencing courts may consider both uncharged and acquitted conduct in determining the appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">At sentencing, Whitaker did not object to the PSI\u2019s finding that the drugs seized in 2004 were found in his former bedroom. Whitaker did assert that the confidential informant\u2019s information was unreliable, but he did not present any evidence on this point or offer any argument explaining his assertion. Finally, he challenged the reliability of his step-father\u2019s statement that the drugs were his (ie. Whitaker\u2019s), but only by noting that his parents had since been convicted on state charges related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the 2004 seizure. However, without knowing what those charges were, it is difficult to determine whether establishing his parents\u2019 guilt would exonerate Whitaker. Further, as the district court noted, the fact that the state refrained from charging Whitaker in that offense does not necessarily indicate that it had no evidence to support such charges, but could simply reflect the state\u2019s recognition that Wfliitaker had been charged in federal court. Finally, Whitaker did not challenge the fact that when he was ultimately arrested \u2014 roughly three months after the 2004 seizure \u2014 and more drugs were found in his parents\u2019 house, he admitted that those drugs were his.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">As it is well-settled that a sentencing court can use \u201cuncharged or acquitted conduct\u201d in sentencing a defendant, <em>Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d at 1336, and as Whitaker has failed to present any evidence to rebut the facts alleged in the PSI, the district court did not clearly err by concluding that the instant offense began as early as December 2004. The information suggesting that Whitaker was connected to the drugs seized in 2004 justified the conclusion that he had committed acts at that time either in preparation for the offenses committed three months later, or as part of the \u201cconduct or common scheme or plan\u201d of those later offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)-(2). Considered even more broadly, the information in the PSI, along with the findings not disputed by Whitaker, supported a conclusion that Whitaker was \u201cdirectly involved\u201d with the 2004 drugs. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n. 2). Accordingly, the court correctly assigned Whitaker two additional criminal history points because he was on parole in December 2004 at the time he engaged in conduct relevant to the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Further, even if the district court did err in this regard, the error was harmless, as reducing Whitaker\u2019s criminal history from 12 points to 10 points would not, by itself, have reduced his criminal history category, and therefore would not have reduced his guideline sentencing range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Chapter 5, Part A, Sentencing Table; <em>Williams, </em>503 U.S. at 203, 112 S.Ct. at 1120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-10\">. We note that the Supreme Court has more recently held that a suspended or probated sentence of imprisonment entitles the defendant to the benefit of counsel. <em>Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 674, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 1776, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002). We decline to address whether <em>Shelton </em>applies in this case because Whitaker did not bring it to the district court\u2019s attention and has not raised the case on appeal; thus, the issue is deemed waived. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1989) (holding that issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
