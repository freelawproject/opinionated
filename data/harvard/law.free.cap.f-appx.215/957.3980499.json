(\u201cDownrite\u201d) appeals the Order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), whose Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) affirmed citations issued to Downrite for violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">The ALJ determined Downrite to be in violation of the following: (1) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.20(b)(2) for failing to have a designated competent person make frequent and regular inspections of the worksite; (2) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.100(a) for failing to ensure employees were protected from falling objects with protective helmets; (3) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.501(b)(4)(i) for failing to provide fall protection to employees exposed to falls greater than six feet; and (4) an \u201cother\u201d violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.21(b)(6)(i) for failing to instruct employees in confined space safety. (R.3-24 at 12.) The ALJ found the first three violations to be serious, and assessed penalties totaling $3600 for these three violations. (R.3-24 at 12.) Downrite petitioned the Commission for discretionary review, which the Commission declined. The ALJ\u2019s decision then became the final order of the Commission. (R.3-28 at 1.) Downrite filed a timely petition for review by the court. Downrite contends the Order of the ALJ should be reversed for three reasons: (1) Downrite did not consent to the warrantless inspection by OSHA Compliance Safety and Health Officers, and such an inspection was a violation of its Fourth Amendment rights; (2) Downrite had no actual or constructive knowledge of the violations; and (3) none of the citations constituted a \u201cserious violation\u201d of an OSHA safety standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">This court\u2019s review of Commission decisions is limited and highly deferential. <em>See Fluor Daniel v. OSHRC, </em>295 F.3d 1232, 1236 (11th Cir.2002). The court must sustain the Commission\u2019s fact-finding as long as it is \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a), and the Commission\u2019s determinations will be upheld unless \u201cthey are \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with [the] law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fluor Daniel, </em>295 F.3d at 1236 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">We find no error in the ALJ\u2019s determination that the search was consensual, and therefore not in violation of the Fourth Amendment. And, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s fact-finding, and that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions are not shown to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
