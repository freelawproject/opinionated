On appeal, Marin-Colon contends that the district court erred in determining that his inconsistent statements to the probation officer constituted obstruction of justice under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 3C1.1 (2005). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-24\">Marin-Colon asserts that the inconsistent information he provided to the probation officer during the presentence interview was not \u201cwillful\u201d or \u201cmaterial\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, and that the district court failed to differentiate between the falsity of the statements and their materiality. Marin-Colon contends that at all times during this case, he has identified himself by his true name, and that he never denied the use of the numerous aliases listed in the presentence report, thereby allowing for a \u201cfull account\u201d of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice will be imposed if the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad0\">willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and the obstructive conduct related to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or a closely related offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Conduct to which this adjustment applies includes \u201cproviding materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(h)). \u201cMaterial\u201d information is further defined as \u201cinformation that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6). Whether information is material is a factual matter determined by the district court, and is subject to review by this court under the clearly erroneous standard of review. <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 886 (4th Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Gormley, </em>201 F.3d 290, 294 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe threshold for materiality ... is conspicuously low.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">While Marin-Colon contends that he has identified himself by his true name at all times during this case, the district court noted that his date of birth could not be established, and in light of the dozen different aliases previously used by Marin-Colon, there was still a question as to his actual identity. Additionally, when the information provided by Marin-Colon to the probation officer was compared with a presentence report from an earlier criminal trial, as well as with the pretrial report that was prepared after his arrest, there were conflicting statements regarding his date of birth, place of birth, the names and ages of his parents and siblings, and whether he was married or had children. As a result, the probation officer concluded that the defendant\u2019s true identity, date of birth, family history, and marital status could not be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">A defendant\u2019s true identity is material to a presentence investigation, even if the false information provided does not affect the probation officer\u2019s recommendation. <em>See United States v. Restrepo, 53 </em>F.3d 396, 397 (1st Cir.1995) (sufficient that misrepresentations had the potential to affect the investigation); <em>see also United States v. Pereira-Munoz, 59 </em>F.3d 788, 792 (8th Cir. 1995) (failure to provide truthful identity hampered preparation of the presentence report and precluded determination as to criminal history). Marin-Colon asserts that he has given his \u201ctrue name\u201d throughout the proceedings, but the probation officer could not verify this fact due to the numerous aliases and the inconsistent personal information provided by Marin-Colon. While it is possible that Marin-Colon did give his actual name, the false information provided to the probation officer hampered her investigation and her attempts to ensure that a complete and accurate presentence report was provided to the district court for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Because Marin-Colon\u2019s true identity was a material fact in the probation officer\u2019s investigation, the false information that he provided had the potential to obstruct her efforts and therefore qualifies as materially false information under USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\u00a7 3C1.1. Additionally, we find that in light of the \u201cextremely evasive\u201d answers provided to the probation officer and Marin-Colon\u2019s concession at sentencing that the information provided was not accurate, these actions were also willful. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly enhanced Marin-Colon\u2019s sentence for obstructing justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Marin-Colon\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
