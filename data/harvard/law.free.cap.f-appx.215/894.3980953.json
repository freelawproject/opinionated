Herrera-Guillen argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>because the court never considered a sentence outside the 41 to 51 months\u2019 guidelines range and, therefore, effectively transformed the guidelines from advisory into mandatory. Herrera-Guillen also argues that the district court did not genuinely consider the case\u2019s mitigating factors. As a result, Herrera-Guillen claims his sentence is unreasonable and seeks to have his sentence vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Where a defendant challenges his overall sentence, we review for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>a sentence may be reviewed for procedural or substantive unreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if \u201cit is the product of a procedure that does not follow <em>Booker\u2019s </em>requirements, regardless of the actual sentence,\u201d as when the district judge fails to consider the relevant factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or when the district judge considers impermissible factors. <em>Id.; United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert, filed, </em>(Oct. 19, 2006) (No. 06-7352) (disagreement with Congress\u2019s policy judgments are invalid grounds for a lower sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">A sentence also \u201cmay be substantively unreasonable, regardless of the procedure used.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3. In assessing reasonableness, we consider \u201cthe final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir. 2006). Reasonableness review <em>of </em>the length of a sentence is \u201cdeferential\u201d and \u201c[t]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Although a sentence within the guidelines is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Upon review of the record and sentencing transcripts, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error. The sentence was procedurally reasonable because the district court considered both the guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, noting that the guidelines range is just one of the factors to be considered in sentencing. The sentencing judge considered Herrera-Guillen\u2019s arguments for mitigation and acknowledged that Herrera-Guillen\u2019s sentence was three months lower than it would have been had those arguments not been made, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-9\">I understand your lawyer\u2019s arguments and I have factored those in, and quite frankly, that\u2019s why I did not sentence you to the highest end of the range, which is what I would have done, given the very violent and vile nature of that cilme. I mean, I can\u2019t think of too many worse things in life than to be raped while your children are on the other side and your children being threatened if you don\u2019t give into somebody\u2019s demands. I just can\u2019t even imagine a worse factual scenario than that. And that\u2019s what I can\u2019t, quite frankly, get around.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">Although Herrera-Guillen argues that the district court \u201cnever considered a sentence outside of the guideline range\u201d and suggests that the court did not truly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, not once during his sentencing hearing did Herrera-Guillen request a sentence any lower than \u201cthe low end of the guideline range.\u201d Even if Herrera-Guillen had made a request for such a departure, the district court was entitled to sentence within the guidelines range without specifically ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>knowledging each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Here the district court specifically did note that Herrera-Guillen\u2019s arguments for mitigation had been factored into the sentencing equation, showing that the sentencing judge definitely considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">The sentence was also substantively reasonable. Herrera-Guillen notes that under <em>Booker, </em>a sentence within the guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Here, the sentencing judge did not blindly apply the guidelines range. The sentencing judge took account of the mitigating factors offered by Herrera-Guillen and reduced the sentence below what he would have imposed absent consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363. Moreover, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787-88. Because the sentencing judge in this case accorded some weight to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, sentenced Herrera-Guillen within the guidelines range, and provided valid reasons for imposing a sentence near the top of the guidelines range, we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363. Herrera-Guillen therefore has not shown that \u201cthe sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
