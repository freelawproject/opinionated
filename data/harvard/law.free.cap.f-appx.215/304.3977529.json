The district court sentenced Sutton to 185 months of imprisonment based on the finding that he was an armed career criminal because he had at least three previous convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.4 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On appeal, counsel argues that the district court\u2019s finding that Sutton was an armed career criminal, absent Sutton admitting or a jury finding that he had at least three previous violent felonies or serious drug offenses, violates the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In his brief, however, Sutton\u2019s counsel concedes that this court has rejected this argument. <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005); <em>see Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance citing the opinions in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and <em>Cheek. </em>Sutton\u2019s counsel has filed a response to the motion, stating that he has no objections. Accordingly, we grant the motion and affirm Sutton\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
