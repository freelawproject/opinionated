Alexander (\u201cAlexander\u201d), deported from the United States in 2001 for an aggravated felony, pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry into the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). Alexander was sentenced by the District Court to 70 months imprisonment to run concurrently with a New Jersey state sentence for possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute. This Court summarily remanded the District Court\u2019s sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and the District Court resentenced Alexander to the same 70-month sentence, based on an advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) range and other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to be considered under <em>Booker. </em>The 70-month sentence imposed by the District Court lies within the advisory Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months and Alexander does not argue that the range was calculated incorrectly. On appeal, Alexander argues that the sentence imposed was unreasonable due to the District Court\u2019s inadequate consideration of the other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On February 4, 2001, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) executed an October 8, 1997 Order of Deportation <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by deporting Alexander to his native Dominican Republic and advising him that he would have to reapply with the Attorney General\u2019s Office should he wish to return to the United States. By his own admission, Alexander illegally re-entered the United States days later in violation of the Deportation Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On September 24, 2002, Alexander was arrested in Bergen County, New Jersey, for cocaine possession. Bergen County jail officials notified INS officials of Alexander\u2019s arrest; and on December 11, 2002, he appeared before a federal magistrate judge in the District of New Jersey for arraignment on the illegal re-entry charge. Upon his arrest, Alexander attempted to cooperate with state and federal law authorities, but his efforts yielded no viable information for the authorities and therefore did not result in a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Concurrently with Alexander\u2019s attempt to cooperate with authorities, the New Jersey state charge for cocaine possession proceeded against him. Alexander pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled dan-</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">gerous substance with intent to distribute. On May 20, 2004, he was sentenced in state court to five years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">On June 3, 2004, Alexander entered his plea of guilty to illegal re-entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). While ah parties agreed that the applicable Guidelines range would be 70 to 87 months for Alexander\u2019s sentence, Alexander moved for a downward departure in light of the \u201cextraordinary\u201d factual situation, arguing that but for his attempt to cooperate with the authorities, he would have been sentenced prior to the resolution of his state drug charge and three fewer points would have been added when calculating his criminal history. App. at 62-63. On September 17, 2004, the Honorable Jerome B. Simandle sentenced Alexander to 70 months, to run concurrently with his New Jersey state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Alexander filed a timely appeal of his sentence and while his appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Booker. </em>In light of <em>Booker, </em>Alexander\u2019s sentence was summarily vacated and his case was remanded for resentencing. On November 16, 2005, Judge Simandle sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>fenced Alexander to the same 70-month sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">For a sentence to be reasonable under <em>Booker, </em>\u201c[t]he record must demonstrate the trial court gave meaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d which include the range suggested by the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006). We therefore consider whether the District Court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to \u201cany sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 332 (internal citations omitted). \u201c[TJhere are no magic words that the district judge must invoke when sentencing,\u201d however, and the district court need not mechanically state by rote that it has considered each of the factors when imposing a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 332. Finally, we consider whether the District Court \u201creasonably applied [the \u00a7 3553(a) factors] to the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330. We apply a \u201cdeferential standard\u201d in reviewing the District Court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201c[t]he trial court being in the best position to determine the appropriate sentence in light of the particular circumstances of the case,\u201d and must affirm where the District Court issued a sentence \u201cfor reasons that are logical and consistent with the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party that challenges the sentence has the burden of proving that it is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">Alexander argues that the sentence imposed by the District Court was unreasonable. He contends that while the District Court recognized the factors embodied in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court failed to sufficiently consider those factors. Alexander also argues that the District Court failed to sufficiently address the concerns raised by the defense. Alexander questions whether the District Court accounted for his efforts to cooperate with law-enforcement; problems that resulted from the delay; and whether the District Court considered his history of drug and alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">The record of the District Court proceedings fails to support Alexander\u2019s claims. At the outset of Alexander\u2019s re-sentencing hearing, Judge Simandle noted that his \u201cfunction is to impose a sentence that\u2019s reasonable and that\u2019s sufficient but no greater than necessary to accomplish the statutory goals of sentencing in section 3553(a), and the guidelines play an impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tant part, but not the only part, in determining the reasonableness of a sentence.\u201d App. at 107. Questioning \u201c[w]hat has [Alexander] ... contributed to this country other than the violation of our laws,\u201d Judge Simandle stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2C\">what is sad is that [Alexander] ... hadn\u2019t learned by age 39 when in 1998 he was arrested and eventually convicted for conspiracy to distribute five kilograms of cocaine and more. And he hadn\u2019t learned it by age 41 when he illegally re-entered and was arrested on the state charges and eventually convicted in Bergen County and he\u2019s serving the sentence that, the present sentence in federal court has been made concurrent with. I don\u2019t know that he got so brilliant between age 41 and age 45 that I can really conclude he\u2019s learned any lessons. He\u2019s had so many chances. And looking through his report, I just don\u2019t see any string of years when he\u2019s been crime-free let alone drug-free or alcohol-free.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">App. at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In setting forth the reasons for his sentence, Judge Simandle first noted that the crime itself was \u201cbrazen\u201d and generally discussed how the sentence imposed reflects the seriousness of the offense and that it provides just punishment for the offense. See App. at 131-34. Noting further that Alexander has no dispute with the advisory Guideline range of 70 to 87 months of imprisonment, App. at 131, Judge Simandle gave an articulate and well-reasoned review of Alexander\u2019s criminal history and stated that his continual run-ins with the law \u201c[say] a lot to me about his character and also his prospects of recidivism and I\u2019ve considered those----I think of the need to deter this defendant because of his significant brushes with the criminal justice system and the fact that they haven\u2019t deterred him from violating the laws of the United States and of New Jersey, and so it\u2019s hard to accept that he has turned something around.\u201d App. at 132-33. Accordingly, Judge Simandle\u2019s sentence attempts to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and to protect the public from further crimes of Alexander. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B-C).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Judge Simandle subsequently addressed Alexander\u2019s argument that his cooperation with authorities should result in a reduced sentence and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">I previously considered, at the time of the initial sentencing, the special circumstances surrounding his attempt at cooperation and I took that into account by taking the recommended sentence at that time, and I still have the recommendation from the probation department, which was a sentence at the top of the range, an 87-month sentence is what was recommended. I didn\u2019t impose that at the time and gave a 17-month break and imposed a sentence at the bottom of the range, which is only 70, not only, but it was 70 months, a substantial period of time to be sure. In recognition of the fact, which was also argued at the second sentencing, if he was sentenced before the state time, his criminal history would have been four rather than five, and all of that was considered carefully at that time and again today.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">App. at 134-35. Judge Simandle is quite explicit in addressing Alexander\u2019s argument that his cooperation with authorities should result in a reduced sentence and concluded that his cooperation was factored into the sentence. Thus, any claim that the District Court did not consider Alexander\u2019s cooperation with authorities has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Finally, Alexander\u2019s history of drug and alcohol abuse, while not considered a viable argument to reduce a Guidelines sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tenee,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was proactively addressed by Judge Simandle: \u201cI would encourage you to participate, to get on the waiting list or whatever needs to be done and then try to get benefit from meeting with other men who have had similar problems and are trying to overcome them---- [W]hen you come out and if alcohol or drugs are at the root of your problems, then you have to solve that.\u201d App. at 127. We recognize Judge Simandle\u2019s efforts to encourage Alexander to seek appropriate assistance for his chemical dependencies as an attempt to provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The District Court ultimately sentenced Alexander to the minimum term within the advisory range and further limited the sentence by ordering that it run concurrently with Alexander\u2019s New Jersey state sentence. The Judge not only looked at the recommended Guideline sentence, but effectively considered multiple other \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Alexander\u2019s sentence. Judge Simandle concluded, \u201cI fully recognize that the Guidelines are not binding, but in this case, I don\u2019t see any factor that would make a Guideline sentence unreasonable and I don\u2019t find that there\u2019s any sentence less than 70 months that would be sufficient and necessary to achieve the purposes of sentence in Mr. Alexander\u2019s case.\u201d App. at 136. We agree with the learned District Judge and, accordingly, are convinced that the District Court effectively applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the circumstances in Alexander\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">We find that the record demonstrates that the District Court meaningfully considered the necessary \u00a7 3553(a) factors and applied them to the circumstances of the case in determining a sentence for Alexander. We conclude that the sentence imposed by the District Court was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM the Judgment and Commitment Order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AN\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324 (3d Cir.2006). In <em>Cooper, </em>we held that an appellate court has jurisdiction to review the unreasonableness of a sentence, \u201cwhether within or outside the advisory guidelines range,\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 328.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\">. Alexander is a native of the Dominican Republic who legally entered the United States in 1978 and earned permanent resident status in 1985 while playing minor league baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Alexander's career was cut short by injury and he turned to drugs and alcohol. In May 1991, Alexander was sentenced to 15 years in New Jersey state custody for several narcotics-related convictions including distribution of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine). After having served five years of his 15-year sentence, Alexander was paroled in January 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">On October 8, 1997, while on parole, Alexander was ordered deported as an aggravated felon based on his 1991 narcotics conviction. Alexander failed to comply with the deportation order and remained unlawfully in the United States. Alexander was subsequently arrested in January 1998 in New York on federal narcotics charges. Because Alexander entered a cooperation plea to the charges, he was sentenced in March 2000 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to time served, after having spent 774 days in prison, and three years of supervised release after receiving the benefit of a Government motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">Two days after Alexander\u2019s federal sentencing, New Jersey revoked his parole on the 1991 conviction. He remained in state custody on the parole revocation until January 2001, at which point he was transferred to the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\u201d) for execution of the 1997 deportation order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">.
