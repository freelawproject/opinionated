Kazeem contends that he provided sufficient evidence to sustain his burden of proof regarding his application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-24\">This court reviews \u201cthe BIA\u2019s factual conclusion that an alien is not eligible for withholding of [removal] only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Zamora-Morel v. I.N.S., </em>905 F.2d 833, 838 (5th Cir.1990). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be affirmed unless \u201cthe evidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. I.N.S., </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84,112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-25\">Kazeem fails to show that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that he has suffered past persecution or will more than likely suffer persecution if he is returned to Nigeria. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u00a7 208.16(b); <em>Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 594 (5th Cir.2006). Kazeem has abandoned the issues regarding the denial of his applications for asylum, voluntary departure, and relief under the CAT by failing to brief the issues in his petition for review. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). Accordingly, Kazeem\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
