California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Boyett has filed several responses. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Boyett\u2019s responses shows that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Although Boyett argues in one of her responses that her counsel was ineffective for various reasons, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration of these claims on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this appeal is DISMISSED. All other outstanding motions are DENIED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under file limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
