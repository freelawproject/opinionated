In response, the government argues that Denmark waived these issues in a valid appeal waiver in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">We review an appeal-of-sentence waiver provision <em>de novo. United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir. 1993). A sentence appeal waiver contained in a plea agreement, made knowingly and voluntarily, is enforceable. <em>United States v. Weaver, </em>275 F.3d 1320, 1333 (11th Cir. 2001). To enforce the sentence-appeal waiver, the government must demonstrate either that (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the sentence-appeal waiver during the change of plea colloquy, or (2) the record clearly shows that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>Id.; See also </em>F.R.Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(N). In addition, guideline-based chaEenges to a sentence and appeals on <em>\u201cApprendi/Booker </em>grounds\u201d can be waived by virtue of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1129 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">In this case, the district court discussed the appeal waiver with Denmark during the Rule 11 plea colloquy. In so doing, the court informed Denmark that he was expressly waiving his right to appeal subject to three exceptions. Denmark could challenge his sentence if it exceeded the guideline range as determined by the court or the statutory maximum, or if it violated the Eighth Amendment. Based on the fact that the court questioned Denmark about the appeal waiver and explained the ramifications of agreeing to the waiver, the waiver was valid. Moreover, none of the exceptions apply. Accordingly, we dismiss Denmark\u2019s appeal of his 240-month sentence based upon a valid appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">With respect to his 60-month sentence imposed upon revocation of his supervised release, Denmark argues that his sentence was unreasonable for three reasons. First, he argues that it was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion to impose his revocation of supervised release sentence consecutively to his conspiracy conviction because the court was punishing him for the same conduct. In addition, Denmark argues that the sentencing guidelines do not require consecutive sentences, and thus the court abused its discretion. Second, Denmark contends that the maximum statutory sentence he could have received upon the revocation of his supervised release was three years because he had been originally convicted of a class B felony in 1996. Third, Denmark contends that the district court failed to adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Sentences imposed for violation of supervised release under an advisory guidelines system are reviewed for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Sweeting, 437 </em>F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). Because Denmark failed to raise any objection to his sentence in the district court, we review this claim, raised for the first time on appeal, only for plain error to avoid manifest injustice. <em>United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Section 3583 of Title 18 provides that the district court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-10\">revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable to revocation of probation or supervised release, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, except that a defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve more than 5 years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony, more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a class C or D felony, or more than one year in any other case[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). If a criminal offense is not classified by a letter grade in the statutory section defining it, then the maximum statutory sentence determines an offense\u2019s proper letter grade classification. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a). For an offense with a maximum term of life imprisonment, the proper classification is a Class A felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107. A district court need not, however, explicitly consider every single \u00a7 3553(a) factor in order for the sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In addition, it is within a district court\u2019s discretion to impose a sentence consecutively regardless of whether the sentence is based on revocation of supervised release and is imposed prior to the sentence for the instant offense. See <em>United States v. Flowers, </em>13 F.3d 395, 397 (11th Cir. 1994). Revocation of supervised release and any subsequent incarceration is part of the original sentence and constitutes punishment for the crime underlying that sentence. <em>United States v. Woods, </em>127 F.3d 990, 992 (11th Cir.1997). The introductory commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B indicates that courts may order a term of imprisonment to be served consecutively or concurrently to an undischarged term of imprisonment. The court, in determining whether to run a sentence concurrently or consecutively, is to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">The district court\u2019s 60-month sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. In Denmark\u2019s 1997 conviction, the plea agreement explicitly stated that the maximum penalty he was facing was a term of life imprisonment. The district court specifically stated to Denmark during the plea colloquy that the offense to which he was pleading guilty carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Section 841 of Title 18, the section under which Denmark was convicted, does not classify its offenses by felony letter grades, but does carry a Denmark\u2019s offense was a Class A felony because he could have received a term of life imprisonment. Thus, the court\u2019s 60-month sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Further, the sentence imposed was reasonable, as Denmark\u2019s sentence reflected consideration of several of the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, the court satisfied its obligation to consider the relevant factors by stating that it had considered the factors and Denmark\u2019s arguments. The court specifically considered Denmark\u2019s career offender status, the fact that he had been through the penal system, and that he had cooperated with law enforcement only to get involved with drugs again. The court\u2019s statements reflected consideration of the history and characteristics of the defendant and the nature and circumstances of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">In addition, it was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion for the district court to impose its sentence consecutively because the 60-month sentence was punishment for the offense underlying the supervised release term. Therefore, it was not a double sentence for the conspiracy charge. The courts also have discretion on whether to run a sentence concurrently or consecutively as long as they consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In this case, the court imposed the consecutive sentence after considering \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
