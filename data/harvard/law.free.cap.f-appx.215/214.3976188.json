Galloway\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether Galloway\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Galloway was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-23\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range,</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then should consider the resulting advisory guideline range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the proper advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The district court determined that because Galloway was over eighteen years old and had at least two prior felony convictions for a controlled substance, he was subject to sentencing as a career offender, resulting in an offense level of 37 and Criminal History Category VI. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1 (2005). His advisory guideline range was thus 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table). Galloway did not object to the presentence report and conceded to the factual allegations contained therein. The district court imposed a sentence of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, which is within the appropriately calculated advisory guideline range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment and is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457. There is no evidence in the record that the sentence is proeedurally or substantively unreasonable. We therefore find the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Galloway\u2019s conviction and sentence. We also deny Galloway\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel. This court requires that counsel inform Galloway, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">States for further review. If he requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Galloway. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
