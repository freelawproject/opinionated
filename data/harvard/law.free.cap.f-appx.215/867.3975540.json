She argues that the sentences are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">On appeal, Rizki argues that her low-end concurrent 70-month sentences are unreasonable because she clearly outlined, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), six reasons based on her personal circumstances to warrant a downward <em>variance </em>but the district court erroneously required her to meet a higher, <em>pre-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>standard by proving that she was entitled to a downward <em>departure.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">We review <em>post-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\"><em>Booker </em>mandates that courts review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). 543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66. A party challenging a sentence must bear the burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record established below. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Some factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) are the: (1) \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; and (2) need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2). While a sentence within the Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, it is expected to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. A district court need not mention each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). Additionally, in reviewing such sentences, we review the final sentence for reasonableness, as opposed to each individual decision made during the sentencing process. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">Upon review of the record and consideration of both parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. The record here indicates that Rizki\u2019s 70-month concurrent sentences are not unreasonable. As the government argues, although the district court used the word \u201cdeparture\u201d at the same time that it stated sentences below the Guidelines range were not warranted, the record indicates that the court appreciated, but chose not to exercise its authority to impose below-range sentences. The court: (1) clearly discussed its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the fact that, in its opinion, Rizki had not proved that any of these factors warranted a downward variance; and (2) specifically addressed Rizki\u2019s mitigating arguments, pointing out its opinion that Rizki had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>overstated the severity of her substance-abuse problems, and declined a downward variance. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (the \u00a7 3553(a) factors serve as a basis for determining reasonableness); <em>see also Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30 (a court need not mention each \u00a7 3553(a) factor). Additionally, Rizki\u2019s 70-month sentences are at the low end of the Guidelines range and 50 months below the statutory minimum. Because the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the context of Rizki\u2019s personal circumstances in arriving at her sentences, she has failed to meet her burden of proving unreasonableness. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-13\">. <em>United States v.
