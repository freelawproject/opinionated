He argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment as well as <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and due process. Upon review of the record and consideration of both parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">Sanchez argues for the first time on appeal that his 20-year sentence is disproportionate, cruel, and unusual in violation of the Eighth Amendment because (1) it is based on two prior convictions that were too old to be counted toward his criminal history points, (2) without these old prior convictions, he faced only 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, and (3) his co-defendants received only 24- and 70-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">Generally, we review <em>de novo </em>constitutional challenges to a sentence. <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1604, 164 L.Ed.2d 325 (2006). However, Sanchez did not raise his Eighth Amendment argument below, and so it is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Road, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 196, 163 L.Ed.2d 207 (2005). Thus, Sanchez must prove that \u201c(1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting [his] substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-20\">We have held that \u201c[i]n non-capital cases, the Eighth Amendment encompasses, at most, a narrow proportionality principle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original; citations omitted). Additionally, \u201c[o]utside the context of capital punishment, <em>successful </em>challenges to the proportionality of sentences [are] exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and emphasis in original; citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-21\">When addressing an Eighth Amendment challenge, \u201ca court \u2018must make a threshold determination that the sentence imposed is grossly disproportionate to the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>committed[J\u201d and the defendant bears the burden of making this showing. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1324), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 462, 166 L.Ed.2d 329 (2006). \u201cIn general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243 (quoting <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2005)); <em>see also Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1324 (noting that we have upheld mandatory minimum sentences in various statutes, such as conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1); the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924; the career-offender provisions of the Guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; and a food-stamp fraud statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Sanchez pled guilty to Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment, and Count 3 charged him with conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1), 846, 851. He also admitted at sentencing that he had two prior felony drug offenses. According to \u00a7 841(b)(1), if a defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 841 involves 50 grams or more of methamphetamine and he \u201ccommits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, [he] ... shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 20 years and not more than life imprisonment[.]\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(viii).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">In a case similar to this one, we held that the district court did not plainly err in imposing mandatory life sentences based on the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record and instant conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1), 851. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 250-51 (11th Cir.1992). In <em>Willis </em>we held that (1) the district court\u2019s honoring of the government\u2019s exercise of its unfettered discretion in its decision to invoke \u00a7 851 did not violate the Due Process Clause because mandatory minimum sentences set by statute did not violate due process;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the defendant\u2019s claim that the mandatory life sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment was meritless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">Sanchez\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment does not violate the Eighth Amendment. As a general rule, a sentence imposed by statute does violate the constitution. <em>See Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243. Like the defendant in <em>Willis, </em>956 F.2d at 250-51, Sanchez had a prior criminal record, which triggered the statutory minimum under \u00a7 841(b)(1). Although Sanchez\u2019s prior felony drug convictions were old, nothing in the statute disqualifies prior convictions based on their remoteness in time from the instant offense. Moreover, upholding Sanchez\u2019s sentence of 20 years follows <em>a fortiori </em>from the <em>Willis </em>decision, which affirmed the constitutionality of a life mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1). Likewise, Sanchez\u2019s argument that his co-defendants received lower sentences is unpersuasive given that neither of his co-defendants had a prior criminal record similar to his. Sanchez has thus failed to establish plain error by demonstrating that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Sanchez also argues that his 240-month sentence is unreasonable and violates <em>Booker </em>and due process because it is greater than the 108- to 135-month guideline range he faced without prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">We review post<em>-Booker </em>sentences for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). However, Sanchez\u2019s argument that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>and due process because it is outside the guideline range, an argument not raised below, is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See Raad, </em>406 F.3d at 1323 (argument reviewed for plain error when the defendant did not object below).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">After <em>Booker, </em>district courts still must correctly calculate the guideline range, after which they may consider imposing a more or less severe punishment under the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). According to the Guidelines, \u201c(wjhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). Furthermore, even after <em>Booker, </em>district courts remain bound by applicable statutory m\u00ednimums. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Here, the correct calculation of Sanchez\u2019s guideline range yielded, pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.1(b), a sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment because, as previously discussed, his statutory minimum sentence was 20 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(viii); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). Although, as Sanchez points out, his guideline range momentarily was 108 to 135 months, his ultimate and correct guideline range was 240 months. Therefore, the district court did not plainly err in imposing a sentence within the guideline range. <em>See McVay, </em>447 F.3d at 1353 (district courts first must correctly calculate the guideline range); see also <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10 (district courts remain bound by applicable statutory minimum sentences). Accordingly, Sanchez\u2019s arguments are without merit, and we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-12\">. <em>United States v.
