He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of a so-called safety valve reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Of the five criteria for a \u00a7 5C1.2 adjustment, the only one at issue here is the requirement that the defendant has truthfully provided the Government with all information and evidence he has concerning the offense. We review the district court\u2019s factual finding that Madrigal did not truthfully debrief for clear error. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Contrary to Madrigal\u2019s assertions, the district court\u2019s conclusion was not based on unsubstantiated speculation. Rather, the district court heard directly from Madrigal and concluded that his story that a stranger sought him out randomly to transport a large and valuable load of marijuana for $10,000 was not plausible. The district court\u2019s credibility determination, entitled to great deference, was not clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>168 F.3d 741, 753 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 968 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Salinas-Capistran, </em>133 Fed. App\u2019x 112, 113-14 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
