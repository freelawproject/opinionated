The Government seeks to enforce the appeal waiver provision of the plea agreement in which Velazquez waived \u201cany right to appeal the sentence on any grounds.\u201d Velazquez contends that his case falls within exceptions to the appeal waiver for ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. He asserts that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s taking, and the prosecutor\u2019s failure to prevent the case agent from making, <em>ex parte </em>statements constitute, respectively, ineffective assistance and prosecutorial misconduct. Velazquez, however, does not properly brief ineffective assistance and prosecutorial misconduct claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">Velazquez does not challenge the validity of his guilty plea or the sentence-appeal waiver. The record shows that the waiver was knowing and voluntary and, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the issues raised on appeal. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Velazquez\u2019s assertion that defense and government counsel had a duty to object to the district court\u2019s use of the case agent\u2019s testimony and Velazquez\u2019s debriefings does not bring the issue raised on appeal \u2014 that the district court erred at sentencing \u2014 into the excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>tions to the waiver. As such, we do not address the merits of Velazquez\u2019s challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
