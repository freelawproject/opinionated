Cardone, a Delaware state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b)(l). Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>cause we agree with the District Court and conclude that this appeal is frivolous as well, we will dismiss it pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Cardone filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that defendants have \u201ceroded\u201d his due process rights ever since he has \u201chad the misfortune of coming into contact [with them] through Delaware\u2019s legal system[.]\u201d Such contact was occasioned by Cardone\u2019s prosecution for and conviction of three crimes, the sentences for which the Delaware Supreme Court recently affirmed. <em>See generally Cardone v. State, </em>No. 397,2005, 2006 WL 686588 (Del. Mar. 17, 2006). The defendants are all judges or lawyers, and include the judge who presided over Cardone\u2019s trial (appellee Graves), the prosecutor (appellee Ryan) and Cardone\u2019s appointed counsel (appellee Abram). Also named as defendants are two other judges (appellees Bradley and Stokes), the Delaware Public Defender and a lawyer in his office (appellees Sullivan and Callaway, respectively), another prosecutor (appellee Withers) and the Delaware Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Cardone alleges that \u201ceach defendant\u201d has denied his \u201cnumerous requests\u201d and, in particular, that he \u201crequested motions to be filed, search for evidence to prove [his] innocence, bail reviews to reduce [his] bail, only to be ignored.\u201d Cardone further alleges that he has filed disciplinary complaints against appellees Abram and Graves, which were dismissed. Cardone seeks damages and requests that the District Court \u201c[p]ull the defendant\u2019s [sic] licenses\u201d that allow them to \u201cmake a mockery of our legal system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Cardone is proceeding in <em>forma pauperis, </em>so we review this appeal to determine whether it should be dismissed as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An appeal is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We are in complete agreement with the District Court\u2019s reasons for dismissing Cardone\u2019s complaint, and our independent review reveals that there is no arguable basis to challenge them. In particular, for the reasons explained by the District Court, we agree that the judicial and prosecutorial defendants are immune from this suit, that Cardone\u2019s counsel and the public defender defendants are not state actors for \u00a7 1983 purposes, and that the complaint does not state an actionable claim against the Delaware Attorney General. We further agree that the complaint states no basis for relief even if it is liberally construed to challenge the validity of, or seek damages resulting from, Cardone\u2019s conviction or sentence, and that any amendment of the complaint would be futile.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. The District Court dismissed Cardone\u2019s complaint without prejudice, but we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, both because the dismissal was in part pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e) and because any amendment of the complaint would be futile. <em>See Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir. 1995); <em>Borelli v. City of Reading, </em>532 F.2d 950, 951-52 (3d Cir.1976). Our review is plenary. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
