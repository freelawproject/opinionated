Hyacinthe filed a second petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. After review, we deny the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">A. August 13, 2004 Notice to Appear</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">In 2000, Hyacinthe entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident. On August 27, 2003, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, Hyacinthe pled guilty to three counts of \u201cBank Fraud,\u201d each in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. According to the judgment, the bank fraud offense in Count One of Hyacinthe\u2019s indictment \u201cconcluded\u201d on July 5, 1996; the bank fraud offense in Count Two \u201cconcluded\u201d on May 15, 1997; and the bank fraud offense in Count Three \u201cconcluded\u201d on June 18,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">On August 13, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear, charging Hyacinthe with removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (ii), as an alien who committed two or more crimes involving moral turpitude that did not arise out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">B. August 31, 2004 hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">On August 31, 2004, Hyacinthe, represented by attorney Landy, appeared before the IJ. At that time, through Mr. Landy, Hyacinthe admitted the allegations in the Notice to Appear, including that he had been convicted of three counts of bank fraud, and conceded removability. At Mr. Landy\u2019s request, the IJ explained to Hyacinthe that his bank fraud convictions did not arise out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct because they were \u201cseparate incidents,\u201d and while Hyacinthe \u201chad the chance to change [his] mind at any time and stop,\u201d he \u201cdid not,\u201d and instead \u201ccommitted a whole separate offense.\u201d The IJ stated that \u201c[a] single scheme is ... one in which you commit one offense like if you go in and you pass a bad check. There\u2019s forgery for writing somebody\u2019s name on it.... There\u2019s grand theft when you receive the money. That\u2019s one scheme.\u201d Hyacinthe responded that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">Also at the August 31, 2004 hearing, Mr. Landy stated that Hyacinthe was \u201cof the opinion that these crimes don\u2019t arise out of a single scheme.\u201d Mr. Landy explained his belief that if Hyacinthe\u2019s crimes did arise out of a single scheme, Hyacinthe would be removable in any event under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(m) for having committed an aggravated felony (as opposed to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) for two or more crimes of moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme). Mr. Landy explained that if Hyacinthe were removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(m), that \u201cwould not be good,\u201d because then \u201c[h]e wouldn\u2019t have a political asylum application.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The August 31, 2004 hearing concluded with the IJ setting Hyacinthe\u2019s asylum application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>for a hearing and denying Hyacinthe a bond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">C. October 26, 2004 hearing</p>\n<p id=\"ACV\">On October 26, 2004, Hyacinthe, represented by Mr. Landy, appeared again before the IJ. Hyacinthe, through Mr. Landy, stated that he wished to \u201cstand by\u201d his \u201cprevious admissions, concessions, and acknowledgments\u201d made at the August 31, 2004 hearing. The IJ asked Hyacinthe if he was \u201cgoing to go forward\u201d with his asylum application. Hyacinthe, through Mr. Landy, responded that he wished to \u201cwithdraw [Hyacinthe\u2019s] application for asylum and ... request voluntary departure as relief from removal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The IJ stated that before he could accept the withdrawal of Hyacinthe\u2019s asylum application, he had to make sure that the decision was \u201cvoluntarily [and] intelligently made\u201d by Hyacinthe. The IJ posed several questions directly to Hyacinthe, asking, <em>inter alia, </em>whether he had an opportunity to discuss his case with Mr. Landy; whether his decision was voluntary; whether his decision was uninfluenced by promises, threats, or other improprieties; whether he understood that he was withdrawing his application with prejudice; and whether he was \u201csatisfied with the representation given\u201d by Mr. Landy. Hyacinthe responded affirmatively to each question. The IJ also explained to Hyacinthe that a withdrawal with prejudice meant that he could not \u201creassert\u201d his claim and that he \u201cwould have to depart the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Hyacinthe also agreed that he was subjecting himself to a \u201cfinal order.\u201d Hyacinthe expressed his understanding that if he \u201cwanted to contest anything that happened\u201d in front of the IJ, he would not have that \u201copportunity.\u201d The IJ then entered his final removal order, which granted Hyacinthe\u2019s \u201csole form of [requested] relief\u2019 \u2014 120 days to voluntarily depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">D. Hyacinthe\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal to the BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">On November 23, 2004, Hyacinthe filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal with the BIA, in which he contended that he had acquired \u201cnew evidence\u201d that Mr. Landy was \u201cineffective, malicious, and [perhaps] even ... psychologically unfit to practice law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, Hyacinthe filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion to Invalidate Waiver of Appeal\u201d with the BIA, as well as a merits appeal brief arguing that his due process rights had been violated. The essence of Hyacinthe\u2019s filings before the BIA was that Mr. Landy conspired with the IJ to trick Hyacinthe into withdrawing his asylum application, and that Hyacinthe\u2019s underlying bank fraud convictions were part of a single scheme, making deportation under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">On February 15, 2006, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, dismissed Hyacinthe\u2019s appeal, and reauthorized voluntary departure. The BIA observed that Hyacinthe had withdrawn \u201call applications for relief and waived his right to appeal the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision <em>in </em>exchange for an agreed upon lengthy period for voluntary departure.\u201d The BIA addressed Hyacinthe\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and concluded that Hyacinthe failed to satisfy \u201cany of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>\u201d 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">E. Motion for Reconsideration of BIA\u2019s February 15, 2006 decision</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Hyacinthe subsequently obtained new counsel and filed a motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s February 15 decision, which the BIA denied on April 24, 2006. The BIA stated that, despite Hyacinthe\u2019s allegations to the contrary, it had \u201caddressed all of [Hyacinthe\u2019s] claims\u201d in its first decision. The BIA observed that Hyacinthe\u2019s motion for reconsideration still failed to meet the <em>Lozada </em>requirements. The BIA again noted that Hyacinthe had \u201cwithdrawn all other claims\u201d before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Hyacinthe timely filed petitions for review of both BIA decisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">II. Exhaustion and appeal waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The government contends that we lack jurisdiction over all of Hyacinthe\u2019s claims, except his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, because Hyacinthe explicitly abandoned all claims in his hearing before the IJ and thereby failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">In order to exhaust administrative remedies, a petitioner must raise the claim before both the IJ and the BIA, unless there is a valid \u201cexcuse or exception.\u201d <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1251 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Galindo-Del Valle v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>213 F.3d 594, 599 (11th Cir.2000), <em>superseded on other grounds by statute as stated in Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>533 U.S. 949, 121 S.Ct. 2590, 150 L.Ed.2d 749 (2001). Because Hyacinthe abandoned his claims before the IJ, Hyacinthe failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and we lack jurisdiction over his claims, except for his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see also Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">Furthermore, Hyacinthe\u2019s appeal waiver before the IJ barred his claims before the BIA, making them unexhausted before this Court for this additional reason. As the government argues, the BIA properly concluded that Hyacinthe waived his right to appeal his removal order in exchange for 120 days to voluntarily depart. Under BIA precedent, a valid appeal waiver before the IJ takes away the BIA\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See In re Rodriguez-Diaz, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); <em>Matter of Shih, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 697, 699 (BIA 1993); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(G). \u201cWhenever the right to appeal is waived, the decision of the [IJ] becomes final and may be implemented immediately____By waiving appeal, an alien relinquishes the opportunity to obtain review of the [IJ\u2019s] ruling.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Diaz, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1322. The BIA will uphold appeal waivers that are knowingly and intelligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>made. <em>See id; see also United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </em>481 U.S. 828, 840, 107 5. Ct. 2148, 2156, 95 L.Ed.2d 772 (1987) (indicating that alien\u2019s waiver of appeal of a deportation order is invalid unless it is \u201cconsidered [and] intelligent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Here, the BIA\u2019s determination that Hyacinthe waived his right to appeal his removal order is supported by the record. For example, the IJ specifically asked Hyacinthe if he understood that he would not have the \u201copportunity\u201d to contest anything that happened before the IJ. The IJ also asked Hyacinthe and his counsel if they were prepared to accept the decision as \u201cfinal.\u201d Hyacinthe indicated that he understood. Hyacinthe also agreed, with his attorney, that he would accept the IJ\u2019s order as final. According to the BIA, \u201c[a]sking the parties whether they accept a decision as \u2018final\u2019 is a shorthand expression commonly used\u201d by IJs, and \u201c[t]hose who understand the meaning of this shorthand expression, such as aliens represented by attorneys ... may effectively waive appeal in response to this simple question.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Diaz, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 1322.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Moreover, we agree with the BIA that Hyacinthe cannot avoid his failure to exhaust or invalidate his appeal waiver through his claim that Mr. Landy provided him ineffective assistance of counsel, because Hyacinthe failed to comply with the procedural requirements for asserting a claim of ineffective assistance. A petitioner attempting to \u201c\u2018reopen or reconsider based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\u2019 \u201d must at least \u201csubstantially\u201d comply with the requirements of <em>Lozada. See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 639); <em>see also Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2003). <em>Lozada </em>requires that a petitioner: (1) provide an affidavit detailing the agreement entered into with counsel and any representations counsel did or did not make regarding the agreement; (2) inform counsel of the allegation of ineffectiveness and provide counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) establish that a complaint has been filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding any ethical or legal violations committed by counsel, or if no such complaint has been filed, explain why. <em>Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">In his initial appeal to the BIA, Hyacinthe did not comply with any of the three <em>Lozada </em>requirements. Indeed, even Hyacinthe\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not substantially comply with the third <em>Lozada </em>requirement, because he failed to file a complaint about Mr. Landy with the appropriate state bar authorities. <em>See Gbaya, </em>342 F.3d at 1221-22 &amp; n. 2 (observing that filing of a complaint with the appropriate state bar disciplinary authorities might satisfy the third <em>Lozada </em>requirement). Accordingly, Hyacinthe cannot establish ineffective assistance of counsel or avoid the exhaustion requirement or invalidate his appeal waiver by virtue of his ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">III. Hyacinthe\u2019s removal order</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">Alternatively, even if Hyacinthe did not validly waive his appeal rights, Hyacinthe\u2019s petitions fail on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal if the alien is deportable for a criminal conviction under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Camacho-Salinas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>460 F.3d 1343, 1346-47 (11th Cir.2006). Nevertheless, because judicial review is limited by statutory conditions, we retain jurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists. <em>Sosa-Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>420 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, as to Hyacinthe\u2019s final removal order, we may address whether Hyacinthe is \u201c(1) an alien; (2) who is removable; (3) based on having committed a disqualifying offense,\u201d if such matters are in dispute. <em>Camacho-Salinas, </em>460 F.3d at 1346 (quotation marks and citation omitted). In addition, \u201cfollowing the passage of the REAL ID Act of 2005 and despite other provisions which \u2018limit[ ] or eliminatef ] judicial review,\u2019 we retain jurisdiction to review \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1347 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Hyacinthe\u2019s main merits argument is that his convictions are not qualifying offenses under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). Specifically, Hyacinthe asserts that his three bank fraud convictions arose out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, so that he is not removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii). We disagree for several reasons. First, the BIA has determined that two offenses are not part of a single scheme when they are separate and distinct crimes and neither offense causes (or constitutes) the other. <em>See Matter of Adetiba, </em>20 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 506, 506 (BIA 1992). At least five other circuits have concluded that the BIA\u2019s approach is reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Abdelqadar v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 668, 675 (7th Cir.2005) (observing that the BIA \u201cwould treat a series of securities frauds by a broker who finds a new \u2018mark\u2019 daily as distinct offenses rather than aspects of a single scheme, because the broker could stop after any of the frauds,\u201d and citing precedent from other circuits).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Here, as detailed in the judgment, Hyacinthe committed one bank fraud offense that \u201cconcluded\u201d in July 1996 and two others that \u201cconcluded\u201d in May and June 1997, respectively. Hyacinthe could have \u201cstopped\u201d after his July 1996 fraud, but he did not, and accordingly, the IJ\u2019s determination that the crimes did not arise out of a single scheme was not unreasonable. <em>See Abdelqadar, </em>413 F.3d at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Secondly, at Hyacinthe\u2019s August 31, 2004 appearance before the IJ, Hyacinthe, through counsel, stated that he was \u201cof the opinion that these crimes don\u2019t arise out of a single scheme,\u201d because \u201cif they didn\u2019t, he\u2019d have an aggravated] felony\u201d that would render him removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(a)(m). Hyacinthe cannot now have it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Hyacinthe\u2019s final merits argument is that, for various reasons, he was improperly denied a full and fair hearing under the due process clause. However, Hyacinthe was not denied due process by the IJ, because Hyacinthe in fact received a hearing at which he chose to concede the allegations in the Notice to Appear. Moreover, despite Hyacinthe\u2019s contention to the contrary, he was not entitled to a full BIA opinion addressing every point raised in his appeal from the IJ\u2019s final order. <em>See Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir.2003) (BIA is free to adopt IJ\u2019s order and to affirm without opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>For all of the foregoing reasons, we deny Hyacinthe\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\">. In full, \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) provides that an alien is deportable if \"at any time after admission [he] is convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, regardless of whether confined therefor and regardless of whether the convictions were in a single trial.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-17\">.

Accordingly, we review the IJ\u2019s decision and review the BIA's analysis as to Hyacinthe's ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">To the extent that the IJ's or BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo.

The BIA\u2019s procedure generally requires an alien challenging the validity of an appeal waiver to file a motion with the IJ. <em>Shih, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 699.
