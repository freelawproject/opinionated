The Board provides free copies of the maps to government agencies and sells copies to non-government entities for a fee calculated according to the requested maps\u2019 coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Robert Tombs requested copies of certain maps at the cost of reproduction on a computer diskette, pursuant to New Jersey\u2019s Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 47: 1A-1 (West 2003). The Board explained it would provide Tombs with the copies according to its ordinary fee schedule. Tombs then threatened to seek relief from the Superior Court of New Jersey or the Government Records Council, the agency responsible for adjudicating OPRA appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">In response, the Board filed a complaint asking the District Court to declare that federal copyright law preempts Tombs\u2019 OPRA request, and applied for a temporary restraining order against Tombs. The District Court, <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed the Board\u2019s action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and \u00a7 1338. The Board timely appealed. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">District courts must look to the plaintiffs well-pleaded complaint to determine whether a ease arises under federal law. <em>U.S. Express Lines Ltd. v. Higgins, </em>281 F.3d 383, 389 (3d Cir.2002). A case arises under federal law for purposes of \u00a7 1331 or \u00a7 1338(a) if a right or immunity created by the Constitution or laws of the United States is an essential element of the plaintiffs cause of action. <em>Christianson v. Colt Ind. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 809, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988); <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 10-11, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983). The well-pleaded complaint rule is fully applicable to complaints seeking only declaratory relief. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>463 U.S. at 15-16, 103 S.Ct. 2841. A case does not arise under federal law simply because it is brought pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act. A district court lacks jurisdiction where, but for the availability of the declaratory judgment procedure, the federal claim would arise only as a defense to a state-created action. <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>463 U.S. at 16, 103 S.Ct. 2841 (1983) (citing <em>Shelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petrol. Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 672, 70 S.Ct. 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-17\">Where, as here, the complaint for declaratory judgment essentially asserts a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>defense to a threatened state court action, it is the character of the threatened state court action that determines whether there is federal-question jurisdiction in the district court. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 248, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952); <em>Thiokol Chem. Corp. v. Burlington Ind., Inc., </em>448 F.2d 1328, 1330 (3d Cir.1971), <em>cert, denied, Burlington Ind., Inc. v. Thiokol Chem. Corp., </em>404 U.S. 1019, 92 S.Ct. 684, 30 L.Ed.2d 668 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Tombs\u2019 threatened action arises under OPRA, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">all government records shall be subject to public access unless exempt from such access by [OPRA] as amended and supplemented ... [or] any federal law, federal regulation, or federal order ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC\">N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 47: 1A-1 (West 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">OPRA gives a citizen, without showing a personal or particular interest, an unqualified right to inspect public documents if they are, in fact, documents required by law to be made, maintained, or kept on file, unless they are otherwise exempted. <em>Asbury Park Press v. Lakewood Tp. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>354 N.J.Super. 146, 804 A.2d 1178, 1183 (2002). Federal copyright law is not an essential element of Tombs\u2019 OPRA claim. The Board\u2019s exclusive rights under copyright law arise only as a defense to Tombs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In <em>Thiokol Chemical, </em>we held that a plaintiff patent licensee could not invoke federal jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1338 by bringing a declaratory judgment action in which he asserted patent rights where the validity of his patent arose only as a defense against a threatened breach of contract action. <em>Thiokol Chem. Corp., </em>448 F.2d at 1330-31; <em>see also Christianson v. Colt Ind. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 809, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988). Similarly, the Board cannot invoke federal jurisdiction by asserting its federal copyright as a defense against Mr. Tombs\u2019 OPRA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Next, the Board argues federal copyright law completely preempts Tombs\u2019 threatened OPRA action. The United States Supreme Court has recognized a limited exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule where a federal statute wholly displaces a state cause of action through complete preemption. <em>Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, </em>539 U.S. 1, 6, 8, 123 S.Ct. 2058, 156 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003); <em>In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., </em>418 F.3d 277, 294 (3d Cir.2005); <em>In re U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 151, 160 (3d Cir.1999), <em>cert, denied, U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Bauman, </em>530 U.S. 1242, 120 S.Ct. 2687, 147 L.Ed.2d 960 (2000). Complete preemption doctrine applies where the federal statute at issue provides the exclusive cause of action for the claim asserted and also sets forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action. <em>Anderson, </em>539 U.S. at 8, 123 S.Ct. 2058.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The complete preemption doctrine does not apply to Tombs\u2019 threatened OPRA claim. Federal copyright law does not create an exclusive cause of action for access to public records and does not set forth procedures and remedies governing such actions. Simply stated, federal copyright law does not wholly displace state statutory or common law rights to public records, and therefore cannot be said to completely preempt Tombs\u2019 threatened claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">The District Court properly dismissed the Board\u2019s action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
