Aruanno filed his complaint <em>pro se. </em>The District Court granted him <em>informa pauperis </em>status. We will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-27\">Aruanno raised his claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>procedures in place for his civil commitment hearing violated his due process rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He requested a new civil commitment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Before the complaint was served, the District Court screened the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The District Court determined that Aruanno\u2019s sole federal remedy was a writ of habeas corpus. Furthermore, the District Court determined that to the extent that Aruanno sought declaratory or injunctive relief, his claims had not yet accrued because a favorable judgment would necessarily imply the invalidity of his civil commitment. Thus, the District Court dismissed Aruanno\u2019s complaint without prejudice. Aruanno timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The basis for our appellate jurisdiction is slightly (although not fatally) complicated by the dismissal of the proceedings below without prejudice. Orders without prejudice are generally not final within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Umbenhauer v. Woog, </em>969 F.2d 25, 30 n. 6 (3d Cir.1992). In this case, however, the District Court divested itself of the suit completely. Therefore, we have appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Erie County Retirees Ass\u2019n v. County of Erie, Pa., </em>220 F.3d 193, 202 (3d Cir.2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Our review of the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint is plenary. We must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them. <em>See Nami v. Fauver, </em>82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">A prisoner in state custody cannot use a \u00a7 1983 action to challenge the fact or duration of his confinement. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). \u201cHe must seek federal habeas corpus relief (or appropriate state relief) instead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u00a7 1983 action is barred if a plaintiffs success in the action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the confinement or its duration. <em>See id. </em>at 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242. In <em>Wilkinson, </em>the plaintiffs sought relief that would render the state procedures used to deny parole eligibility and parole suitability invalid. <em>See id. </em>at 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242. The Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in <em>Wilkinson </em>were cognizable under \u00a7 1983 because success would not mean that the plaintiffs would be immediately released or have a shorter confinement. <em>See id. </em>Rather, success would only mean a new parole eligibility review or a new parole hearing. <em>See id. </em>Thus, their claims did not lie \u201cat the core of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Similar to the claims in <em>Wilkinson, </em>Aruanno\u2019s claims do not lie \u201cat the core of habeas corpus.\u201d Aruanno seeks relief that would render the state\u2019s procedures in civil commitment hearings invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aruanno does not seek immediate release from civil commitment or a shorter civil commitment period. Instead, he only seeks a new civil commitment hearing. Pursuant to <em>Wilkinson, </em>Aruanno\u2019s claims are cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">In conclusion, we find that Aruanno\u2019s complaint does not \u201clie at the core of habe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>as corpus\u201d and that his claims are cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. Aruanno\u2019s motion for reconsideration of this Court\u2019s denial of his motion to appoint counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\">. <em>Pro se </em>complaints are liberally construed. <em>See Holley v. Dep\u2019t of Veteran Affairs, </em>165 F.3d 244, 247 (3d Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-16\">. For example, Aruanno argues that his due process rights were violated because a jury did not decide his civil commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
