On appeal, Lockhart contends the district court erred in calculating his guidelines range because the range was based only on information contained in his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d). According to Lockhart, because the guidelines range was improperly calculated, his sentence exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by his guilty plea in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Lockhart\u2019s claim that the enhancements to his offense level may not be based upon information submitted in the PSR is meritless. A district court may exercise discretion \u201cto select a specific sentence within a defined range,\u201d and Lock-hart \u201chas no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455 (4th Cir.) (holding that a district court \u201cmust make factual findings as appropriate or necessary to carry out its sentencing function\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Accordingly, we find the district court\u2019s calculation of the guidelines range was appropriately based upon information reported in Lockhart\u2019s PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">We also find the district court did not err when it considered the guidelines range calculated in the PSR accurate. While Lockhart is correct that his sentencing hearings for crimes for which he was arrested on March 10 and May 7, 1999, were consolidated, the sentences were for offenses that took place on different occasions and that were separated by an intervening arrest. Accordingly, the sentences are not \u201crelated\u201d for sentencing purposes. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.3). We therefore conclude the district court properly assigned Lockhart to criminal history category V.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">We also find the district court did not consider the guidelines range mandatory. After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). In a <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing, district courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455-56. However, \u201ca district court need not explicitly discuss every [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>- U.S.L.W. - (U.S. June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659). A sentence imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-21\">At sentencing, the district court clearly recognized that the guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory. The court further recognized its duty to fully consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After hearing argument from Lockhart\u2019s counsel and the Government regarding the guidelines range and \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court concluded the guidelines range was reasonable under the circumstances and considering the need to protect the \u201cpublic from further crimes of the defendant and to provide the defendant with the opportunity for needed vocational training,\u201d sentenced Lockhart at the low end of the guidelines range. We conclude Lockhart\u2019s sentence is reasonable because a sentence imposed \u201cwithin the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable,\u201d and there is no evidence to rebut the presumption in this case. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">We therefore affirm Lockhart\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
