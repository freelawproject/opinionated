The district court granted the USPS\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">The Postal Service has employed Richardson, who is black, as a mail handler since 1985. In January 1997 Richardson suffered a stroke. A few months later, his two doctors completed a \u201crequest for a light duty assignment\u201d on his behalf and stated he was ready to return to work, but the reports contained discrepancies. The doctors wrote new reports, both of which stated Richardson had difficulty with speech and comprehension. Richardson then underwent a fitness-for-duty exam at the direction of the USPS. The examining doctor recommended that he not lift over fifty pounds or operate or be around heavy equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">Based on the doctors\u2019 requests and the exam report, the USPS in July 1997 denied Richardson\u2019s request for light duty, because \u201c[a]ll examinations still indicate that you have difficulty with comprehension/understanding. This may present a safety problem in our work.\u201d After a second fitness-for-duty exam in December 1997, also scheduled by the USPS, Richardson was notified to report back for duty in January 1998, and he resumed his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">After pursuing relief through administrative channels,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Richardson, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>sued, alleging discrimination based on disability, hostile work environment, interference with Family and Medical Leave Act leave, violations of procedural due process, and breach of contract. Unable to decipher Richardson\u2019s claims, the district court ordered him twice to file statements outlining the specific claims he was asserting.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-21\">The court based its summary judgment on Richardson\u2019s second statement in which he alleged race discrimination under title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, <em>et seq., </em>disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, <em>et seq., </em>and due process violations under the Fifth Amendment. He asserts that he suffered these ills from March 1997, when his doctors released him to return to work after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>stroke, until January 1998, when he resumed work. More specifically, he claims injury from the USPS\u2019s failure to grant his request for light duty and its insistence on his second fitness-for-duty examination, which delayed his return. In his briefs on appeal, Richardson asserts claims beyond those involved in the summary judgment ruling, but we limit our discussion to the issues resolved by the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We apply the familiar standard of review of summary judgments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. A motion for summary judgment is properly granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. An issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action. In deciding whether a fact issue has been created, we must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>Roberts v. Cardinal Servs., Inc., </em>266 F.3d 368, 373 (5th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">First, Richardson\u2019s contention that the USPS discriminated against him because of his race fails because he offered no evidence that the USPS\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment decision was false or pretext for illicit discrimination. Under <em>McDonnell Douglas\u2019s </em>burden-shifting framework,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Richardson must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Frank v. Xerox Corp., </em>347 F.3d 130, 137 (5th Cir.2003). If a plaintiff is successful, the burden shifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its adverse employment decision. <em>Id. </em>If it does so, the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer\u2019s reason was a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Assuming without deciding that Richardson established a <em>prima facie </em>case, he did not demonstrate that the USPS\u2019s reason for refusing to assign him light-duty work or for requiring him to undergo a second fitness-for-duty examine was pretext for discrimination. The USPS claimed that Richardson\u2019s comprehension limitations posed a safety problem, and Richardson offered no evidence that this nondiscriminatory reason was false or a pretext. He failed to meet his burden under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>so summary judgment on this issue was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">Second, Richardson urges that the USPS discriminated against him because he is disabled. Richardson, however, has not made the requisite showing that he is disabled as defined by the Rehabilitation Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so the court rightly granted summary judgment. \u201cAn individual with a disability is any person who (1) has a physical or mental impairment which \u2018substantially limits one or more of such person\u2019s major life activities\u2019; (2) has a \u2018record\u2019 of such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>impairment; or (3) is \u2018regarded\u2019 as having such an impairment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Richardson offered no evidence that his impairments substantially limited a major life activity, so he is not disabled under the first prong. To have an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, an \u201cindividual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people\u2019s daily lives. The impairment\u2019s impact must also be permanent or long term.\u201d <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 198, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Richardson does not even allege that his impairments prevent or severely restrict major life activities, and the evidence suggests that his do not. His doctors and the examinations all concluded his ability to lift was not substantially impaired, and none suggested that his comprehension limitations prevented or severely restricted activities that are of central importance to most people\u2019s daily lives. Thus, the district court did not err in its conclusion Richardson is not disabled under the first prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Similarly, Richardson presented no evidence that there was a record of an impairment that substantially limited a major life activity, so he was not disabled under the second prong. His best evidence that the USPS regarded him as having an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity is the fact that the USPS did not permit him to work. Nonetheless, \u201c[a]n employer\u2019s belief that an employee is unable to perform one task with an adequate safety margin does not establish <em>per se </em>that the employer regards the employee as having a substantial limitation on his ability to work in general.\u201d <em>Chandler v. City of Dallas, </em>2 F.3d 1385 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Without more evidence, Richardson failed to present evidence that the USPS regarded him as disabled. Because he was not disabled under the Rehabilitation Act, his claim of discrimination because of disability was correctly dismissed at summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">Finally, Richardson complains of a violation of his constitutional procedural due process rights. Without reaching whether he can assert such claims given the statutory remedies available to him, we agree with the district court that Richardson has not offered evidence that any of his procedural rights was violated. He had access to and was heard by both administrative and judicial bodies, which addressed his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
