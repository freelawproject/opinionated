He was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 38 years and four months. Following sentencing, Ford\u2019s trial counsel filed a notice of appeal, which is currently pending in this Court. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>C.A. No. 05-4998.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In November 2006, Ford filed in the District Court a <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for the Court to Take Judicial Notice,\u201d requesting that the court \u201cvacate, and or dismiss count(s) II and IV ... of his facially deficient superseding indictment due to the government\u2019s lack of proffered subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d The District Court dismissed the motion. It found that the filing of the notice of appeal divested it of subject matter jurisdiction and that Ford\u2019s motion, which essentially amounted to motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, was premature while his direct appeal is pending. The District Court also noted that the motion was procedurally flawed because Ford could not represent himself at the same time that he is represented by counsel. Ford filed a timely <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u201cAs a general rule, the timely filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance, immediately conferring jurisdiction on a Court of Appeals and divesting a district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Venen v. Sweet, </em>758 F.2d 117, 120 (3d Cir.1985) (citations omitted). <em>See also Hudson United Bank v. LiTenda Mortg. Corp., </em>142 F.3d 151, 158 (3d Cir. 1998) (\u201c[J]urisdiction that is originally and properly vested in the district court becomes vested in the court of appeals when a notice of appeal is filed.\u201d). As the Court explained in <em>Venen, </em>this rule \u201chas the salutary purpose of preventing the confusion and inefficiency which would of necessity result were two courts to be considering the same issue or issues simultaneously.\u201d 758 F.2d at 121. The Court added that \u201c[t]he rule is a judge-made, rather than a statutory, creation ... [and thus, as] a prudential doctrine, the rule should not be applied when to do so would defeat its purpose of achieving judicial economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, in the context of collateral attacks upon convictions, courts have concluded that there is no <em>jurisdictional </em>bar to a District Court\u2019s adjudication of a \u00a7 2255 motion while the movant\u2019s direct appeal is pending, but that such actions are disfavored as a matter of judicial economy and concern that the results on direct appeal may make the District Court\u2019s efforts a nullity. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Prows, </em>448 F.3d 1223, 1228-29 (10th Cir. 2006); <em>Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 570-72 (3d Cir.1999) (recognizing that \u201cif ... direct review is ongoing ... the commencement of a simultaneous \u00a7 2255 proceeding would be inappropriate\u201d). While a direct appeal is pending, a District Court may consider a \u00a7 2255 motion only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Womack v. United States, </em>395 F.2d 630, 631 (D.C.Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Ford\u2019s \u201cMotion for the Court to Take Judicial Notice,\u201d like his direct appeal, seeks to challenge his conviction and sentence. Because of the possibility that disposition of the direct appeal may render the motion moot, the District Court properly refrained from adjudicating the motion. <em>See Feldman v. Henman, </em>815 F.2d 1318, 1320-21 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>a \u201cDistrict Court should not entertain a habeas corpus petition while there is an appeal pending in [the court of appeals] ... [because] disposition of the appeal may-render the [habeas corpus writ] unnecessary.\u201d). Moreover, even if the District Court is not jurisdictionally barred from acting upon the motion, we cannot say that this case presents the type of extraordinary circumstance that would warrant simultaneous review.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Because this appeal presents us with no substantial question, <em>see </em>I.O.P. 10.6, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. Although we have recognized exceptions to this rule, none apply here. <em>See Mary Ann Pensiero, Inc. v. Lingle, </em>847 F.2d 90, 97 (3d Cir.1988) (noting that \u201c[t]he district court retains jurisdiction [after the filing of a notice of appeal] ... to issue orders staying, modifying or granting injunctions, to direct the filing of supersedeas bonds, and to issue orders affecting the record on appeal, the granting of bail, and matters of a similar nature.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
