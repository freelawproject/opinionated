Shimer, an attorney proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a writ of mandamus compelling a district judge to disqualify himself and vacating certain of the District Court\u2019s orders. For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Shimer is a defendant in a civil action currently pending before the Honorable Robert B. Kugler. That action was brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and involves an alleged \u201cmulti-million dollar commodity futures fraud\u201d in which the CFTC alleges that Shimer participated. (Am. Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 2, 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Shimer twice moved for summary judgment on the CFTC\u2019s claims, and the CFTC in turn moved for summary judgment on certain of those claims. Judge Kugler denied both of Shimer\u2019s motions and granted the CFTC\u2019s motion in part. Shimer then moved to disqualify Judge Kugler and, while that motion was pending, filed the instant petition. Judge Kugler has since denied the disqualification motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">A. Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Shimer requests that we order this case reassigned to a different district judge, either because Judge Kugler\u2019s disqualification is required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) or through exercise of our supervisory authority. Although this issue comes before us on a petition for a writ of mandamus, we review Judge Kugler\u2019s denial of the disqualification motion for abuse of discretion, which we will find only if Judge Kugler has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d obligation to disqualify himself. <em>See In re Kensington Int\u2019l Ltd., </em>368 F.3d 289, 300-01 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">We agree with Judge Kugler that he had no such obligation here. Section 455(a) requires judges to disqualify themselves when their \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Shimer does not rely on any extra-judicial partiality (i.e., one arising from something other than events occurring during judicial proceedings).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Instead, Shimer argues that certain of Judge Kugler\u2019s rulings and remarks call his impartiality into question. Shimer must show that those rulings and remarks \u201cdisplay a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">Shimer devotes the majority of his petition to arguing merely that Judge Kugler\u2019s summary judgment rulings might reflect partiality because they are legally erroneous. But \u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion\u201d and \u201conly in the rarest circumstances evidence the degree of favoritism or antagonism required\u201d for disqualification. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147. We express no opinion on the merits of Judge Kugler\u2019s rulings, but we detect no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>such favoritism or antagonism here. As we have explained, \u201c[disqualification is not an appropriate remedy for disagreement over a legal ruling. In the event [Judge Kugler\u2019s] rulings may be in error, they are subject to review on appeal.\u201d <em>In re TMI Litig., </em>193 F.3d 613, 728-29 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Shimer also relies on the following circumstances. In his opinion denying Shim-er\u2019s first motion for summary judgment, Judge Kugler notes that \u201c [defendants spend over 170 pages of briefing belaboring [a legal issue] in what can only be characterized as an abuse of the judicial process\u201d and that Shimer\u2019s own 92-page brief (which the judge nevertheless allowed) exceeded the local page limitation. (Oct. 4, 2005 Op. at 4 n. 2.) Judge Kugler later allowed the CFTC to file a brief in excess of the page limitation but denied Shimer\u2019s request to exceed the page limitation in his opposing brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">These circumstances do not evidence the kind of \u201cdeep-seated favoritism or antagonism\u201d necessary to require Judge Kugler\u2019s disqualification. Judge Kugler\u2019s isolated remark about defendants\u2019 excessive briefing does not reflect any partiality. <em>See Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147 (\u201c[J]udicial remarks ... that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.\u201d); <em>In re TMI Litig., </em>193 F.3d at 728-29 (allegedly \u201chostile rebukes of counsel by the court\u201d held insufficient to require disqualification). Nor are we persuaded that Judge Kugler\u2019s refusal to allow Shimer to once again exceed a page limitation reflects any partiality. Thus, Judge Kugler\u2019s refusal to disqualify himself was not an abuse of discretion, and we will not exercise our supervisory authority to order the reassignment of this case to a different district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">B. Vacation of Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">Shimer also requests that, whether or not we order this case reassigned to a different district judge, we vacate certain of Judge Kugler\u2019s summary judgment orders and remand those matters for reconsideration. Shimer further requests that we vacate, pending such reconsideration, an order requiring him to produce certain tax returns because it is dependant on his status as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">We decline to do so. Mandamus is \u201can extraordinary remedy\u201d that we have discretion to award only when, among other things, a petitioner has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief sought.\u201d <em>In re Pressman-Gutman Co., </em>459 F.3d 383, 398-99 (3d Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Even if Judge Kugler\u2019s rulings were legally erroneous, which we do not decide, Shimer has not alleged any reason why an appeal in the ordinary course would be inadequate to correct those errors or otherwise protect his rights. <em>See Commc\u2019n Workers v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>932 F.2d 199, 210, 213 (3d Cir.1991) (denying mandamus petition premised on denial of summary judgment because appeal represented adequate remedy).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\">. Shimer has moved to supplement his petition, and we grant that motion. Vincent J. Firth, one of Shimer's co-defendants in the District Court, has moved to join in Shimer\u2019s petition. Because we are denying the petition, we deny Firth\u2019s motion as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-16\">. Shimer alleges that Judge Kugler <em>\"may </em>harbor\u201d a prejudice \u201cagainst <em>pro se </em>defendants generally\u201d or <em>\u201cmay </em>simply assume\u201d the accuracy of a federal agency\u2019s assertions, but these facially speculative allegations do not form the basis of his petition. (Mandamus Pet. at 2) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">. Shimer argues that Judge Kugler\u2019s denial of his summary judgment motions denied him the right to be \u201ceffectively heard\u201d and that <em>Communication Workers </em>is inapposite because Judge Kugler's grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the CFTC means that Shimer cannot proceed to trial on those claims. Once again, however, Shimer has not alleged anything that cannot be redressed, if warranted, by an appeal in the ordinary course.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
