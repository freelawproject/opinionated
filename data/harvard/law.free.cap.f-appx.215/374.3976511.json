Evans, now federal prisoner #27502-044, of drug-trafficking offenses in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, and Evans was sentenced to concurrent 325-month prison terms. He subsequently filed an unsuccessful 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate and an unsuccessful second postconviction application in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-25\">In 2006, Evans filed the instant pro se habeas petition in the Northern District of</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Texas, purportedly pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court dismissed the petition, probably, although not certainly, after characterizing it as falling under \u00a7 2255. On appeal, Evans argues that the court didn\u2019t, but should\u2019ve, characterized his petition as falling under \u00a7 2255. In any event, because Evans was collaterally attacking his federal sentence, rather than the manner in which it was executed, the district court should have construed his petition as under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Evans contends that the district court then should have transferred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the recharacterized \u00a7 2255 petition to a court that had jurisdiction, presumably the district court for the Eastern District of Missouri, such a transfer would not have been \u201cin the interest of justice,\u201d <em>id., </em>given that Evans first would have to obtain authorization from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the Eastern District of Missouri. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1631, 2255, 2244(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">. There is one limited exception. \u201c[A] \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 [as a \u00a7 2241 petition] if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426. Evans has made no contention that his petition should have been entertained under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, and, in any event, such a contention seems meritless, <em>see Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381-82 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-23\">. That section mandates transfer of a civil case to the proper venue when the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction if it is in \"the interest of justice.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether the court below dismissed Evans\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction, but it should have because a \u00a7 2255 motion must be brought in the district of conviction and sentence. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
