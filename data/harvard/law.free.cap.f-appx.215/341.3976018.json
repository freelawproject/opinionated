The plaintiff was awarded $23,357.30 in damages and $129,805.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-22\">We review the District Court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Saizan v. Delta Concrete Prods. Co., </em>448 F.3d 795, 800 (5th Cir.2006). There is a strong presumption that the lodestar award established by the district court is the reasonable fee. <em>Heidtman v. County of El Paso, </em>171 F.3d 1038, 1044 (5th Cir.1999). The defendants have raised no arguments sufficient to overcome this presumption. We do not consider the defendants\u2019 arguments based on alleged faulty billing records because they were not raised in the district court. The district court considered the degree of success obtained by Howe on her claims in its reduction of the requested fee for time related to her unsuccessful attempt to pursue the case as a collective action. The failure of Howe to recover overtime pay for every overtime hour originally claimed does not require a reduction of the lodestar award. <em>Singer v. City of Waco, </em>324 F.3d 813, 829-830 (5th Cir. 2003). Finally, based on our review of the record presented to the district court, the court did not clearly err in concluding that the balance of the hours and fees requested by Howe\u2019s attorneys were reasonable and necessary to the pursuit of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>F.L.S.A. claim, particularly noting the length of time it took to bring the case to trial. Given the nature of claims under the F.L.S.A., it is not uncommon that attorney fee requests can exceed the amount of judgment in the case by many multiples. See <em>Fegley v. Higgins, </em>19 F.3d 1126, 1134-35 (6th Cir.l994)(Affirming award of $7,680 in overtime compensation and $40,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees.); <em>Cox v. Brookshire Grocery Co., </em>919 F.2d 354, 358 (5th Cir.l990)(Affirming award or $1,181 in overtime compensation and $9,250 in attorneys\u2019 fees.); <em>Bonnette v. Cal. Health &amp; Welfare, </em>704 F.2d 1465, 1473 (9th Cir.l983)(Affirming award of $18,455 in damages and $100,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees.). The district court was in the best position with its superior understanding of the litigation to judge the appropriateness of the fee award. <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
