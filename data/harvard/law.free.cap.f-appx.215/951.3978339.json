Complainants traveled from Puerto Rico to the State of Georgia in September 2003 to work for Booth Farms under a contract approved by the United States Department of Labor. Complainants allege that Booth Farms discriminated against them and terminated their employment. Larry Booth (\u201cBooth\u201d) responded to the complainants\u2019 allegations with a <em>pro se </em>letter, indicating a general denial on behalf of his company, Booth Farms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">After reviewing the record, including the final order on summary disposition entered on June 28, 2006, as well as all subsidiary orders entered in this cause, and the petitioners\u2019 brief, we conclude that the reasons Booth gave for terminating petitioners were not a pretext for discrimination. It is evident to us from the record that Booth terminated the complainants\u2019 employment due to poor performance. Specifically, the Puerto Rican petitioners were not as productive as the Mexican workers. Because petitioners have failed to demonstrate that Booth\u2019s reasons for terminating them were pretextual, or otherwise demonstrated that he acted with the intent to discriminate against them on the basis of their citizenship status, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-9\">. We also observe from the record that respondents, for whatever reason, did not file a brief in response to the petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
