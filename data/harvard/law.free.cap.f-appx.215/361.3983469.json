He argues that (1) his Massachusetts conviction for indecent assault and battery of a minor was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) (2004) and (2) the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-21\">We hold that Castillo\u2019s violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, \u00a7 13B constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d as that term is commonly understood, for purposes of the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d sentencing enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). We further hold that the waiver provision contained in Castillo\u2019s plea agreement is construed against the Government as the drafter. <em>See United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1997). Because Castillo\u2019s plea agreement does not specifically waive the right to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b), we conclude that the waiver provision does not preclude this appeal. <em>See id. </em>Because Castillo would be entitled to a lesser sentence if his constitutional challenge were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>successful, he has standing. <em>See Henderson v. Stalder, </em>287 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Nevertheless, Castillo\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 </em>U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Castillo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendy </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Castillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
