He argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to properly weigh the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a term of imprisonment greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">Faulk\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guideline range and is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Giving \u201cgreat deference\u201d to such a sentence, and recognizing that the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that Faulk has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
