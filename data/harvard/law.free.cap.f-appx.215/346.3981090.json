Kundra contends the district court: erred in construing his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b) to consider his petition, and violated his due-process and equal-protection rights by construing his petition under \u00a7 2241. (Kundra\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Santana v. Chandler, </em>961 F.2d 514, 516-17 (5th Cir. 1992).)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">Kundra has <em>not </em>shown the district court erred in dismissing his petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006). When he filed his petition, Kundra had <em>not </em>exhausted his administrative remedies, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d). Kundra has <em>not </em>cited any authority stating the district court had jurisdiction: to issue orders to an IJ during ongoing immigration proceedings; or under \u00a7 636(b). Kundra also failed to demonstrate mandamus was appropriate; he did <em>not </em>show he had a clear right to relief, that there was any clear duty to act, or that he had no other adequate remedy. <em>See Jones v. Alexander, </em>609 F.2d 778, 781 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>449 U.S. 832, 101 S.Ct. 100, 66 L.Ed.2d 37 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-20\">To the extent Kundra seeks to raise a claim pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), he may not raise a new claim on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir. 1999), <em>cert, denied, </em>528 U.S. 1138, 120 S.Ct. 982,145 L.Ed.2d 932 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
