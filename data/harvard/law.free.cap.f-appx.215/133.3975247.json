Bax was sentenced to serve 286 months of imprisonment under the career offender guidelines. Bax\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed by this Court in 1994. In 1997, Bax filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. This motion was denied, as was Bax\u2019s application to this Court for a certificate of appealability. Bax thereafter filed an unsuccessful motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A)(i). Subsequently, Bax applied to this Court for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, but this application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>In his current \u00a7 2241 petition, Bax argues that his conviction and sentence violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. The District Court dismissed Bax\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that it constituted a collateral attack upon the legality of his sentence, and that Bax\u2019s inability to bring a subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion did not make that remedy \u201cineffective or inadequate\u201d to test the legality of his detention. On appeal, Bax contends that the \u00a7 2255 \u201csafety valve\u201d should apply to him because he is \u201cactually innoc[ent] of the elements needed to subject him to the substantial career offender enhancement____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because there is no substantial question on appeal, the District Court\u2019s order will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Motions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u201care the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences that are allegedly in violation of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). Unless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241 cannot be entertained by the court. <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because a petitioner is unable to meet its stringent gatekeeping requirements. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). Rather, the \u201csafety-valve\u201d provided under \u00a7 2255 is extremely narrow, and has been held to apply in unusual situations, such as those in which a prisoner has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal by an intervening change in law. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Bax\u2019s claims fall within the purview of \u00a7 2255 because they challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence. We agree with the District Court that Bax has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2255 is an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d remedy under the circumstances presented here. This is not a situation where Bax has had no prior opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime later deemed to be non-criminal. Indeed, Bax has already challenged \u2014 albeit unsuccessfully \u2014 being sentenced as a career offender in his prior \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, we need not reach the question of whether a prisoner can be actually innocent of being a career offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">For these reasons, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it could not entertain Bax\u2019s petition. We also conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bax\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We will, therefore, summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
