We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-25\">Figueroa was arrested after a high-speed chase following a bank robbery. He was prosecuted in a Texas state proceeding for various offenses related to the robbery and was sentenced to fifty years\u2019 imprisonment. He was subsequently indicted in federal court for the primary offense of bank robbery and pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-26\">Based on the presentence report, the court found that Figueroa\u2019s offense level was 29 and his criminal history score was VI, yielding a guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government moved for an upward departure based on several uncharged offenses, and Figueroa moved for a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b), to account for the 15 months he had already spent in state custody for the related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The court departed upward and sentenced him to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment to be served concurrently with his state sentence. The departure was based on his use of an illegal weapon and stolen vehicle in the commission of the offense. The court did not address Figueroa\u2019s \u00a7 5G1.3(b) request at sentencing or in its Judgment in a Criminal Case Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we continue to review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Medina-Argueta, </em>454 F.3d 479, 481 (5th Cir.2006). Before imposing a non-guideline sentence, a court must consider the guidelines. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). This consideration requires that the court calculate the appropriate guideline range. <em>Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707. The court must justify a departure from the guidelines, and \u201cthe farther a sentence varies from the applicable Guideline sentence, the more compelling the justification ... must be.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">At issue is whether the district court properly followed the guidelines\u2019 requirement that Figueroa be credited with the time he served on his related state conviction before being sentenced in federal court. The guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(1), state that if a defendant has a term of imprisonment resulting from a related offense, \u201cthe court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The commentary elaborates on the appropriate application of this guideline and provides an example. The court should first determine the appropriate sentence according to the guideline range. If credit is due for time already served on a related state charge, that time is then subtracted from the sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 comment. (n.2(D)). If time is credited under this section, it should be noted on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 comment. (n.2(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">We have held, in a <em>pre-Booker </em>case, that the application of \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is mandatory. <em>See United States v. Rangel, </em>319 F.3d 710, 714 (5th Cir.2003). Although <em>Booker </em>provides sentencing judges flexibility to depart from the guideline range, it does not allow them to bypass a provision of the guidelines, which still provide an anchor for our evaluation of a sentence\u2019s reasonableness. <em>Booker </em>does not nullify \u00a7 5G1.3(b), and when that section applies, sentencing judges must include its dictates in the calculation of the proper guideline sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">The government argues that the court actually did grant Figueroa\u2019s request for a downward departure and that the ultimate sentence reflects that departure. It bases its position on the court\u2019s statement, at sentencing, that it would \u201cabide by the mandate of the guideline range.\u201d Accordingly, the government posits that the district court decided to depart upwardly to 255 months before subtracting 15 months for the time already served, to reach an ultimate sentence of 240 months, and that the court did so without explaining its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>reasoning at sentencing or in the Judgment Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the government\u2019s characterization is accurate, the court did not acknowledge \u00a7 5G1.3(b) in its sentencing calculations. Accordingly, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing. We express no opinion on what sentence the district court should impose on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. We need not, and do not, consider whether sentencing courts must, under <em>Booker, </em>follow \u00a7 5G1.3(b) and subtract the time served. We conclude only that courts must include the calculation required by this section when determining the proper guideline sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
