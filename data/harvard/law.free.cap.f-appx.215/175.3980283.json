We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-18\">On July 22, 1992, following a bench trial, Davenport was convicted in state court of second degree murder, rape, and theft. Davenport worked as a bouncer at Ted\u2019s High Spot at 58th and Chester Avenue in Philadelphia and he reported to work on the evening of October 21, 1990.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During his shift, Davenport bought a drink for the victim, Theresa Dickerson, at her request. Davenport\u2019s live-in girlfriend, Lisa Sharp, witnessed the exchange and argued with Davenport about it, eventually telling him their relationship was over. Throughout the evening, Davenport consumed two six-packs of beer, some liquor shots, and crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-19\">Around 2:30 or 3:00 a.m., Davenport left Ted\u2019s High Spot, bought some crack caps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and went home. After realizing he was locked out of his apartment, Davenport wandered the streets to find Sharp, who had the key. At 55th and Chester Avenue, Davenport ran into Dickerson. Dickerson told the defendant she wanted to smoke the caps. Davenport purchased additional crack caps and the two proceeded to a playground at 59th and Chester Avenue to smoke the crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The defendant began to have intercourse with Dickerson, as part of a deal made in exchange for his crack. Dickerson screamed at Davenport to stop, claiming he was being too rough, and punched him when he would not stop. Dickerson called out for her boyfriend, Crest, for help. This provoked Davenport, who started choking Dickerson, while laying on top of her, to stop her from screaming. At one point, Davenport stopped choking Dickerson, and she began to breathe again. But he then resumed choking her until she was no longer moving. Davenport stayed with the victim for over an hour and watched her die.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Upon returning home around 6:30 a.m., Davenport told Sharp he had killed somebody. After Sharp claimed she did not believe him, he brought her to the playground to show her Dickerson\u2019s body. When they returned home, Davenport showed Sharp the victim\u2019s purse and told her he had continued choking Dickerson because he was afraid she would have called the police if he did not kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Police found Dickerson\u2019s body on the afternoon of October 22, 1990, and she was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:40 p.m. The Assistant Medical Examiner testified the cause of death was manual strangulation, which could have been caused by \u201capplying the hands, and then loosening them, then reapplying, then loosening again.\u201d After being arrested for Dickerson\u2019s murder, Davenport signed a written confession to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">During the bench trial in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, Davenport testified he choked Dickerson to death. For the first time, he claimed he acted in self-defense because she had stabbed him before he started to strangle her. He testified he strangled her once, paused, then started choking her again. During the trial, defense counsel cross-examined the witnesses. In his closing argument, defense counsel told the court, \u201c[t]here is no doubt you have a murder here,\u201d and went on to assert a third degree diminished capacity defense. The judge found Davenport guilty of second degree murder, rape, and theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">On March 14, 1994, the trial court denied Davenport\u2019s Motion for a New Trial and sentenced him to life imprisonment for second degree murder, and concurrent sentences of ten to twenty years for rape and eleven-and-a-half to twenty-three months for receiving stolen property. Davenport appealed his conviction to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, alleging, among other things, ineffective assistance of counsel for conceding the offense of murder. The Superior Court found defense counsel had consulted with Davenport about the diminished capacity defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Commw. v. Davenport, </em>444 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Pa.Super. 674, 663 A.2d 246 (1995) (\u201cThe record evidence discloses that appellant\u2019s trial counsel testified at the post-verdict hearing that he and appellant discussed the defense of murder by diminished capacity, and that in preparation for this defense, appellant submitted to a psychiatric evaluation. Our review of the record demonstrates that the trial court properly credited the testimony of trial counsel and rejected appellant\u2019s argument.\u201d). On April 11, 1995, the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence, finding Davenport\u2019s ineffectiveness claim regarding the murder concession without merit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied review on October 2, 1995. <em>Commw. v. Davenport, </em>542 Pa. 641, 666 A.2d 1051 (1995). Davenport filed a pro se Motion for Post Conviction Collateral Relief on April 1, 1996, which was dismissed by the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas on November 6, 1997. <em>Commw. v. Davenport, </em>No. 9103-1442-1446 (Phila. County Ct. C.P. Feb. 5, 1998) (opinion dismissing PCRA petition). The Pennsylvania Superior Court denied his appeal on October 28, 1997, finding no merit to the ineffectiveness claim because \u201cDavenport\u2019s trial counsel testified that he urged Davenport to take the diminished capacity defense in light of the overwhelming evidence, and Davenport agreed to do so.\u201d <em>Commw. v. Davenport, </em>No. 4958, 734 A.2d 433 (Pa.Super.Ct. Nov. 17, 1998) (opinion dismissing PCRA petition). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied Davenport\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal on April 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Davenport, pro se, filed a timely petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in federal court on March 17, 2000, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. On June 26, 2000, the District Court issued an Order allowing Davenport an additional 120 days to file an all-inclusive petition; Davenport submitted the new petition on October 13, 2000. On January 9, 2002, the District Court ordered counsel appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The District Court adopted the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on April 14, 2005, denying Davenport\u2019s petition. <em>Davenport v. Vaughn, </em>No. 00-5316, 2005 WL 856912, *12 (E.D.Pa. April 14, 2005). The District Court found Davenport\u2019s trial counsel had communicated with Davenport about the diminished capacity defense. <em>Id. </em>at *11. (\u201c[T]hroughout the hearing Mr. Giampietro made it clear that Mr. Davenport was informed of his options and involved in the decisionmaking process.\u201d). The District Court held Davenport\u2019s ineffectiveness of counsel claim on the diminished capacity defense \u201centirely without merit\u201d based on the state courts\u2019 conclusions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that defense counsel\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>mony should be credited, and further that Davenport had not rebutted this presumption by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Weeks v. Snyder, </em>219 F.3d 245, 258 (3d Cir.2000); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Davenport timely appealed and we granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u201cthat counsel was ineffective for arguing diminished capacity without consent.\u201d Our review is plenary. <em>See Duncan v. Morton, </em>256 F.3d 189, 196 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cThis court applies a plenary standard of review when a district court dismisses a habeas petition based on a review of the state court record and does not hold an evidentiary hearing....\u201d). With respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court, we may grant relief only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Davenport contends trial counsel\u2019s representation of him was ineffective because Davenport did not consent to a diminished capacity defense, which required a concession of guilt. To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland, </em>Davenport must demonstrate his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by this deficiency. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). That is, he must prove counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">In conducting a habeas analysis, we must afford state courts\u2019 factual findings a presumption of correctness, which the petitioner can overcome only by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>see also Weeks, </em>219 F.3d at 259 (\u201c[An] implicit factual finding is due the same highly [deferential] presumption of correctness required by \u00a7 2254(e)____\u201d). This presumption applies to the factual determinations of both state trial and appellate courts. <em>Dickerson v. Vaughn, </em>90 F.3d 87, 90 (3d Cir.1996). Even if a petitioner can rebut a state court\u2019s finding of fact by clear and convincing evidence, we will only grant habeas relief if the state court\u2019s factual finding was \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2); <em>see also Campbell v. Vaughn, </em>209 F.3d 280, 290 (3d Cir.2000) (holding habeas relief unwarranted when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>trial court credits trial counsel\u2019s testimony and discounts the defendant\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The state trial and appellate courts on direct review implicitly found Davenport had consented to his trial counsel\u2019s use of the diminished capacity defense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both courts credited defense counsel\u2019s testimony at the post-verdict evidentiary hearing conducted on March 1, 1994. The trial court noted defense counsel \u201chad told the defendant that he was seeking a conviction for Third Degree Murder based on diminished capacity. In furtherance of the defense, he had Dr. Allen Tepper examine the defendant.\u201d <em>Commw. v. Davenport, </em>No. 1442-46 (Phila. County Ct. C.P. March 1, 1994). The Pennsylvania Superior Court on direct review similarly determined that trial counsel had discussed this course of action with the defendant, and the defendant had agreed to it by seeing Dr. Tepper. <em>Davenport, </em>444 Pa.Super. 674, 663 A.2d 246 (1995). The Pennsylvania Superior Court held this ineffectiveness claim meritless because \u201cthe trial court properly credited the testimony of trial counsel and rejected appellant\u2019s argument\u201d that he had not consented to the diminished capacity defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Davenport contends defense counsel did not explain the diminished capacity defense, nor did Davenport consent to a concession of guilt in the course of pleading this defense. A finding that Davenport agreed to the diminished capacity trial strategy would negate any claim of counsel\u2019s deficient performance. Although the state courts on direct appeal did not make an express finding that Davenport had consented to defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy, the courts did credit his testimony, in which he stated they had discussed the strategy, and not Davenport\u2019s testimony, in which he stated they had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">We must apply a presumption of correctness to state courts\u2019 implicit factual findings. <em>See Weeks, </em>219 F.3d at 258. The District Court did not find Davenport had met his burden to rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence, and we agree. <em>Davenport, </em>2005 WL 856912, at *11. The trial court\u2019s implicit fact-finding in its denial of a Motion for New Trial, based on a credibility determination of witnesses observed by the trial court judge, was not unreasonable in light of the evidence presented. <em>See, e.g., Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 339-340, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 434, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Even if Davenport did not explicitly consent to trial counsel\u2019s pursuit of the diminished capacity defense or the concession of guilt during his closing argument, we do not find defense counsel\u2019s performance deficient. To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioners must overcome the \u201cpresumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 5. Ct. 2052. Petitioners may rebut this presumption by \u201cshowing that no sound strategy posited by the [government] could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>have supported the conduct.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Varner, </em>428 F.3d 491, 500 (3d Cir.2005). Counsel\u2019s failure to obtain express consent from his client to pursue a strategy that includes a concession of guilt is not deficient performance per se. <em>See Florida v. Nixon, </em>543 U.S. 175, 188, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004). The Court in <em>Nixon </em>held \u201ccounsel\u2019s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant\u2019s explicit consent,\u201d as long as counsel informed the defendant of the strategy before he proceeded and it satisfied the <em>Strickland </em>standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 192, 125 S.Ct. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">To support finding counsel\u2019s performance deficient for not obtaining express consent to concede guilt, Davenport relies on <em>Brookhart v. Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1, 6-7, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966), which held counsel must obtain his client\u2019s express consent to enter a guilty plea on the Ghent\u2019s behalf. But in <em>Nixon, </em>the Court found conceding guilt during a closing or opening statement did not amount to the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, thereby distinguishing <em>Brookhart, </em>because the defendant \u201cretained all the rights accorded a defendant during a criminal trial.... \u201d <em>Commw. v. Cousin, </em>585 Pa. 287, 888 A.2d 710, 721 (2005); <em>see also Nixon, </em>543 U.S. at 186-89, 125 S.Ct. 551 (\u201cIn contrast to <em>Brookhart, </em>there was in Nixon\u2019s case no \u2018truncated\u2019 proceeding ... shorn of the need to persuade the trier \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 and of the defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.\u201d) (quoting <em>Brookhart, </em>384 U.S. at 5-6, 86 S.Ct. 1245) (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Here, defense counsel pursued a reasoned trial strategy in light of the evidence available, which included Davenport\u2019s written confession to police that he killed Dickerson. The only defense strategies available to reduce the murder charge to third degree were self defense and diminished capacity. Davenport contends he had wanted to pursue self defense at trial, but defense counsel testified he had not believed that to be a viable strategy and had told Davenport so. In his trial testimony, Davenport admitted killing Dickerson, but claimed she stabbed him first and, accordingly, contended his actions were in self-defense. Davenport did not mention the stabbing in his signed police statement, nor did his girlfriend testify to any injury to Davenport beyond scratches when recounting the night in question. Although a knife was recovered from the scene, no forensic evidence connected the knife to Davenport\u2019s alleged injury. No evidence corroborates a heat of passion defense, besides Davenport\u2019s contentions on the stand. No state court found this defense had any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">The state courts determined defense counsel had a reasonable basis for not pursuing this defense. <em>See, e.g., Davenport, </em>No. 4958, 734 A.2d 433 (Pa.Super.Ct.1998) (opinion dismissing PCRA petition). We agree with this assessment. Accordingly, the diminished capacity defense was the only other defense available to obtain the lowest possible punishment, and the trial court found \u201ctrial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>argued strenuously [for it] during closing arguments.\u201d <em>Davenport, </em>No. 1442-46 (Phila. County Ct. C.P. March 1, 1994). We find defense counsel\u2019s pursuit of a diminished capacity defense was sound trial strategy and not deficient performance under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">To prevail under <em>Strickland, </em>a petitioner must prove prejudice in addition to deficiency. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Davenport contends we should evaluate this case under <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), instead of <em>Strickland. </em>In <em>Cronic, </em>the Court identified a narrow exception to the application of <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice requirement when defense counsel completely fails to engage in the adversarial process. <em>Id. </em>at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039; <em>see also Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 697, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). In these situations, counsel\u2019s strategy is \u201cso likely to prejudice the accused\u201d that prejudice is presumed. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Supreme Court has identified three situations in which courts should apply the <em>Cronic </em>standard of presumed prejudice. The first is when there is a \u201c\u2018complete denial of counsel\u2019 \u201d at a critical stage in the trial proceedings. <em>Bell, </em>535 U.S. at 695-96, 122 S.Ct. 1843 (quoting <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039). Second are situations in which a petitioner is represented by counsel at trial, but counsel \u201centirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And third, situations at trial where counsel could not render competent assistance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Davenport contends the second situation applies, and \u201c[t]rial counsel failed to subject the state\u2019s case to any real adversarial testing.\u201d But the Court in <em>Bell </em>held if counsel only fails to challenge the prosecution\u2019s case at specific points, to further a reasonable trial strategy, and not in its entirety, then <em>Cronic </em>does not apply. <em>Bell, </em>535 U.S. at 697, 122 S.Ct. 1843; <em>see also Haynes v. Cain, </em>298 F.3d 375, 380-81 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201c[W]hen counsel fails to oppose the prosecution\u2019s case at specific points or concedes certain elements of a case to focus on others, he has made a tactical decision ... [and] has not abandoned his or her client by entirely failing to challenge the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d). \u201cCrome is reserved only for those extreme cases in which counsel fails to present any defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381. In <em>Nixon, </em>the Court held <em>Strickland </em>applied to the situation in which counsel made a strategic choice to concede defendant\u2019s guilt in consideration of the best outcome in the penalty phase. <em>Nixon, </em>543 U.S. at 190-91, 125 S.Ct. 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Davenport\u2019s trial counsel did not fail to subject the government\u2019s case to adversarial testing, but rather pursued the only defense strategy he believed was available to obtain a more favorable trial outcome for his client. He acknowledged Davenport\u2019s guilt in the closing statement as part of the diminished capacity defense only after viewing the evidence presented at trial, including Davenport\u2019s concession in his signed police statement and trial testimony, and subjecting the government\u2019s witnesses to cross-examination. Accordingly, <em>Strickland, </em>and not <em>Cronic, </em>was the correct standard to apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The Pennsylvania Superior Court, in its PCRA opinion, found counsel\u2019s concession did not prejudice the defendant because he \u201chad maintained throughout the entire trial that he had committed the acts for which he was charged.\u201d <em>Davenport, </em>No. 4958, 734 A.2d 433 (Pa.Super.Ct. Nov. 17, 1998) (opinion dismissing PCRA petition); <em>see Basden v. Lee, </em>290 F.3d 602, 616 (4th Cir.2002) (finding no prejudice under</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>Strickland </em>for counsel\u2019s concession of defendant\u2019s guilt due to defendant\u2019s \u201cfull, voluntary, and detailed pretrial confession\u201d). We do not find this unreasonable. Davenport confessed to strangling the victim and watching her die in both his signed police statement and his trial court testimony, and the medical examiner\u2019s testimony corroborated this cause of death. In light of this evidence, the state court reasonably found Davenport had failed to establish that without the concession strategy, the trial\u2019s outcome would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment, denying Davenport\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\">. The following narrative is derived from the trial testimony of Davenport and Sharp, and Davenport\u2019s statement to police after his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-8\">. Defense counsel testified at the post-verdict hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">I told [Davenport] that due to the nature of the statement [to police] and what was contained in the statement, that I believed diminished capacity might be a potential way he could go with this particular case. He indicated to me that was basically something he would consider. As a matter of fact, I had Doctor Tepper go examine him concerning that, and he spoke to Doctor Tepper up in the cell room upstairs.... What we kept going back to was \u2014 and you have to take this in the context, Judge, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>got on the stand and admitted he killed the woman, basically, in this courtroom.... Voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter were not in this case, in my opinion.... I was seeking a conviction for third degree murder due to the diminished capacity. And had I discussed it with him prior to that? Yes, I had. I sat there and I said to him, prior to standing up and making an argument, this is how I'm going to argue it.... I also told him I thought the best way to go was this diminished capacity. I thought it was the only potential way out in this particular case was the third degree murder conviction so he could potentially get out of jail. And that\u2019s what I told him, and that\u2019s the way I proceeded.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">.

Davenport raised the ineffectiveness claim on diminished capacity on direct and PCRA review. The Pennsylvania Superior Court (direct appeal) noted one of the questions Davenport submitted for review was \u201cwhether trial defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in conceding that the offense was murder, where appellant's trial testimony, and his pretrial statement, would raise an issue of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>Davenport, </em>444 Pa.Super. 674, 663 A.2d 246 (1995).

Davenport attempts to distinguish <em>Nixon </em>on the basis that his case was not death penalty-certified, and it was commonly known Judge Richette, the trial court judge, did not give the death penalty.
