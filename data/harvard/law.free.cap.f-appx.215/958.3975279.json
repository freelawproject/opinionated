On appeal, Brown argues that his 260-month sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Specifically, Brown argues that the catastrophic nature of his medical condition, namely, his quadriplegia, outweighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In addition, Brown maintains that there was an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and the sentence of his co-conspirator who was the leader of the drug trafficking organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-20\">We have held that \u201c[i]n reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir. 2006) (brackets in original) (citation omitted). In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the district court should be guided by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Section 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>provides that district courts must consider, among other things: (1) the applicable guideline range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (5) the need for adequate deterrence; (6) protection of the public; and (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Although the district court must be guided by these factors, we have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006). We will not substitute the district court\u2019s judgment in weighing the factors unless \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The record before us amply demonstrates that the district court adequately and properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and that the sentence it imposed was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. The 260-month sentence was reasonable for several reasons. First, the court explicitly considered and evaluated many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including (1) Brown\u2019s history and characteristics; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence of criminal conduct; and (5) the need to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Second, although Brown suggests that the district court did not properly weigh the sentencing factors, we have no trouble concluding that the district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in applying the factors. We note that the court granted a substantial downward variance after weighing the mitigating factors, including the seriousness of Brown\u2019s medical condition, against the aggravating factors, such as the seriousness of Brown\u2019s offense, his criminal record, and his commission of another drug crime after he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Finally, Brown\u2019s assertion that his sentence created an unwarranted sentencing disparity is without merit because the district court explained that the disparity between Brown\u2019s and his co-conspirator\u2019s sentences resulted from Brown\u2019s more serious prior criminal history. Moreover, Brown\u2019s 260-month sentence was significantly less than the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that Brown has failed to carry his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable. His 260-month sentence is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
