He was sentenced to fifteen years of incarceration by the United States Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>trict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Schweitzer filed a motion for entry of judgment of acquittal that was denied by the District Court. We affirmed. C.A. No. 85-1665. Thereafter, Schweitzer filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 that was denied on October 26, 1988. On October 7, 2005, Schweitzer filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania arguing that his sentence is unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), challenging the actions that the Parole Commission has taken regarding his sentence, and challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 calculation of his sentence. Schweitzer also sought a writ of error coram nobis, or, alternatively, asserted that he was entitled to relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court denied Schweitzer\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Schweitzer has been granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">A \u00a7 2255 motion filed in the sentencing court is the presumptive means for a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). A \u00a7 2241 petition may not be entertained unless a motion under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. A \u00a7 2255 motion is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the petitioner can not meet the stringent gate keeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, <em>Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120, or because the sentencing court does not grant relief. <em>Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Schweitzer has not demonstrated that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d as to the claim that his sentence is unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Apprendi, Booker, </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>Unlike the intervening law in <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997), the decisions in <em>Apprendi, Booker, </em>and <em>Blakely </em>did not decriminalize the conduct for which Schweitzer was convicted. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21 (\u00a7 2255 not \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d where petitioner sought to raise sentencing claim based on the intervening decision in <em>New Jersey v. Apprendi); see also Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424 (5th Cir.2005) (\u00a7 2241 petition based on the intervening decision in <em>United States v. Booker </em>does not fall within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255). Furthermore, the holdings in <em>Apprendi, Booker, </em>and <em>Blakely </em>are not applicable retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See United States v. Swinton, </em>333 F.3d 481, 491 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608, 613-615 (3d Cir.2005); <em>U.S. v. Price, </em>400 F.3d 844 (10th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the District Court properly concluded that \u00a7 2241 relief was not available as to Schweitzer\u2019s <em>Apprendi, Booker, </em>and <em>Blakely </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Schweitzer also contends that the actions the Parole Commission has taken regarding his sentence are unauthorized because his underlying conviction was void pursuant to <em>Apprendi, Booker, </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>Although this argument may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition, his contention lacks merit. Schweitzer\u2019s sentence has not been declared void. Accordingly, the Parole Commission has exercised, and continues to exercise, lawful jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Schweitzer also asserts that the Bureau of Prisons has failed to properly calculate his sentence as an \u201cold\u201d law sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3568 (repealed). Appellees filed a response with the District Court arguing that the claim should be dismissed because Schweitzer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Ordinarily, federal prisoners are required to exhaust their administrative remedies pri- or to seeking a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Moscato v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>98 F.3d 757 (3d Cir.1996). Schweitzer asserts that he is not required to exhaust his administrative remedies because the Bureau of Prisons is exercising an \u201cincorrect version of statutory authority,\u201d and, thus, any attempt at resolving the issue through administrative remedies would be futile. (Doc. 23, Traverse at 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We disagree with Schweitzer\u2019s characterization of his argument. He is asserting that the Bureau of Prisons calculated his sentence pursuant to the wrong statute, not that the Bureau of Prisons has wrongly interpreted a statute. Bureau of Prisons\u2019 regulations provide a multi-level review process that a federal prisoner may utilize in order to seek formal review of an issue relating to any aspect of his confinement. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.10-542.18. Because the Bureau of Prisons permits administrative review of its sentence calculation and because there is no indication that Schweitzer would be foreclosed from seeking such a review, Schweitzer must exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Finally, Schweitzer\u2019s contentions that he is entitled to a writ of error coram nobis or relief pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) lack merit. A writ of error coram nobis may not be used by a petitioner in custody to circumvent AEDPA\u2019s limitations on second or successive \u00a7 2255 petitions. <em>United States v. Baptiste, </em>223 F.3d 188 (3d Cir.2000). Because Schweitzer seeks to raise new claims collaterally attacking his underlying conviction, his Rule 60(b) motion must be treated as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>Pridgen v. Shannon, </em>380 F.3d 721, 727 (3d Cir.2004). Schweitzer has not sought our permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">. Schweitzer has been paroled several times since his incarceration in 1985; however, his parole has been revoked for various violations. The history of Schweitzer\u2019s incarceration and parole is set forth, at length, in the District Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
