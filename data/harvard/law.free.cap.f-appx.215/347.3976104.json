Turner contends the district court erroneously enhanced his sentence, pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.1(c), for directing and supervising another participant\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-24\">A factual finding that a defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor under \u00a7 3B1.1(c) is reviewed only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 584 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2363, 165 L.Ed.2d 280 (2006). Among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the presentence report stated Turner\u2019s roommate, Guy Wilbanks, served as Turner\u2019s personal assistant in distributing drugs and maintaining Turner\u2019s financial records; and, at sentencing, a police officer gave unrebutted testimony that Wilbanks drove a drug shipment from Phoenix to Dallas at Turner\u2019s direction. Therefore, the district court did <em>not </em>clearly err in imposing the enhancement. <em>E.g., United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 725 (5th Cir.) (upholding a \u00a7 3B1.1(c) two-level enhancement when the district court did not clearly err in finding defendant was an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in a marijuana conspiracy), <em>cert, denied, </em>538 U.S. 1017, 123 S.Ct. 1939, 155 L.Ed.2d 857 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Because the district court did <em>not </em>err in imposing the \u00a7 3B1.1(c) enhancement, we need not reach Turner\u2019s contention that his resulting bottom-of-the-advisory-Guidelines-range sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
