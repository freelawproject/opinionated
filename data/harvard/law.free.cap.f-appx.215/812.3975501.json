The district court granted a certificate of appealability as to \u201cwhether trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient for failing to object to a jury instruction concerning efforts to evade prosecution.\u201d On appeal, Jones argues that his counsel\u2019s failure to rely upon <em>Fenelon v. State, </em>594 So.2d 292 (Fla.1992) (holding that a jury instruction on consciousness of guilt based on evidence of flight was an impermissible judicial comment on the evidence), while objecting to a special jury instruction on subornation of perjury, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Jones argues that he has satisfied the <em>Strickland </em>standard because his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and there is a reasonable probability that preservation of the <em>Fenelon </em>issue would have resulted in a new trial on appeal. He argues that the district court unreasonably applied the <em>Strickland </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. <em>Conklin v. Schofield, </em>366 F.3d 1191, 1199 (11th Cir.2004). Where a claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court, federal courts may not grant habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">As we explained in <em>Putman v. Head, </em>\u201c[t]he \u2018contrary to\u2019 and \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 clauses of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) are separate bases for reviewing a state court\u2019s decisions.\u201d 268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-15\">A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if either (1) the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by Supreme Court case law, or (2) when faced with materially indistinguishable facts, the state court arrived at a result different from that reached in a Supreme Court case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-16\">A state court conducts an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law if it identifies the correct legal rule from Supreme Court case law but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case .... [or] unreasonably extends, or unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>declines to extend, a legal principle from Supreme Court case law to a new context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">In deciding whether the state court applied federal law in an unreasonable manner, we consider whether the state court\u2019s application was objectively unreasonable. <em>Wellington v. Moore, </em>314 F.3d 1256, 1261 (11th Cir.2002). \u201c[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ under the reasonable application clause simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 411 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1522, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">In addition, state courts need not explain their merits rulings to qualify for deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Wright v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1255 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cAll that is required under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is an adjudication on the merits, not a full state court opinion.\u201d <em>Parker v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>331 F.3d 764, 776 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cEven a summary, unexplicated rejection of a federal claim qualifies as an adjudication entitled to deference under \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Herring v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>397 F.3d 1338, 1347 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 171, 163 L.Ed.2d 277 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">When a convicted defendant claims that his counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective, the defendant must show that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. \u201cFor performance to be deficient, it must be established that, in light of all the circumstances, counsel\u2019s performance was outside the wide range of professional competence.\u201d <em>Putman, </em>268 F.3d at 1243. We are highly deferential in reviewing counsel\u2019s performance, and must utilize the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable. <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201c[Bjecause counsel\u2019s conduct is presumed reasonable, for a petitioner to show that the conduct was unreasonable, a petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Under the prejudice prong, the defendant must show \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068. We have noted that in the context of requests for habeas relief predicated upon ineffective assistance of counsel by state prisoners, the petitioner must do more than satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>standard. <em>Rutherford v. Crosby, </em>385 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.2004). The petitioner must also show that the state court \u201capplied <em>Strickland </em>to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 699, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1852, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">We have held that reasonably effective representation does not include a requirement to make arguments based on predictions of how the law might develop. <em>Spaziano v. Singletary, </em>36 F.3d 1028, 1039 (11th Cir.1994). Even if a claim based upon an anticipated change in the law is reasonably available at the time counsel failed to raise it, such failure does not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>See Pitts v. Cook, </em>923 F.2d 1568, 1573-74 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">As an initial matter, the state court decision is entitled to deference under the AEDPA because it was an adjudication on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the merits. Despite the state trial court\u2019s lack of an explanatory opinion, Jones identified <em>Strickland </em>as the controlling law governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the court, and the court acknowledged considering and reviewing Jones\u2019s claims. Thus, the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Moreover, the state trial court\u2019s decision was not an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. The trial transcript shows that Jones\u2019s counsel did object to the special jury instruction. Thus, Jones\u2019s sole contention is that the objection was not specific enough because his trial counsel did not explicitly rely upon the rule in <em>Fenelon. </em>However, Jones admits that no Florida appellate case has extended the <em>Fenelon </em>restriction on jury instructions with respect to evidence of flight to a case that involves evidence of subornation. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the state trial court\u2019s decision was an objectively unreasonable application of <em>Strickland </em>when it found that the failure to argue the <em>Fenelon </em>restriction on jury instructions respecting flight did not constitute ineffective assistance when objecting to a subornation instruction. Therefore, it is unnecessary to address the second prong of <em>Strickland, </em>namely whether Jones\u2019s counsel\u2019s conduct prejudiced his defense, because Jones did not establish that his counsel was deficient under the first prong of <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The state court\u2019s decision denying Jones\u2019s post-conviction motion was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, and the district court did not err in denying habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
