Acosta claims (1) that he was nothing more than an unskilled deck hand, following the directions of his supervisors; (2) he was not going to receive proceeds from the drugs he was transporting; and (3) he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>own the drugs or organize the trip. He argues that the purpose of a mitigating-role reduction is to ensure that low-level participants in the conspiracy do not receive the same sentences as participants \u201chigher up in the criminal pyramid.\u201d He claims that, as the sentence stands, there is no distinction between the crew and \u201cequally responsible\u201d participants, such as the drug owners and managers who manage to evade arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a role reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). The defendant bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to a mitigating role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">To determine whether a minor-role reduction applies, a district court first should measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which the defendant has been held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 940-41. This requires the district court to assess all probative facts of the defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 943. In cases where the defendant is a drug courier, relevant factual considerations include, but are not limited to: (1) the amount of drugs; (2) the fair market value of the drugs; (3) the amount to be paid to the courier; (4) the defendant\u2019s equity interest in the drugs; (5) the defendant\u2019s role in planning the criminal scheme; and (6) the defendant\u2019s role in distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 945. The amount of drugs, in particular, is a material consideration in assessing the defendant\u2019s role, and \u201cmay be dispositive \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Further, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">We agree with the district court that Acosta failed to carry his burden under \u00a7 3B1.2. It is clear that his role in the offense was identical to the conduct for which he was held accountable, and he did not show that he was substantially less capable than other participants involved in the conspiracy. Acosta was held accountable only for the 1,832 kilograms of cocaine that he helped to transport, a substantial amount of drugs. His role was not minor in the relevant conduct of possession and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms of cocaine. Although there was a captain on board that may have played a more significant role, Acosta brought forth no evidence at the sentencing hearing that the other two crew members on board were more involved in the venture than he was. Moreover, the evidence that he presented at sentencing\u2014 that he was a hard-working family man, had no criminal history, and that such criminal conduct was out of character for him \u2014 are irrelevant to his conduct in the instant offense. These sentencing factors were already taken into consideration in determining the reasonableness of Acosta\u2019s sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Since the district court did not clearly err by denying Acosta\u2019s request for a \u00a7 3B1.2 minor-role reduction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-16\">. 46 App. U.S.C., \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
