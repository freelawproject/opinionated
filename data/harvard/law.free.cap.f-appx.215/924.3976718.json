He reported that he was hired only to take a replacement vessel to a malfunctioning vessel that was to transport the drugs, and when he arrived at the location of the malfunctioning vessel, he realized that it could not be repaired, so the crew of the malfunctioning vessel transferred the drugs to the replacement vessel and boarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">On appeal, Micolta first argues that, in denying his request for a minor-role reduction, the district court failed to consider that he: (1) had \u201cno equity interest in the drugs;\u201d (2) had no input on where the drugs were taken; and (3) received only a flat fee to replace a malfunctioning vessel. He also argues that he was convicted for his involvement in a conspiracy that involved multiple defendants, such that he \u201cwas held accountable for the reasonably foreseeable actions of all other coconspirators \u2014 not just his own conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">\u201c[We have] long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999). After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this standard of review remains unchanged. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002). We have noted that \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. Because of Micolta\u2019s personal involvement in the importation of 1,250 to 1,625 kilograms of cocaine, the district court did not clearly err by denying his minor-role reduction request.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Micolta next argues that his sentence is unreasonable under the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) due to his: (1) lack of criminal history; (2) lack of employment opportunities in his village; (3) lack of education; (4) family\u2019s dependency on him; and (5) minimal involvement in the outcome of the offense. He argues that a sentence of 108 months\u2019 imprisonment would have been the minimum necessary to accomplish the principles listed in \u00a7 3553.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">After <em>Booker, </em>we review sentences under the advisory guideline regime for \u201cunreasonable[ness].\u201d 543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765. Following <em>Booker, </em>we have stated that the district court first must correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range, then, using the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence, as long as it is reasonable. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. The relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed [treatment]; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence' and the sentencing range ...; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArM\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 259-61, 125 S.Ct. at 764-66. There is no requirement, however, that the district court engage in a detailed, step-by-step analysis of every factor, as we have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">A sentence within the advisory guideline range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but we ordinarily expects such a sentence to be reasonable. See <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Scott, </em>we held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences. 426 F.3d at 1329-30. We further explained that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the guideline range, and considered evidence in mitigation as reflected by the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range. <em>See id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Because the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence at the low end of the advisory guideline range, Micolta\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
