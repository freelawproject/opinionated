In his motion, Ryan challenged the validity of his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Ryan also asserted that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal, although he specifically requested that counsel do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">A COA may issue only if Ryan makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). \u201cThe COA determination under \u00a7 2253(c) requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). \u201cA petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327,123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">With respect to his challenge to the validity of his guilty plea, Ryan has failed to meet the standard required for the issuance of a COA. Accordingly, Ryan\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED as to this issue. Ryan has, however, made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right with respect to his claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to file a notice of appeal on his behalf. <em>See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Because he alleges that he specifically requested that counsel file a notice of appeal, Ryan was not required to demonstrate that he would have presented merit worthy issues on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1029. Further, Ryan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was made under penalty of perjury and was competent evidence supporting his claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746; <em>see Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2003). Because Ryan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and the files and records of this case do not conclusively show that he is entitled to no relief, an evidentiary hearing was required. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>635 F.2d 449, 451 (5th Cir.1981). Accordingly, it is ORDERED that Ryan\u2019s motion for a COA is GRANTED solely on the ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel issue. The judgment is VACATED and the case REMANDED for further development in the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
