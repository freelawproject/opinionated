On appeal, Cineus argues that he was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury and to equal protection because the government used four of its peremptory challenges to strike prospective African-American jurors from the jury without legitimate cause, in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Second, Cineus argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction of importation of cocaine because the government failed to prove that he had knowledge that the cocaine was in his luggage. Finally, Cineus argues that the $2,000 fine rendered his sentence unreasonable, and cites to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as the appropriate standard of review. Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">We review \u201cthe resolution of a <em>Batson </em>challenge givfing] great deference to a district court\u2019s finding as to the existence of a <em>prima facie </em>case. De novo review is inappropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez, </em>428 F.3d 1015, 1039 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, as the district court\u2019s determination of the reason for a juror\u2019s dismissal is a finding of fact, we will not overturn it unless it is clearly erroneous or appears to have been guided by improper principles of law. <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[p]urposeful racial discrimination in selection of the <em>venire </em>violates a defendant\u2019s right to equal protection.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 86, 106 S.Ct. at 1717. <em>\u201cBatson </em>established the ... three-part inquiry for evaluating whether a peremptory strike was motivated by rac[e].... First, the district court must determine whether the party challenging the peremptory strikes has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by establishing facts sufficient to support an inference of racial discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>nation.\u201d <em>Ochoa-Vasquez, </em>428 F.3d at 1038 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-4\">If the objector makes a <em>prima facie </em>showing, the burden then shifts at step two to the striker to articulate a race-neutral explanation for the challenged strike. However, the ultimate burden of persuasion rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike. Thus, even if the [striker] produces only a frivolous or utterly nonsensical justification for its strike, the case does not end \u2014 it merely proceeds to step three. At step three, the district court determines the persuasiveness of the justification offered by the striker and decides whether the objector has carried its burden of proving purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1038-39 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Because the district court elicited nondiscriminatory reasons for the exercise of the prosecution\u2019s peremptory strikes, we review the prosecutor\u2019s articulation, and the judge\u2019s acceptance, of the stated justifications for the strikes. <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 1866, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) (plurality opinion); <em>see United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2006). In this case, it appears that the government met its burden of production in setting forth race-neutral explanations for using four of its six peremptory strikes against prospective African-American jurors. <em>See Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Although Cineus asserted that the prosecution\u2019s reasons for striking some African-American jurors were pretextual, he did not introduce any evidence tending to discredit the government\u2019s proffered explanations or otherwise establish pretext. <em>See Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005). Furthermore, the record shows that the government did not object to at least three prospective African-American jurors, and, ultimately, two African-American jurors sat on the jury. Without more, Cineus\u2019s allegation based solely on the number of prospective African-American jurors stricken from the <em>venire </em>does not establish that the government engaged in racial discrimination. <em>See Central Ala. Fair Housing Ctr., Inc., v. Lowder Realty Co., </em>236 F.3d 629, 636 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he mere fact of striking a juror or a set of jurors of a particular race does not necessarily create an inference of racial discrimination.\u201d). Therefore, Cineus has failed to demonstrate that the district court clearly erred in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">We review a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence <em>de novo. United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1234 (11th Cir.) <em>cert, denied, </em>543 U.S. 937, 125 S.Ct. 324, 160 L.Ed.2d 244 (2004). Moreover, credibility determinations are left to the jury, and as long as the testimony is not incredible as a matter of law, we must accept the jury\u2019s conclusions. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997). We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, and accept reasonable inferences and credibility choices by the fact-finder. <em>United States v. Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d 719, 720 (11th Cir.1997) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">Section 952(a) prohibits the importation of any controlled substance into the United States. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a). A charge under \u00a7 952(a) requires proof that the defendant had knowledge that he was importing a controlled substance. <em>United States v. Peart, </em>888 F.2d 101, 104 (11th Cir.1989). Direct evidence of intent is not necessary, however, as knowledge can be inferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>from circumstantial evidence. <em>Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Cineus\u2019s conviction was supported by the evidence. Although it is true that the government did not introduce direct evidence showing that Cineus knew the two suitcases contained cocaine, this argument is not fatal to the government\u2019s case. <em>See Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d at 721. Here, the surrounding circumstances provide ample circumstantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The evidence at trial showed that Cineus\u2019s behavior at the primary customs check point was so suspicious that the customs officer referred him for customs inspection. In the secondary inspection, Cineus admitted to owning the two suitcases and the contents therein, and having packed the suitcases. When the customs officers noticed the unusual weight of the partition in Cineus\u2019s luggage, Cineus began to question the officers and make statements that a reasonable jury could understand were meant to divert the officers\u2019 attention from the luggage under immediate inspection. Three separate compartments containing a significant amount of cocaine \u2014 four kilograms \u2014 were found in Cineus\u2019s two suitcases. Based on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a person who is caught with luggage containing a large amount of drugs knew of the presence of the drugs. <em>See Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d at 721-22. In addition, a reasonable jury could infer from the quantity of drugs seized that a \u201cprudent smuggler\u201d was not likely to entrust such valuable cargo to an innocent person without that person\u2019s knowledge and consent. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the testimonial evidence at trial revealed that Cineus had told numerous conflicting stories, and therefore a reasonable jury could choose to disbelieve Cineus\u2019s testimony that he did not have knowledge of the cocaine in his luggage. Because a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Cineus intended to import cocaine into the United States in violation of \u00a7 952(a), we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">We review a fine set by the district court for clear error. <em>United States v. Lombardo, </em>35 F.3d 526, 527 (11th Cir. 1994). The defendant has the burden of proving inability to pay a fine. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 665 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">A sentence to pay a fine may be imposed in addition to any other sentence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3551(b). The statutory maximum fine is $2,000,000. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(2)(B). Section 5E1.2(a) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay.\u201d Here, Cineus was scored an offense level of 30, for which the sentencing guidelines recommend a fine of $15,000 to $2,000,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(c)(2-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">If a district court determines, however, that the defendant could not pay, and would not likely become able to pay, a fine within the applicable range, the district court may impose a sentence outside the recommended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(f). The guidelines provide a list of seven factors that the court must consider when setting a fine. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d). These factors include: defendant\u2019s income; earning capacity; financial resources; the burden on the defendant and his dependents; pecuniary loss inflicted on others as a result of the offense; whether restitution is ordered; the need to deprive the defendant of illegal gains; and the need to promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and adequate deterrence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d). Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>that a defendant has faded to disclose the existence of assets to the court may support a determination that he is able to pay a fine with those undisclosed assets. <em>United States v. Rowland, </em>906 F.2d 621, 624 (11th Cir.1990). Although the representation of a defendant by appointed counsel may indicate his inability to pay, that fact is not determinative. <em>United States v. Long, </em>122 F.3d 1360, 1366 n. 8 (11th Cir.1997); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2, comment. (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">While the district court did not make explicit findings of fact regarding Cineus\u2019s ability to pay, the hearing did provide an adequate record to enable us to conduct a meaningful review. <em>See United States v. Alston, </em>895 F.2d 1362, 1374 (11th Cm. 1990). First, the PSI showed that Cineus claimed ownership of $2,000 worth of jewelry when arrested, and he admitted, when objecting to the PSI, that he had other items of jewelry with an undetermined value. Second, the district court relied on the fact that Cineus did not provide the probation office with sufficient information regarding his financial status when it imposed his fine. <em>See Rowland, </em>906 F.2d at 624. The district court departed downward from the guideline range of $15,000 to $2,000,000 to impose a $2,000 fine because there was not sufficient information to confirm Cineus\u2019s ability to pay. Moreover, the court provided that if Cineus\u2014 who was in his mid-thirties and good health at sentencing \u2014 could not pay the fine immediately, he could pay it over time by arrangement through the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program. Thus, over the course of Cineus\u2019s nine years of incarceration and four years of supervised release, he would have to pay less than $20 per month to satisfy the $2,000 fine. <em>Cf. Long, </em>122 F.3d at 1367 (upholding fine amounting to $56 per month over period of imprisonment and supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">For the reasons stated above, the district court did not clearly err in imposing a $2,000 fine as part of Cineus\u2019s sentence, and because no other circumstances suggest that Cineus\u2019s sentence was unreasonable,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm his sentence in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-5\">.
