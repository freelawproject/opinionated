On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) determined that an attorney trial referee was authorized to rule on the defendants\u2019 contested motion to amend their answer, (2) found that the attorney trial referee correctly denied that motion to amend, and (3) rendered judgment in accordance with the recommendations of the attorney trial referee. We agree with the defendants that the trial court incorrectly determined that an attorney trial referee has the authority to rule on a motion to amend and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. In early 1988, the defendant N. David Hanania began negotiations regarding the purchase of five lots in Wilton with the intention of developing those lots residen-tially. The defendant corporation, New Dimension Homes of Connecticut, Inc., was created for the purpose of acquiring and developing this property. At about this time, John Fitzgerald, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the plaintiff, expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>an interest on behalf of the plaintiff in providing financing for the project. The discussions between Hanania and Fitzgerald regarding financing were not memorialized in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">On July 26, 1988, the plaintiff agreed to loan the defendant New Dimension Homes of Connecticut, Inc., the principal amount of $2,025,000 to be secured by a mortgage on the five lots of property purchased. The loan was further secured by the personal guarantees of the defendants Hanania, Raymonde Mujak, Earle S. Rynston and George Stanley. The terms of the loan provided for the principal to be repaid one year from the making of the loan and for quarterly payments of interest. Fitzgerald was the loan officer responsible for the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Upon the defendants\u2019 failure to make the required payment of interest on July 26, 1989, the plaintiff decided to exercise its option to declare the entire balance on the loan due and payable. On September 26, 1989, the plaintiff instituted suit against the defendants, seeking to foreclose on the mortgaged property. In their answer, the defendants admitted having executed the note, mortgage and guarantees. The defendants asserted, however, by way of special defense, that they were fraudulently induced into acquiring the Wilton property by the plaintiff\u2019s promises to make available sufficient additional funds to complete the construction on that property. The defendants claimed that this failure to advance additional sums forced them to default on the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On October 1, 1991, the defendants moved for the appointment of a commission to take the deposition of Fitzgerald, who was no longer in the plaintiff\u2019s employ and resided in New York. This motion was granted on October 21,1991. On December 11,1991, still attempting to depose Fitzgerald, the defendants moved to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>pel Fitzgerald\u2019s deposition or in the alternative to preclude the plaintiff from introducing his testimony at trial. This subsequent motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">On January 21,1992, the parties consented to reference of the case to attorney trial referee David Albert.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At that time, the defendants informed the attorney trial referee that they wanted to postpone the trial until they could take the deposition of Fitzgerald who was present in the courtroom. The defendants stated that the plaintiff had responded to their notice of deposition by informing them that it could not produce Fitzgerald because he was no longer an employee of the plaintiff. The defendants also informed the court that they had instituted a separate action in New York for the sole purpose of taking Fitzgerald\u2019s deposition. The attorney trial referee decided to allow the plaintiff to call its first witness to establish the amount of the debt, but continued further hearings until the defendants were able to take Fitzgerald\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On February 20,1992, the defendants deposed Fitzgerald. Allegedly as a result of the information obtained in the deposition, the defendants moved the court for permission to amend their answer to add a special defense and to file two counterclaims. The proposed amendments included a second special defense that the interest rates on the loan were usurious and two counterclaims, one alleging fraud<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the other, a vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>lation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110 et seq.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff objected to the motion to amend and requested oral argument. Oral argument was heard before the attorney trial referee<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who granted the motion as to the additional special defense of usury and denied the motion as to the proposed counterclaims. Trial continued thereafter on June 2, 1992, and was completed on September 2, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">On March 18,1993, the attorney trial referee issued a report containing his findings of fact and recommended judgment for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants filed exceptions to the attorney trial referee\u2019s report and objected to its acceptance. Among its objections, the defendants claimed that the attorney trial referee lacked the authority to rule on their contested motion to amend their answer. On August 6, 1993, the trial court overruled their objections and entered judgment in accordance with the attorney trial referee\u2019s report. This appeal followed the entry of strict foreclosure and setting of law days on August 5, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The defendants first claim that the attorney trial referee did not have the authority to rule on their motion to amend their answer to the plaintiffs complaint. We agree and reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The limited authority of attorney trial referees was first defined by our Supreme Court in <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 508 A.2d 415 (1986). Attorney trial referees, whose authority stems from General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are not judges and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>do not have the authority of a judge. <em>Seal Audio, Inc. v.Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 501-502. Rather, attorney trial referees have limited roles as fact finders \u201cwhose determination of the facts is reviewable in accordance with well established procedures prior to the rendition of judgment by the court. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 428 through 445.\u201d Id., 502; see also <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>17 Conn. App. 294, 299, 552 A.2d 827 (1989). Any legal conclusions reached by an attorney trial referee have no conclusive effect. <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 510. \u201cThe reviewing court is the effective arbiter of the law and the legal opinions of [an attorney trial referee], like those of the parties, though they may be helpful, carry no weight not justified by their soundness as viewed by the court that renders judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id .; see also <em>CMG Realty of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Colonnade </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>One at Old Greenwich Ltd. Partnership, </em>36 Conn. App. 653, 664, 653 A.2d 207 (1995); <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u201cThe rules of practice governing procedure in matters referred to committees are also applicable to \u2018[attorney trial] referees.\u2019 Practice Book \u00a7 428.\u201d <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 199 Conn. 502-503; see also <em>Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 300 n.8. As such, Practice Book \u00a7 433 requires that a case be referred to a committee or attorney trial referee only after the issues have been closed and the case has been claimed to the trial list. After such time, no further pleadings may be filed \u201cexcept by agreement of all parties or <em>order of the court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 433; compare Practice Book \u00a7 438 (motion to correct to be filed with court and then forwarded to attorney trial referee for consideration of motion). The attorney trial referee cannot, therefore, make a legal determination regarding the merits of a contested motion to amend pleadings, nor can the trial court legally delegate its authority to the attorney trial referee; it is an integral part of the authority of the court to make such rulings. See Practice Book \u00a7 433; <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 501-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The trial court, therefore, improperly determined that the attorney trial referee was authorized to rule on the defendants\u2019 contested motion to amend. The attorney trial referee\u2019s limited role does not extend to legal rulings regarding the pleadings of the parties; see Practice Book \u00a7 433; and the trial court improperly found otherwise. The trial court should, therefore, have rejected the report of the attorney trial referee and ordered further proceedings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 443.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Because we determine that an attorney trial referee has no authority to rule on a contested motion to amend we need not address the defendants\u2019 second claim that, if an attorney trial referee did have such authority, the trial court improperly determined that the attorney trial referee correctly denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In addition, in light of our remand to the trial court for further proceedings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 443, we do not address the defendants\u2019 third claim that the trial court improperly rendered judgment in accordance with the recommendation of the attorney trial referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to reject the report of the attorney trial referee and to order further proceedings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> The defendants in this appeal are New Dimension Homes of Connecticut, Inc., and four individuals associated with that corporation: N. David Hanania, Raymonde Mujak, Earle S. Rynston, and George Stanley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> The transcript from January 21,1992, reveals that the plaintiff readily consented to the reference and that the defendants expressed some concern that the case was too complicated to be heard by an attorney trial referee. The defendants ultimately consented to the reference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> In the defendants\u2019 first proposed counterclaim, the defendants alleged that they had approached the plaintiff concerning the possibility of the plaintiff\u2019s financing the purchase of a \u201cminimum of one and a maximum of two\u201d lots in Wilton. The defendants further alleged that the plaintiff encouraged them to form the defendant corporation and to proceed with the acquisition of the Wilton lots with false promises to extend the necessary financing. The defendants alleged that they relied on these promises to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>detriment and that the plaintiff knew that the promises were false because such an extension of funds would have exceeded its legal lending limitations as well as the limits of the loan policy as set by the plaintiffs board of directors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\"> In their second proposed counterclaim, the defendants asserted that the facts alleged in their first counterclaim constituted an unfair trade practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> Although the arguments before the attorney trial referee were conducted off the record, the parties agree that the attorney trial referee asked the judge who had assigned the case whether he should decide the motion. The trial court informed the attorney trial referee that he had the case for all purposes and was to hear the parties and then rule on the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b517-10\"> The attorney trial referee first issued his report on January 6, 1993. Both parties filed motions to correct these findings pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438. After considering these motions, the attorney trial referee filed the March 18,1993 report in substitution of the original report. The attorney trial referee\u2019s decisions whether to correct various findings is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 provides in relevant part: \u201cstate referees.
