On April 5, 1991, the defendant, a twenty year old male, met the victim, a twelve year old girl, at a highway picnic area across the street from the victim\u2019s house. He gave the victim a beer and drove her to a wooded area where they engaged in sexual intercourse and other sexual acts. The victim told several people about her sexual encounter with the defendant, all of whom testified at trial. The victim\u2019s parents, upon learning about the incident from reading the victim\u2019s diary, reported the incident to the state police. Additional facts will be discussed as the context requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The defendant first claims that the late disclosure of the victim\u2019s diary violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair trial, confrontation and due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He argues that his late receipt of the material information contained in the diary prevented him from adequately preparing his defense, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to compel the state to disclose all exculpatory evidence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 741. In response, the state made the contents of its file, except the victim\u2019s diary and medical and psychiatric records, available for the defendant\u2019s review. The defendant thereafter moved to compel disclosure of the diary, but the trial court, after reviewing the documents, ordered the release of only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>certain pages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s subsequent motions for the state to disclose the entire diary were all denied. It was not until the second day of the victim\u2019s cross-examination at trial that the court allowed the defendant access to the victim\u2019s entire diary.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It is well established that \u201c \u2018[t]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u2019 <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). . . .\u201d (Citation <em>omitted.)State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>231 Conn. 195, 205, 647 A.2d 342 (1994). In order to prevail <em>on a Brady </em>claim, the defendant must show \u201c(a) suppression by the prosecution after a request by the defense, (b) the evidence\u2019s favorable character for the defense, and (c) the materiality of the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 406, 563 A.2d 646, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512 (1989). A defendant does not satisfy this three prong test by showing only a failure to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Our Supreme Court has further explained that evidence is material only \u201cif there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 406-407. \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish materiality in the constitutional sense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Where, as here, the evidence was disclosed to the defendant at trial, the burden is on the defendant to \u201cestablish that he was prejudiced by the state\u2019s failure to make the information available to him at an earlier time.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Our analysis of whether the defendant was prejudiced by the late disclosure focuses on the <em>effect </em>of the timing of the disclosure on the jury\u2019s verdict. The defendant makes the sweeping claim that the timing of the disclosure affected his entire trial strategy. He fails, however, to specify in what way he was prejudiced by not having been given the diary prior to trial. On the contrary, the diary was disclosed soon enough for it to be of use to the defendant during his cross-examination of the victim. In addition, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance to allow him to prepare for his cross-examination of the victim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 122, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986), our Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s bald assertion that he was deprived of the opportunity to make an adequate investigation failed to establish prejudice. As in <em>Reddick, </em>the defendant here has asserted prejudice but failed to sustain his burden of showing such. Therefore, the <em>Brady </em>claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to make all of the victim\u2019s medical and psychiatric records available to the defense. He argues that he was entitled to review the records in their entirety because they went to the victim\u2019s mental and physical state as well as to her motive, bias and credibility. He further argues that an in camera review of the records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>does not adequately protect his right to prepare his defense, and suggests that we establish a procedure whereby defense counsel and the state would initially review all such records to determine what is exculpatory and material. The court would then review the records to determine which should be admitted. The defendant alternatively claims that the release of parts of the privileged records forty-three days prior to trial violated the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">We note that the defendant is not challenging the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining that certain records were not material to the defendant\u2019s impeachment of the victim. Rather, he is challenging the constitutionality of the in camera review procedure. Both our Supreme Court and this court have addressed this issue and balanced the competing interests of the victim\u2019s privacy and the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. Both courts have held that an in camera review of privileged records does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 631 A.2d 309 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hufford, </em>205 Conn. 386, 533 A.2d 866 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 471 A.2d 949 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>31 Conn. App. 178, 623 A.2d 1052 (1993). We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s claim that he is entitled to review the records.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s release of the pertinent parts of the privileged records forty-three days prior to the commencement of the trial violated his constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the records were disclosed to the defendant, he can complain only of the timing of the disclosure. Under these circumstances, the defendant has the burden of proving that he was prejudiced by such timing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>214 Conn. 122, 126-27, 571 A.2d 686 (1990). He has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The defendant does not cite any specific ways in which his trial preparation was hindered by the timing of the disclosure. In addition, we note that the defendant did not seek a continuance from the trial court. \u201c \u2018On this record, the defendant\u2019s claims of prejudice are purely speculative and cannot furnish a basis for the reversal of his conviction.\u2019 \u201d Id., 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly admitted evidence of a prior sexual assault that he had committed against the victim. He argues that the evidence should not have been admitted because any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its highly prejudicial nature. At trial, the victim was allowed to testify that on February 12, 1991, the defendant kissed her, put his hand down the front of her pants and rubbed her vagina. This evidence of a prior sexual assault was admissible only to show the defendant\u2019s sexual interest in the victim and hence his motive for the subsequent assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The basic principle that governs this issue is well established in Connecticut. Evidence of prior miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>duct, although inadmissible to prove bad character or propensity to commit the crime, is admissible to prove motive if a two part test is satisfied: \u201c(1) [the evidence] must be relevant and material, and (2) its probative value must outweigh its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>24 Conn. App. 330, 335, 588 A.2d 648, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 903, 593 A.2d 132 (1991). In <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 560 A.2d 426 (1989), our Supreme Court held that evidence of prior sexual misconduct perpetrated by the defendant on the same victim was relevant and material to showing motive. \u201cThat the defendant had a particular sexual interest in [the victim] is certainly relevant to his motivation to commit the crime charged.\u201d Id., 578. Therefore, the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant had previously committed sexual acts toward her was relevant and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In determining whether the trial court properly held that the probative value of the evidence outweighed the prejudicial effect, we apply a deferential standard of review. \u201cReversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 337. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The defendant claims that the evidenc\u00e9 was unfairly prejudicial because it was likely to arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy. While it is true \u201cthat relevant evidence that is potentially prejudicial should be excluded . . . \u2018where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy\u2019 id., 337; the defendant fails to persuade us that the evidence in question so aroused the jury\u2019s emotions as to be inadmissible. \u201cPrejudice is not measured by the significance of the evidence which is relevant but by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>impact of that which is extraneous. ... All adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to b\u00e9 admitted. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Zoravali, </em>34 Conn. App. 428, 435, 641 A.2d 796, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 921 (1994). Furthermore, the court minimized any prejudicial effect of the evidence by instructing the jury that the evidence was admissible only to show the defendant\u2019s motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that his conviction of two counts of first degree sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) as well as two counts of second degree sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) violated his federal constitutional right against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find no such violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">To avail himself of the protections guaranteed by the double jeopardy clause, a defendant must first show that a violation occurred. It is undisputed that the defendant\u2019s claim that his convictions for both first degree sexual assault and second degree sexual assault implicates the constitutional protection \u201cagainst multiple punishments for the same offense [in a single trial]. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 706, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991). No violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>occurred here because the defendant, while having been charged and convicted of both first and second degree sexual assault, was <em>not </em>punished separately for both crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Chicano, </em>our Supreme Court held that when a defendant is convicted of both a greater and a lesser included offense, the proper remedy is to combine the convictions of the lesser offense and the greater offense and to vacate the sentence for the lesser offense. Vacatur of both the conviction and the sentence on the lesser offense is not required. Id., 725. In this case, the trial court did not sentence the defendant for the two counts of second degree sexual assault but, rather, properly combined the two counts of second degree sexual assault with the two counts of first degree sexual assault, and sentenced the defendant accordingly. There is, therefore, no double jeopardy violation from which the defendant is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person . . .
