And when were you arrested for failing to appear in this case? And if you want to use notes, be my guest.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">\u201cA. Well, uh-</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\u201c[The State]: Your Honor, I\u2019d object. <em>I don\u2019t know how this is relevant to anything that\u2019s before the court in this instance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">\u201c[The Court]: Mr. Sherman?</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, I unfortunately have to claim it, Your Honor. Trooper Marchio\u2019s the one who picked up a big glob of mud and threw it on the wall. And now it\u2019s incumbent on me to obliterate it as best I can. <em>I never brought it out.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">\u201c[The Court]: <em>You brought it out, though.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Excuse me, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">\u201c[The Court]: <em>You forced it out.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Oh, I don\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-18\">\u201c[The Court]: I don\u2019t mean that you did so intentionally, but it seems to me that you put some water on the dirt, and made it mud.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, and I \u2014 I strongly, respectfully disagree with the court. When I asked Trooper Marchio a question having nothing to do with anything, he is the one who said, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s when I arrested him for failure to appear in court.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u201c[The Court]: <em>What\u2019s that have to do with this case then, at any rate?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, the jury has now been made aware that he\u2019s been arrested for failure to appear in court, which would seem to be some type of contempt\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u201c[The State]: Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: \u2014Marchio\u2014and I think I\u2019m entitled at this point to clear up [the] matter for the jury and explain why he was a failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">\u201c[The Court]: Okay. What do you want to say?</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\u201c[The State]: Can we excuse the jury so we can talk?</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">\u201c[The Court]: Excuse the jury, please.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">The state argued to the trial court that defense counsel was opening the door to the failure to appear charge, which had been severed at his request, and that, if he continued to do so, the state should be allowed to reinstate the failure to appear charge. No formal motion to reinstate the charge was made and that charge was never brought back into the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">The defendant made an offer of proof, out of the presence of the jury, that pertained solely to the severed failure to appear charge. The state objected on relevancy grounds. Defense counsel argued that the evidence was necessary to rebut the prejudicial effect of Marchio\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The trial court ruled that the subject of the offer of proof was not relevant to either of the charges for which the defendant was on trial. When the jury-returned, the court instructed it to disregard all reference to the failure to appear charge<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and reemphasized this point as part of its final jury instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Facts relating to the fingerprint claim will be discussed with the analysis of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly interfered with his right to present a defense and also interfered with his decision to testify in his own behalf (1) by permitting him to explore evidence of the severed failure to appear charge on cross-examination of a state\u2019s witness and (2) by not permitting him to introduce evidence pertaining to that crime as part of his own case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The genesis of this problem was the cross-examination of Marchio when he was asked: \u201cDid you have any other discussions with [the defendant] about this case?\u201d Apparently, defense counsel was referring to other discussions that may have taken place at the time the defendant was being processed on the original arrest. Marchio, however, misinterpreted the question and started to reply, \u201cI arrested him after for a charge of failure to appear in court. . . .\u201d The trial court immediately interrupted Marchio, ordering, \u201cLet\u2019s go on to another area now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The defendant persisted, however, in going into the failure to appear charge despite continued efforts by the trial court to deter him. On appeal, the defendant relied on the timeworn cliche, \u201cYou can\u2019t unring the bell.\u201d This truism is well taken when extensive and critical prejudicial testimony is unexpectedly exposed to the jury. Not every inadvertent word or expression, however, comes within the ambit of the saying. In the present case, Marchio\u2019s inadvertent remark barely tinkled the proverbial bell. It was the defendant who grabbed the bell rope and swung on it, causing the bell to peal over and over again. Any prejudice resulting from the repeated reference to the failure to appear charge was self-induced and, if not the result of the defendant\u2019s opening the door, was the consequence of the defendant\u2019s taking a door that was barely ajar and forcing it wide open. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>224 Conn. 196, 206, 618 A.2d 494 (1992). \u201c \u2018Action induced by an appellant cannot ordinarily be ground of error.\u2019 . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>34 Conn. App. 473, 488, 642 A.2d 36, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 907, 648 A.2d 157 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Furthermore, any possible prejudice that might be claimed was eliminated by the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction, repeated in its final jury charge. Absent evidence to the contrary, the jury is presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instruction to disregard all references to the failure to appear charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 331, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992). \u201cSuch curative instructions are entitled to great weight and ordinarily prevent an appellate court from finding that the trial court committed reversible error. ...\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>28 Conn. App. 474, 481, 612 A.2d 123, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 926, 614 A.2d 828 (1992). A limiting instruction was an adequate remedy in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The defendant\u2019s attempt to undo the benefit of the limiting instruction cannot be laid at the door of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Because the defendant\u2019s offer of proof contained no evidence relevant to the charges for which the defendant was on trial, the trial court properly refused to allow it to be presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In the final aspect of this claim, the defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s \u201cinvitation\u201d to defense counsel to \u201c[d]o what you have to do\u201d interfered with his decision on whether to take the stand and testify or to exercise his constitutional right not to testify. The record is devoid of testimony or trial court findings showing that the defendant\u2019s decision resulted from Marchio\u2019s partial answer or the court\u2019s subsequent action. This claim is supported only by representations of appellate counsel. Representations and arguments of counsel are not evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>29 Conn. App. 724, 732, 618 A.2d 50, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 902, 621 A.2d 285 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">It is the appellant\u2019s burden to furnish an adequate record. Practice Book \u00a7 4061;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>deFur </em>v. <em>deFur, </em>37 Conn. App. 450, 451-52, 656 A.2d 703 (1995); <em>Gallant </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>36 Conn. App. 794, 797, 654 A.2d 380 (1995). \u201c \u2018If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, [this court] will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 732, <em>quoting State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, <em>240, </em>567 A.2d 823 (1989). We decline to review this aspect of the first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury concerning fingerprint evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">On the night of the arrest, Marchio seized a plastic bag that was in plain view on the front seat. The bag\u2019s contents proved to be cocaine. Sergeant Angel Gonzales testified that the police did not fingerprint the package because it was \u201cassumed\u201d to be the defendant\u2019s since he was alone in the car, and, under such circumstances, it was not common practice to fingerprint a package suspected of containing narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">At trial, the defendant denied ownership of the drugs and also denied having handled the package. The car was rented, and he claimed that the package fell from above the sun visor as he tried to find the vehicle registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">During closing argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked, rhetorically, why the state had not fingerprinted the package. \u201cWe could have solved this long ago, I suggest to you, by the fingerprints. We can\u2019t do it. They\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d The state did not refute these statements at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">During deliberations, the jury asked the question: \u201cDoes the accused have the right, or did he have the right to get the cocaine bag fingerprinted and introduced into evidence?\u201d The court answered, \u201cNo.\u201d The state excepted to this answer, pointing out that pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 741,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>right to make reasonable tests on the package, so the answer to the jury\u2019s question should have been yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The defendant objected to a simple affirmative answer because he argued that so many people had handled the package during its processing that it effectively denied him his right to have it fingerprinted. As an alternative, he sought to have the court supplement its affirmative answer with an instruction that the package had been contaminated by having been handled by a number of people. There was no evidence, however, that the bag had become so contaminated that it could not be effectively fingerprinted.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The court refused to go into the testimony and rein-structed the jury that the defendant had a right to test the package and that \u201cthe value of [making the tests] is based upon the testimony that you\u2019ll have to recall regarding those circumstances of fingerprinting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The jury then requested: \u201cPlease clarify your statement regarding fingerprint[s], particularly the part about prior testimony.\u201d The state asserted that the court was limited to telling the jury that it must rely on its recollection of the evidence. The defendant again argued that the court should remind the jury that there had been testimony that many people had touched the package and explain that this meant that any fingerprint testing would have been useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The court again refused this request, instead telling the jury, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, it\u2019s your obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to try to recall the testimony in this case to the best of your ability. Your collective memory is what you should use. If there was testimony about fingerprinting that was introduced into evidence, think about that testimony. Try to recall what the testimony was. And that way, you can come to your answer to your own question. If there was testimony regarding fingerprinting, and again, in the context of your question that you asked me, about whether or not he had the right to have the bag fingerprinted, that\u2019s for you to decide.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The defendant introduced this issue when he incorrectly argued that the defendant could not fingerprint the package. He cannot now complain about the result of what he brought into the case. Action induced by a party cannot, ordinarily, be ground for error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 67, 630 A.2d 990 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 47, 454 A.2d 266 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>36 Conn. App. 516, 520, 651 A.2d 1313, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 912, 654 A.2d 356 (1995). \u201cThe defendant can claim relief from an induced error only upon a showing that the error violated his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The defendant argues on appeal that the court\u2019s instruction shifted the burden to him to prove his innocence and allowed the jury to draw an adverse inference that the defendant\u2019s failure to have the package fingerprinted was evidence of guilt. Even if this were true, it would not constitute grounds for overturning the verdict. The trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the defendant was presumed to be innocent and that the state had the burden of proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not consider individual instructions in isolation; rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>we consider the jury charge as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>36 Conn. App. 506, 511, 651 A.2d 1318, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 912, 654 A.2d 357 (1995). When considered as a whole, the jury instructions did not shift the burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who possesses or has under his control any quantity of any narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, may be imprisoned not more than seven years or be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second offense, may be imprisoned not more than fifteen years or be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned; and for any subsequent offense, may be imprisoned not more than twenty-five years or be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-222 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe operation of a motor vehicle upon any such highway, road or parking area for ten cars or more at a rate of speed greater than eighty-five miles per hour shall constitute [reckless driving].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\"> Appellate counsel was not trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b108-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-173 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of failure to appear in the second degree when, while charged with the commission of a misdemeanor or a motor vehicle violation for which a sentence to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>term of imprisonment may be imposed and while out on bail or released under other procedure of law, he wilfully fails to appear when legally called according to the terms of his bail bond or promise to appear.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b109-21\"> The record does not disclose why the defendant was charged with failure to appear in the second degree rather than failure to appear in the first degree, which is appropriate for failure to appear when charged with a felony. Possession of narcotics is a felony. At any rate, the failure to appear charge was later nolled by the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"> \u201cThank you.
