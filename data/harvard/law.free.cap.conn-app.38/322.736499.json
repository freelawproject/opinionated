We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">On November 18, 1988, the plaintiff, an employee of the state department of transportation (DOT), was operating a nine ton capacity DOT dump truck traveling east on Interstate Route 1-95 in West Haven. The truck was filled with loam, which the plaintiff was transporting to a landfill. Because she was unfamiliar with the area, the plaintiff followed another DOT truck to the landfill on her first trip. That truck exited 1-95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>at exit 43, and the plaintiff followed. The ramp was clearly posted with two \u201cNo Trucks\u201d signs. Despite the clear prohibition, the plaintiff used exit 43 on her second trip to the landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">On the second trip, as she turned onto the ramp, the plaintiff was unable to slow her vehicle enough to keep it under control. She went through a red light at the bottom of the ramp and was attempting to turn right onto Campbell Avenue when her truck overturned onto a car that was stopped at the traffic light, killing the driver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-111, a hearing was held on May 23 and July 18, 1991, at which the plaintiff was present and represented by counsel. The commissioner, acting through his hearing officer rendered his decision on August 17, 1991, concluding that the plaintiff was responsible for the fatality, and ordering that her operator\u2019s license be suspended for eighteen months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which sustained the appeal and reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The commissioner brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u201cJudicial review of the commissioner\u2019s actions is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act . . . and the scope of that review is very restricted.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>707, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977). \u201cNeither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the defendant.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 3, 509 A.2d 489 (1986). \u201cThe \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 rule governs judicial review of administrative factfinding under [General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j)]. . . . Such a standard of review allows less room for judicial scrutiny than does the \u2018weight of the evidence\u2019 rule or the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 rule. ... In determining whether an administrative finding is supported by \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 a court must defer to the [commissioner\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and to the [commissioner\u2019s] right to believe or disbelieve the evidence presented by any witness, even an expert, in whole or in part.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>210 Conn. 214, 217, 554 A.2d 292 (1989). \u201c[I]f there is evidence . . . which reasonably supports the decision of the commissioner, [the court] cannot disturb the conclusion reached by him.\u201d <em>DiBenedetto </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>168 Conn. 587, 589, 362 A.2d 840 (1975). The primary concern on appeal is that the hearing was conducted in a fundamentally fair manner. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The commissioner first contends that the trial court improperly found that the record did not sustain the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ating her vehicle at an unreasonable speed. We conclude that there was ample evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The plaintiff testified that she thought she exited 1-95 at about twenty-five miles per hour, the posted ramp speed. Her own expert testified that if the plaintiff had been traveling at twenty-five or thirty miles per hour at the top of the ramp, he believed that she would have been able to stop at the bottom. It is logical to extrapolate that, because she could not stop at the bottom of the ramp, the plaintiff was traveling faster than the posted speed limit, which is presumptively unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters within the province of the commissioner as finder of fact. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Sergeant Albert Lindblom of the West Haven police department testified that the plaintiff\u2019s truck was traveling at an excessive rate of speed to be able to negotiate the turn at the bottom of exit 43.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although there was some seemingly conflicting testimony from Lindblom about what speed would be reasonable under the circumstances,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it is up to the trier of fact to weigh conflicting evidence, and there is evidence that rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>sonably supports the commissioner\u2019s conclusion of unreasonable speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The commissioner next argues that the trial court improperly determined that the record did not sustain the conclusion that the plaintiff failed to keep her vehicle under control. We conclude that the hearing officer reasonably found that the plaintiff failed to maintain control of her vehicle. The trial court recited in its memorandum of decision that the plaintiff did not stop at the bottom of the ramp \u201cdue to the failure of the braking system of the truck.\u201d The court went on to say that \u201c[a]n examination of the vehicle by the West Haven police department found the vehicle to be in good mechanical condition \u2018other than the brakes not holding sufficiently.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">There was neither allegation nor evidence that the brakes failed between the plaintiff\u2019s first uneventful use of exit 43 and the second. Rather, the testimony indicated that the braking system was generally inadequate for the weight and speed of the truck. As the plaintiff\u2019s expert testified, the \u201cbrake system was too small to be able to bring the truck to a proper stop for the conditions that existed on ramp 43.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The hearing officer found that the plaintiff was unable to \u201csufficiently slow her vehicle to keep it under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>control [and] was unable to stop the dump truck by braking and downshifting . . . .\u2019\u2019He found further that \u201c[a]n examination of the dump truck by the West Haven police revealed no mechanical defects in the braking system.\u201d It was reasonable for the hearing officer to infer from the evidence that the first time the plaintiff used exit 43, she was not traveling too fast for the braking system to control the truck, and the second time she was traveling too fast for the braking system and, consequently, lost control of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Finally, the commissioner argues that the trial court improperly found that the plaintiff was exempt from the requirements of the exit ramp traffic control signs. The hearing officer found that the plaintiff used exit 43, despite two \u201cNo Trucks\u201d signs, and that that contributed to her responsibility for the fatality.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-290 (b) exempts maintenance vehicle operators from specified statutes \u201cso far as such exemption is necessary, while such operators and equipment are engaged in or are preparing to engage in or are departing from highway maintenance operations on any highway . . . .\u201d The plaintiff was not required to use exit 43 to reach the landfill, nor did her supervisor order her to use that ramp. In fact, according to police testimony, her use of the ramp displayed poor judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The hearing officer could reasonably have found that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to use exit 43, that she could have used a nonrestricted exit ramp, and, therefore, that she was not exempt from the traffic control signs. Even if the plaintiff were exempt from the truck prohibition, that would not save her. Her use of the restricted ramp was just one of the findings that led the hearing officer to conclude that the plaintiff was responsible for the fatality and thus to suspend the plaintiff\u2019s operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>There is evidence that reasonably supports the commissioner\u2019s decision. In light of this evidence, the commissioner did not act unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-111 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201csuspension of license after fatal accident. The commissioner shall not suspend the license of any operator concerned in any motor vehicle accident resulting in the death of any person solely because such death has occurred, unless the facts as ascertained by the commissioner, after a hearing, indicate responsibility on the part of such operator for such accident, and, if, after such hearing, the commissioner finds that such operator has caused or contributed to such death through the violation of any provision of this chapter or of chapter 248 or through negligence or carelessness, such suspension shall be for not less than one year . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> The plaintiffs conviction of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a was affirmed by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickles, </em>28 Conn. App. 283, 610 A.2d 716 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> The hearing officer concluded as follows: \u201cThat Lynn F. Pickles caused or contributed and is responsible for the death of Frank A. Giaimo in that she failed to keep her vehicle under proper control, in that she faded to obey the traffic control signage on 1-95 exit ramp and in that she was operating at an unreasonable speed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> Our Uniform Administrative Procedure Act is codified in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189.

The court shall affirm the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (2) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (3) made upon unlawful procedure; (4) affected by other error of law; (5) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-218a (a) provides in relevant part that \u201cthe State Traffic Commission may determine speed limits which are reasonable and safe on any state highway . . . built or maintained by the state . . .
