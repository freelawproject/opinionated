On April 21, 1993, Edward Clinton and Judith Clinton suffered a loss by fire at premises owned by them and insured by the plaintiff under a homeowner\u2019s policy. After the parties were unable to agree as to the value of the loss, the plaintiff appointed an appraiser pursuant to an appraisal clause in the insurance policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the Clintons failed to appoint an appraiser, they were served with an application for an order to proceed with an appraisal and for the appointment of an appraiser pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court conducted a hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ing on the plaintiff\u2019s application and, on March 8,1994, granted the application and ordered the Clintons to proceed to appraisal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal by the defendant followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The defendant first challenges the trial court\u2019s authority to have heard the plaintiff\u2019s application to compel appraisal. Specifically, she argues that the court lacked jurisdiction because (1) the plaintiff filed its application on Form JD-CV-1, which Practice Book \u00a7 49 excludes from use in matters pertaining to arbitration, (2) the plaintiff failed to make a proper appearance, (3) the plaintiff changed the return date on the original writ from March 1,1994, to March 8,1994, before the writ was served on the defendant, (4) the plaintiff included a recognizance in its application, (5) the plaintiff failed to attach a copy of the arbitration agreement to its application as an exhibit, (6) a contract of appraisal does not grant the trial court power to appoint an arbitrator or to order arbitration and (7) the plaintiff failed to achieve personal service on all the defendants. We will consider the defendant\u2019s arguments seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The defendant first argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiff filed its application to compel appraisal on Form JD-CV-1. She asserts that Practice Book \u00a7 49, which outlines the requirements for mesne process, provides that \u201cForm JD-CV-1 shall not be used in . . . [proceedings pertaining to arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">A defect in process, such as an improperly executed writ, implicates personal jurisdiction, rather than subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>222 Conn. 541, 551, 610 A.2d 1260 (1992). Our Supreme Court has held, however, in the context of an administrative appeal, that the improper use of Form JD-CV-1 does not defeat the Superior Court\u2019s jurisdiction \u201c[a]s long as it contains a proper citation, signed by a competent authority . . . .\u201d <em>Chestnut </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356, 514 A.2d 749 (1986). In <em>Chestnut Realty, </em>\u201cthe court examined the contents of the form and, finding that the information adequately gave notice to the defendant of the nature of the proceedings, it concluded that, absent a showing of prejudice by the defendant, the use of the incorrect form did not mandate dismissal of the administrative appeal.\u201d <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>18 Conn. App. 488, 493, 558 A.2d 1029 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">We conclude that the same reasoning is applicable in the context of this case. \u201c \u2018It is elementary that the [defendant] cannot be bound by the action of the court without reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middlesex Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Castellano, </em>225 Conn. 339, 344, 623 A.2d 55 (1993). In this case, the defendant, while served with the incorrect form, nonetheless received actual notice of the proceedings. She was personally served on February 24, 1994, with the Form JD-CV-1 writ, the plaintiff\u2019s application to compel appraisal and an order to appear on March 7,1994, and show cause why the application should not be granted. On the following day, February 25, 1994, the defendant filed an appearance, an answer and a motion to dismiss the defendant\u2019s application. Also, the defendant personally appeared at the March 7 show cause hearing. Thus, because the contents of the form adequately gave notice to the defendant of the nature of the proceedings and because the defendant has not shown prejudice arising from the use of the incorrect form, we must conclude that the plaintiffs lack of compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 49 was not fatal to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Our conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s use of Form JD-CV-1 in this matter was harmless dictates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>defendant\u2019s next argument must fail. She asserts that the plaintiff failed to make a proper appearance because its appearance was made by virtue of the Form JD-CV-1 writ, which may not be used in matters pertaining to arbitration. Because its underlying premise is not supportable, this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The defendant next argues that the plaintiff\u2019s alteration of the return date deprived the trial court of jurisdiction. The application to compel appraisal was originally made returnable to the court on March 1, 1994. On February 24, 1994, the serving sheriff contacted counsel for the plaintiff and reported that he had been unable to locate the defendant until that day. Counsel for the plaintiff authorized the sheriff to alter the return date from March 1 to March 8,1994, before serving the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The defendant relies on <em>Denison </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>74 Conn. 38, 49 A. 351 (1901), for the proposition that a plaintiff cannot lawfully change the return date in his writ after its issue and before service, unless the writ is reissued at the time of the alteration. The defendant\u2019s reliance on this case, however, is misplaced. In <em>Denison, </em>the court held that a pro se plaintiff did not have the authority to alter process. <em>Denison </em>has since been cited for the proposition that only the issuing authority can change the return date of a writ. 1E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1982) \u00a7 21b. In the case at hand, the alteration of the return date was made with the express authorization of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, a commissioner of the Superior Court duly authorized to issue writs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For this reason, we conclude that the alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ation of the return date is not, as the defendant claims, a jurisdictional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In a subsidiary argument, the defendant asserts that the March 1,1994 return date, which was subsequently altered, did not give her enough time to respond under the applicable accelerated pleading schedule of General Statutes \u00a7 52-410 (c), which provides that \u201c[t]he parties shall be considered as at issue on the allegations of the complaint unless the defendant files answer thereto within five days from the return day . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the alteration was effective, however, the return date was March 8, 1994. The defendant was served on February 24,1994, giving her a legally sufficient eight days within which to file an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The defendant also contends that the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction was affected by the plaintiff\u2019s inclusion of a recognizance in its application to compel appraisal. She argues that the provision of a recognizance was improper because a recognizance is not required in arbitration proceedings. <em>Fishman </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>4 Conn. App. 339, 345-46, 494 A.2d 606, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 806, 499 A.2d 57 (1985) (plaintiff\u2019s application to compel arbitration pursuant to \u00a7 52-410 not subject to dismissal on basis of lack of recognizance). The court in <em>Fishman </em>noted that arbitration proceedings are \u201c \u2018intended to avoid the formalities, the delay, the expense and vexation of ordinary litigation.\u2019 <em>In re Curtis-Castle Arbitration, </em>64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Conn. 501, 511, 30 A. 769 (1894) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 345. \u201cTo the extent that arbitration proceedings are viewed as requiring all the formal trappings of civil actions, those policies would be frustrated.\u201d Id. Just as the <em>Fishman </em>court determined that the omission of a recognizance did not defeat the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear an application to compel arbitration, we conclude that the inclusion of the same, albeit an unnecessary \u201cformal trapping of civil actions,\u201d likewise does not undermine the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The defendant next argues that the plaintiff\u2019s application to compel appraisal was defective because the plaintiff failed to attach a copy of the arbitration agreement, as required by \u00a7 52-410. The plaintiff admits that it did not attach a copy of the arbitration agreement to its application, but asserts that \u00a7 52-410 permits but does not require such an attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\u201cIn order to resolve the issue presented to us, we must resort to statutory interpretation in accordance with well defined principles that require that we ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . To determine the intent of the legislature, we first consider whether the statutory language yields a plain and unambiguous resolution. ... If the words are clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that [they] express the intention of the legislature . . . and we need inquire no further. . . . The words of a statute must be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning unless their context dictates otherwise. . . .\u2019\u2019(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>38 Conn. App. 8, 12, 658 A.2d 163 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Section 52-410 (b) provides in part that an application to compel arbitration <em>\u201cmay be </em>in the following form: \u20181. On , 19 , the plaintiff and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>defendant entered into a written agreement for arbitration, of which exhibit A, hereto attached, is a copy. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) We must conclude, therefore, that the statute is permissive rather than mandatory regarding the attachment of a copy of the arbitration agreement. Thus, while the attachment of an arbitration agreement pursuant to a \u00a7 52-410 application is desirable and encouraged, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to do so was not a statutory violation and did not affect the jurisdiction of the trial court to hear the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The defendant next challenges the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction by relying on <em>Mott </em>v. <em>Goer Bros., Inc., </em>22 Conn. Sup. 449, 174 A.2d 549 (1961), for the proposition that a contract of appraisal does not grant the trial court the authority to create an order to proceed with arbitration. In <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>177 Conn. 273, 279-80, 413 A.2d 862 (1979), however, our Supreme Court concluded that an appraisal clause in a fire insurance policy, required under General Statutes \u00a7 38a-307, constitutes a written agreement to arbitrate within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411. See also <em>Giulietti </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Placement Facility, </em>205. Conn. 424, 432, 534 A.2d 213 (1987). The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that because the plaintiff failed to achieve personal service on all the defendants, the application was not properly before the trial court. The defendant does not contest that she was personally served. Rather, she asserts that only abode service was achieved on the defendant Edward Clinton.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>A similar claim was made in <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Debek, </em>210 Conn. 175, 554 A.2d 728 (1989), where the defendants asserted that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs foreclosure action because the plaintiff failed to serve all the defendants in a timely manner. Our Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ur precedents make it abundantly clear that, except in the special circumstances of administrative appeals, defects in process do not deprive a court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 179. Because the defect in service implicated only the court\u2019s in personam jurisdiction, the Supreme Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider the case on its merits as to the defendants who had been properly served. Id., 179-80. Similarly, we conclude that the plaintiffs failure to serve Edward Clinton personally did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction in this case. Because the court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider the application to compel appraisal and personal jurisdiction over the defendant, we conclude that this claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff\u2019s application to compel appraisal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She argues (1) that the court failed to consider the rights of the parties, (2) that \u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411 provide statutory relief only for an aggrieved insured, not an insurer, and (3) that the plaintiff presented no evidence of an appraisal agreement or of a dispute as to the value of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Section 52-410 (c) provides that the trial court, after hearing an application for order to proceed with arbitration, \u201cshall either grant the order or deny the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>cation, according to the rights of the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the trial court failed to consider the rights of the parties before ordering her to proceed with appraisal. Specifically, she asserts that the trial court did not consider (1) her right to have the court not order the appointment of an appraiser, (2) her right pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-408 to have the agreement to arbitrate voided as a result of fraud or duress and (3) her right to waive appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\u201cArbitration is a creature of contract. ... It is designed to avoid litigation and secure prompt settlement of disputes and is favored by the law. . . . But a person can be compelled to arbitrate a dispute only if, to the extent that, and in the manner which, he has agreed so to do. . . .No one can be forced to arbitrate a contract dispute who has not previously agreed to do so.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) A. <em>Dubrueil &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Libson, </em>215 Conn. 604, 608, 577 A.2d 709 (1990). Accordingly, it seems that the requirement that the trial court must grant or deny an application to compel arbitration \u201caccording to the rights of the parties\u201d refers to the arbitrability of the dispute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The question of arbitrability entails both whether the parties have agreed to arbitration and what issues in particular are arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cThe issue of whether the parties to a contract have agreed to arbitration is controlled by their intention. . . . The intention of the parties is, in turn, a question of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 608-609. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Consequently, the finding of the trial court is subject to only limited appellate review to determine whether it is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record. Id., 609; <em>Stelco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bette, </em>2 Conn. App. 17, 21, 475 A.2d 1105 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The defendant first argues that the trial court improperly failed to consider her right to have the court not order the appointment of an appraiser. She asserts that there is no statutory authority for the court to appoint an appraiser. Section 52-411 (b), however, clearly provides that \u201c[i]f no method is provided [in the arbitration agreement], or if a method is provided and any party thereto fails to use the method, or if for any other reason there is a failure in the naming of an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire . . . upon application by a party to the arbitration agreement, the superior court . . . shall appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire, as the case may require.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See also <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 278-79. Also, the defendant does not claim nor is there evidence in the record that the appraisal clause in the insurance policy contained an agreement waiving the provision of \u00a7 52-411 (b). Therefore, the defendant did not have a right to have the court not appoint an appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The defendant also contends that the court did not consider her right to have the arbitration agreement voided as a result of fraud or duress. She argues that at the March 7, 1994 show cause hearing, she unsuccessfully attempted to present the trial court with evidence of duress suffered by her as a result of the plaintiffs insistence that she submit to arbitration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Section 52-408 provides that an arbitration agreement \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable, except when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity for the avoidance of written contracts generally.\u201d \u201cThis means that an arbitration agreement, like any other, can be declared void for fraud, misrepresentation, duress or undue influence, among other reasons not pertinent here. See 6 Williston, Contracts (Rev. Ed.) p. 5369.\u201d <em>Dewart </em>v. <em>Northeastern Gas Transmission Co., </em>140 Conn. 446, 449, 101 A.2d 299 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In this case, however, the defendant does not claim that duress occurred at the time of the formation of the arbitration agreement, that is, at the time when she signed the insurance policy containing the appraisal clause. Consequently, the defendant did not have a right to have the agreement declared void for duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court failed to consider her right to waive appraisal. She relies on <em>Batter Building Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschner, </em>142 Conn. 1, 11, 110 A.2d 464 (1954), for the proposition that \u201can arbitration clause may be waived by the parties or by the one entitled to its benefit.\u201d She asserts that she wants to waive appraisal in order to preserve her right to sue the plaintiff for breach of contract and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The plaintiff responds that, under the insurance policy, arbitration is a condition precedent to litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\"><em>In Batter Building Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschner, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 1, after the plaintiffs brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract, the defendants moved for a stay until the subject matter of the suit was submitted to arbitration, as provided for in the contract. The trial court granted the stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>after determining that the disputed issue was arbitra-ble and that the contract provided that arbitration was a condition precedent to litigation. On appeal, the plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, that the defendants had waived their right to insist on arbitration because of an unjustifiable delay between the breach of contract and request for submission to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The case at hand is distinguishable from <em>Batter Building Materials Co., </em>where the party wanting to sue claimed that the party wanting to arbitrate had waived its right to rely on the provision that arbitration is a condition precedent to litigation. Here, the party wanting to sue is claiming that she has waived her own right to arbitration, while the party wanting to arbitrate relies on the provision that arbitration is a condition precedent to litigation. For this reason, the defendant\u2019s reliance <em>on Batter Building Materials Co. </em>is misplaced. Her assertion of a right to waiver amounts to an attempt to escape her prior agreement to submit to arbitration.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not improperly fail to consider the rights of the parties before ordering the defendant to proceed with appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff\u2019s application because \u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411 provide statutory relief only for an aggrieved insured, not an insurer. In support of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>position, she cites <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 278, in which our Supreme Court noted that \u201c\u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411 . . . provide an appropriate procedure for an insured who needs judicial assistance when an insurer unreasonably refuses to proceed with the appraisal procedure specified in the insurance contract.\u201d The defendant asserts that <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>dictates that \u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411 are \u201cquite clearly a protection for the rights of the insured, but <em>only </em>the insured.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We refuse to read either <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>or \u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411 so narrowly. The Supreme Court\u2019s comments in <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>were appropriate for the facts of the case, where it was the insured who sought appraisal. The reasoning is equally applicable here, where the insurer seeks judicial assistance to compel a reluctant insured to proceed with appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff\u2019s application because the plaintiff presented no evidence of an appraisal agreement or of a dispute as to the value of the loss. As noted previously, because the issue of arbitrability ultimately is a question of fact, our review is limited to a determination of whether the finding of the trial court was clearly erroneous. See <em>A. Dubrueil &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Libson, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 608-609; <em>Stelco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bette, </em>supra, 2 Conn. App. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In its application to compel appraisal, the plaintiff alleged the existence of a contract of insurance, which provided that \u201cif the [defendant] and the [plaintiff] should fail to agree on the amount of the loss, either party may demand that these amounts be determined by appraisal.\u201d The plaintiff also alleged that it and the defendant disputed the value of the loss. In her answer and at the show cause hearing, the defendant failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>deny the existence of the appraisal agreement. The defendant now alleges that the parties actually agreed as to the value of the loss, but the record clearly indicates that the trial court could have reasonably found that a dispute existed. Consequently, we conclude that the court properly determined that an appraisal of the value of the loss was necessary so that the plaintiff could make payment to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-13\"> While Edward Clinton and Judith Clinton were the two defendants in the underlying action, only Judith Clinton, hereinafter the defendant, has appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-5\"> The appraisal clause provided: \u201cIf [the insured] and [the insurer] fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, [the insured] or [the insurer] may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the residence premises is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire.

On , 19 , the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a written agreement for arbitration, of which exhibit A, hereto attached, is a copy. 2. The defendant has neglected and refused to perform the agreement for arbitration, although the plaintiff is ready and willing to perform the agreement.

A person so appointed an arbitrator or umpire shall act under any arbitration agreement with the same force and effect as if he had been specifically named or referred to therein.

The central issue raised by a petition to compel arbitration is whether the reluctant party has agreed to arbitrate the particular question in dispute.

We construe this to be a claim that the plaintiff has waived its right to appraisal because of an unjustifiable delay. A review of the record convinces us that, as in <em>Batter Building Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschner, </em>supra, 142 Conn. 13, we cannot conclude that, \u201cas a matter of law, the time between the ripening of the dispute and the demand for arbitration was unreasonable and that the [plaintiff] consequently waived [its] right to insist upon arbitration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
