J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad6\">The defendant state commission on human rights and opportunities appeals from the trial court\u2019s granting of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a. The commission claims that (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff\u2019s motion because it was filed nearly five months after the final judgment was rendered, (2) the plaintiff is barred from recovering attorney\u2019s fees and expenses because she failed to request them in her appeal petition, and (3) the amount requested by the plaintiff and granted by the trial court was unreasonable under the facts and circumstances of this case. The attorney general has submitted a brief as amicus curiae. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Certain facts are relevant to this appeal. The underlying action is a sex discrimination case filed with the commission by the plaintiff against her employer, the defendant state judicial branch. The plaintiff alleged in her complaint that she was hired in December, 1989, as a \u201cMaintenance Administrator,\u201d and discovered shortly thereafter that she had been given the title \u201cAssociate Maintenance Administrator,\u201d that two males had been hired at about the same time with the title \u201cMaintenance Administrator,\u201d and that the two males with the superior title were compensated at a salary higher than that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff farther alleged that all three positions require the same knowledge, skill and abilities, and that, therefore, the judicial branch had discriminated against her on the basis of sex and had denied her equal pay for equal work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 (a), 46a-60 (a) (1), 46a-70 (a) and 31-75, and in violation of Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the federal Equal Pay Act of 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Upon receipt of the plaintiffs complaint, the commission commenced its investigation. In early February, 1991, a commission investigator concluded that there was no reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory practice had occurred and prepared a draft finding to that effect. In his draft finding, the investigator recommended that the complaint be dismissed for lack of evidence. The investigator gave the draft finding to his supervisor, who forwarded it to the plaintiff with a cover letter advising the plaintiff that she had fourteen days to comment on the draft finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Upon receipt of the draft finding, the plaintiff requested that the commission give her copies of all evidence produced in connection with her case. The commission investigator sent the plaintiff copies of that evidence. The plaintiff then submitted her comments on the draft finding to the commission. The commission supervisor notified the plaintiff that her comments had been received and would be reviewed to determine if additional investigation or a change in the draft finding would be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">After reviewing the plaintiffs comments, the commission investigator telephoned the plaintiffs supervisor at the judicial branch to discuss the plaintiffs comments. The plaintiff\u2019s supervisor asked the investigator to fax him a copy of the comments. Upon reviewing the plaintiff\u2019s comments, the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor faxed the investigator a memorandum in which he set forth his responses to the plaintiff\u2019s comments on the draft finding. The plaintiff\u2019s supervisor claimed in this memorandum that the plaintiff refused to follow department procedure for handling maintenance jobs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>and that maintenance problems had developed \u201cbecause of [the plaintiff\u2019s] continual overextension of her authority .. . .\u201d The memorandum also discussed the plaintiff\u2019s job title as printed on business cards, in the judicial branch directory, and on monthly report forms, and that the plaintiff\u2019s personnel file would be \u201cmarked to reflect\u201d her \u201cbeing insubordinate.\u201d Finally, the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor questioned the impartiality of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">After faxing his memorandum to the commission investigator, the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor telephoned him and requested that the substance of his memorandum not be included in any response that the investigator might make to the plaintiff\u2019s comments because the statements in the memorandum were \u201csubjective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The investigator placed the memorandum in the commission case file, but did not tell the plaintiff about it or about his telephone conversations with the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor. Instead, he wrote his own memorandum to the commission supervisor rebutting the plaintiff\u2019s comments on the draft finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">A few days later, the commission supervisor wrote to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to acknowledge receipt of the plaintiff\u2019s comments and to advise the attorney that the commission supervisor and the investigator had determined that further investigation was not warranted. She further advised the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that she would endorse and forward to the commission the investigator\u2019s recommendation that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed. She did not mention the memorandum from the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Shortly thereafter, the commission issued its \u201cFinding of No Cause and Summary,\u201d which is almost iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tical to the draft finding and which recommends dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint for lack of evidence. By letter dated March 28,1991, the chairperson of the commission notified the plaintiff that she had accepted the recommendation to dismiss the complaint for lack of sufficient evidence and that the plaintiff could'apply for reconsideration of the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The plaintiff requested reconsideration of the dismissal of her complaint. After reviewing the request, a commission staff attorney recommended dismissal of the complaint. The chairperson approved this recommendation and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On July 23,1991, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 on several grounds<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and requested that her case be remanded to the commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs petition further requested \u201c[s]uch other relief as the court may deem fair and equitable.\u201d After her appeal was filed, the plaintiff learned of the ex parte communication between the commission investigator and the plaintiffs supervisor, and on December 11,1991, moved to supplement the agency record by showing that there were procedural irregularities in the commission\u2019s handling of her complaint. The motion was granted and a hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>held at which the plaintiff produced evidence concerning the commission investigator\u2019s ex parte communication with the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In a memorandum of decision dated September 3, 1992, the court ruled that the commission had violated General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 46a-83 (b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>in investigating the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and that the violation had substantially prejudiced the plaintiff\u2019s right to a fair investigation and resolution of her complaint. The court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and remanded the case pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for a new investigation of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">On February 3,1993, the plaintiff filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a, claiming that she was entitled to compensation for 96.2 hours of work billed at the rate of $150 an hour, plus costs of $473.20, for a total of $14,903.37. The plaintiff requested $7500, the maximum amount allowed by \u00a7 4-184a. The commission filed an objection, challenging the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover fees and expenses on several grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>branch also filed an objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On September 20,1993, the Superior Court ruled for the plaintiff and found the requested amount of $14,903.37 to be reasonable, but reduced the award to $7500, the maximum amount allowed by \u00a7 4-184a. The commission thereafter filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Our standard of review differs for the commission\u2019s three claims. Because the issues of whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s motion five months after the final judgment was rendered, and whether a party may waive fees under \u00a7 4-184a by not expressly requesting them in the petition to the Superior Court raise questions of law rather than fact, those issues are subject to our plenary review. <em>Gateway Co. </em>v. <em>DiNoia, </em>232 Conn. 223, 229, 654 A.2d 342 (1995); <em>Langan </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>37 Conn. App. 105, 112, 655 A.2d 771 (1995). With regard to the commission\u2019s claim that the amount the trial court awarded the plaintiff was unreasonable, this court has in other contexts held that the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Kovac, </em>36 Conn. App. 270, 279, 650 A.2d 626 (1994). The plain language of \u00a7 4-184a (a) (2) provides that a court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cnot in excess of seven thousand five hundred dollars . . . reasonably incurred in opposing the agency action . . . .\u201d \u201c \u2018In deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>mining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, an appellate court should entertain every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d Id., 277. The commission\u2019s third claim, therefore, will be reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We first address the commission\u2019s argument that because the plaintiff filed her motion for attorney\u2019s fees nearly five months after the judgment sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was rendered, the motion was time barred and the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Section 4-184a (b) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]n any appeal by an aggrieved person of an agency decision taken in accordance with section 4-183 and in any appeal of the final judgment of the superior court . . . the court may, in its discretion, award to the prevailing party, other than the agency, reasonable fees and expenses in addition to other costs if the court determines that the action of the agency was undertaken without any substantial justification.\u201d This statute provides no express time limitation for the filing of requests for these fees. Moreover, there are no published decisions in Connecticut addressing the timeliness of such motions. This issue, therefore, is one of first impression in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The commission makes several arguments to support its claim that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction to consider the motion five months after final judgment was rendered. In its brief, the commission urges us to adopt the four month limitation applicable to certain postjudgment motions provided by Practice Book \u00a7 326<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>and General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The commission notes that the Supreme Court has adopted this four month limitation in other contexts. See <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 284-87, 618 A.2d 1 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 437, 507 A.2d 1367 (1986). The commission also argues in its primary brief that administrative appeals are occasionally treated as civil actions for various purposes; see <em>Haylett </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>207 Conn. 547, 548, 541 A.2d 494 (1988) (return date); <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356-57, 514 A.2d 749 (1986) (may use civil summons to initiate administrative appeal rather than citation); and that this appeal should also be treated as a civil action. In its reply brief and at oral argument, however, the commission abandoned that position and adopted the position advocated in the amicus brief that this court should adopt a thirty day time limit on \u00a7 4-184a motions in accordance with rule 9 (f) of the Local Rules of Civil Procedure for the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The commission urges that a ruling by this court that the trial court here did have jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff\u2019s motion is tantamount to a ruling that trial courts have unlimited and indefinite jurisdiction over postjudgment motions filed under \u00a7 4-184a, even though in other contexts, absent the filing of an appeal or a motion to open the judgment, the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction expires after four months, unless there has been a waiver by the parties. The commission asserts that because both it and the judicial branch filed objections to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, there was no waiver of this four month limitation here. The commission also notes the strong public interest in the finality of legal proceedings, and that, because as a practical matter costs cannot be assessed until after the judgment, there cannot be an unlimited time in which the prevailing party can file a motion to recover those costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The commission finally argues that because \u00a7 4-184a contains two significant departures from the common law, it must be strictly construed, which counsels against a broad reading of the right to recovery under the statute. The two departures to which the commission refers are the general principle that each litigant bears the cost of his own suit and the rule of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Although the commission has raised important policy considerations, we find the plaintiff\u2019s arguments more persuasive. The plaintiff argues that the award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4-184a is a matter within the discretion of the trial court, and, further, that neither the rules of practice nor the federal rules should dictate the timeliness of motions made under \u00a7 4-184a. The plaintiff claims that the award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4-184a cannot interfere with the merits or the finality of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The plaintiff primarily relies on the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, </em>445 U.S. 445, 102 S. Ct. 1162, 71 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1982). <em>White </em>addressed the issue of the timeliness of a postjudgment request for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue presented to the court in <em>White </em>was whether the plaintiff\u2019s postjudgment request for an attorney\u2019s fee award under \u00a7 1988, filed four and one-half months after judgment was entered, was subject to the ten day limitation of rule 59 (e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s original complaint in <em>White, </em>as here, did not specifically request attorney\u2019s fees, but did request \u201csuch other and further relief as may be equitable and just.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept, of Employment Security, </em>supra, 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The court in <em>White </em>held that \u201ca request for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action \u2014 issues to which Rule 59 (e) was never intended to apply. Section 1988 provides for awards of attorney\u2019s fees only to a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 Regardless of when attorney\u2019s fees are requested, the court\u2019s decision of entitlement to fees will therefore require an inquiry separate from the decision on the merits \u2014 an inquiry that cannot even commence until one party has \u2018prevailed.\u2019 \u201d Id., 451-52. The court also noted that \u00a7 1988 \u201cauthorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u2018in [the] discretion\u2019 of the court. . . . This discretion will support a denial of fees in cases in which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>postjudgment motion unfairly surprises or prejudices the affected party. . . . [T]he district courts remain free to adopt local rules establishing timeliness standards for the filing of claims for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Id., 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">We agree with the plaintiff that the attorney\u2019s fees provided for in \u00a7 1988 are similar to those provided for in \u00a7 4-184a in that they are unaffected by the merits of the action, requiring an inquiry separate from the judgment itself, and their award is a matter entirely within the discretion of the trial court. The trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion filed under \u00a7 4-184a does not open, modify, or in any way affect the judgment. It is therefore inappropriate to apply time limitations that govern these types of motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">We hold that postjudgment motions under \u00a7 4-184a must be filed within a reasonable time of the entering of the final judgment, and that the determination of whether such a motion has been filed within a reasonable time is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. The commission conceded at oral argument before this court that five months could be a reasonable amount of time in which to file a motion for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4-184a, but that in the present case it was an unreasonable amount of time because the commission had no notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for fees. We disagree with this position because the statute gives notice that such fees may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In this case, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s motion almost five months after the rendering of the final judgment because neither objection filed by the defendants claimed unfair prejudice or surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The commission\u2019s next claim is that because the plaintiff did not expressly request attorney\u2019s fees in her appeal from the dismissal of her claim of sex discrimination, she waived her right to them. The commission reiterates its argument that \u00a7 4-184a is in derogation of both the general rule requiring parties to pay their own attorney\u2019s fees and the rule of sovereign immunity, and that, therefore, a party seeking fees under \u00a7 4-184a must specifically plead and prove that the agency action was undertaken without substantial justification. The commission also argues that had it known that the plaintiff was going to request fees under \u00a7 4-184a, it would have appealed from the trial court\u2019s remand of the plaintiff's complaint, and that, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to request the attorney\u2019s fees in her petition to the Superior Court effectively deprived it of proper notice of the full extent of its potential liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded under \u00a7 4-184a only \u201cif the court determines that the action of the agency was undertaken without any substantial justification.\u201d In both the September 3, 1992 memorandum of decision remanding the plaintiff\u2019s complaint to the commission and the September 20,1993 memorandum of decision awarding the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court cites with disapproval the commission\u2019s ex parte communication with the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor and the commission\u2019s failure to disclose to the plaintiff the supervisor\u2019s memorandum, contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s statutory right under \u00a7 46a-23 to review and comment on all adverse evidence in the agency file. The September 20, 1993 memorandum of decision makes a clear finding that the commission\u2019s actions with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the plaintiffs supervisor and his memorandum were taken without substantial justification. The commission makes no attempt to refute this finding, but rather argues that the plaintiffs request for attorney\u2019s fees should have been made in her appeal petition or in an amended appeal petition, and that her failure to make the request in that form and at that time constitutes a waiver of those fees. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">At the time she filed her appeal petition in July, 1991, the plaintiff was unaware of either the commission\u2019s ex parte communication with her supervisor or of the existence of a memorandum written by that supervisor in the agency file. It was, therefore, impossible for her to include allegations of those particular procedural irregularities, which eventually became the subject of the award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4-184a. In December, 1991, the plaintiff brought the commission\u2019s actions to the court\u2019s attention by way of a motion to supplement the agency record, and it is clear that the trial court decided both to remand the case and to award attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing on that motion. The commission should not be allowed to rely on the fact that its inappropriate actions were disclosed after the filing of the appeal petition to preclude relief to this plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Furthermore, we agree with the plaintiff that the allegation that the commission\u2019s actions were taken without substantial justification was implicit in her appeal petition. The appeal petition alleges, among other things, that the commission failed to take into account the plaintiff\u2019s comments and evidence, and that the commission\u2019s \u201cinvestigation and handling of plaintiff\u2019s complaint was perfunctory, arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.\u201d These allegations were sufficient to alert the commission that attorney\u2019s fees could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>be sought under \u00a7 4-184a (b) if a court found that \u201cthe action of the agency was undertaken without any substantial justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u201c[I]t is not essential to the sufficiency of a complaint alleging a statutory cause of action that the precise terms of the applicable statute \u2018be either counted upon or recited.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Bank, </em>219 Conn. 465, 470, 594 A.2d 1 (1991). Moreover, complaints must be construed in the manner most favorable to sustaining their legal sufficiency. Id., 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Finally, we agree with the plaintiff that her request for \u201c[s]uch other relief as the court may deem fair and equitable\u201d entitled her to an award of attorney\u2019s fees within the discretion of the trial court. In Connecticut, absent statutory or contractual authorization, attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable, and absent such authorization, a trial court may not award attorney\u2019s fees where a party has requested \u201csuch other relief as the court deems appropriate.\u201d <em>Plikus </em>v. <em>Plikus, </em>26 Conn. App. 174, 179, 599 A.2d 392 (1991). Here, however, \u00a7 4-184a provides clear statutory authorization for the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Because neither the commission nor the defendant judicial branch claimed unfair prejudice or surprise, and because \u00a7 4-184a provides clear statutory authority for the discretionary award of attorney\u2019s fees, we hold that the plaintiff\u2019s request for \u201csuch other relief\u201d entitled her to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4-184a within the court\u2019s discretion, and that the failure expressly to plead entitlement under \u00a7 4-184a was not a waiver of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Reasonableness of Award</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Finally, the commission argues that the amount requested by and awarded to the plaintiff was unreasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>If a trial court finds under \u00a7 4-184a (b) that the action of the agency was \u201cundertaken without any substantial justification,\u201d the court may, \u201cin its discretion,\u201d a vard \u201creasonable fees and expenses in addition to other costs . . . .\u201d Section 4-184a (a) (2) defines reasonable fees and expenses as \u201cany expenses not in excess of seven thousand five hundred dollars which the court finds were reasonably incurred in opposing the agency action, including court costs, expenses incurred in administrative proceedings, attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees of all necessary witnesses, and such other expenses as were reasonably incurred.\u201d The plaintiff here requested, and the court awarded, the maximum amount of $7500. The commission argues that this amount was unreasonable because the plaintiff prevailed on only one of the issues raised in her appeal petition. The commission also implies that the trial court did not give this matter careful consideration, but merely gave a \u201crubber stamp\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Where a statute contains no standard by which a court is to award attorney\u2019s fees, it is left \u201cto the sole discretion of the trial court to determine if attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded and the amount of such an award.\u201d <em>Staehle </em>v. <em>Michael\u2019s Garage, Inc., </em>35 Conn. App. 455, 461, 646 A.2d 888 (1994). \u201c \u2018The amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has abused its discretion: \u201cA court has few duties of a more delicate nature than that of fixing counsel fees. The degree of delicacy increases when the matter becomes one of review on appeal. The principle of law, which is easy to state but difficult at times to apply, is that only in case of a clear abuse of discretion by the trier may we interfere. . . . The trier is always in more advantageous position to evaluate the services of counsel than are we.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ruwet-Sibley Equipment Corp. </em>v. <em>Steb-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>bins, </em>15 Conn.
