We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The record discloses the following pertinent facts, as recited by the state\u2019s attorney in court and in the presence of the defendant prior to his plea. An associate of the defendant, Eric Amato, had been storing a quantity of cocaine at an apartment in West Haven. The residents of that apartment were Hope Vaughn and Joanne Bailey. On October 18,1990, Vaughn stole the cocaine and took it to the apartment of Anthony Young. When Amato discovered that the drugs were missing, he and another person went to Bridgeport where they met Bailey. She denied any knowledge of the theft. Amato and the others were later joined by the defendant. They returned to West Haven that evening, where they encountered Vaughn. Their attempts to coerce Vaughn into divulging the whereabouts of the drugs were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The following morning, Amato and Bailey spoke to neighbors in the West Haven apartment, one of whom disclosed that she had observed a black woman placing bags into the trunk of a red Toyota. Amato concluded that Vaughn was the woman and that the car belonged to Young. Later that morning, Amato and the others, including the defendant, took Bailey and Vaughn to the front door of Young\u2019s apartment. The defendant was armed with a pistol. An altercation took place after the door was opened. Two people from inside the apartment were shot and killed by Amato. Bailey was also shot. The men neither entered the apartment nor retrieved the three and one-half pounds of cocaine that was later found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The defendant was convicted on his plea of guilty to the crime of attempted robbery in the first degree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Prior to sentencing, the defendant\u2019s counsel argued during a hearing on a motion to withdraw his plea that there had not been substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711 (l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant argued that the trial court had failed to include the definition of robbery when it addressed him. Specifically, the court failed to include, as part of that definition, the use or threat of the immediate use of force on another.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court acknowledged that it had not referred to robbery as larceny by force. It had indicated when addressing the defendant, however, that robbery in the first degree occurs when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery, \u201csomeone is armed with a deadly weapon.\u201d The court opined that this implies that some force was used, thereby distinguishing robbery in the first degree from a mere larceny. The court also noted that the state\u2019s recitation of the factual background of the crime was sufficient to notify the defendant of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court incorrectly failed to apprise him of an essential element of the crime charged. The defendant claims that the trial court, by accepting the guilty plea, failed in its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>stitutional obligation and in its obligation under Practice Book \u00a7 711. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that unless a plea of guilty is made knowingly and voluntarily, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore voidable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>23 Conn. App. 1, 3, 579 A.2d 560 (1990). A plea of guilty cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>176 Conn. 7, 9, 404 A.2d 871 (1978). These principles are in accord with Practice Book \u00a7 711 (1) et seq.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cThe fact that an allegation of noncompliance with [a rule of practice] may sometimes have constitutional dimensions does not . . . establish the existence of such a constitutional nexus in every case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 776, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991). Precise compliance with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7711 and 712, which govern the canvassing of a defendant\u2019s guilty pleas, is not constitutionally required. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 418, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). Our Supreme Court has indicated that \u201c[w]here there has been a substantial compliance with [\u00a7 711], such that none of the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected rights has been infringed upon, the failure to comply with each and every requirement of [\u00a7 711] does not automatically require the vacating of the defendant\u2019s plea. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>197 Conn. 337, 346, 497 A.2d 390 (1985). Moreover, due process does not mandate a factual basis inquiry. <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>203 Conn. 484, 491, 525 A.2d 1315 (1987). The <em>Paulsen </em>court quoted approvingly from <em>Willbright </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>745 F.2d 779, 780 (2d Cir. 1984), in which the court stated that \u201c[t]he voluntariness of a plea of guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>. . . should be determined by considering all of the relevant circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We must consider all of the relevant circumstances to determine whether the defendant had a full understanding of the nature of the charge to which he was entering a plea. For that plea to have been knowing and intelligent, the record must show that constitutional standards were satisfied and that there was substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilnite, </em>202 Conn. 369, 383, 521 A.2d 547 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">It is the duty of the trial court to comply with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 711. <em>State </em>v. <em>Elijah, </em>34 Conn. App. 595, 597, 642 A.2d 735, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 907, 648 A.2d 157 (1994). Substantial compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 711 does not require that the trial court read the statute to the defendant if there are other reasons to believe that the defendant understands the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>220 Conn. 6, 14, 595 A.2d 851 (1991). The court could reasonably have concluded that the defendant understood the statute on the bases of what the court had informed him and the factual recitation of the nature of the crime placed in the record.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court informed the defendant, in part, that \u201cin the commission of said robbery, someone is armed with a deadly weapon\u201d and that \u201cif a robbery is going to be committed and one of the participants had a deadly weapon, it\u2019s a robbery one, subsection two.\u201d While this does not specifically inform the defendant that \u00a7 53a-133 requires the use of physical force on another or the threatened immediate use of physical force on another, the concept of being armed with a deadly weapon, by its very nature, was sufficient to convey to the defendant that the crime of robbery in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>degree included the use or threatened use of physical force on another. Also, the state\u2019s recitation of the underlying facts, in the defendant\u2019s presence, conveyed to the defendant the nature of the crime. The state\u2019s recitation explicitly described a scenario in which several men, including the defendant, who was armed with a pistol, went to an apartment to retrieve drugs. One of the men shot and killed two occupants of the apartment. This recitation provided the defendant with \u201creal notice\u201d of the nature of the crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 43, 470 A.2d 688 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The defendant asks that we consider our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, 454 A.2d 1274 (1983), as determinative that the court\u2019s omission was not inconsequential in that it was a failure to apprise the defendant of an element critical to the offense. In <em>Childree, </em>the defendant claimed that the trial court failed to apprise him of an element critical to the offense of first degree larceny, i.e., a threat of physical injury to some person in the future. Id., 118. After a comparison of the trial court\u2019s definition of first degree larceny with the statutory definition, the court concluded that the critical element of \u201cfuture harm\u201d was not made clear to the defendant. As stated earlier, we conclude that, in this case, the critical elements of the crime of robbery in the first degree were conveyed to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We conclude, on the basis of our review of the record, that the defendant understood the nature of the crime and was aware of the elements of the crime of attempted robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\"> During jury selection, a plea agreement was fashioned and, on November 5,1993, the defendant pleaded guilty to a substitute information alleging one count of attempted robbery in the first degree. He had been charged with two counts of capital felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (8), two counts of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).
