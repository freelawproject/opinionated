J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjN\">This appeal is taken by Zolt\u00e1n Gutt-man, one of the defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a foreclosure action, from a deficiency judgment rendered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Guttman raises two claims. First, he claims that General Statutes \u00a7 49-14,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Connecticut\u2019s deficiency judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ment statute, violates his state constitutional right to trial by jury by limiting the determination of damages to a court hearing. Second, he claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiff mortgagee acted reasonably despite an allegedly considerable delay in proceeding to judgment. We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Certain facts are relevant to this appeal. In 1987, the defendants executed a mortgage deed on property they owned to Connecticut Bank and Trust Company (CBT). In January, 1989, Guttman transferred his interest in the property to Voll. In March, 1990, the defendants defaulted on their obligations to make payment on the debt evidenced by a promissory note and secured by the mortgaged property, and, in the fall of 1990, CBT commenced a foreclosure action. In January, 1991, CBT was declared insolvent. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed receiver of CBT, and conveyed CBT\u2019s assets to a bridge bank, New Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, N.A. (New CBT). By motion filed in April, 1991, New CBT was substituted as the plaintiff in the foreclosure action against the defendants. In the same motion, the plaintiff demanded that the defendants disclose a defense. The defendants did not disclose any defense. In July, 1991, FDIC was appointed as receiver of New CBT. The FDIC was substituted as plaintiff in the foreclosure action by motion dated April, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Also in July, 1991, Voll filed for bankruptcy. That same month, the attorney for Guttman withdrew his appearance. The stay with respect to the bankruptcy proceedings was lifted in February, 1992. Shortly thereafter, new counsel for Guttman entered an appearance. In April, 1992, the FDIC filed a motion for default for failure to disclose a defense against the defendants, which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">On June 26, 1992, the trial court rendered a judgment of dismissal for dormancy pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251. The dismissal was subsequently opened and the case returned to the docket pursuant to the FDIC\u2019s motion dated August 7, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In October, 1993, the FDIC moved for a judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendants did not oppose the motion for judgment, assert the equitable defense of laches, or object to the inclusion of interest in the judgment debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">On November 2, 1993, the court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure. The court found a debt of $506,626.07, and awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $3250, and title search fees of $150, for a total debt of $513,776.07. Law days were set to commence on January 25,1994. The defendants did not seek to reargue the motion for judgment or to open the judgment, and did not appeal from the judgment of strict foreclosure. The defendants did not redeem on their law days, and title to the mortgaged property vested in the FDIC on January 29, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">On January 31, 1994, the FDIC moved for a deficiency judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-14. The defendants did not claim that motion to the jury trial list, or tender a jury fee to the clerk of the court. Guttman did file an objection to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, however, arguing that (1) the Connecticut deficiency judgment statute deprived him of his constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>right to a jury trial, (2) the FDIC had unreasonably delayed proceeding to a judgment and, therefore, a deficiency judgment would not be equitable, (3) the remedy of a deficiency judgment should not be available against him because he had transferred his interest in the property to Voll before the start of the foreclosure action, and (4) the FDIC had waived its right to proceed to a deficiency judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The court found that deficiency procedures in Connecticut were not unconstitutional and did not violate Guttman\u2019s right to a jury trial because a deficiency hearing is part of an equitable foreclosure action. The court also rejected Guttman\u2019s defense of unreasonable delay by the FDIC, specifically finding that the FDIC had not caused any unreasonable or inexcusable delay,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, even if it had, Guttman\u2019s claim of undue delay had not been timely asserted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also found that \u00a7 49-14 does not by its terms limit the authority to enter a deficiency judgment against only the obligors who were owners of the property at the time of the foreclosure proceedings and that Guttman\u2019s previous failure to contest the debt during the foreclosure proceedings barred him from claiming that the FDIC had no right to obtain a deficiency judgment against him. Finally, the court found that there was no evidence that the FDIC had waived its right to a deficiency judgment against Guttman.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The court found the total debt as of the day title vested in the FDIC to be $613,423.59, which included principal, interest, attorney\u2019s fees, appraisal fees, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>title search fees that had been awarded at the time of the judgment of strict foreclosure, plus additional interest, attorney\u2019s fees, costs and real estate taxes encumbering the property. The court also found the value of the property on the date that title vested in the FDIC to be $230,000, leaving a deficiency of $383,423.59. A deficiency judgment against Guttman in that amount was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Constitutional Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Guttman attacks the constitutionality of \u00a7 49-14 on the ground that it deprives him of his right to a jury trial under article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution. Before we begin our analysis, we note that \u201c[a] party who challenges the constitutionality of a statute \u2018bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and we indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Merdinger, </em>37 Conn. App. 379, 382, 655 A.2d 1167 (1995). In addition to showing that \u00a7 49-14 is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, Guttman must show that \u2018\u2018its effect or impact on him adversely affects a constitutionally protected right which he has.\u201d <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 569, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979). Finally, \u201c[w]hile the courts may declare a statute to be unconstitutional, our power to do this should \u2018be exercised with caution, and in no doubtful case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fair Cadillac-Oldsmobile Isuzu Partnership </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>229 Conn. 312, 316, 640 A.2d 101 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201c[T]he area of fundamental civil liberties . . . includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution . . . .\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 641, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). Article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>trial by jury shall remain inviolate . . . .\u201d This particular clause has been in existence since 1818, the year Connecticut adopted its constitution. See W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution, A Reference Guide (1993), p. 75. Article first, \u00a7 19, has been held to provide two basic rights. First, it provides for the right to a trial by jury for those cases that were triable, or that are similar to cases that were triable, by jury in 1818. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 49-53, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). Second, it protects the jury trial from procedural changes that in fact change the substance of the institution. <em>Spitzer </em>v. <em>Haims &amp; Co., </em>217 Conn. 532, 539-41, 587 A.2d 105 (1991). \u201cBecause at common law only legal claims were tried to a jury, the state constitutional right to a trial by jury does not extend to equitable claims.\u201d <em>Associated Investment Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Williams Associates IV, </em>230 Conn. 148,153, 645 A.2d 505 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u201c[I]n determining whether a party has a right to a trial by jury under the state constitution . . . we\u2018must ascertain whether the action being tried . . . has roots in the common law, and if so, whether the remedy involved was one in law or equity. If the action existed at common law and involved a legal remedy, the right to a jury trial exists and the legislature may not curtail that right either directly or indirectly.\u2019 \u201d Id., 153-54. \u201cConsequently, statutory actions established since the adoption of the constitution of 1818 ordinarily fall outside the scope of the provision, unless, perhaps, the new remedy constitutes a modification of existing remedies, so vital as to unduly limit and violate the right of trial by jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 154. \u201c \u2018The test is whether the issue raised in the action is substantially of the same nature or is such an issue as prior to 1818 would have been triable to a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Angliker, </em>211 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>370, 375, 559 A.2d 701 (1989). This testis \u201cflexible and may require a jury in a new cause of action, not in existence in [1818], if it involves rights and remedies of the sort traditionally enforced in an action at law or if its nearest historical analogue is an action at common law.\u201d Id., 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Guttman concedes that a deficiency judgment hearing is procedurally part of a foreclosure action, and that a foreclosure action is an equitable proceeding and is not triable to a jury. He argues, however, that a deficiency proceeding is analogous to a suit on a note, which was triable by jury in 1818, and, because the legislature has in \u00a7 49-14 tied the deficiency judgment action to an existing foreclosure case, his right to have the deficiency proceeding tried to a jury has been abrogated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Connecticut enacted its first deficiency judgment statute in 1833. <em>Farmers &amp; Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Durham Realty, Inc., </em>34 Conn. App. 204, 207, 640 A.2d 1017 (1994). Prior to 1818, therefore, there was no such proceeding. \u201c \u2018At common law, a mortgagee was required to elect between a foreclosure action or an action on the underlying debt.\u2019 \u201d <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>227 Conn. 270, 278 n.10, 630 A.2d 1010 (1993). If the mortgagee recovered successfully on the debt, \u201cthe mortgage [was] released. If [the mortgagee chose] to take the land and to make it his own absolutely, whereby the mortgagor [was] totally divested of his equity of redemption, the debt [was] thereby paid and discharged: And if it eventually prove[d] insufficient to raise the sum due, it [was] the mortgagee\u2019s own fault, and at his risk.\u201d <em>M\u2019Ewen </em>v. <em>Welles, </em>1 Root (Conn.) 202, 203 (1790).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">It was, therefore, precisely because the entry of judgment of foreclosure precluded any further common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>proceedings on the note that the legislature in 1833 created the remedy of the deficiency judgment as the only available means of satisfying a mortgage debt when the security was inadequate to make the plaintiff whole. <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 278 n.10, citing D. Caron, Connecticut Foreclosures (2d Ed. 1989) \u00a7 9.05A, p. 158. In other words, the 1833 statute lifted the bar at common law on any further action on the mortgage debt after foreclosure. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Associates, </em>233 Conn. 153, 164-65, 659 A.2d 138 (1995); <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>122 Conn. 451, 454, 190 A. 616 (1937). Guttman\u2019s argument, therefore, that an action on a promissory note is the historical analogue of a deficiency proceeding is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The common law rule requiring a creditor to choose between an action at law on the note and an action at equity by foreclosing remains in effect. \u201cIt is well established that a mortgagee has two separate and distinct causes of action against a defaulting mortgagor. A mortgagee may pursue an action at law for the amount due on the promissory note, or it may pursue its remedy in equity and foreclose on the mortgage. . . . The mortgagee may also pursue both of these remedies simultaneously in one consolidated foreclosure suit. . . . The only restriction on the mortgagee\u2019s election of remedies is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 49-1, which provides that \u2018[t]he foreclosure of a mortgage is a bar to any further action upon the mortgage debt, note or obligation against the person or persons who are liable for the payment thereof who are made parties to the foreclosure . . . .\u2019General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 furnishes an exception to \u00a7 49-1 by providing that, \u2018[a]t any time within thirty days after the time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment.\u2019 . . . Thus, a mortgagee who elects to pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>his right of foreclosure of a mortgage and his right to obtain payment of a promissory note may also, in the same action, seek a deficiency judgment. When a deficiency judgment is sought, the plaintiff may recover the difference between the amount due on the underlying debt and the amount received upon foreclosure.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Bilmor Building Corp., </em>28 Conn. App. 809, 816-17, 614 A.2d 456 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We recognize that deficiency proceedings are in some respects functionally similar to actions on promissory notes because both enable a creditor to collect the full amount owed him by a debtor. This court has in the past stated that \u201cthe deficiency judgment procedure, although procedurally a part of the foreclosure action, serves the separate function of providing for recovery on the balance of the note which was not satisfied by the strict foreclosure\u201d and that \u201cthe deficiency judgment is the functional equivalent of a suit upon the note . . . <em>.\u201d Maresca v. DeMatteo, </em>6 Conn. App. 691, 696, 506 A.2d 1096 (1986). Furthermore, our Supreme Court has compared deficiency judgment hearings to suits for collection. <em>Eichman v. J&amp;J Building Co., </em>216 Conn. 443, 453, 582 A.2d 182 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">As shown in the legislative history, however, deficiency proceedings are not, and never have been, independent actions on the debt. Rather, they are \u201cpart of the main foreclosure suit.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Bilmor Building Corp., </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 822. A deficiency judgment proceeding is a part of the foreclosure action, but is distinct from, although dependent on, the common law, nonstatutory process of strict foreclosure. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Associates, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 172. It is \u201ccomplementary to, the traditional and equitable common law action.\u201d Id., 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">A deficiency proceeding is not an independent action because \u201ca request for a deficiency judgment in a fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>closure action is brought by written motion and not by service of process. ... A deficiency judgment provides a means for a mortgagee to recover any balance due on the mortgage note that was not satisfied by the foreclosure judgment. ... It is the \u2018only means of satisfying a mortgage debt when the security is inadequate to make the foreclosing plaintiff whole.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Bilmore Building Corp., </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 822. Furthermore, a deficiency proceeding has a very limited purpose. \u201cIn the hearing contemplated under \u00a7 49-14 to obtain a deficiency judgment, the court, after hearing the party\u2019s appraisers, determines the value of the property and calculates any deficiency. This deficiency judgment procedure presumes the amount of the debt as established by the foreclosure judgment and merely provides for a hearing on the value of the property.\u201d <em>First Bank </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>199 Conn. 368, 373, 507 A.2d 997 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Since the passage of the first deficiency judgment statute in 1833, the mortgagee\u2019s right to a deficiency judgment has always been coupled with some provision for fixing the actual value of the property as of the date of the foreclosure, as a basis of valuation for determining any claimed deficiency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>supra, 122 Conn. 454. The 1833 statute provided for a determination of this value by the court before which the action was pending. Id. This continued to be the function of the court until 1878, when it became the function of three \u201cdisinterested appraisers.\u201d Id., 454-55. So \u201cthat there might be no doubt that the court\u2019s function in determining value in all its aspects had been transferred to the appraisers, the act provided: \u2018such appraisal shall be final and conclusive as to the value of said mortgaged property.\u2019 \u201d Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>455. \u201cThe provision . . . first appearing in . . . the Revision of 1902, permitting the court to enter a judgment for the deficiency between the debt and the appraisal, was obviously to do away with the necessity of bringing a separate action to satisfy the debt, and in no way affected the power in the appraisers to determine the value of the mortgaged property. Thus, under the statute as it existed from 1833 to 1878, the court\u2019s determination of value was conclusive upon the parties because it was a question of fact which [our Supreme Court] would not review.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In 1979, however, the procedure that allowed disinterested appraisers to determine the value of the property was declared unconstitutional because there was no hearing at which the defendant could present evidence as to value. <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 576-77, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979). The statute was declared unconstitutional on the ground that the failure to provide for an eviden-tiary hearing violated due process. The legislature accordingly amended the statute to provide that the court hears evidence on the value of the property from both parties and establishes a conclusive valuation of the property. That amendment resulted in the present \u00a7 49-14. <em>Bank of Stamford </em>v. <em>Alaimo, </em>31 Conn. App. 1, 7, 622 A.2d 1057 (1993). The defendant\u2019s reliance <em>on Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>supra, 576-77, to bolster his claim that \u00a7 49-14 violates his right to a jury trial is therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">As discussed previously, in an action on a promissory note, unlike in the deficiency judgment procedure, the issues of whether any debt is owing and, if so, the amount of the debt owed must be resolved. Those issues, not the issue of property value, are resolved by a jury in an action on a note. In a deficiency proceeding, however, the judgment of foreclosure has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>determined that a debt is owed and the amount of that debt. Those issues are not relitigated in the deficiency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The mere fact, therefore, that a deficiency proceeding may result in a personal judgment against the debtor for the amount of the debt unsatisfied by the foreclosed property does not convert that portion of the equitable foreclosure proceedings into an action at law. We conclude that because a deficiency proceeding is not substantially similar to any common law claim triable to a jury in 1818, Guttman\u2019s claim that \u00a7 49-14 violates article first, \u00a7 19, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Laches</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Guttman claims that the trial court improperly found that the FDIC acted reasonably despite the length of time it took the FDIC and its predecessors to proceed to judgment. Guttman argues that the. delays were unreasonable because, during the three years between the filing of the complaint and the motion for strict foreclosure, the debt substantially increased while the value of the property substantially decreased. Essentially, Guttman is asserting the equitable doctrine of laches. We are not persuaded, and, even if we were, we conclude that Guttman\u2019s claim of laches was untimely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u201cLaches consists of an inexcusable delay which prejudices the defendant.\u201d <em>Danaher </em>v. <em>C. N. Flagg &amp; Co., </em>181 Conn. 101, 107, 434 A.2d 944 (1980). \u201cLaches consists of two elements. First, there must have been a delay that was inexcusable, and, second, that delay must have prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>Kurzatkowski </em>v. <em>Kurzatkowski, </em>142 Conn. 680, 684-85, 116 A.2d 906 (1955). Absent prejudice to the defendant, the mere lapse of time does not constitute laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201cA conclusion that a plaintiff has been guilty of laches is one of fact for the trier and not one that can be made by this court, unless the subordinate facts found make such a conclusion inevitable as a matter of law.\u201d Id., 684. We cannot say as a matter of law that the trial court was compelled on the facts of this case to conclude that the FDIC had lost its rights against Gutt-man by laches. Nor can we say that the trial court\u2019s findings that most of the delays were beyond the control of the FDIC, and that, although the FDIC could have minimized some of the delays, none was so long as to be unreasonable are unsupported by the record. In fact, some delay in these proceedings was inevitable because there were two federal receiverships and a bankruptcy proceeding against one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Moreover, at no time during the foreclosure proceedings did Guttman claim that he had been prejudiced by any of the delays.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At a minimum, Guttman could have filed an answer asserting the doctrine of laches, or asserted the doctrine when New CBT moved that the defendants disclose a defense, or objected to the calculation of debt at the time the FDIC moved for a judgment of foreclosure. Defenses that could have been raised during the foreclosure proceedings may not be raised at the deficiency hearing. <em>Vignot </em>v. <em>Bank of Mystic, </em>32 Conn. App. 309, 314, 628 A.2d 1339 (1993); <em>Bank of Stamford </em>v. <em>Alaimo, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Guttman\u2019s claim, therefore, that the trial court should have used the equitable doctrine of laches to preclude the FDIC from moving for a deficiency judgment, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-11\"> The defendants whose mortgage was foreclosed are Joseph Voll and Zolt\u00e1n Guttman. As used in this appeal, the defendants refers to Voll and Guttman. Other parties claiming interests in the property are John Wendler, the city of Bridgeport and Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, N. A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-14 (a) provides: \u201cAt any time within thirty days after the time limited for redemption has expired, any party to a mortgage foreclosure may file a motion seeking a deficiency judgment.

Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen days following the filing of the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>except as the court may otherwise order.
