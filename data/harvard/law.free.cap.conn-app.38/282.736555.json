The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury verdict, of assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-60d (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claimed that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury as to proximate cause, (2) denied a motion to strike expert testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>on the ground of lack of an evidentiary foundation and (3) instructed the jury as to reasonable doubt thereby diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof. When this matter was first before us, we agreed with the defendant\u2019s first claim and, accordingly, reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroy, </em>33 Conn. App. 232, 242, 635 A.2d 305 (1993), rev\u2019d, 232 Conn. 1, 653 A.2d 161 (1994). Upon certification, our Supreme Court reversed our decision and remanded the case to this court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroy, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">A summary of the facts that the jury could have reasonably found is as follows. On September 29, 1984, at approximately 3 a.m., the defendant was involved in a two vehicle collision with Leslie Daniel in Enfield. Ralph Adamczyk was the only eyewitness to the accident. He was traveling behind Daniel\u2019s, car and observed both headlights of the defendant\u2019s oncoming car as it came around a corner. As the defendant\u2019s car approached, the driver\u2019s side headlight disappeared twice from Adamczyk\u2019s view. Both cars swerved to avoid a collision. At the accident scene, police officers noted the smell of alcohol on the defendant, who had difficulty maintaining his balance and exhibited slurred speech. The defendant was unable to perform two field sobriety tests satisfactorily and his subsequent breathalyzer test yielded a blood alcohol reading of 0.215. Daniel was seriously injured as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to strike expert testimony on the ground of lack of an evidentiary foundation. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>argues that the court permitted the state to offer an expert opinion based on a fact not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The following additional facts are pertinent to this claim. The state presented the expert testimony of Joel Milzoff, chief of toxicology for the state department of health. The state asked Milzoff to give his opinion of the number of alcoholic beverages that an individual weighing 170 pounds would have had to consume to arrive at a blood alcohol reading of 0.215. The defendant objected to this question on the ground that evidence of his body weight had not been presented. The trial court permitted the question subject to the state\u2019s connecting it to the defendant\u2019s weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Milzoff then testified that an individual having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.215 and weighing 170 pounds would have had to consume a minimum of the equivalent of ten and one-half twelve ounce beers. When asked to assume that the same individual ate a certain meal at about 5 p.m., drank during the course of the evening until approximately 1 a.m. and took the breath test at 4:07 a.m., Milzoff stated that the individual would have had to consume at least thirteen and one-half twelve ounce beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Later in its case, the state presented Officer Patrick Droney of the Enfield police department, who had processed the defendant following his arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Droney testified that he believed that the defendant had told him that he weighed 170 pounds. Droney identified an alcohol influence report as the one that he had filled out in reference to the defendant on the night of the defendant\u2019s arrest. The report, which was marked for identification only, indicated that the defendant\u2019s weight was 170 pounds. Droney stated that he recorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the background information, including the defendant\u2019s weight, before the defendant took the breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">During cross-examination, after viewing the videotape taken during the processing of the defendant, Droney admitted that the defendant did not state his weight on the tape. Droney stated that his earlier testimony that he had recorded the defendant\u2019s weight prior to the breathalyzer test had been his best recollection. After viewing the tape, Droney testified that he could not specifically recall the defendant\u2019s stating his weight and that he could have recorded that information after the breathalyzer test. Droney insisted, however, that if the defendant\u2019s weight was included in his report, which it was, he wrote it there.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">On redirect examination, the state asked Droney if he could have learned the defendant\u2019s weight from his driver\u2019s license. While Droney recalled having seen the license, he could not recall if the license stated the defendant\u2019s weight. Finally, the state asked Droney, \u201cYou didn\u2019t make [his weight] up, though, did you?\u201d Droney responded that he had not. At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved to strike that portion of Milzoff\u2019s testimony predicated on a body weight of 170 pounds on the ground that the state had not placed the defendant\u2019s weight into evidence. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u201cThe facts assumed in a hypothetical question must have their basis in the evidence on the record. See <em>Engelke v. Wheatley, </em>148 Conn. 398, 410-11, 171 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>402 (1961); see generally McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed. 1972) \u00a7 14. Whether a proper foundation has been laid to support a hypothetical question is an issue of fact for the trial court. <em>Spoto </em>v. <em>Hayward Mfg. Co., </em>2 Conn. App. 663, 670, 482 A.2d 91 (1984). . . . \u2018 \u201c[W]here the admissibility of evidence depends upon a preliminary question of fact, to be determined by the court, its decision is not to be reversed unless there is clear and manifest error.\u201d <em>Engelke </em>v. <em>Wheatley, </em>[supra, 411].\u2019 <em>Spoto </em>v. <em>Hayward Mfg. Co., </em>supra [670].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Soehard </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center, </em>8 Conn. App. 6, 9-10, 510 A.2d 1367 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The issue, then, is whether the trial court properly determined that the defendant\u2019s body weight was a fact in evidence. Droney testified on direct examination that he believed that the defendant told him that his weight was 170 pounds. \u201c[I]t is fundamental that a witness must base his evidence on personal knowledge. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Mossman, </em>91 Conn. 430, 437-38, 99 A. 1062 (1917); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>Spann, </em>110 Conn. 312, 313, 147 A. 807 (1929); 2 Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed.) 657.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>De Santis, </em>178 Conn. 534, 543, 423 A.2d 149 (1979). Droney\u2019s testimony was based on a statement made to him by the defendant. Thus, Droney\u2019s testimony on direct examination effectively put the defendant\u2019s body weight into evidence. The fact that cross-examination may have cast some doubt on the accuracy of Droney\u2019s recollection or on his credibility goes to the weight to be accorded his testimony by the jury, rather than its admissibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 406-407, 631 A.2d 238 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>36 Conn. App. 525, 536, 651 A.2d 1306 (1995). The hypothetical question posed to Milzoff, then, was based on facts in evidence. For this reason, we conclude that the trial court was correct in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to strike Milzoff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt deprived him of a fair trial by diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof. He argues that the court improperly instructed the jury that \u201cif all the evidence has been impartially and thoroughly reviewed by you and it produces in your mind a settled and an abiding belief that you would be willing to act upon it in matters of the highest importance relating to your own affairs, then in that event it would be free from a reasonable doubt and you should declare the defendant to be guilty.\u201d Within this sentence, the defendant specifically challenges the court\u2019s language as to \u201ca settled and abiding belief\u201d and the jurors\u2019 willingness to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The defendant concedes that he did not properly preserve this claim, but seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because this court rejected a similar claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>24 Conn. App. 347, 358-59, 588 A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 909, 593 A.2d 134, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 915, 112 S. Ct. 319, 116 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ever, we conclude that the defendant has failed to show that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In <em>Ober, </em>we stated that \u201c[i]n reviewing a constitutionally based challenge to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, we must examine the charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the challenged instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>210 Conn. 244, 275-76, 555 A.2d 390, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 3258, 106 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 338, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988). The defendant in this case objects only to one sentence in the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt. \u2018Even if the phrase were incorrect, one single misstatement in the context of an otherwise appropriate charge can be overlooked.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>23 Conn. App. 160, 166, 580 A.2d 520 (1990).\u201d Id., 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Our review of the charge as a whole in this case reveals that, as in <em>Ober, </em>the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt gave the jurors a clear understanding of the state\u2019s burden of proof. Consequently, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> In its opinion reversing this court\u2019s original decision, the Supreme Court stated that the defendant was charged under General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 53a-60d. The offense having occurred on September 29, 1984, the statute in effect was General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-60d. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-60d (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated when, in consequence of his intoxication while operating a motor vehicle, he causes serious physical injury to another person. For the purposes of this section, \u2018intoxication\u2019 shall include intoxication by alcohol or by drug or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> After being transported to the police station, the defendant was escorted into a processing room. A videotape recorded the processing from the time the defendant walked into the room until he took the breathalyzer test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> In its ruling, the trial court stated: \u201cMy recollection of the testimony of the officer is that he did specifically indicate that he obtained certain factual information, and that factual information was obtained from the defendant, and that one of those facts that he obtained was his weight, height and then other factors which were indicated on the alcohol influence report, to which he testified after refreshing his recollection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, the defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u201conly if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 358, the defendant claimed that the court improperly instructed the jury that \u201c \u2018if all of the evidence has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>been impartially and thoroughly reviewed by you and it produces in your mind a settled and abided belief that you would be willing to act upon in matters of the highest importance relative to your own affairs, then in that event you would be free from a reasonable doubt and should declare the defendant to be guilty.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
