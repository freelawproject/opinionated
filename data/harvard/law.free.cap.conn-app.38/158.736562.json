The principal issue in this appeal is whether the trial court improperly reduced an assessment on the plaintiffs real property by adopting an appraisal method that was invalid as a matter of law. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The trial court found the following facts. On July 1, 1987, the plaintiff purchased an apartment complex located at the corner of Brown Avenue and Russell Street in the town of Griswold. Thereafter, the plaintiff declared the twenty-six units as condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The plaintiff furnished the assessor of the town of Griswold with all of the information relevant to the assessment of the property. The assessor implemented, as of October 1, 1992, and October 1, 1993, a valuation of the condominium units for the town of Griswold at 70 percent of their alleged actual valuation. The plaintiff appealed to the town board of tax review for a reduction of the assessments made, but the board made no changes. On June 11,1993, the plaintiff commenced this action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The defendant town of Griswold conducted a revaluation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-62 with the resulting values assessed on all property as of October 1, 1992. The plaintiff\u2019s premises were assessed at $37,450 per unit, 70 percent of $53,000, which the board determined to be the fair market value of each unit. Since the conversion to condominiums, six units have been sold. At the time of trial, all units were either available for rent or occupied as rental units. No units have been sold since October 1,1992. A prior tax appeal concerning the premises with respect to the tax lists of October 1, 1988, October 1, 1989, and October 1, 1990, went to judgment on December 17, 1990. The trial court in that case found the true and actual fair market value of each unit to be $21,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">At trial, the plaintiff\u2019s expert, Chris S. Buckley, testified that the fair market value of the twenty-six units appraised as residential condominiums for purchase by a single purchaser was $426,000; when appraised as residential apartments, the value was $920,000. Buckley employed a method of appraisal, which he called \u201cthe discounted cash flow developmental method of income capitalization,\u201d utilizing projections of sales for a period of eight years less expenses and discounting to a present value estimate. By that method, the fair market value of each unit was $16,385. An alternative value as rental apartments was also estimated using the \u201cincome capitalization approach\u201d over a period of eight years. The trial court found Buckley\u2019s appraisal method \u201cinherently credible when it relates the fair market value per unit to be $16,385 . . . based on the discounted cash flow analysis.\u201d The trial court, however, gave \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the 1990 judgment in the prior tax appeal, and found the present fair market value of each unit to be $21,600, a figure identical to the value found by the trial court in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>It is well established that \u201c[i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given specific testimony.\u201d <em>Kimberly-Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 153, 527 A.2d 679 (1987). The credibility and the weight of expert testimony is judged by the same standard, and the trial court \u201cis privileged to adopt whatever testimony [the court] reasonably believes to be credible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>203 Conn. 364, 378, 525 A.2d 68 (1987). On appeal, we do not retry the facts or pass on the credibility of witnesses. <em>Nor\u2019easier Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 473, 542 A.2d 692 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u201cThe trial court was presented with conflicting testimony as to the value of the property, and concluded that the report and testimony of the plaintiffs expert was the most credible. In any assessment case in which the trial court is confronted with conflicting appraisal methods, it is a proper function of the court to give credence to one expert over the other. <em>Connecticut Coke Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>169 Conn. 663, 666, 364 A.2d 178 (1975).\u201d <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>226 Conn. 92, 99-100, 626 A.2d 1292 (1993). The conclusions reached by the trial court must stand \u201cunless they are legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or unless they involve the application of some erroneous rule of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>15 Conn. App. 513, 517-18, 545 A.2d 584, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 807, 548 A.2d 444 (1988). We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s adoption of the plaintiff\u2019s valuation of the property, therefore, unless the appraisal was legally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides for the following three methods of appraisal to be considered when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>determining the present true and actual value of real property for tax assessment in the absence of comparable sales: \u201c(1) Replacement cost less depreciation, plus the market value of the land, (2) the gross income multiplier method as used for similar property and (3) capitalization of net income based on market rent for similar property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">At trial, the plaintiff\u2019s expert explained that he had used an income capitalization approach, the discounted cash flow method, using projected sales over eight years to obtain the fair market value of the property for October 1, 1992, and October 1, 1993. \u201cThe discounted cash flow method is an accepted method for determining the present value of real property. The Appraisal of Real Estate (10th Ed. 1992) pp. 420-21; Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal (2d Ed. 1984) p. 94.\u201d <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 100. \u201cThe income capitalization approach to value consists of methods, techniques, and mathematical procedures that an appraiser uses to analyze a property\u2019s capacity to generate benefits (i.e., usually the monetary benefits of income and reversion) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>convert these benefits into an indication of present value.\u201d Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (10th Ed. 1992) p. 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">To determine if projected sales is an appropriate factor to be considered in determining value pursuant to the income capitalization method, we look to the plain language of \u00a7 12-63b (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981). . . . <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>226 Conn. 818, 828, 629 A.2d 379 (1993). Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature and there is no need for statutory construction .... <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept, of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 195, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 223, 640 A.2d 89 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cSection 12-63b (a) (3) requires the use of <em>\u2018market rent\u2019 </em>as the indicator of income. . . . \u2018[T]he term \u201cmarket rent\u201d means the rental income that such property would most probably command on the open market as indicated by <em>present rentals being paid for comparable space. </em>In determining market rent the assessor shall consider the <em>actual rental income </em>applicable with respect to such real property under the terms of an existing contract of lease at the time of such determination.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b (b).\u201d <em>First Bethel Associates </em>v. <em>Bethel, </em>231 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Conn. 731, 739-40, 651 A.2d 1279 (1995). The statute is clear and unambiguous in providing that market rent is the factor to be considered in a determination of value under the income capitalization method. Future projected sales is not contained in the statute as a factor for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The trial court purported to adopt the income capitalization method of appraisal conducted by the plaintiff\u2019s expert. Despite evidence of the rental income from the units not yet sold, the court chose to accept the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s determination of value based on projected sales over the next eight years. \u201cAlthough valuation of some properties may appropriately involve more than one single theory of valuation, and appraisals may be made which combine the cost and income approaches; <em>Xerox Corporation </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>71 App. Div. 2d 84, 421 N.Y.S.2d 475 (1979); such was not done in this case.\u201d <em>Whitney Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>4 Conn. App. 426, 428, 494 A.2d 624 (1985). The trial court concluded that the approach it was adopting was the income capitalization method pursuant to \u00a7 12-63b (a) (3). What it actually used was a hybrid between the income capitalization method and the sales method pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-63. The trial court explicitly rejected the comparable sales approach as too speculative, but then allowed the plaintiff to speculate even further by measuring value using projected sales over eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The function of the trial court is to determine the \u201ctrue and actual value of the plaintiff\u2019s property. <em>Dickau </em>v. <em>Glastonbury, </em>156 Conn. 437, 441, 444, 242 A.2d 777 [1968]; <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>146 Conn. 669, 673, 154 A.2d 608 [1959].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Executive Square Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>11 Conn. App. 566, 570, 528 A.2d 409 (1987). We are persuaded, on this record, that the trial court improperly applied the law in correcting the town\u2019s valuation of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tiffs property. The plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 12-63b (a) (3) and 12-63b (b) demonstrates that the trial court incorrectly adopted and applied an appraisal method conducted under the income capitalization method that relied on future sale of units as a measure of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a provides in pertinent part: \u201cappeals from DECISIONS OF BOARDS OF TAX REVIEW CONCERNING ASSESSMENT LISTS FOR ASSESSMENT YEARS COMMENCING OCTOBER 1, 1989, TO OCTOBER 1, 1992.
