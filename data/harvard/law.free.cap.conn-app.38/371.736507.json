The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly (1) admitted into evidence expert opinion testimony regarding the time of death that was based on unestablished factual assumptions and unreliable methodology, (2) excluded from evidence the defendant\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion as to time of death because of an alleged sequestration order violation, (3) admitted evidence of the victim\u2019s subjective state of mind, and (4) denied the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim, Ellen Sherman, was the defendant\u2019s wife. Due in part to extramarital affairs on the part of both the defendant and the victim, their marriage was contentious. On Friday, August 2, 1985, the defendant and the victim both arrived home after work at about 4 p.m. Several hours later, the defendant left the house for a week long sailing trip with four friends. On Sunday, August 4, the defendant made a ship to shore call to Barbara LeValley, a friend of the victim\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and asked her to check on the victim, as he had been unsuccessful in his efforts to contact her for two days. LeValley sent another friend, Len Fredriksen, to the Sherman residence. When Fredriksen arrived and found the house locked, he pried open a window and entered. Fredriksen discovered the naked body of the victim, then five and one-half months pregnant, in the master bedroom. The victim had died as a result of strangulation, both manual and ligature. When the body was discovered, the air conditioner in the bedroom was on and the door was closed, causing the room to be noticeably cold.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant was not arrested for the murder of his wife until March, 1990. Initially, Catherine Galvin, then chief medical examiner for the state of Connecticut, determined that the victim had died between twenty-four and thirty-six hours prior to her observation of the body. The defendant had left on his trip over sixty hours prior to Galvin\u2019s observation. After being informed that the temperature of the bedroom when the body was found was \u201cvery cold, like a refrigerator,\u201d Galvin reevaluated the time of death and determined that the victim had died between forty-eight and ninety-six hours prior to observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">A probable cause hearing lasting fourteen days preceded a jury trial, at the conclusion of which the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The trial court subsequently denied the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The defendant first claims that the misconduct of the state\u2019s attorney throughout the probable cause hearing and trial deprived him of a fair trial in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He alleges that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct falls into seven categories of proscribed behavior, each of which was sufficient to deny him a fair trial: (1) suppression of evidence favorable to him in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); (2) deliberate disregard of the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine and improper questioning; (3) withholding of witnesses\u2019 statements; (4) commenting on facts not in evidence; (5) expressions of opinion as to the defendant\u2019s credibility and guilt; (6) injection of extraneous matter into the trial and appeal to the jurors\u2019 emotions; and (7) misrepresentation that the state would call a certain witness. The defendant also seeks review of the cumulative effect of this claimed misconduct, asserting that the various instances can be viewed as \u201cindividual strands in a web of prosecutorial impropriety that blanketed the entire trial\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 509, 590 A.2d 901 (1991); and violated his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201cIn analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, we ask whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct \u2018 \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d \u2019 <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1986), quoting <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 94 S. Ct. 1868, 40 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>176 Conn. 367, 372, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978). We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. \u2018 \u201cThe fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 163, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 562, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983); see also <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>supra [181]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>200 Conn. 642, 654, 513 A.2d 58 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>[194 Conn. 573, 585, 484 A.2d 435 (1984)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 23, 463 A.2d 558 (1983); the severity of the misconduct; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181 (2d Cir. 1981); the frequency of the misconduct; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>[194 Conn. 530, 562-63, 482 A.2d 300 (1984)]; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>supra, [200 Conn.] 654; <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, [196 Conn.] 163; the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case; <em>Hawthorne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>476 A.2d 164, 172 (D.C. App. 1984); the strength of the curative measures adopted; <em>United States </em>v. <em>M\u00f3dica, </em>supra [1181]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 656, 657 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>supra [654]; and the strength of the state\u2019s case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra [1181]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 564; <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>[194 Conn. 483, 492, 48 A.2d 741 (1984)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 539-40, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The defendant first argues that the state suppressed ten distinct sets of evidence that were favorable to him in violation of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>In particular, he asserts that, at the probable cause hearing, the state withheld (1) a statement made by Fredriksen wherein he admitted to having had an affair with the victim, (2) a statement made by Fredriksen to the police on August 4, 1985, (3) a police report of an interview with Carol Colangeli on August 5, 1985, (4) LeValley\u2019s date book, (5) Detective Michael Mal-chik\u2019s report regarding the condition of the locks at the defendant\u2019s residence, (6) a copy of the bill from the Shermans\u2019 dinner at the Inn at Chester on August 1, 1985, (7) a police report of an interview with trial witness Theodore Mathieu, (8) the autopsy of the fetus, (9) the state police major crime squad checklist on which was recorded the temperature taken at the crime scene on August 5,1985, and (10) the police report of an interview with LeValley on August 4, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">It has long been held, \u201con the basis of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>[supra, 373 U.S. 83], and its progeny, that [s]ince the adversarial probable cause hearing [mandated by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution as amended] ... is an essential part of a defendant\u2019s criminal prosecution, the constitutional obligation to disclose exculpatory material attaches at that time. . . . [I]n <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>212 Conn. 387, 406, 563 A.2d 646 [cert. denied, 493 U.S. 980, 110 S. Ct. 510, 107 L. Ed. 2d 512] (1989), [the Supreme Court] held that in order for this court to consider claims of nondisclosure of exculpatory material at a probable cause hearing required by our state constitution, the defendant must demonstrate: (1) that the prosecution suppressed evidence; (2) that the evidence was favorable to the defense; and (3) that it was material. <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 539, 539 A.2d 80 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>229 Conn. 125, 134-35, 640 A.2d 572 (1994), quoting State v. <em>McPhail, </em>213 Conn. 161, 166-67, 567 A.2d 812 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>If, after applying that analysis, we conclude that the state did suppress evidence in violation of <em>Brady </em>at the probable cause hearing, it is then incumbent upon us to determine whether \u201c \u2018the nondisclosure did in fact taint the defendant\u2019s subsequent prosecution\u2019 and \u2018deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 138. \u201c[W]here there has been an initial disclosure of exculpatory evidence at trial, the appropriate standard to be applied is whether the disclosure came so late as to prevent the defendant from receiving a fair trial. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>214 Conn. 122, 127, 571 A.2d 686 (1990). In other words, exculpatory evidence must be disclosed at a time in which it can be [effectively] used. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>199 Conn. 399, 414, 508 A.2d 1 (1986). When exculpatory evidence is not timely disclosed its potential importance to the defense must be evaluated in light of the strength or weakness of the evidence presented against the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 298, 503 A.2d 146 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 264.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">With respect to eight of the defendant\u2019s ten claims of suppressed evidence, we need not analyze whether the state violated <em>Brady </em>at the probable cause hearing. Even if we assume, arguendo, that the state did improperly suppress these eight sets of evidence, we nonetheless conclude that the nondisclosure at the probable cause hearing did not taint the defendant\u2019s subsequent prosecution and deprive him of his constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The statement made by Fredriksen to the police on August 4, 1985, was disclosed to the defendant during the trial. Moreover, it was disclosed at a time when it could be effectively used. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 414. The defendant offered the statement as a defendant\u2019s exhibit and used it during his cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>examination of Fredriksen. Similarly, the defendant offered the relevant pages from LeValley\u2019s date book as a defendant\u2019s exhibit and cross-examined LeValley at the trial with respect to those pages. The defendant also offered the copy of the bill from his dinner at the Inn at Chester, which was disclosed during the trial in time for its effective use. Malchik\u2019s report on the condition of the locks, the police report of the interview with Mathieu, the major crime squad checklist, and the police report of the interview with LeValley were each disclosed by the state before the trial. Finally, while the autopsy of the fetus was initially disclosed during the trial, the defendant had used it during his cross-examination of the physician who performed the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The defendant also alleges that the state failed to disclose a statement made by Fredriksen in which he admitted to having had an affair with the victim. Asserting that the state\u2019s case at the probable cause hearing relied in great part on the testimony of Fredrik-sen, the defendant contends that the suppressed evidence would have impeached Fredriksen\u2019s credibility. The state responds that this evidence was not suppressed in that it was known to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u201c[Ejvidence known to the defendant or his counsel, or that is disclosed, even if during [the probable cause hearing], is not considered suppressed as that term is used in <em>Brady. . </em>. .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 91, 621 A.2d 728 (1993). In this case, the defendant had personal knowledge prior to the probable cause hearing that Fredriksen had had an affair with the victim. He acknowledged the fact in his polygraph interview on August 5, 1985, and questioned Fredriksen about the affair on cross-examination during the probable cause proceedings. We conclude, therefore, that Fredriksen\u2019s statement was not suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The defendant\u2019s last claim of suppressed evidence relates to the police report of an interview with Colangeli. During the interview, she stated that Fredriksen had told her on August 5, 1985, that he believed that the marital differences between the defendant and the victim \u201chad been patched up.\u201d The defendant claims that this evidence could have been used to impeach Fredriksen, who testified both at the probable cause hearing and at trial that not long before her death, the victim had discussed with him the possibility of divorcing the defendant. The state disclosed the report on December 18,1991, after Fredriksen had testified at the trial. Consequently, the defendant argued before the trial court, as he does now, that he was unable to make effective use of the report as impeachment material at either the probable cause hearing or the trial. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The report was not disclosed until the trial and it was therefore suppressed at the probable cause hearing, as per the first prong of the three part test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 387. As to the second prong of the test, which requires that the evidence must be favorable to the defense, it is well established that \u201c[i]mpeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence falls within <em>Brady\u2019s </em>definition of evidence favorable to an accused.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 142, 531 A.2d 125 (1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985). We must then consider whether the suppressed report was material in order to determine whether its nondisclosure at the probable cause hearing constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Materiality is to be evaluated \u201cby utilizing the test set forth in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>[supra, 473 U.S. 682]. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>supra, [212 Conn.] 406-407. Under the <em>Bagley </em>test, nondisclosed exculpatory evidence will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>considered material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to, the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>supra, 682.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u201cIn analyzing a <em>Brady </em>claim, the courts \u2018must avoid concentrating on the suppressed evidence in isolation. Rather, we must place it in the context of the entire record. Evidence that may first appear to be quite compelling when considered alone can lose its potency when weighed and measured with all the other evidence, both inculpatory and exculpatory. Implicit in the standard of materiality is the notion that the significance of any particular bit of evidence can only be determined by comparison to the rest.\u2019 <em>Trujillo </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>815 F.2d 597, 613 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 929, 108 S. Ct. 296, 98 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>supra, [205 Conn.] 143. Further, \u2018[t]he determination of materiality has been said to be \u201cinevitably factbound\u201d and like other factual issues is committed to the trial court in the first instance.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>supra, 147. \u2018There is a difficulty inherent in measuring the effect of nondisclosure in the course of a lengthy trial with many witnesses and exhibits . . . this lack of certitude suggests deference by a reviewing court especially in the weighing of evidence.\u2019 Id., 149; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>790 F.2d 130, 136 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pflaumer, </em>774 F.2d 1224, 1230 (3d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1046, 106 S. Ct. 1263, 89 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1986). Thus, the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the defendant\u2019s petition for a new trial as a result of a <em>Brady </em>violation will be overturned only upon a finding of \u2018clear abuse of discretion.\u2019 <em>Demers </em>v. <em>State, </em>[209 Conn. 143, 148, 547 A.2d 28 (1988); <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>202 Conn. 561, 564-65, 522 A.2d 288 (1987); <em>Asherman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>v. <em>State, </em>202 Conn. 429, 434, 521 A.2d 578 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 399-400.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We cannot conclude that, had the defendant had access to the report during the probable cause hearing, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. The defendant extensively cross-examined Fredriksen on matters including the fact that Fredriksen had had sexual relations with the victim and that Fredriksen believed that the defendant had killed the victim. We conclude that, in the context of a probable cause hearing that lasted fourteen days, the nondisclosure of the challenged evidence was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Because the same standard of materiality applies to the analysis of an alleged <em>Brady </em>violation at trial, we also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In support of his prosecutorial misconduct claim, the defendant next argues that the state deliberately disregarded the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine and posed improper questions to witnesses. The trial court granted the defense\u2019s motion to limit the cross-examination of the defendant in certain areas not raised on direct examination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant now asserts that the state deliberately violated the motion in limine when it cross-examined him as to (1) whether he had ever previously assaulted anyone, (2) his refusal to let the state police test the air conditioner, and (3) a discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>sion with Roger Peterson that constituted an alleged act of interference with the investigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">As previously discussed, in considering claims of pros-ecutorial misconduct, we apply a due process analysis and consider whether the defendant was deprived of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 539-40. A different standard is applied, however, when the claim involves \u201cdeliberate prosecutorial misconduct during trial which violates express trial court rulings . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Ubaldi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 570. In such instances, \u201c[t]his court . . . has supervisory power to vacate a judgment of conviction and to order a new trial to deter prosecutorial misconduct which, while not so egregious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, is unduly offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>194 Conn. 573, 584, 484 A.2d 435 (1984). In determining whether the use of our supervisory powers to reverse a conviction is appropriate, we consider whether the effect of the challenged remark \u201cwas to undermine the authority of the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 574. We also consider the degree of prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the remark. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>202 Conn. 316, 330, 521 A.2d 1025 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Our Supreme Court, however, has urged a cautionary approach in this regard, noting that \u201c[r] ever sal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>a conviction under our supervisory powers . . . should not be undertaken without balancing all of the interests involved: the extent of prejudice to the defendant; the emotional trauma to the victims or others likely to result from reliving their experiences at a new trial; the practical problems of memory loss and unavailability of witnesses after much time has elapsed; and the availability of other sanctions for such misconduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 330; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The defendant first asserts that the prosecutor deliberately violated the motion in limine when he inquired as to whether the defendant had ever assaulted anyone. Specifically, the defendant challenges the following questions, which were posed to him in the presence of the jury: \u201c[Ijsn\u2019t it a fact that you have on occasions hurt people?\u201d and \u201cYou have previously assaulted \u2014 prior to the time you spoke to Mr. Malchik, you assaulted people, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d The defendant objected to both questions. While the state withdrew the first question, argument was held in the absence of the jury regarding the propriety of the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In sustaining the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court ruled that \u201cthe court does not find that the general question of whether or not the defendant had previously assaulted people is any less or is any more acceptable than the specific question of whether he assaulted a particular person on a particular day . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court admonished the state to advise the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>advance and out of the presence of the jury if it intended to bring up the specific incidents precluded by the motion in limine or any other alleged assaults by the defendant. The court also instructed the jury to disregard the question and \u201cnot to speculate about what the answer might have been.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We cannot say that the state\u2019s questions were so unduly offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction is necessary. The trial court itself found that the state\u2019s questions did not directly undermine the court\u2019s ruling. While the court did sustain the defendant\u2019s objection to the questions, it did so on the theory that the questions were similar to those meant to be precluded by the motion in limine. Further, any prejudice the defendant may have suffered was remedied by the court\u2019s curative instruction to the jury. \u201cThe defendant made no claim at trial, nor has he claimed on appeal, that the curative instruction given to the jury was in any way defective. We have often held that a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks obviates any possible harm to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nowakowski, </em>188 Conn. 620, 624, 452 A.2d 938 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>[177 Conn. 677, 720-21, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>[176 Conn. 367, 373, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The defendant next argues that the state improperly began to ask about the defendant\u2019s alleged refusal to allow the state police to test the air conditioner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ing cross-examination of the defendant, the state asked: \u201c[Bjetween August of 1985 and September of 1986, the air conditioner was available to be tested in that room; isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d The defendant objected, claiming that the question was argumentative and that \u201cthere\u2019s another legal basis for it.\u201d The court agreed that the question was argumentative and sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The state then asked: \u201cDo you know anything about the state police seeking permission in September of 1985 . . . .\u201d The defendant interrupted with an objection and the state withdrew the question. After the jury had been excused, the defendant moved for a mistrial, claiming that the state, by beginning to pose a prohibited question, had again deliberately disregarded the motion in limine. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Through his motion in limine, the defendant sought to prevent the state from asking whether he had refused to let the state police test the air conditioner. The inference that he sought to avoid was consciousness of guilt. Our review of the record reveals that the actual questions asked, considered in context, did not expose the jury to the supposition that the defendant had interfered with the testing of the air conditioner. Consequently, the jury could not have drawn the unfavorable inference. There is merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that he should not have been forced to object to a line of questioning seemingly headed toward matter barred by the motion in limine. The minimal prejudice that the defendant may have suffered, however, plainly renders the sanction of reversal inappropriate in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Finally, the defendant asserts that the state disregarded the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine when it asked about a discussion with Roger Peterson that constituted an alleged act of interference with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>investigation. Additional facts are necessary to put this claim in perspective. After Peterson had testified before the grand jury in November, 1987, he and the defendant had a discussion, during which Peterson got the impression that the defendant was attempting to change his recollection of the events of August 2,1985. Peterson contacted Detective Malchik and gave a statement on December 12,1987, in which he recounted the discussion. In the statement, Peterson related that the defendant had said to him, \u201cYou got emotional about [the victim] not coming out [of the house on August 2, 1985]\u201d and that Peterson had responded, \u201cI was emphatic that she would have come out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">During its case-in-chief, the state introduced Peterson\u2019s statement as consciousness of guilt evidence. In its ruling on the motion in limine, however, the court barred cross-examination of the defendant as to Peterson\u2019s statement because the defendant had not testified on direct examination about his discussion with Peterson. The defendant now challenges the fact that the state asked the defendant, \u201cDid you at some time tell Roger that he got emotional about [the victim\u2019s] not coming out?\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant immediately objected to the question and subsequently moved for a mistrial. The trial court again denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The court precluded cross-examination about Peterson\u2019s statement because it was outside the scope of the defendant\u2019s direct testimony, not because it could implicate the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. In fact, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>statement had been admitted into evidence on the basis of a consciousness of guilt theory. Consequently, in violating the motion in limine in this instance, the state was delving into subject matter outside the scope of direct examination, not subject matter that the court had ruled unduly prejudicial or inadmissible on a specific evidentiary basis. While the state was wrong to broach the topic of Peterson\u2019s statement, it never directly asked the defendant a question implying that he had attempted to change Peterson\u2019s recollection of events. For these reasons, we must conclude again that, while the defendant should not have been forced to object to halt a line of questioning that seemed headed toward precluded subject matter, the actual prejudice, if any, that he suffered cannot support a resort to our supervisory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The defendant next argues, in support of his prose-cutorial misconduct claim, that the state improperly withheld witness statements. Specifically, he contends that it was not until his cross-examination of both LeValley and Malchik that it became apparent that the state had failed to produce relevant statements of these witnesses despite his timely request for production pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 752<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, at least with respect to LeValley\u2019s statement, the state\u2019s representation that it had turned over all relevant material.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In response to questioning by the defendant on cross-examination, LeValley explained that she had given the state a date book containing information concerning events about which she had testified. The state offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>to give her the date book to refresh her recollection as to a certain question posed by the defendant. When defense counsel made a claim to see the date book, the trial court excused the jury. After reviewing the date book and hearing argument, the court ordered that the two pages covering July 29, 1985, to August 3, 1985, be reproduced and made available to the defendant. On one of those pages, under the date August 2,1985, was the statement at issue here, a handwritten notation stating \u201ccall Ell around 11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Relying on Practice Book \u00a7 755,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the defendant subsequently made a motion to strike LeValley\u2019s direct testimony and, in the alternative, a motion for mistrial based on the state\u2019s failure to turn over the statement contained in the date book prior to the start of his cross-examination. The trial court ruled that it had never ordered the state to produce statements made by LeValley. Rather, the court found that all discovery as to such statements had been made by agreement of the state. Therefore, the trial court concluded, the state\u2019s failure to honor its agreement did not constitute an \u201celection] not to comply with an order of the judicial authority.\u201d See Practice Book \u00a7 755. For this reason, the court found it unnecessary to strike LeVal-ley\u2019s testimony or to grant a mistrial. See id. The court also specifically found that the state\u2019s failure to disclose the statement before the defendant\u2019s cross-examination was not done in bad faith and was harmless to the defendant. The court stated that \u201cthe failure to produce [the statement] at the appropriate time, that is, when the state finished their examination, was in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>harmless in this ease and that any disclosure at the earlier time would not have changed the result of the trial since it\u2019s available, the information is available to the defendant at this time.\u201d At the time the court made this ruling, the defendant had not yet finished his cross-examination of LeValley.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that any impropriety on behalf of the state with regard to LeVal-ley\u2019s date book was not prejudicial to the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The record reveals that the defendant knew of LeVal-ley\u2019s statement prior to having the date book pages in his possession. He was provided with the pages while still engaged in the cross-examination of LeValley. Moreover, the cross-examination continued into the next day, affording the defendant an opportunity to examine the pages overnight. We cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s tardiness in producing the statement, which the trial court deemed inadvertent, \u201c \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Darden </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>supra, 477 U.S. 181; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant also argues that the state failed to disclose a statement made by Malchik in a report dated August 5,1985. During his cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Malchik about the report, which concerned Malchik\u2019s interview of the defendant at the time he was first informed of his wife\u2019s death. Counsel asked Malchik, \u201cNow, you also said, as I heard you, that you confronted Mr. Sherman with why would you tell [LeValley] to turn off the battery when you already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>apparently told your wife to do that on Friday night; isn\u2019t that what you confronted him with?\u201d Malchik responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Counsel then asked if that fact was in his August 5,1985 report. When Malchik responded that he believed so, counsel handed him a copy of the report to review. Malchik asserted that the document handed to him was not his full report, that a portion had been redacted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The jury was excused, and the defendant moved for a mistrial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 755 on the ground that the redacted portion of the report constituted an undisclosed statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Defense counsel argued before the trial court, as he does now, that his failure to possess the redacted statement during his cross-examination of Malchik was prejudicial. Counsel had intended to challenge Malchik\u2019s credibility by establishing that he had never made note in his report of a fact that he now testified was there. The defendant argues that because the information in question was, in fact, in Malchik\u2019s report, Malchik\u2019s credibility was bolstered rather than undermined. Moreover, the defendant asserts that his defense counsel\u2019s credibility was harmed because the jury may have believed that counsel was attempting to trick Malchik by asking him to review a redacted report.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, ruling that there was no election by the state not to comply with an order of the court in that there was not any court order \u201cfound by the court with regard to the particular report.\u201d Also, the court found a lack of prejudice because the redacted portion of the report did not contain what Malchik would have been looking for when it was handed to him for him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>review, \u201cthat is namely, some place where in his report he wrote down the fact that he confronted the defendant with the difference between the claims with regard to the phone call.\u201d When the jury was reconvened, the trial court specifically informed the jurors that defense counsel had not been in possession of the unredacted report during his previous cross-examination of Malchik.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We must conclude that the fairness of the trial was not compromised by the state\u2019s late production of the redacted statement. As the trial court found, the defendant was not prejudiced. His argument is that the actual presence of certain information in the report thwarted his efforts to challenge Malchik\u2019s credibility. This argument, however, is without merit in that the redacted statement did not constitute that information. Of more importance is that any injury to defense counsel\u2019s credibility was cured by the trial court\u2019s subsequent explanation to the jury that counsel had not possessed the full report when questioning Malchik. For these reasons, we find that the state\u2019s failure to disclose the challenged statements prior to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of LeValley and Malchik did not constitute unconstitutional prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that he was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecutor, in his rebuttal closing argument, improperly commented on facts not in evidence. Through these comments, the defendant asserts, the prosecutor attempted to persuade the jury that he knew additional facts and witnesses who, if presented, could prove the defendant\u2019s guilt. The state responds that its comments were in rebuttal to the defendant\u2019s closing argument in which he referred to facts not in evidence to imply that the state police had inadequately investigated the murder. The state urges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that the gist of its remarks was not that it had other evidence to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt, but that there was other evidence not relevant to his guilt and that the verdict should be based solely on the evidence before the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">After the jury was excused, the defendant objected to the state\u2019s comments and moved for a mistrial on the ground that they constituted prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the comments did not \u201cin the view of the court, rise to the level of requiring mistrial.\u201d The court thereafter instructed the jurors to consider only the evidence properly before them, which evidence did not include the arguments of the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u201cWhile the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 169, 113 A. 452 (1921). \u201cWhen a verdict is challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly prejudicial remarks, the defendant bears the burden of proving the remarks prejudicial in light of the whole trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>10 Conn. App. 361, 364, 523 A.2d 1323, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 859, 108 S. Ct. 172, 98 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In considering this claim, we must adhere to the principle that \u201cthe action of the trial court is entitled to weight because of the vantage point from which it can observe and evaluate the circumstances of the trial. The trial court is in a better position to determine the propriety of the remarks of counsel and whether or not they are harmful. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>supra, [190 Conn.] 563; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 77, 444 A.2d 896 (1982); <em>Downing </em>v. <em>State, </em>178 Ind. App. 144,152, 381 N.E.2d 554 (1978).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Our review of the trial transcript convinces us that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not improper. The defendant presents his argument to us using portions of the prosecutor\u2019s comments. When the prosecutor\u2019s comments are examined in toto, it becomes clear that the remarks did not constitute an assertion that the state was aware of additional evidence that could prove the defendant\u2019s guilt. Rather, in emphasizing to the jury that it must consider only evidence properly presented, the prosecutor claimed that he knew additional evidence that was irrelevant to proving the defendant\u2019s guilt and, consequently, had not been presented. Even were we to assume that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper, we agree with the trial court that the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>18 Conn. App. 184, 191, 557 A.2d 553 (1989). \u201cAdditionally, the court instructed the jury that its verdict should be based only on the evidence and that the statements of counsel during closing argument did not constitute evidence. Those instructions served to diminish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the impact, if any, the remark[s] may have had on the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Flinter, </em>16 Conn. App. 402, 410, 548 A.2d 1 (1988).\u201d Id. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The defendant next claims that prosecutorial misconduct exists in the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper expressions of opinion as to the credibility of the defendant and a state\u2019s witness. \u201cThe prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnessess. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, [663 F.2d 1181]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>481 F.2d 62 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>[supra, 10 Conn. App. 365]; ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (Second), The Prosecution Function \u00a7 3-5.8 (b) (1985). . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 541. \u201cThe prosecutor may, however, argue to the jury that the <em>evidence </em>and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom should lead the jury to a conclusion as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>[supra, 62]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 656 (D.C. Cir. 1968).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 541 n.6. Moreover, in the context of cross-examination, a prosecutor is not prohibited from impeaching the credibility of a witness, as long as he refrains from expressing his own opinion of the witness\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The defendant first asserts that the prosecutor, during his nine and one-half day cross-examination of him, asked improper questions that were comments on his credibility. While the defendant objected to each question that he now challenges, he did not move for a mistrial or request a curative instruction. Although the defendant refers to twenty-five alleged incidents of improper questioning, a careful examination of the record reveals that, while a few were argumentative, none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of the challenged questions contained comments about the defendant\u2019s credibility. Cf. id., 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Even assuming the impropriety of these questions, however, we must consider them in the context of the entire trial and make a determination as to whether the fairness of the trial was compromised. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 523, our Supreme Court concluded that the prosecutor had improperly expressed his opinion as to the credibility and guilt of the defendant. In so finding, the court noted that the prosecutor had expressed his opinion \u201cfrequently and vitriolically.\u201d This case presents neither the frequency, the virulence, nor the direct comment on truthfulness of the prosecutor\u2019s questions and remarks in <em>Williams. </em>Consequently, after reviewing the record, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s challenged questions did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor expressed his opinion as to the credibility of Kristen McDuff, a state\u2019s witness, during his closing argument. In reference to McDuff, the prosecutor stated, \u201cI respectfully submit to you \u2014 I respectfully submit for your consideration, that that little girl told you the absolute truth when she told you that she ran in because she had asked first to use the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s comment was an improper voucher of a state\u2019s witness\u2019 credibility. For this impropriety to warrant reversal, however, the defendant must demonstrate that the statement, even if prejudicial in isolation, undermined his right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 497. We conclude that the defendant has failed to make such a demonstration. At the beginning of his closing argument, the prosecutor cautioned the jury that \u201c[t]he credibility of witnesses is up to you to determine.\u201d He also stated, \u201cIn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>course of my argument, I might slip ... I might use the words T believe.\u2019 And if I do use those words, please, immediately disregard them because what I believe is totally unimportant, it\u2019s immaterial.\u201d Following closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury that it was to determine the credibility of the witnesses and to disregard any statements made by either lawyer as to the truthfulness of the witnesses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Taking this curative instruction into account, we cannot conclude that, in the context of the entire trial, the prosecutor\u2019s improper remark affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The defendant next claims that the state improperly injected extraneous matter into the trial and appealed to the jurors\u2019 emotions. First, he argues that the prosecutor made three statements during his closing argument that were extraneous and served to divert the jury\u2019s attention from its duty to decide the case on the evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Following the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the defendant moved for a mistrial based on sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>eral alleged improper statements made during that argument, specifically including the first two statements challenged here. The trial court denied the motion for mistrial. During its instructions, the court directed the jury to consider only the evidence presented and not the arguments or expressed beliefs of the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The defendant now maintains that the three challenged statements constituted a suggestion to the jurors that any reasonable doubt in their minds existed only because of the skill and superior resources of the defense counsel and the intelligence of the defendant. \u201c[A] prosecutor should not inject extraneous issues into the case that divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence. ABA Standards [for Criminal Justice (Second)], supra, \u00a7 3-5.8.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 547. As to the first two statements, we conclude without commenting on their propriety that the trial court was correct in determining that the defendant was not prejudiced thereby. The prosecutor did not state to the jury that any existing doubt could be attributed to the superior skill, resources and intelligence of the defendant and his attorneys. Rather, the defendant asks us to draw that inference from what the prosecutor did say to the jury. Whether this is a reasonable inference and, if so, whether the jury may have actually drawn it to the prejudice of the defendant is a determination best left to the trial court, which occupied the best vantage point for such a determination. The court concluded that a mistrial was unnecessary on this claim and we discern no reason to upset its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">As to the prosecutor\u2019s statement about his winter suit, the defendant presents it to us out of context. At the beginning of his closing argument, the prosecutor stated, \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury . . . [y]ou sit here as twelve people, we\u2019ve come to know each other to some extent, <em>you probably know that I only </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>have one real winter suit that I can wear. </em>But I have twelve minds, and I cannot see in your mind, and I have twelve minds to convince beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant, Edward Sherman, is guilty . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant did not object to this statement when it was made or in his motion for mistrial and exceptions following the closing argument. It is evident that the defendant took the statement at the time for what it was, an offhand remark intended to emphasize the familiarity between the jury and attorneys as a result of a four month long trial. We find no impropriety in this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the emotions of the jurors. During his cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor asked, \u201cSo tell us, your wife is bleeding [and goes] to the hospital and you buy an airline ticket to go to Illinois or to St. Louis, is that correct, the same day?\u201d He also asked \u201cDid you have enough sympathy for [your wife] on Tuesday to say, well, maybe I better keep away from [the woman with whom I\u2019m having an affair] for a while to help [my wife] out for a little bit?\u201d The defendant\u2019s objections to these two questions, on the basis that they were argumentative, were sustained.

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 561, the court found that the prosecutor had repeatedly characterized the defendant and his codefendant as \u201cmurderous fiends,\u201d \u201crats,\u201d \u201cutterly merciless killers\u201d and \u201cinhumane, unfeeling and reprehensible creatures.\u201d The defendant\u2019s objections to these remarks were overruled and his requests for curative instructions were denied. In both of these cases, the Supreme Court concluded that the prosecutors\u2019 persistent invective could reasonably have had the improper effect of appealing to the emotions and prejudices of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The case before us differs from both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Couture </em>in that it is unlikely that the four challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>remarks, which were made during the course of the long trial, could have so inflamed the emotions of the jury as to have had an effect on its verdict. The defendant has not established that the remarks were in fact harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 470. We conclude that the remarks, even if improper, did not impinge on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument in support of his pros-ecutorial misconduct claim is that the state misrepresented to the court that it would call a certain witness. While placed under the rubric of prosecuto-rial misconduct, this argument is more properly characterized as a claim that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence testimony regarding a search of the Sherman residence on August 9, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. Late in the evening of August 5,1985, the state police surrendered custody of the Sherman residence and the defendant returned home. On August 9,1985, Malchik and other members of the state police searched the Sherman residence pursuant to a warrant. They seized, inter alia, a container of linguine and a container of red clam sauce from the refrigerator and took photographs of them. At trial, during the state\u2019s direct examination of Malchik, the prosecutor initially attempted to introduce the photographs and question Malchik as to the evidence seized. The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection that the evidence was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Later in the trial, the state again offered the evidence and Malchik\u2019s testimony. In an oral offer of proof, the state argued that intervening testimony had established a foundation for relevance. The prosecutor referred to the fact that Galvin, who had performed the autopsy of the victim, had testified that linguine and clam sauce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>were found in the stomach of the victim. He argued further that the fact that the containers of linguine and clam sauce were seized one week after the alleged time of death, and four days after the police surrendered custody of the house, went to the weight the jury should afford the evidence, not to its admissibility. In the course of his argument, the prosecutor stated, \u201cIf there is to be reasonable relevance of this evidence, and I claim the testimony of Dr. Galvin tied the relevance in, I also intend to call Dr. Carver if, in fact, this evidence is admitted.\u201d Carver had assisted in the autopsy and would testify, the state offered, that the linguine and clam sauce seized and shown to him by Malchik were similar to the substances found in the victim\u2019s stomach. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">When the state rested without calling Carver as a witness, the defendant moved to strike Malchik\u2019s testimony regarding the August 9,1985 search. Because Carver did not testify, the defendant claimed, the state failed to \u201cconnect up the [linguine and clam sauce] in any scientific way to [the victim].\u201d After hearing from the state, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion without comment. Subsequently, in his request to charge, the defendant asked for a missing witness charge based on the state\u2019s failure to call Carver. See <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960). The court gave no such instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly admitted Malchik\u2019s testimony, denied his motion to strike and failed to give the missing witness charge. \u201cThe trial court is given broad discretion in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ing the relevancy of evidence and its decision will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliman, </em>214 Conn. 38, 50, 570 A.2d 680 (1990). \u201cEvidence is [relevant] when it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., quoting <em>Federated Department Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>162 Conn. 77, 82, 291 A.2d 715 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The state had already presented evidence that the victim had consumed linguine and clam sauce not more than two hours prior to her death. Moreover, in his testimony as to his and the victim\u2019s actions before he left the house on August 2,1985, the defendant made no mention of her eating linguine and clam sauce. Because both the time of death and the defendant\u2019s credibility were at issue, it was reasonable for the trial court to have concluded that the evidence seized from the Sherman\u2019s refrigerator was relevant. \u201cEvidence is not rendered inadmissible simply because it is not conclusive. It is admissible if it tends to support a relevant fact even in a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 548, 498 A.2d 76 (1985). The trial court admitted the challenged evidence, therefore, because it was relevant. Consequently, the court properly refused to strike the evidence following the state\u2019s failure to call Carver and refused to give a missing witness charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The defendant also contends that we should view the state\u2019s representation to the trial court that it would call Carver and its subsequent failure to do so as pros-ecutorial misconduct. We disagree, however, that the state\u2019s announcement of its intent to call Carver constituted misconduct. During the offer of proof, the state did not promise to call Carver in the future so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>establish the relevance of the disputed evidence. Rather, it indicated its intention to call Carver \u201cif, in fact, this evidence is admitted.\u201d Also, it is not apparent that the trial court relied on the prosecutor\u2019s representation that he would call Carver when it ruled that the evidence was admissible. The court based its ruling on the fact that Galvin had testified as to the evidence and did not indicate to the defendant that it would entertain a motion to strike if Carver was not presented as a witness. In any event, Carver\u2019s testimony would have been, at best, cumulative of Galvin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In examining each of the defendant\u2019s seven claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we conclude that the challenged conduct either was not improper or, if inappropriate, did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the defendant\u2019s resulting conviction a denial of due process. We reach the same conclusion after considering the instances of alleged impropriety cumulatively. In the context of this lengthy trial, the aggregate effect of the state\u2019s misconduct cannot be said to have undermined the fairness of or have affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Expert Opinion as to Time of Death</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence expert opinion testimony regarding the time of death. Specifically, he argues that Galvin, who testified on behalf of the state, should not have been permitted to offer her opinion as to the time of the victim\u2019s death in that her opinion was based on assumptions and unreliable methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The time of death was a critical issue at the defendant\u2019s trial. Galvin, chief medical examiner for the state, initially determined that the time of death was twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>four to thirty-six hours prior to her observation of the body at 7 a.m. on August 5,1985. This estimate exculpated the defendant, who had left on his trip over sixty hours prior to that time. After taking into account the fact that Fredriksen, who had discovered the body, described the temperature of the room as \u201cvery cold, like a refrigerator,\u201d Galvin redetermined the time of death to be between forty-eight and ninety-six hours prior to her observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The defendant unsuccessfully objected to the admission of Galvin\u2019s opinion as to time of death at the probable cause hearing. Thereafter, he filed a motion in limine, seeking to preclude its admission into evidence at the trial. During trial, outside the presence of the jury, the court held a lengthy hearing on the motion, during which the state presented Galvin\u2019s testimony as to how she had formed her opinion. On direct and cross-examination, Galvin testified that unless there is a witness to the death, only a range of time can be given with medical probability. The further removed the examiner\u2019s observation is from the time of death, the greater the range. Galvin testified that she based her initial opinion primarily on the degree of rigidity that she observed during her autopsy of the victim. She explained that rigidity is an ongoing process that occurs at a given rate. Under average room temperatures, between sixty-eight and seventy degrees Fahrenheit, rigidity is fully developed approximately twelve hours after death and persists for approximately another twelve to twenty-four hours before beginning to subside. On the average, rigidity begins to lessen between twenty-four to thirty-six hours after death. Full rigidity has been known to last longer in some cases, including as long as sixty hours in one recorded case. Galvin testified that these average rates of the onset and diminuation of rigidity are taught in forensic pathology classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Galvin further testified that she changed her estimate as to time of death after being informed that the room was very cold. She stated that in cooler than normal temperatures, a body becomes rigid more slowly and maintains rigidity for a longer period before beginning to subside. While it is an understood fact in the field of forensic pathology that colder temperatures retard the rate of rigidity, there are no. established standards such as those she had described for the rate of rigidity in normal room temperatures. Consequently, she explained, the effect of cold is a relative consideration, which in this case she based on her personal experience, personal communications and literature. When told that the room in which the body had been discovered was \u201cvery cold, like a refrigerator,\u201d Galvin interpolated that to mean that \u201cthe room could have been as cold as [forty to forty-five degrees], may not have been as cold as that, but was markedly colder than the area outside the room.\u201d Following the offer of proof and argument, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine, finding that the state had met its burden of proving the necessary foundation for Galvin\u2019s opinion as to the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The defendant first contends that Galvin\u2019s opinion was based on unsubstantiated assumptions due to the uncertainty regarding the temperature of the room in which the victim\u2019s body was found. Because Galvin did not know the actual temperature of the room or whether the air conditioner was capable of cooling the room to approximately forty degrees, the defendant maintains that she did not have the necessary factual basis to render an admissible opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u201c \u2018The trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Girolamo, </em>197 Conn. 201, 214, 496 A.2d 948 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Biller, </em>190 Conn. 594, 617, 462 A.2d 987 (1983).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>476, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986). The exercise of such discretion is not to be disturbed unless it has been abused or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 166, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 716, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Biller, </em>supra [617]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>180 Conn. 481, 489-90, 429 A.2d 931 (1980); <em>Going </em>v. <em>Pagani, </em>172 Conn. 29, 35, 372 A.2d 516 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, 8 </em>Conn. App. 566, 572, 513 A.2d 1285, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 813, 517 A.2d 630 (1986). \u2018In order to render an expert opinion the witness must be qualified to do so and there must be a factual basis for the opinion.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra [716]. The essential facts on which an expert opinion is based are an important consideration in determining the admissibility of his opinion. See <em>Berndston </em>v. <em>Annino, </em>177 Conn. 41, 46, 411 A.2d 36 (1979); <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>147 Conn. 311, 314-15, 160 A.2d 742 (1960). \u2018Where the factual basis of an opinion is challenged the question before the court is whether the uncertainties in the essential facts on which the opinion is predicated are such as to make an opinion based on them without substantial value.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 716-17. That question is one of fact for the trial court. <em>Liskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>5 Conn. App. 136, 141, 497 A.2d 86 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>203 Conn. 445, 452-53, 525 A.2d 101 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that Galvin\u2019s opinion was based on an adequate factualpredicate. Galvin based her estimate on her direct observation of the body and information concerning the temperature of the room in which the body was found. She utilized her expertise, which is not challenged, to arrive at assumptions regarding the temperature of the room and the effect that temperature would have on the rate of rigidity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the body. The trial court was not incorrect in finding that the uncertainties underlying Galvin\u2019s opinion did not render it \u201cwithout substantial value.\u201d Cf. <em>Going </em>v. <em>Pagani, </em>supra, 172 Conn. 33-34. Consequently, the uncertainties in this case go to the weight to be afforded Galvin\u2019s opinion, not its admissibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The defendant also asserts that Galvin\u2019s opinion as to time of death was inadmissible because it was based on unreliable and unscientific methodology. Connecticut courts utilize \u201cthe <em>Frye </em>standard in appraising the admissibility of evidence derived from innovative scientific techniques.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 30, 513 A.2d 660 (1986). <em>In Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C. App. 1923), the court stated: \u201cJust when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well recognized scientific principle or discovery, that from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>We do not, however, apply the <em>Frye </em>test to all types of expert testimony, even if technical or scientific concepts are involved. <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>227 Conn. 153, 165, 629 A.2d 1105 (1993). \u201cThe <em>Frye </em>test finds its rational basis in the degree to which the trier of fact must accept, on faith, scientific hypotheses capable of proof or disproof in court and not even generally accepted outside the courtroom. . . . <em>Frye </em>contemplates those situations in which the evidence sought to be admitted is beyond the understanding of the ordinary juror who must sacrifice his independent judgment in deference to the expert. . . . Among the dangers created by such scientific evidence is its potential to mislead lay jurors awed by an aura of mystic infallibility surrounding scientific techniques, experts and the fancy devices employed. . . . The fact that a technique or method has gained general acceptance in the scientific community to which it belongs tends to ensure that the jury will not accord undue weight to theories whose validity has not been adequately tested. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u201cSuch infirmities do not inhere in all types of expert evidence. Accordingly, the <em>Frye </em>test has been either ignored or rejected in cases in which the method used by the expert was a matter of physical comparison rather than scientific test or experiment . . . the basic data upon which the expert relied was verifiable by the factfinder . . . or where established techniques were applied to the solution of novel problems. ... In such cases, the jury is in a position to weigh the probative value of the testimony without abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment to the expert\u2019s assertions based on his special skill or knowledge. . . . Furthermore, where understanding of the method is accessible to the jury, and not dependent on familiarity with highly technical or obscure scientific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>theories, the expert\u2019s qualifications, and the logical bases of his opinions and conclusions can be effectively challenged by cross-examination and rebuttal evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>205 Conn. 485, 490-91, 534 A.2d 877 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Because Galvin\u2019s testimony falls within this category, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it into evidence. Galvin\u2019s methodology might be described as follows: She applied the generally accepted principle that colder temperatures slow the rate of rigidity to her personal observations of the rate of rigidity in bodies stored in her morgue refrigerator and her general expertise in forensic pathology to arrive at an estimated range of time in which the death might have occurred. In other words, because she knew that cold decelerates the rigidity process, but did not know the exact rate of the slowing effect, she developed a hypothesis as to the effect the cold temperature had in this case. The defendant does not take issue with the fact that medical examiners regularly render opinions as to time of death without knowledge of all the predicate facts, as long as their opinions constitute estimates within a range of time. The general method of applying assumptions derived from uncertain information to known facts to arrive at an opinion as to time of death is not an innovative technique for medical examiners. The defendant also does not, and cannot, challenge the fact that experts agree that temperature affects the rate of rigidity. The defendant is not claiming that Galvin accounted for environmental data but challenges the accuracy of her opinion as to how much the colder temperature affected the rate of rigidity in this case. The weight to be accorded Galvin\u2019s estimate, however, is something the jury could determine because direct and cross-examination revealed that her estimate as to the effect of the temperature was a hypothesis and not depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>dent on established standards. The jury\u2019s understanding of this fact, and of Galvin\u2019s method, was \u201cnot dependent on familiarity with highly technical or obscure scientific theories . . . .\u201d Id., 491. Thus, because the jury was in a position to weigh the probative value of the testimony without abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Gal-vin\u2019s testimony into evidence. See id., 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Exclusion of Defendant\u2019s Expert\u2019s Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly excluded his expert\u2019s opinion as to the time of death because of an alleged violation of a sequestration order. He argues that the court\u2019s preclusion of this testimony was a \u201cdraconian penalty\u201d that deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense and to confront an adverse witness. As a subsidiary argument, the defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that the sequestration order was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. At the commencement of trial, at the request of both the defendant and the state, the court entered a sequestration order pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 876<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> During its case, the defense called Louis Roh, a forensic pathologist, to rebut the testimony of Galvin and to offer an opinion as to time of death. Roh testified generally as to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>qualifications and the factors considered by forensic pathologists in estimating time of death. When the defendant asked Roh about a photograph of the victim, the state objected and requested that the jury be excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The state then moved that Roh be prohibited from testifying as to substantive matters due to a violation of the sequestration order on the part of the defendant. The defendant acknowledged that before he testified, Roh had been provided with the transcript of Galvin\u2019s trial testimony. Following argument, the trial court ruled that the defendant had violated the sequestration order and, consequently, that Roh would be precluded from testifying as to substantive matters. The defendant inquired if Roh would be permitted to continue testifying \u201cin an academic sense\u201d as he had before the state\u2019s objection. The court stated that such testimony was not barred by the ruling. The defendant then continued his direct examination, during which Roh testified generally and at length about issues raised in Gal-vin\u2019s testimony. For example, Roh testified as to the manner in which medical examiners consider lividity, rigidity, decomposition and room temperature when estimating time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u201cThe primary purpose of a sequestration order is to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial by preventing witnesses from shaping their testimony to corroborate falsely the testimony of others. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 200, 187 A.2d 442 (1962).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumble, </em>24 Conn. App. 57, 61, 585 A.2d 1245, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 902, 588 A.2d 1077 (1991). \u201cExpert witnesses are not excepted under either the rule of practice or the statute and may be sequestered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 27, 444 A.2d 213 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Soltes, </em>20 Conn. App. 342, 346, 566 A.2d 1374 (1989), appeal dismissed, 215 Conn. 614, 577 A.2d 717 (1990). \u201c \u2018An inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>case is necessary to ascertain whether the purpose of a sequestration order has been thwarted.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumble, </em>supra, 61, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>16 Conn. App. 172, 182, 547 A.2d 77, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 821, 551 A.2d 758 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Turning first to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court incorrectly found a violation of the sequestration order, we conclude that the court was correct in its determination. There is no dispute that the defendant furnished Roh with the transcript of Galvin\u2019s trial testimony before Roh took the stand. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 26, our Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s conduct in providing witnesses barred from the courtroom during . . . testimony with a verbatim transcript of that testimony was a clear violation of any sequestration order, narrow or broad, and the trial court erred in finding otherwise.\u201d In light of the purpose of sequestration orders, stated previously, we conclude that the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Falby </em>is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The defendant also challenges the sanction that the court imposed for the violation of the sequestration order. \u201cThe remedy for such a violation rests in the trial court\u2019s discretion, guided by a primary concern for \u2018the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the [offender].\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>186 Conn. 476, 488-89, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 27. The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it imposed a sanction that deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense and to confront an adverse witness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The court did not exclude all of Roh\u2019s testimony. He was permitted to testify extensively as to matters relevant to determining time of death. Toward the goal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>rebutting Galvin\u2019s general testimony and her methodology in determining the victim\u2019s time of death, such testimony was valuable to the defendant. Roh was prevented from offering an opinion as to time of death contrary to Galvin\u2019s. The defendant, however, had the opportunity, through his direct examination of Roh and defense expert Kenneth Elovitz, a professional engineer, and his cross-examination of Galvin, to undermine Galvin\u2019s opinion. The defendant also had the opportunity, which he failed to utilize, to engage another expert witness pathologist to testify on the subject of time of death. We are satisfied in this case that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Roh\u2019s opinion as to time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Admission of Hearsay Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence hearsay statements, allegedly made by the victim, under the state of mind and catchall exceptions to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">During its case-in-chief, out of the presence of the jury, the state made an offer of proof as to questions it intended to ask regarding discussions the victim had had with various witnesses in which she expressed, inter alia, her feelings concerning her relationship with the defendant, her knowledge that the defendant had been having an affair with Nancy Prescott, that Prescott had had a baby by the defendant, that she was going to have a baby and details the stormy status of her relationship with the defendant. The defendant objected to the admission of such testimony on the basis that it would be hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Following argument, the trial court generally overruled the objection on the basis of the state of mind and residuary exceptions to the hearsay rule. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the court found that the offer of proof was \u201call over the lot\u201d and that the various rules of law applicable to the different proposed statements were \u201cclaimed and reviewed in somewhat of a garbled, mixed way,\u201d it specified that it was \u201cgoing to require that the parties particularize their objections as the evidence comes in . . . . I don\u2019t want the defense to be limited with regard to their objections. The only thing that I will ask is that if you just indicate it\u2019s the same basis, then we won\u2019t have to renew the legal arguments attendant to the offers from time to time.\u201d Subsequently, during the state\u2019s direct examination of four witnesses, the defense objected to individual questions on the basis of hearsay, which objections were overruled by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The defendant claims that all of the victim\u2019s statements were inadmissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule. He asserts that the state actually offered the statements to show his motive, rather than the victim\u2019s state of mind. He also argues that the statements could not be admitted under the catchall exception because they lacked the requisite indicia of reliability and were not reasonably necessary. See C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 11.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In making these general allegations of error, however, the defendant has not complied with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 4065 (d) (3).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This seriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>limits our review because, although we know that the general basis for the defendant\u2019s objection as to admissibility of statements that showed state of mind is relevancy, we are not obligated to examine over 100 pages of testimony to determine which questions were proper and which were not. Regardless, we conclude that even if the trial court improperly admitted each challenged hearsay statement, the defendant has failed to prove that the admission of any one of them was harmful. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>214 Conn. 616, 629, 573 A.2d 716 (1990). Our review of the pertinent transcript reveals that each question to which the defendant objected on the basis of hearsay related to the subject matter referred to by the state in its offer of proof. All of this evidence was offered to show the deteriorated relationship between the defendant and the victim. In this respect, there was an abundance of evidence already before the jury as to the stress between the Shermans and many of the challenged questions sought to elicit specific facts already in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>y</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Postverdict Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The final issue in this appeal is whether the verdict was so clearly against the manifest weight of the evidence that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant, relying on State v. <em>Hammond, </em>221 Conn. 264, 604 A.2d 793 (1992), argues that because the verdict contradicts undisputed physical and mechanical facts, his conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u201cAppellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a motion for a new trial must take into account the trial judge\u2019s superior opportunity to assess the proceedings over which he or she has personally presided. . . . [We] have accordingly confined our role to a determination of whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id., 269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u201cOne cogent reason for overturning the verdict of a jury is that the verdict is based on conclusions that are physically impossible. \u2018[A] verdict should be set aside \u201c[w]here testimony is thus in conflict with indisputable physical facts, the facts demonstrate that the testimony is either intentionally or unintentionally untrue, and leave no real question of conflict of evidence for the jury concerning which reasonable minds could reasonably differ.\u201d <em>Budaj </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>108 Conn. 474, 476, 143 A. 527 (1928).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>[178 Conn. 450, 457, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980)].\u201d Id., 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 264, it was undisputed, based on uncontroverted blood typing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>DNA evidence, that it was physically impossible for the defendant to have committed the sexual assault in question. The case at hand is distinguishable in that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the scientific facts upon which he relies were not indisputable such as to \u201c \u2018leave no real question of conflict of evidence for the jury concerning which reasonable minds could reasonably differ.\u2019 \u201d Id., 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The defendant argues that the state\u2019s theory of guilt in this case is premised on physically impossible facts and conclusions regarding the time of death. He first asserts that the \u201cunrebutted and unchallenged testimony\u201d of Elovitz established that it was mechanically impossible for an air conditioner similar to that in the defendant\u2019s bedroom to lower the room temperature below seventy degrees. He also maintains that Roh\u2019s testimony established that after two and one-half days, the time claimed by the state to have elapsed between the time of death and the fetal autopsy, a fetus would have shown a more advanced condition of maceration than it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The defendant, however, mischaracterizes the dis-putability of the conclusions to be drawn from this evidence. Elovitz\u2019 testimony related to a theoretical air conditioner similar in size and capacity to the air conditioner in the defendant\u2019s bedroom, operating properly under normal conditions. Also, the state produced testimony from various witnesses from which the jury could have inferred that, notwithstanding Elovitz\u2019 testimony, the bedroom temperature was considerably lower than normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Roh\u2019s testimony concerning the maceration of the fetus was derived from his interpretation of the underlying autopsy data. Roh explained on cross-examination that much of his testimony on direct examination was premised on a live mother and dead fetus and that fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tors such as a dead mother and room temperature could affect the maceration rate of the fetus. Moreover, Roh, who did not perform the autopsy, testified that pathology is an inexact science. Such evidence is not the type \u201cthat renders prior expert opinions as to the [time] of death scientifically impossible or improbable. Indeed, if it were, \u2018[t]he ultimate result would be a never-ending battle of [pathologists] appointed [or retained] as experts for the sole purpose of discrediting a prior [pathologist\u2019s] diagnosis.\u2019 <em>Silagy </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>905 F.2d 986, 1013 (7th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1110, 111 S.

Consequently, we cannot say that the trial court abused its broad discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, our Supreme Court transferred the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court.

Beyond his assertion that these questions were improper, the defendant has provided us with no analysis or legal authority to support this claim. Because the issue is inadequately briefed, it is deemed abandoned and we decline to review it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Yopp, </em>35 Conn.

We, therefore, deem this claim abandoned. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Yopp, </em>35 Conn. App. 740, 750, 646 A.2d 298 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
