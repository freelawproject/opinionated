GOLD, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1402-5\">1. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-6\">As the docket sheet demonstrates, this case has been extraordinarily contentious since it was first filed in March 2009. While most civil actions focus on the merits of the underlying dispute, this case has been inundated with ancillary issues, including alleged ethical and criminal violations, petitions by non-parties seeking to intervene, foreclosures, concomitant foreign proceedings and more, many of which still require resolution. This Order addresses as many of the outstanding issues as practicable, given their number and complexity. Oral argument was held on February 1, 2010. The most pressing matter was the Defendants\u2019 objections to the Special Master\u2019s Report and Recommendation that this Court report certain activities to authorities for criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-7\">The Special Master\u2019s Report and Recommendation is very serious.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For reasons stated in this Order, I have a solemn duty to \u201cpreserve the integrity of this Court\u201d and to \u201cnotify the proper authorities\u201d in accordance with the Federal Judicial Code of Conduct because I conclude that a crime has been, or may have been, committed in connection with a matter over which I preside. <em>See </em>Code of Conduct for the United States Judges, Compendium Section \u00a7 1.1(c) (2009); <em>cf. Brookings v. Clunk, </em>389 F.3d 614, 623 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cAdditionally ... Judge Clunk had an obligation to report potentially obstructive conduct to the proper authorities if he felt such conduct had occurred in a case before him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-10\">The Special Master\u2019s Report and Recommendation does not occur in a vacuum of which I have no understanding. I already have devoted significant time (as evidenced by the already lengthy docket) to hear numerous matters in this case. I have acquired detailed knowledge as a result of the preliminary injunction hearings, contempt hearings, and other miscellaneous hearings at which I have heard testimony, reviewed numerous documents, and had an opportunity to determine the credibility of witnesses. This prior background has helped me place into context the Report of the Special Master which I am now considering and which is the primary subject of this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-11\">I have had serious reservations about this litigation from the beginning. As noted in my \u201cInterim Order Following Hearing on Preliminary Injunction and Appointing Special Master\u201d [DE 348], it was clear that many hundreds of innocent investors have suffered greatly. Derek and Frederick Elliott (\u201cthe Elliotts\u201d), individually, and acting on behalf of the numerous corporations they control in foreign countries, have claimed the fault lies with James Catledge and his Impact sales associates, who marketed the Dominican resort projects at issue in these proceedings. Based on what I heard directly from Plaintiff Hofmann and other witnesses at the preliminary injunction hearing, I never did understand \u2014 and still do not understand\u2014 why Catledge, his principal associates, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>his company, Impact, were not named as party defendants in the most recent Amended Complaint. Nearly everyone else associated with the Juan Dolio and Cofresi projects was named by the Plaintiffs. As early as May 22, 2009, I voiced my concerns, finding a \u201clack of candor and actions of both Plaintiffs and Defendants.\u201d [DE 348, p. 12].</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">In the beginning, I gave the Elliotts the benefit of the doubt that they were misled by Impact and Catledge, and were being set up in an aggressive civil action funded by Catledge as a ploy to divert attention from himself. This contention was initially supported by the dual manner in which these proceedings were filed: besides the <em>Hofmann </em>case, a companion proceeding was initiated by numerous additional plaintiffs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which included Catledge and his Impact associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">After considering the evidence presented at the preliminary injunction hearing, I believed that the Elliotts should be allowed to attempt to save the Cofresi and Juan Dolio projects because they were most familiar with them, and ordered the Elliotts to provide a business plan to do so. What I received was patently insufficient and raised immediate concerns about what was really going on in this case. I needed help to sort all of this out, and therefore appointed Special Master Thomas E. Scott, a former United States District Judge and a former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, to assist me. As things progressed, my confidence in the Elliotts, and in what they had been telling me, diminished greatly, resulting in findings of contempt after motions by the Plaintiffs and upon recommendations from the Special Master.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">As detailed in my discussion below, Special Master Scott\u2019s role in this matter has increased incrementally by order of this Court. I increased his responsibilities, with the consent of the parties, as it became clear that the Elliotts were unable to save the projects from foreclosure. I also increased Special Master Scott\u2019s role as I lost confidence in the Elliotts and in the truthfulness of their representations. I only declined to appoint a receiver because of the complications of having one recognized in the Dominican Republic. Out of necessity, I expanded Mr. Scott\u2019s role to that of a \u201cMonitor,\u201d because I was greatly concerned about what happened to the millions of dollars in investor money. I had good reason to believe, and still believe (particularly after hearing from the Defendants and their new counsel at the February 1st hearing), that the Elliotts and their companies seek to regain possession of the projects, either directly or indirectly, after the foreclosures wiped out the investors. I also remain concerned that investor money was improperly used by the Elliotts to purchase the Miches property, which is now being offered for sale. The only check in place to prevent the execution of such a scheme is by means of the Monitor Order [DE 528] (\u201cthe Monitor Order\u201d). If anything is clear after the last hearing, the Defendants desperately want the Monitoring Order and Tom Scott to leave them be so they can once again go about their business without Court scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-11\">Under my authority, Mr. Scott placed Mr. Kip Rabin, an accomplished forensic accountant and businessperson, on-site to see what was happening to the money and to assist with the monitoring functions. From what Mr. Rabin saw and reviewed, and from what Mr. Scott reported, I found a great likelihood that important documents were in danger of being destroyed to hide possible crimes, and I authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>Mr. Scott and Mr. Rabin to secure the documents and prepare a preliminary forensic analysis. By then, the investors\u2019 interests had been wiped out through foreclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">While I understand Defendants\u2019 concerns regarding a referral to the appropriate authorities, I cannot stand idly by as revelations of seemingly criminal activity continue to amass. In referring this matter to the authorities, I acknowledge and affirm that I am not a prosecutor. As such, the reference will be made in a neutral fashion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> carefully calculated to avoid passing judgment on the culpability of the persons involved. However, to the extent that my silence can be construed as indifference to the allegations of criminal activity that have effectively engulfed this case, I remain silent no longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">II. The Special Master\u2019s Report and Recommendation Following Preliminary Forensic Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">\n<em>A. The Appointment of the Special Master and the Monitor Expansion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AsA\">I now turn to address in more detail the matters introduced above. As the parties are aware, Special Master Scott has been serving as Special Master in this matter since May 22, 2009 per court order. <em>See </em>[DE 348]. His appointment was made pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, which allows district judges to appoint a master to \u201caddress pretrial and post-trial matters that cannot be effectively and timely addressed by an available district judge or magistrate judge of the district.\u201d Special Master Scott\u2019s appointment was ordered following a hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction, when it became apparent that I was in need of assistance to \u201cinvestigate and recommend resolution of the many issues presented] in this case\u201d \u2014 issues that required such a tremendous amount of travel, investigation, and coordination with the parties that they would have been impossible for myself or a magistrate judge to address without assistance. <em>See </em>[DE 348].</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-10\">In my Order appointing Special Master Scott, I specifically noted that \u201cI envisioned] Master Scott\u2019s role to involve two phases \u2014 the first an investigation, and the second a recommendation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With regard to the investigation, I ordered that it encompass, among other things, \u201cthe potential diversion of Juan Dolio monies to other Elliott businesses, including whether such diversion was at the behest of James Cateldge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In accordance with my directives, the Special Master began his work in earnest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-11\">By July 2009, it had become apparent\u2014 thanks in large part to the excellent investigative work of the Special Master \u2014 that the situation at the Juan Dolio and Sun Village Cofresi properties was dire, and that there was a \u201cserious and imminent threat of foreclosure.\u201d [DE 528, p. 1] (\u201cthe Monitor Order\u201d). After considering the possibility of appointing a receiver at an emergency hearing, the Plaintiffs and the Elliott Defendants<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> agreed to \u201cthe granting of enhanced monitoring authority to the Special Master.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. That authority' \u2014 -which was expressly bestowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>upon the Special Master by this Court\u2014 provided the Special Master with the \u201cfull power and authority necessary to carry out\u201d the following, among other things: (1) \u201c[ijnvestigate any and all transfers of monies, property, assets, records or other tangible things that the Monitor may believe have wrongfully, illegally, or otherwise improperly been misappropriated or transferred, including but not limited to monies or other proceeds directly or indirectly traceable from the Elliott Defendants\u201d; (2) \u201c[h]ave access to inspect, review, audit, inventory, assess and evaluate all property, assets, and estates of every kind, whatsoever and wheresoever located, belonging to or in the possession of the Elliott Defendants and all entities that they own or control (directly or indirectly, including through a nominee or trustee)\u201d; and (3) \u201c[ajppoint one or more special agents, employ legal counsel, actuaries, accountants, clerks, consultants and assistants as the Monitor deems necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">\n<em>B. The Special Master\u2019s Investigation, the Preservation of Evidence, and the Special Master\u2019s November Report Following Preliminary Forensic Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">As the Special Master\u2019s investigation progressed, the need to protect sensitive and highly relevant information became a serious concern, particularly given the threat of foreclosure and the lack of security at the Cofresi Resort. Ultimately, these concerns became so grave that the Special Master advised that the court-ordered investigation was in imminent danger of being irreparably jeopardized. As such, the Special Master and Mr. Rabin requested, on an emergency basis, \u201c[t]hat [Mr. Rabin] be authorized, as the District Court\u2019s direct representative to seize and remove any and all documentation, computers, hard-drives or other similar materials which exist on the Cofresi Resort and which [Mr. Rabin], in his discretion, believes contain sensitive or relevant information to the issues in this lawsuit.\u201d [DE 829]. Recognizing the detrimental and irreversible consequences that would result from the loss or destruction of such documents, I granted the Special Master\u2019s request on September 16, 2009. <em>See </em>[DE 833].</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-9\">On September 18, 2009, the Special Master prepared a Report and Recommendations in anticipation of a hearing on various contested matters. <em>See </em>[DE 706]. This report provided, among other things, an update as to the inspections, assessments, and analyses undertaken by the Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>Master in accordance with the Monitor Order. <em>See </em>[DE 706]. Specifically, the September 18th Report noted that \u201c[a]fter a long five (5) weeks of the Manager\u2019s direct involvement at the Resort ... massive amounts of information and documentation (some electronic and some physical) [had] been obtained\u201d and requested the Court\u2019s permission to continue a \u201cforensic examination of the records and information obtained to date ... in preparation for providing an interim report and recommendation regarding the future course of conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 23-26. At the September 18, 2009 hearing, I expressed to the parties that I intended to allow the Special Master to continue his limited forensic examination of the available materials. [Sep. 18, 2010 Tr. at 21:23-22:2]. No objections were raised, and my decision was subsequently memorialized in a written order. <em>See </em>[DE 714].</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">In accordance with my directives, the Special Master issued his Report and Recommendation Following Preliminary Forensic Analysis on November 12, 2009, 2009 WL 5895055 [DE 832] (\u201cthe Report\u201d). This Report, which is based on a preliminary forensic analysis of materials obtained both directly from the Defendants and from the resorts themselves, outlines what the Special Master suspects was a \u201cmassive fraud and, essentially, a theft of investor monies\u201d carried out by James Catledge, the Elliotts, and their respective employees, attorneys, and agents via a \u201cPonzi-type scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 13. The Report notes that, in the Special Master\u2019s opinion, \u201c[t]here is enough and sufficient information available which establishes a reasonable and supportable conclusion that criminal activities have occurred and/or are still ongoing\u201d and suggests that these \u201cactivities [ ] be investigated and prosecuted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The Report then identifies a number of \u201cindividuals and entities [that] should at least be evaluated and investigated by the appropriate authorities\u201d for having possibly participated in, facilitated, or otherwise assisted criminal acts, including \u201ccriminal RICO violations ... securities violations ... wire fraud, tax fraud, and money-laundering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Special Master concludes the Report with a series of specific recommendations. First, he recommends that the individuals and entities listed in the Report be referred to the appropriate criminal authorities, which are identified therein. <em>Id. </em>at 50. Second, he recommends that James Catledge be ordered to produce certain documents to this Court. <em>Id. </em>Third, he recommends that I enter an order re-freezing certain accounts belonging to Defendants Enrique De Marchena and De Marchena Kaluche &amp; Asociados (\u201cthe DMK Defendants\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Fourth and finally, he recommends that I re-freeze all of the Elliott-related Resort-Com accounts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-7\">\n<em>C. Objections to the Special Master\u2019s November 12, 2009 Report Following Preliminary Forensic Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-8\">Not surprisingly, the Special Master\u2019s November 12, 2009 Report drew vociferous objections from the Defendants referenced therein. The first Defendants to object were the DMK Defendants <em>See </em>[DE 859]. In their Objections, the DMK Defendants argue that the Special Master \u201coverreached his legal authority and impermissibly usurped the duties and obligations of the Plaintiffs, this Court, and the putative jury\u201d in authoring the Report. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Specifically, the DMK Defendants assert that \u201cnowhere in the terms of reference ... was the special master charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>developing and proving a two-tier RICO liability theory of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. They further contend that this Court impermissibly \u201crefer[red] the determination of the case\u2019s underlying RICO merits to a special master\u201d in a manner that constituted \u201can abdication of judicial function depriving the parties of a trial before the court on the basic issues involved in the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">Then, on December 16, 2009, the Corporate Defendants objected to the Report,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> asserting that the Special Master: \u201c(1) exceeded the scope of his mandate to produce a forensic report by developing and attempting to prove a \u2018two-tier RICO liability theory of the case\u2019 in order to reach his ultimate conclusion that the Corporate Defendants, their principals and indeed their professionals are guilty of criminal conduct; (2) made numerous inaccurate factual and legal statements and conclusions; and (3) deprived the Corporate Defendants of their due process rights by relying upon an incomplete evidentiary record which has not been seen or challenged by the Corporate Defendants.\u201d [DE 883, pp. 2-3].</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">The final set of objections was filed by <em>pro se </em>Defendants Frederick and Derek Elliott (\u201cthe Elliotts\u201d), who joined in the Corporate Defendants\u2019 Objections<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, and supplemented them with objections of their own. In their Objections, the Elliotts complain that \u201cthe Special Master has completely prejudiced [their] defense in this case\u201d and \u201cdenied [them] due process\u201d in a manner that went \u201cbeyond the scope of his duties and beyond the scope of this litigation.\u201d [DE 884, pp. 1-2]. The Elliotts further contend that \u201c[i]t is now time to remove the Special Master\u201d and that the Report \u201cmust surely prejudice any judge or court from even hearing the matter if [it] has been entertained or even read by such parties,\u201d which I construe as a Motion to Disqualify the Special Master and the Undersigned.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Finally, the Elliotts request that all documents and materials be \u201creturned to the Corporate Defendants immediately,\u201d that the Special Master provide them with a detailed accounting, that certain funds be released, and that their Objections be posted on Plaintiffs\u2019 website. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>\n<em>D. Defendants\u2019 Procedural Due Process Objections</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">A common theme that echoes loudly throughout the Defendants\u2019 Objections is that their procedural due process rights were violated when the Special Master issued his Report \u201cwithout permitting the DMK Defendants and the Elliott individual and corporate Defendants the opportunity to be heard.\u201d [DE 859, p. 9]; <em>see also </em>[DE 883, pp. 2-3] (Special Master \u201cdeprived the Corporate Defendants of their due process rights by relying upon an incomplete evidentiary record which has not been seen or challenged by the Corporate Defendants.\u201d); [DE 884, pp. 1-2] (Special Master \u201cdenied [Elliotts] due process\u201d and made \u201cunsupported allegations without any judicial process.\u201d) Having carefully considered Defendants\u2019 objections, the applicable law, and the totality of the circumstances, I conclude that Defendants have not been unconstitutionally deprived of due process of law for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">The Supreme Court of the Untied States has \u201cexplained that \u2018procedural due process<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of \u2018liberty\u2019 or \u2018property\u2019 interests within the meaning of the Due Process clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 \u201d and generally \u201crequires notice and an opportunity to be heard before any governmental deprivation of a property or liberty interest.\u201d <em>Grayson v. King, </em>460 F.3d 1328, 1340 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 901, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)); <em>United States v. Powerstein, </em>185 Fed.Appx. 811 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Zipperer v. City of Fort Myers, </em>41 F.3d 619, 623 (11th Cir.1995)). However, where a party cannot demonstrate an <em>actual </em>deprivation of \u201ca constitutionally-protected interest,\u201d there can be no due process violation \u2014 in other words, \u201ca risk of deprivation\u201d will not suffice. <em>Mobley v. Hicks, </em>291 Fed.Appx. 217, 219 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that in order to demonstrate a deprivation of interest for purposes of a procedural due process analysis, a party \u201cmust allege a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected interest, not merely a risk of deprivation.\u201d) (cites and quotes omitted); <em>Stapp v. Avoyelles Parish School Bd., </em>545 F.2d 527 (5th Cir.1977) (\u201c[p]rior to any consideration of the sufficiency or necessity of procedural due process protections, [party] must demonstrate deprivation of an interest in \u201clife, liberty, or property\u201d within the protections of the Due Process Clause.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-8\">While the Defendants\u2019 Objections do not specifically point to a constitutionally-protected interest of which they have been deprived as a result of the Special Master\u2019s Report, it appears that their complaints are three-fold: (1) that they have been denied of their constitutionally-protected right to a fair trial<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by the Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>Master\u2019s usurpation of \u201cthe duties and obligations of the Plaintiffs, this Court, and the putative jury\u201d;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) that they have been \u201cdefamefd]\u201d by the Report which \u201cread[s] like a prosecutor\u2019s bill of indictment;\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (3) that the Court-ordered removal of records and documents<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> from the resort unconstitutionally deprived the Corporate Defendants of their property interest in those documents.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Because I have no intention of adopting the Special Master\u2019s findings and conclusions at this juncture, or allowing the Report to be presented to the jury, <em>see </em>Section 11(F), <em>infra, </em>I summarily reject the argument that the Special Master\u2019s Report deprives Defendants of their constitutionally-protected right to a fair trial. I order that the Special Master\u2019s Report, as such, will play no direct role in the ultimate trial of this action. Of course, this does not mean that the Manager may not be called as a witness, or that the documents associated with the Special Master\u2019s Report may not be offered into evidence; however, Plaintiffs will not be permitted to rely on the Report in lieu of having to carry its evidentiary burden. How these matters will eventually work out remains to be seen, particularly given that the documents at issue have been subpoenaed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as part of its ongoing investigation into matters associated with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-13\"> I also reject Defendants\u2019 defamation argument. Even if the contents of the Special Master\u2019s Report were ultimately proven to be false, defamation by a government actor, without more, is insufficient to establish a due process violation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While the United States Supreme Court has recognized the \u201cdrastic effect of the \u2018stigma\u2019 which may result from defamation by the government in a variety of contexts, this line of cases does not establish the proposition that reputation alone, apart from some more tangible interests such as employment, is either \u2018liberty\u2019 or \u2018property\u2019 by itself sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1161, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976) (emphasis added). This constitutional rule is known as the \u201cstigma-plus\u201d test and is consistently applied in this Circuit. <em>Cannon v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>250 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>plaintiff claiming a deprivation based on defamation by the government must establish the fact of the defamation \u2018plus\u2019 the violation of some more tangible interest before the plaintiff is entitled to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause.\u201d) Here, the Objecting Defendants (i.e., the Elliotts, the Corporate Defendants, and the DMK Defendants) have not established that the issuance of the Report damaged \u201csome more tangible interest\u201d aside from reputation, and, as such, cannot demonstrate that the Special Master\u2019s Report, even if defamatory, violated their procedural due process rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">Nor can the Corporate Defendants or the Elliotts claim that they have been deprived of their corporate records without due process of law, for they expressly consented to the expansive powers bestowed upon the Special Master through the Monitor Order. <em>See </em>[DE 528]. As detailed above, <em>see </em>Section 11(A), <em>supra, </em>the Monitor Order provided the Special Master with the \u201cfull power and authority necessary to carry out\u201d investigations regarding \u201cmonies, property, assets, records or other tangible things that the Monitor may believe have wrongfully, illegally, or otherwise improperly been misappropriated or transferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-4. This grant of authority \u2014 to which the Elliott Defendants consented \u2014 is quite broad, and will not be construed so narrowly as to preclude the removal of sensitive documents and records for safe-keeping on an emergency basis per court order, especially where those documents were believed to be necessary and critical to the Special Master\u2019s court-ordered investigations and were in danger of spoliation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">Additionally, even if it could be argued that the removal of documents from Cofresi did not fall within the purview of the agreed-to Monitor Order (which is not the case), the emergency removal of critical documents and records would still not rise to the level of a due process violation. Due process, as the Supreme Court has often stated \u201cis a flexible concept that varies with the particular situation.\u201d <em>Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 127, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). In determining what procedural protections the Constitution requires in a particular case, courts are instructed to weigh several factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-8\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>While applying this test usually requires \u201can opportunity for some kind of hearing prior to the deprivation of a significant property interest ... [the Supreme] Court has recognized that where the potential length or severity of the deprivation does not indicate a likelihood of serious loss and where the procedures underlying the decision to act are sufficiently reliable to minimize the risk of erroneous determination, government may act without providing additional advance procedural safeguards.\u201d <em>Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 20, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978). Such is the case here. First, \u201cthe initial hardship to the [Elliott Defendants] is limited,\u201d as they were only temporarily deprived of documents and records that could have been readily duplicated and/or returned to them upon request. <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 619, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974). Second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest was minimal given that the \u201cprocess proceeded] under judicial supervision and management.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>416 U.S. at 619, 94 S.Ct. 1895; and finally, the Court\u2019s interest in preserving the documents at issue was overwhelming, particularly given the likelihood of spoliation,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the allegations of criminality, and the immediate and irreparable threat to Special Master Scott\u2019s court-ordered investigation. As such, I conclude that this qualifies as one of the rarely-presented situations where Special Master Scott and I were constitutionally permitted to act without providing additional advance procedural safeguards to the Elliott Defendants.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">\n<em>E. The Special Master\u2019s Duties Regarding Perceived Criminal Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-8\">In addition to the alleged due process violations outlined above, the Objecting Defendants assert that the Special Master \u201cexceeded the scope of his mandate\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by preparing a Report that outlines various instances of potentially criminal conduct. I disagree. Having reviewed the Report and the applicable law, I conclude that the Special Master acted within his mandate and in accordance with the responsibilities he assumed as a quasi-judicial officer of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>It is well-settled that when a special master accepts an appointment by the Court, the special master assumes the duties and obligations of a judicial officer. <em>In Re Gilbert, </em>276 U.S. 6, 9, 48 S.Ct. 210, 72 L.Ed. 441 (1928). Further, with certain exceptions, special masters are subject to the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. Fed.R.Civ.P. 53, Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes, 2003 Amendments, Subdivision (a)(2) and (3). While \u201c[t]he Code of Conduct neither prohibits nor requires judges to report perceived criminal misconduct to the appropriate authorities ... a judge should take appropriate steps to bring [a] matter to the attention of the authorities\u201d if the \u201cperceived transgression is of such a nature as to create a likelihood that failure to report it would reflect adversely upon the judiciary.\u201d <em>Code of Conduct for United States Judges, </em>Compendium \u00a7 1.1(c) (2009). Moreover, \u201c[wjhere a judge in the course of judicial duties obtains information suggesting that a crime has been committed in a foreign country, it is appropriate to report the matter to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for such referral as the latter may deem warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1.1(b) (2009). Here, the Special Master obtained information in the course of his quasi-judicial duties suggesting that serious crimes had been committed, both domestically and abroad. As such, by preparing his Report, he did exactly what the Code of Conduct contemplates: he took steps to bring the matter to my attention so that an appropriate referral could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">While I certainly understand the concerns of the Objecting Defendants insofar as the Special Master\u2019s Report might be perceived as making \u201callegations of criminal conduct like a prosecutor,\u201d [DE 883, p. 3], I emphasize that the Report\u2019s contents are not being adopted by this Court at this time, and that the referral of these matters to the appropriate authorities will be made in a neutral fashion with the appropriate disclaimers as to the preliminary nature of the Report (i.e., the limited information upon which its conclusions rest). <em>See </em>Code of Conduct for United States Judges, Compendium \u00a7 1.1(d) (instructing that \u201c[w]hen a judge decides to take action in response to perceived misconduct, the reference to appropriate authorities should be made in a neutral fashion\u201d). Moreover, in the interests of justice and fairness, I assure the Objecting Defendants that any referral to the criminal authorities will be accompanied by their objections to the Special Master\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-6\">\n<em>F. Because This Court is Not Adopting or Affirming the Special Master\u2019s Report, There is No Need to Rule on Defendants\u2019 Objections to the Special Master\u2019s Factual Findings and Legal Conclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-7\">Contrary to Defendants\u2019 assertions, I have no intention of adopting or affirming the factual findings and legal conclusions set forth in the Special Master\u2019s Report. <em>See </em>[DE 859 p. 12] (\u201cSpecial Master\u2019s findings of fact regarding the DMK Defendants cannot be adopted because of the lack of a substantial evidentiary basis ... and the gross procedural violations.\u201d). Nor will I pass judgment on the truthfulness of the statements contained therein, or the civil or criminal liability of any person, for these sorts of determinations are first to be made by investigating governmental agencies and prosecutors, and later, as warranted, by Grand Juries and Petit Juries. However, having reviewed the Special Master\u2019s Report and the entire record in the cause to date (with which I am familiar), I am left with the firm belief that criminal activities warranting further investigation have occurred in connection with a matter over which I preside. Accordingly, I will take the necessary steps consistent with this Order to bring these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>matters to the attention of the appropriate authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">\n<em>G. Frederick and Derek Elliotts\u2019 Requests for (1) Documents, (2) a Detailed Accounting, (S) the Release of Funds, and (4) the Posting of their Objections on Plaintiffs\u2019 Website.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">In their Objections to the Special Master\u2019s Report, Frederick and Derek Elliott request that (1) all documents and materials be \u201creturned to the Corporate Defendants immediately\u201d; (2) that the Special Master provide them with a detailed accounting of certain funds; (3) that certain funds be released; and (4) that their Objections be posted on Plaintiffs\u2019 website. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 7. The Elliotts\u2019 request to return the documents is now moot because all of the documents are in the process of being turned over to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with a subpoena [DE 947].<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, I deny the request to turn over documents without prejudice. Such request may be re-filed if and when the documents are returned to the possession of the Special Master. The Special Master is unable to perform any detailed accounting without the records under subpoena, and, in any event, no money remains to pay the Special Master for such an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">The Elliotts\u2019 remaining objections are without merit, with one exception. I find no basis to release any funds to the Elliotts, particularly given my findings of their contempt as later addressed in this Order. I agree, however, with the Elliotts\u2019 request that their objections to the Special Master\u2019s Report should be posted on the Court\u2019s website along with the Special Master\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-10\">\n<em>H. Frederick and Derek Elliotts\u2019 Request for the Disqualification of the Undersigned and the Special Master</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-11\">In their Objections to the Special Master\u2019s Report, the Elliotts contend that the Special Master and the Undersigned should be disqualified because the nature of the Report \u201cmust surely prejudice any judge or court from even hearing the matter if [it] has been entertained or even read by such parties.\u201d [DE 884, pp. 1-2]. Apparently in agreement with the Elliotts as to this issue, the Corporate Defendants adopted this argument and made an <em>ore tenus </em>request for the Special Master\u2019s removal at oral argument. [Feb. 1, 2010 Tr. at 13:19-13:24]. Having carefully considered the contents of the Report and Defendants\u2019 arguments, I agree that the Special Master\u2019s \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d and that he should therefore be disqualified from performing \u201cjudicial functions\u201d in connection with these proceedings as a Special Master, but shall not be disqualified from performing administrative or monitoring functions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Jenkins v. Sterlacci, </em>849 F.2d 627, 630-31 (D.C.Cir.1988) (noting that \u201canyone performing judicial functions ... including special masters\u201d who perform \u201cduties functionally equivalent to those performed by a judge\u201d should be disqualified \u201cin any proceeding in which his impartially might reasonably be questioned\u201d). Mr. Scott\u2019s continuation as the Court\u2019s monitor is necessary and vital to these proceedings, and is not im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>permissible given that his monitoring and administrative duties do not involve the exercise of any judicial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">Regarding the Elliotts\u2019 request to disqualify the Undersigned, I conclude that recusal is not warranted at this juncture for a number of reasons. First, the Elliotts have not set forth any facts demonstrating that \u201can objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about [my] impartiality,\u201d such that disqualification is required pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). <em>Parker v. Connors Steel Co., </em>855 F.2d 1510, 1524 (11th Cir.1988). Second, the Elliotts have not adequately alleged either: (a) the existence of bias on my part that stems \u201cfrom extrajudicial sources\u201d; or (b) \u201csuch pervasive bias and prejudice that it unfairly prejudices one of the parties.\u201d <em>Ray v. Equifax Information Servs., LLC, </em>327 Fed.Appx. 819, 825 (11th Cir.2009) (cites and quotes omitted). Of course, if the Elliotts (or any other Defendants) truly believe that I have \u201ca personal bias or prejudice either against [them] or in favor an adverse party\u201d as a result of the Special Master\u2019s Report, this Order, or for any other conceivable reason, they are free to file an affidavit to that effect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. <em>Exime v. E.W. Ventures, Inc., </em>2009 WL 1423345, *4 (S.D.Fla. May 20, 2009) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 and expounding procedures for a Section 144 recusal request).</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">\n<em>I. Extension of the Monitor Order as a Function of Civil Contempt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">The last issues I need to address in connection with Defendants\u2019 Objections to the Special Master\u2019s Report are Defendants\u2019 requests that the restrictions imposed upon them by the Monitor Order be removed. <em>See </em>[Feb. 1, 2010 Tr. at 13:16-13:18; 25:20-25:24; 51:16-51:21]. In support of these requests, Defendants assert that the Monitor Order is unduly restrictive, excessively broad in scope, and unnecessary given the circumstances. <em>See generally id. </em>at 13-51. Having considered Defendants\u2019 arguments, I conclude that a Monitor is still necessary and \u2014 as a function of Defendants\u2019 contemptuous behavior \u2014 expressly order the Objecting Defendants to continue complying with the Monitor Order pending further order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-8\">Civil contempt is remedial in scope to enforce compliance with a court order, and \u201c[district courts enjoy wide discretion to fashion an equitable remedy for [civil] contempt that is appropriate to the circumstances.\u201d <em>U.S. v. City of Miami </em>195 F.3d 1292, 1298 (11th Cir.1999) (cites and quotes omitted). Under Eleventh Circuit case law, civil contempt remedies \u201cmay serve one of two broad purposes: (1) coercing the contemnor to comply with a court order, or (2) compensating a party for losses suffered as a result of the contemptuous act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn serving these ends, a court\u2019s civil contempt power is measured solely by the \u201c \u2018requirements of full remedial relief.\u2019 \u201d \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-10\">Unlike criminal contempt proceedings, which are commenced by the court and are punitive in nature, \u201c[c]ivil contempt is designed to coerce the contemnor to comply with a court order, and a civil contempt action is brought by a private party, not the court.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Coleman, </em>681 F.2d 1302, 1306 (11th Cir.1982). Moreover, once a court finds a party to be in contempt, \u201c[t]he contemnor always has the ability to purge himself of contempt by obeying the court order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-11\">In the instant case, contempt-related issues have been front and center since May of 2009, when the <em>Hofmann </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>Plaintiffs filed their first motion for an order to show cause why the Elliott Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>dants should not be held contempt of court. <em>See </em>[DE 334]. In that motion, Plaintiffs alleged that the Elliott Defendants violated my April 15, 2009 order [DE 205] by initiating certain transfers out of a DMK trust account for purposes \u201cother than completion of the Juan Dolio hotel.\u201d [DE 334]. Although the motion was briefly discussed at a hearing, I deferred ruling on it [May 19, 2009 Tr. at 117:24-118:2].</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-5\">Ultimately, however, the contempt issues came to a head when \u2014 after a number of additional filings by Plaintiffs alleging contemptuous conduct on the part of the Elliott Defendants <em>see e.g., </em>[DE 432]; [DE 499] \u2014 the Special Master advised me through a series of Reports and Recommendations of various acts (and omissions) undertaken by the Elliott Defendants in violation of the Monitor Order. <em>See e.g., </em>[DE 563]; [DE 566]; [DE 585]. Among the allegedly contemptuous acts identified in the Special Master\u2019s Reports were: (1) that the Elliott Defendants had \u201ctransferred, or caused a transfer, of a total of $97,349.33 from their Resortcom accounts\u201d on August 5, 2009 without disclosure or authorization, [DE 585, p. 5]; and (2) that the Elliott Defendants caused more than $100,000 to be transferred in and out of Elliott-controlled bank accounts on July 28 and 29, 2009 without disclosure or authorization [DE 566, p. 6]. As a result of the amassing allegations of contemptuous behavior on the part of the Elliott Defendants, I set a show cause hearing for August 6, 2009. <em>See </em>[DE 565].</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-6\">At the August 6, 2009 show cause hearing, both Frederick and Derek Elliott were questioned extensively regarding the alleged violations of the Monitor Order. <em>See </em>[DE 594]. After hearing testimony, argument, and considering the evidence, I found the Elliotts and the Corporate Defendants <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in contempt of court for admitted violations of the express terms of the Monitor Order. <em>See </em>[Aug. 6, 2009 Tr. at 26:6-26:14] (Frederick Elliott admitting to undisclosed transfers of Elliott Defendant funds in violation of Monitor Order); [DE 603]. I also set forth various conditions that Defendants could meet to purge the contempt, and set a follow-up hearing for September 16, 2009 to determine whether the contempt had been purged. <em>Id. </em>It was not, nor has it been to this day. <em>See </em>[DE 714, p. 4].</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-9\">In the wake of the aforementioned contempt proceedings, Plaintiffs brought yet another instance of potentially contemptuous behavior to the Court\u2019s attention during a hearing on September 30, 2009. Through the questioning of Frederick Elliott at that hearing, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel elicited information regarding a recent transfer of the Cofresi Cove, at least two villas, and two apartment complexes from an Elliott-related company to Inversiones Werden, S.A (\u201cWerden\u201d), a Dominican business entity that Plaintiffs suspected was affiliated with the DMK Defendants. [Sept. 30, 2009 Tr. at 17-19]. After examining Mr. Elliott, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel questioned Mr. De Marchena regarding the relationship between Werden and the DMK Defendants. In response to this line of questioning, Mr. De Marchena denied any present affiliation and testified that his law firm had merely incorporated Werden and promptly thereafter \u201ctransferred [their] shares\u201d to a gentleman named Mr. Aleman. [Sept. 30, 2009 Tr. at 30:15-30:20].</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>Following this hearing, however, a number of submissions raised serious questions about the veracity of Mr. De Marchena\u2019s testimony. Specifically, on October 26, 2009, Plaintiff filed a Dominican governmental certificate<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> indicating that: (1) Werden\u2019s address is the office address of DMK; (2) Werden\u2019s telephone number is the telephone number for DMK; (3) two of Werden\u2019s shareholders are DMK attorneys; and (4) Werden\u2019s secretary is Mr. De Marchena. <em>See </em>[DE 795]. Second, and more importantly, was the DMK Defendants\u2019 response to Plaintiffs\u2019 filing, which effectively conceded that Mr. De Marchena was less than candid when questioned about the Werden-DMK relationship during the September 30, 2009 hearing. Notably, the DMK Defendants\u2019 response admitted that \u201cthe transfer of [Werden] shares [had] not been perfected\u201d as of November 11, 2009. [DE 834, p. 2]. Thus, notwithstanding Mr. De Marchena\u2019s testimony to the contrary, the DMK Defendants were still affiliated with Werden at the time it took title to the properties at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">In light of the foregoing, I now find by clear and convincing evidence that the DMK Defendants violated paragraph eight of the Monitor Order by taking actions affecting property, assets, or estates of the Elliott Defendants \u201cwithout the advice of and consent of the Monitor.\u201d <em>See </em>[DE 528, pp. 5-6]. Specifically, I conclude that the DMK Defendants, by virtue of their relationship with Werden, participated in the transfer of Elliott Defendant property when Werden took title to Cofresi Cove, the villas, and the apartment complexes. <em>See </em>[DE 751, pp. 16-19]; [DE 528, p. 6].<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, the DMK Defendants are in contempt of court and subject to the equitable remedy set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-7\">As noted above, Eleventh Circuit case law provides that I have \u201cwide discretion to fashion an equitable remedy for [civil] contempt that is appropriate to the circumstances.\u201d <em>City of Miami, </em>195 F.3d at 1298. Here, my primary concern is to ensure strict compliance with the Monitor Order, the enforcement of which is critical to prevent the fraudulent transfer and/or improper dissipation of Elliott Defendant assets tied to investor funds. Given this goal and the totality of the circumstances, I conclude that an appropriate remedy for Defendants\u2019 contemptuous conduct is for the Monitor to continue in his present capacity in order to ensure that the provisions of the Monitor Order are strictly complied with by all parties thereto. Accordingly, I reject Defendants\u2019 requests that the Monitor Order be lifted. Instead, the Monitor Order shall remain in full force, and the Monitor is expressly authorized and ordered to continue carrying out the functions outlined therein. Any perceived violation of the Monitor Order shall be promptly reported to this Court in the form of a \u201cMonitor\u2019s Report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-8\">III. Other Pending Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-9\">\n<em>A. Non-Party Jaclinn Pullman\u2019s Motion to Intervene</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">On October 14 and 21, 2009, <em>pro se </em>non-party Jaclinn Pullman filed two motions to intervene and to add sixty-five purportedly indispensable parties as Defendants to this action. <em>See </em>[DE 781]; [DE 792]. In support of her motions, Ms. Pullman claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>that, \u201clike \u2018Hofmann\u2019 and the admitted \u2018Hofmann\u2019 interveners ... [she] is an investor in the now defunct Elliott Management Inc. (\u201cEMI\u201d) resorts in the Dominican Republic which are the properties at issue\u201d in this suit. [DE 781, p. 1]. Plaintiffs and the Elliott Defendants oppose Ms. Pullman\u2019s motions, asserting that her intervention would be improper given the totality of the circumstances. <em>See </em>[DE 801]; [DE 823].</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-5\">Intervention of right is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). Pursuant to Rule 24(a), a party who does not possess \u201can unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute\u201d must be permitted to intervene in an action if they can establish that: (1) the application to intervene is timely; (2) the party has an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action; (3) the party is so situated that disposition of the action, as a practical matter, may impede or impair the party\u2019s ability to protect that interest; and (4) the party\u2019s interest is represented inadequately by the existing parties to the suit. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a); <em>Fox v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>519 F.3d 1298, 1302-03 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-6\">Permissive intervention, on the other hand, is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b). Pursuant to Rule 24(b), \u201c[a] party seeking to intervene ... must show that: (l)[the] application to intervene is timely; and (2) [the party\u2019s] claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.\u201d <em>Chiles v. Thornburgh, </em>865 F.2d 1197, 1213 (11th Cir.1989) (citation omitted). Furthermore, a \u201cdistrict court has the discretion to deny intervention even if both of those requirements are met, and its decision is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1417-9\">As is clear from the foregoing, any request to intervene must be \u201ctimely,\u201d regardless of whether intervention is sought as a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a) or permissively pursuant to Rule 24(b). In determining whether Pullman\u2019s intervention request was timely, I \u201cmust consider the length of time during which [Pullman] knew or reasonably should have known of [her] interest in the case before moving to intervene, the extent of prejudice to the existing parties as a result of [her] failure to move for intervention as soon as [she] knew or reasonably should have known of [her] interest, the extent of prejudice to [Pullman] if [her] motion is denied, and the existence of unusual circumstances militating either for or against a determination that [her] motion was timely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). I must also keep in mind that \u201c[t]imeliness is not a word of exactitude or of precisely measurable dimensions [and that] [t]he requirement of timeliness must have accommodating flexibility toward both the court and the litigants if it is to be successfully employed to regulate intervention in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-10\">Having carefully considered these factors and the totality of the circumstances, I conclude that Pullman\u2019s request to intervene was not timely filed. First, Pullman was aware of her interest in the case as early as March 16, 2009, when she sent correspondence to this Court regarding her relationship with the subject-matter of this action. <em>See </em>[DE 63].<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Despite this knowledge, she did not attempt to intervene until approximately seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>months and seven-hundred docket entries later, even after being admonished by Plaintiffs for not having \u201ctaken any affirmative steps to join this litigation as a party.\u201d [DE 84]. Second, Pullman\u2019s attempt to add an additional sixty-five Defendants would prejudice the Plaintiffs, who have actively litigated this case for the last eight months and have repeatedly expressed concerns regarding their ability to finance this suit as is; and finally, while Pullman claims that she would be prejudiced by having to litigate any of her claims independent of this action, she provides little, if any, support for this contention.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Accordingly, I conclude that Pullman has failed to adequately establish that her motion to intervene was timely filed. <em>See United States v. Borge, </em>249 F.R.D. 387, 388 (S.D.Fla.2008) (noting that \u201cthe Movant bears the burden of establishing his purported right to intervene.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">\n<em>B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Objections Regarding Laptop Imaging Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AVd\">Another issue that has been pending for some time is whether the <em>Hofmann </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>Plaintiffs should be absolved of their responsibility to bear \u201cthe burden and cost of copying the contents of the Elliotts\u2019 laptops\u201d as performed by Ikon Office Solutions, Inc. (\u201cIkon\u201d). <em>See </em>[DE 737] (order referring laptop issues to Magistrate Judge McAliley and imposing burden and cost of laptop mirroring on the <em>Hofmann </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>Plaintiffs).</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">On October 1, 2009, Magistrate Judge McAliley held two status conferences regarding the duplication (a.k.a., \u201cmirroring\u201d) of the hard drives of the Elliotts\u2019 laptop computers. <em>See </em>[DE 753]. After the first status conference, Plaintiffs engaged Humberto Morchano, a Project Manager at Ikon, to mirror the hard drives and were ordered by Magistrate Judge McAliley to cover the costs of the mirroring process in accordance with my prior order. <em>Id.; </em>[DE 754]. On October 7, 2009, the <em>Hofmann </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>Plaintiffs filed Joint Objections to Magistrate Judge McAliley\u2019s order, arguing that the \u201cPlaintiffs should not be required to pay for the expedited service ... [because] had the Elliotts not insisted on the immediate return of their laptops, Plaintiffs would have had a reasonable amount of time to shop around for the best deal regarding the mirroring.\u201d [DE 762, p. 3].</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">As I expressly stated in my October 1, 2009 Order, \u201cthe burden and cost of copying the contents of the Elliotts\u2019 laptops shall be borne by the Plaintiffs.\u201d [DE 737]. I see no reason to reconsider this ruling in light of the \u201cexpedited nature of the mirroring,\u201d <em>see </em>[DE 762], as it was readily apparent at that time I issued my order that there were \u201cextraordinary time constraints\u201d and that the imaging process would need to be done \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d [DE 737]. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 Joint Objections are overruled. The <em>Hofmann </em>and <em>Aguilar </em>Plaintiffs<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> shall each compensate Ikon for fifty percent of the laptop mirroring costs by no later than March 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">IV.

At the February 1st hearing, the Corporate Defendants' new counsel advised that they were being funded by Derek Elliotts' mother. Both Elliotts claim, and have attested under oath, that they are without assets. The volume of pleadings now filed by the Corporate Defendants, which the <em>pro se </em>Elliotts join, suggest that a significant amount of attorneys\u2019 fees are continuing to be spent in this case. It also is interesting to note that the Elliotts\u2019 former attorney, who sought to withdraw from these proceedings because of ethical circumstances, is back in representing the DMK Defendants. Upon inquiry, the attorney assured me he had no \"ethical\u201d issues.

Even if such evidence were offered, it would not trump the inherent power of this Court to act given the circumstances.

Indeed, it was brought to my attention that agents of the Corporate Defendants had intentionally destroyed potentially probative documents. <em>See </em>[DE 883-2]; [DE 832]. As a result of these egregious acts, this Court was vested with the inherent power to take the necessary actions to \"conduct an independent investigation in order to determine whether it [was] the victim of fraud,\u201d including the immediate sequestration and preservation of sensitive evidence subject to further spoliation. <em>See Chambers v.

As I made clear on numerous occasions, the Defendants were free to request that the sequestered documents (or copies thereof) be returned to them, provided that they advance the expenses of duplication so as to ensure that critical evidence would not be destroyed.
