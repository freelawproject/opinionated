The district court granted Eckman a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issues: (1) whether the district court erred in applying the deference standard set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); and (2) whether sufficient evidence was presented to support Eckman\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The record demonstrates that Eckman was convicted in the Superior Court of Lee County, Georgia, of two counts of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, hijacking a motor vehicle, and armed robbery. On direct appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court reversed Eckman\u2019s two aggravated assault convictions, concluding that these convictions should have been merged with the malice murder convictions, but it affirmed the remaining convictions and sentences. <em>Eckman v. State, </em>548 S.E.2d 810, 274 Ga. 63(2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Eckman subsequently filed her federal petition presenting a single issue: that her convictions are not supported by constitutionally sufficient evidence, in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny Eckman habeas relief. The district court, after some modification, adopted the report and recommendation and entered judgment in favor of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief <em>de novo, </em>while fact findings made by the district court are reviewed for clear error. <em>Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we first conclude that the district court correctly applied the deference standard as set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) to Eckman\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim. In essence, what Eckman argues here is that the deference standard as stated in \u00a7 2254(d) is not appropriate in sufficiency of evidence claims. If we were to accept that argument, we would be ignoring the directives of \u00a7 2254(d), and we would be requiring the reviewing court to assess the sufficiency of evidence claims in each case on a <em>de novo </em>basis. This we cannot do. Only Congress is vested with the power to regulate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>jurisdiction of federal courts in habeas corpus matters. <em>Ex \u201cparte Royall, </em>117 U.S. 241, 249, 6 S.Ct. 734, 739, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">It is clear that Congress specifically passed the AEDPA in response to the federal court\u2019s failure to limit its review of state court proceedings to a deferential standard. <em>See Gomez v. Acevedo, </em>106 F.3d 192, 198-99 (7th Cir.1997). We conclude that it is Congress\u2019s plain intent that federal courts sitting under their authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, <em>et seq. </em>must apply the deference standard as articulated in \u00a7 2254. There has been no exception from this standard carved out for <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>claims. If we were to apply a different standard to these claims, we would be engaging in judicial legislation of the AEDPA, which is not permitted. Accordingly, we hold that the district court acted properly when it applied the deference standard of \u00a7 2254(d) to Eek-man\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">We agree with the State that the district court incorrectly framed the second issue. The sufficiency of the evidence issue had already been raised by Eckman on direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court and decided adversely to her. Thus, the district court granted Eckman a \u201csecond bite at the apple\u201d by reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence claim on the merits. Instead, the district court should have framed the issue as whether it erred by holding that the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s decision was not an unreasonable application of, or contrary to, established federal law. No matter how the issue is framed, however, we conclude from the record that the evidence was constitutionally sufficient as clearly set forth in the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s findings. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court denying habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-16\">.
