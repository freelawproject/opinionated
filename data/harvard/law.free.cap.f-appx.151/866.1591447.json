Prior to hearing from the witnesses, the district court heard a proffer from Flemming\u2019s counsel concerning the witnesses\u2019 testimony. The government did not object to the contents of the proffer, but the court announced a sentence without hearing from the witnesses. Flem-ming did not object to this course of events at the time. However, she now argues on appeal that after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts have an \u201caffirmative duty,\u201d to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) in rendering sentences and that the district court had an affirmative duty to hear from these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Because we find that Flemming did not adequately object to the court\u2019s refusal to hear live testimony, rather than defense counsel\u2019s proffer relating to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>See United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 839, 124 S.Ct. 97, 157 L.Ed.2d 71 (2003) (citation omitted), we review this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">Under plain error review, an appellant must show there was (1) an error (2) that is plain (3) which affects the appellant\u2019s substantial rights and (4) affects the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776. To be \u201cplain,\u201d an error must be \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777. We have explained that, \u201cwhere the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>See United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 sets forth the procedure to be followed at sentencing hearings. In particular, Rule 32(i)(l)(C) requires that the sentencing court provide the parties an opportunity \u201cto comment on the probation officer\u2019s determinations and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(C). Rule 32(i)(2) states that the sentencing court \u201cmay permit the parties to introduce evidence on the objections.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(2)(emphasis added). Moreover, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a) states that, \u201c[w]hen any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has discussed whether a district court\u2019s decision not to hear live testimony regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in a post-<em>Booker </em>case, constitutes error. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Flemming has not cited to any authority indicating that a district court must hear, or justify its decision not to hear, live testimony pertaining to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Rather, Rule 32 indicates only that sentencing courts must provide the parties an opportunity to comment on the PSI and \u201cother matters relating to the appropriate sentence.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In the instant case, the district court permitted Flemming\u2019s counsel to comment on the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and proffer testimony regarding the nature of the offense and Flemming\u2019s history and characteristics and other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The government never contested the accuracy of this proffer. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in declining to hear live testimony regarding the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). We, thus, affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">We also reject Flemming\u2019s arguement that the district court failed to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and, therefore, the court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. She notes that at sentencing defense counsel tried to introduce evidence regarding her circumstances, and although the district court acknowledged its authority to impose a sentence below the Guideline range, it did not conduct \u201cany meaningful analysis\u201d regarding whether it should sentence Flemming below the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Under <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 765. We have clarified that we first evaluate, using <em>pre-Booker </em>precedent, whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the guidelines to determine the appropriate advisory guideline range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). As we have noted, \u201cthe district court remains obliged to \u2018consult\u2019 and \u2018take into account\u2019 the Guidelines in sentencing [the defendant],\u201d and the \u201creasonableness\u201d standard applies to the ultimate sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we have commented that we do \u201cnot expect the district court in every case to conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3353(a) factor ... and expound upon how each factor played a role in its sentencing decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">As an initial matter, Flemming does not argue on appeal, and the record does not show, that the district court erred in calculating her offense level under the Guidelines. Accordingly, there is no error in this respect. <em>See Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178. Moreover, in sentencing Flemming, the district court found the sentence imposed to be reasonable, after explicitly considering, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) Flemming\u2019s remorse and her lack of a prior criminal history, <em>(see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1)); (2) the need to deter drug traffickers from using sympathetic individuals as couriers, <em>(see </em>\u00a7 3553(2)(B)); (3) the seriousness of the offense, particularly the fact that Flem-ming was paid $4,000 for her involvement and the fact that the offense conduct involved a large amount of drugs, <em>(see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (2)(A)); and (4) the types of sentence suggested by the defense counsel, <em>(see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4)). As noted above, the district court need not \u201cexpound upon how each factor played a role in its sentencing decision.\u201d <em>See Robles, </em>408 F.3d at 1328. In light of the district court\u2019s assessment of these factors, its sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, within the Guideline range but less than half of the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, is \u201creasonable\u201d under the facts of this case. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, we affirm Flemming\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
