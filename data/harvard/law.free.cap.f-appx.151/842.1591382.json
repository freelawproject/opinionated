According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), in the course of robbing a bank, Earnest handed a bank teller a note, which read: \u201cI have gun, do not alert anyone, give me all the money from the drawer now.\u201d At sentencing, the district court enhanced Earnest\u2019s sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), which provides for a 2-level offense level enhancement \u201cif a threat of death was made\u201d during the robbery. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">On appeal, Earnest argues that the written statement that he had a gun was not an affirmative statement of intended deadly action, such that it would cause a bank teller to have a fear of death. He urges us to reconsider and overrule our decision in <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>306 F.3d 1087 (11th Cir.2002), in which we held that a written note, given to a bank teller during a bank robbery and stating that the defendant had a gun, constituted a \u201cthreat of death,\u201d even though the defendant made no express threat to use the gun, thereby supporting an enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). <em>See </em>306 F.3d at 1088-89. In a footnote in <em>Murphy, </em>we specifically rejected the position, stated in the dissenting opinion in <em>United States v. Clark, </em>294 F.3d 791, 797 (6th Cir.2002), which Earnest asserts we should adopt here, that a robber\u2019s intent is not determinative because \u201cguns are widely known to be capable of producing death.\u201d 306 F.3d at 1089 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Under our prior panel precedent rule, <em>Murphy </em>is the controlling law on the instant issue and we must follow it here. <em>See United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]t is the firmly established rule of this Circuit that each succeeding panel is bound by the holding of the first panel to address an issue of law, unless and until that holding is overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm Earnest\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
