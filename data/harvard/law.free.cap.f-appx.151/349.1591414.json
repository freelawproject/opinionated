Rowley, III, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim. Affording the district court\u2019s ruling de novo review, <em>Priester v. Lowndes County, </em>354 F.3d 414, 418 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 153, 160 L.Ed.2d 44 (2004), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">To state a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim, the complaint must (1) allege the violation of a constitutional right and (2) allege that the violation \u201c \u2018was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cornish v. Corr. Servs. Corp., </em>402 F.3d 545, 549 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Rowley alleges that his constitutional rights were violated by Tehefuncta Club Estates, Inc. (\u201cTCE\u201d), a private entity that maintains public areas and provides some utility and security services to the Tehefuncta Club Estates community. These violations allegedly occurred in three distinct ways: (1) TCE\u2019s imposition of various fees on all homeowners to pay for four full-time deputy sheriffs to be assigned by the St. Tammany Sheriffs Department to the community, and using these deputies to collect the fees; (2) TCE\u2019s ordering the deputies not to enforce a local ordinance against allowing minors to operate golf carts on public roads; and (3) TCE\u2019s ordering a deputy to accompany two TCE employees who attempted to cut off Rowley\u2019s water supply on account of his failure to pay fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We will affirm a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) \u201conly if it appears that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proven consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Ballard v. Wall, </em>413 F.3d 510, 514-15 (5th Cir.2005). When considering the complaint, we do so in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, and resolve every doubt on his behalf. <em>See Cornish, </em>402 F.3d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Rowley\u2019s complaint states facts implicating TCE as a state actor with respect to its employment of the deputy sheriffs, we are persuaded that the complaint, although offering detail, is bereft of any actionable conduct by the deputy sheriffs. Rowley can point to no right violated by the imposition of fees for basic services, the delivery of notices relating to these fees, and the failure to enforce the golf cart ordinance. Although a closer call, we can find no actionable conduct on the part of the officers in relation to the effort by TCE employees to disconnect Rowley\u2019s water supply. In his complaint, Rowley asserts that the TCE employees came onto his lawn, used metal detectors to locate his water pipe, and began digging in an effort to disconnect his water supply, relenting only after he agreed to pay the overdue fees. Importantly, there is no indication that the deputy actively participated in the effort to disconnect the water supply; rather, he was merely present at the scene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the district court dismissing Rowley\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim is</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. To the extent that TCE\u2019s employees may have violated Rowley\u2019s constitutional rights, Rowley cannot establish state action. See <em>Cornish, </em>402 F.3d at 550 (\"Deciding whether a deprivation of a protected right is fairly attributable to the State \u2018begins by identifying the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999)) (quotation omitted in <em>Cornish </em>).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
