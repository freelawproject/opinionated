Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">I. Magistrate Judge\u2019s Denials of Motions to Suppress Evidence and Dismiss Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"A7l\">On appeal, Timothy argues that the district court erred by failing to grant his motions to suppress evidence obtained as a result of his May 23, 1998, arrest and his May 10, 1998, arrest, and his motion to dismiss the indictment based upon a claim of double jeopardy. The magistrate judge recommended denying Timothy\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, as well as his motions to suppress. The parties were given ten days within which to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, but no objections were filed, and the district court never ruled on the motions. Ultimately, a jury convicted Timothy on all counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">\u201cThe law is settled that appellate courts are without jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from federal magistrates.\u201d <em>United States v. Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 500 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Renfro, </em>the defendant presented a motion to a magistrate, who, after a full hearing, issued an order denying the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 499-500. The defendant did not \u201craise[] the possibility that the magistrate erred\u201d until a post-trial motion. <em>Id. </em>at 500. We held that the defendant\u2019s appeal must be dismissed, noting that the defendant had \u201cdeprived the trial judge of his ability to effectively review the magistrate\u2019s holding,\u201d and was \u201cin essence ... appealing a magistrate\u2019s decision directly to this Court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">In <em>United States v. Brown, </em>299 F.3d 1252, 1259 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(\u201cBrown I\u201d), vacated and remanded, Brown v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 1010, 123 S.Ct. 1928, 155 L.Ed.2d 847 (2003), the district court referred a case to a magistrate for a report and recommendation on the defendant\u2019s motion. Rather than submit a report and recommendation, however, the magistrate issued an order denying the motion. <em>Brown I, </em>299 F.3d at 1259. We noted that \u201c[n]o order entered directly by the district court on [the] matter appeared] in [the] record, nor [was] there any indication from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the record that Brown ... ever raised the issue before the district court for review of the magistrate judge\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that we were \u201cwithout power to review the denial\u201d of the motion, as an appeal from a magistrate\u2019s ruling must be made to the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1260. On remand from the Supreme Court, following the vacation of its original decision, we, noting that we were \u201cbound by <em>Renfro, </em>unless and until it is overruled by this court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court,\u201d reinstated our original decision. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003) <em>(\u201cBrown II\u201d), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 37, 160 L.Ed.2d 34 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Because Timothy failed to file objections to the magistrate\u2019s recommendations or to insist that the district court rule on his motions to suppress and dismiss the indictment, Timothy essentially is appealing the magistrate\u2019s recommendations directly to this Court, which is without power to review the magistrate\u2019s recommendations. Accordingly, we dismiss Timothy\u2019s appeal with regard to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">II. Denial of Motion for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Citing <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), Timothy argued that \u201cthere was a complete absence of testimony related to the firearms and the government never attempted to present any evidence that firearms were \u2018actively employed\u2019 during the alleged trafficking offenses.\u201d However, since <em>Bailey, </em>Congress has expanded 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) to permit convictions for possession of a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 a drug-trafficking offense, in addition to \u201cactive employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the disposition of a defendant\u2019s properly preserved motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1994). We need only determine whether \u201ca reasonable fact-finder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1236 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201c[Reasonable inferences, and not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d of guilty. <em>Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Section 924(e)(1)(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-12\">Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-13\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-14\">(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-15\">(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-17\">In <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.2002), we \u201canalyzed] ..., for the first time, the sufficiency of the evidence required to support a conviction for possession of a firearm in \u2018furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.\u201d Noting that \u201cfurtherance\u201d means \u201ca helping forward,\u201d we concluded that \u201ca conviction un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>der this portion of \u00a7 924(c) requires that the prosecution establish that the firearm helped, furthered, promoted, or advanced the drug trafficking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We explained that Congress intended that the government be required to \u201cillustrate through specific facts, which tie the defendant to the firearm, that the firearm was possessed to advance or promote the criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201cthere must be \u2018a showing of some nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In the instant case, Detective Babcock testified, regarding the May 10th arrest, that he observed Timothy exit the vehicle holding a brown bag, which he later found contained drugs, and a black object, which he later determined was a firearm. Detective Babcock further testified that he subsequently observed Timothy attempting to bury the firearm and bag in the ground. Officer Koehn testified, regarding the May 23rd arrest, that he observed Timothy unlock the glove box, using a key hanging from a lanyard around his neck. Officer Hennings testified that, after being informed by Officer Koehn regarding Timothy having placed a firearm in the glove box, he asked Timothy for the lanyard and opened the glove box, at which time he found the firearm, previously seen by Officer Koehn, and several plastic baggies containing drugs. Agent Kent testified that the quantity and packaging of the cocaine base recovered during the searches was \u201cindicative of possession to sell,\u201d and not of personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Because the government established the required \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearms and the drug trafficking offenses, and a reasonable jury could have concluded that the evidence established Timothy\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court did not err by denying Timothy\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, and we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">III. <em>Booker </em>Error</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Timothy also argues that, based upon <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court plainly erred by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines, and his sentence should be \u201creversed\u201d and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Because Timothy did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence in the district court, we review his appellate claims regarding the constitutionality of his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). To satisfy the plain-error standard, we must find that (1) the district court committed error, (2) that was plain or obvious, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1328-29. If these criteria are met, we may, in our discretion, correct the plain error if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">We have explained that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: (1) Sixth Amendment error based upon sentencing enhancements neither admitted by the defendant nor submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) statutory error based upon sentencing under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-31. In the instant case, there was no constitutional error, as the indictment alleged, and the jury subsequently found, that Timothy possessed with intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base. The district court, however, committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Statutory <em>Booker </em>error is error that is plain. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298-99, 1306 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>under the third prong of plain error review, Timothy has the burden to show that the statutory <em>Booker </em>error \u201caffect[ed] substantial rights,\u201d that is, that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Timothy cannot show that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s erroneous application of the guidelines in a mandatory fashion, we affirm his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-21\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-13\">. The district court sentenced Timothy to a total term of 420 months of imprisonment: (1) 120 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Counts I and III, to be served concurrently; (2) 60 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count II, to run consecutively to his sentence for Counts I and III; and (3) 240 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count IV, to run consecutively to his sentence for Count II. The district court should have sentenced Timothy to 300 months of imprisonment as to Count IV, as required by statute. The mandatory-minimum statutory penalties compelled by the jury's verdict account for the 420-month sentence that was imposed, as: (1) a violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), as charged in Count II, carries with it a 5-year (i.e., 60 months) mandatory-minimum sentence to be imposed consecutive to any other sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); (2) a violation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), as charged in Count III, requires a 5-year (i.e., 60 months) mandatory-minimum sentence, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); and (3) a violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C), as charged in Count IV, carries with it a 25-year (i.e., 300 months) mandatory-minimum sentence to be imposed consecutive to any other sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Nevertheless, since the 420-month sentence that the district court gave Timothy equals the correct mandatory-minimum sentence, Timothy was not prejudiced by this error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
