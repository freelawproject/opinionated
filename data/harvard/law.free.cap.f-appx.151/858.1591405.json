(\u201cMohawk\u201d) on his claims of age discrimination, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and breach of contract. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b878-26\">In 1991, plaintiff Polley began working as the president and chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of World Carpets, Inc. (\u201cWorld Carpets\u201d). In November 1998, defendant Mohawk purchased World Carpets and entered into a three-year employment agreement with Polley, dated November 5,1998. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mohawk employed Polley in a newly-formed position titled \u201cPresident of Mohawk\u2019s Residential Division.\u201d Mohawk\u2019s president and CEO, Jeffery Lorberbaum (\u201cLorberbaum\u201d), created the position specifically for Polley. On November 5, 2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>Polley\u2019s employment agreement with Mohawk expired and the parties did not renew the contract. While Polley continued to work as \u201cPresident of Mohawk\u2019s Residential Division,\u201d Polley no longer had an employment agreement, but became an at-will employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">On December 1, 2001, Lorberbaum created the position of President of Mohawk\u2019s Carpet Group and appointed Montgomery Thornton (\u201cThornton\u201d) to that position. As President of the Carpet Group, Thornton had general management responsibility for sales, marketing, and product development of Mohawk\u2019s carpet and hard surface products. Thornton reported directly to Lorberbaum, and Polley reported to Thornton.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In early June 2002, Thornton decided to eliminate Polley\u2019s position and terminate Polley\u2019s employment. According to Thornton, he decided to terminate Polley\u2019s employment because he \u201cfelt [he] could effectively manage all of the sales and marketing functions of [Mohawk\u2019s] Carpet Group without [Polley\u2019s] assistance as President of the Residential Division.\u201d Thornton informed Lorberbaum of the decision, and Lorberbaum approved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">On June 6 or 7, 2002, Thornton met with Polley and informed him that his position was being eliminated and that his employment was being terminated. According to Polley, Polley asked for the cause for the termination, and Thornton replied \u201clet\u2019s just say it\u2019s to make way for the future.\u201d At the time of his termination, Polley was 68 years old. However, it is undisputed that Polley\u2019s position was eliminated and that Mohawk did not hire anyone to fill the eliminated position.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">On appeal, Polley argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his age discrimination claim. Polley also raises several breach of contract claims relating to his deferred compensation, severance pay, and the company car that he used while employed with Mohawk.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">A. Polley\u2019s Age Discrimination Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">The district court determined that although Polley satisfied his burden of establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination, Polley was unable to show that Mohawk\u2019s legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Polley\u2019s termination \u2014 elimination of the position \u2014 was a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">A plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of age discrimination using circumstantial evidence by employing the analytical framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). If the plaintiff satisfies his burden of establishing a prima facie case, \u201cthe employer then must offer a legitimate non-diseriminatory reason for the employment action.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. USBI Co., </em>186 F.3d 1352, 1354 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cIf the employer does so, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons are a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">We need not decide whether Polley satisfied his burden of establishing a prima facie case, because Mowhawk clearly had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Polley\u2019s termination, and we agree with the district court that Polley is unable to show pretext in any event. Polley argues that the decision to terminate him was actually made by Lorberbaum, not Thornton, and that Lorberbaum terminated Pol-ley because of Polley\u2019s age. However, both Lorberbaum and Thornton testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>that the decision to terminate Polley was Thornton\u2019s and that Thornton terminated Polley because his position had become unnecessary. Further, it is undisputed that Polley\u2019s position was eliminated and that Mohawk did not hire anyone to fill the eliminated position. Like the district court, we are unable to find any evidence that would permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that Mohawk\u2019s reason for terminating Polley was pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Mohawk on Polley\u2019s age discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">B. Polley\u2019s Breach of Contract Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">On appeal, Polley raises several breach of contract claims with respect to deferred compensation, severance pay, and the company ear that he used while employed with Mohawk.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">After review, we conclude that all of the plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract claims lack merit, and we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Polley\u2019s contract claims for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned and thorough March 9, 2005 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-5\">. We reject Polley's argument that pretext is evidenced by Thornton\u2019s statement that Pol-ley\u2019s termination was to \u201cmake way for the future. We do not think there is any evidence of discriminatory intent to be inferred by this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
