Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">The IJ found that Liu\u2019s asylum application both was untimely and should be denied on its merits. This court has jurisdiction to review the rejection of the asylum claim on its merits, but it does not have jurisdiction to review a determination that the asylum application was not timely. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(C); <em>Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 527-28 (5th Cir.2004). Because it is impossible to determine whether the BIA\u2019s affirmance was based on the non-reviewable determination that the application was untimely or on the reviewable determination that the application should be rejected on its merits, we VACATE the BIA\u2019s order and REMAND the case with instructions to explain its basis for affirming the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
