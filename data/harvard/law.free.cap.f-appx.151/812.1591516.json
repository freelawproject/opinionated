According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), when police responded to a robbery call they encountered Adams, who ran from police, throwing his jacket to the ground. After stopping Adams, police searched the jacket and discovered a firearm and crack cocaine. Adams agreed to plead guilty to the \u00a7 922(g) offense, in exchange for which the government would seek dismissal of the remaining counts. There was no written plea agreement, but in his notice of intent to plead guilty, Adams admitted that he possessed a firearm and that he had a prior felony conviction. He also acknowledged that the statutory range of punishment included a maximum term of ten years imprisonment. The court accepted the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">The probation officer assigned a base offense level of 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, with a four-level increase for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense \u2014 in this case, the possession with intent to distribute crack that formed the basis of count 2 of the indictment. With a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Adams adjusted offense level was 26. The probation officer then calculated Adams\u2019s criminal history category, noting the lengthy history dating back to when Adams was 13 years old. The resulting category was IV, making the applicable guidelines range 92 to 115 months imprisonment. The probation officer recommended a sentence at the high end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">Adams objected to the four-level increase for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense because the enhancement violated due process as set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He conceded that the advisory nature of the guidelines rendered any constitutional violation moot, but he claimed that, as his offense predated <em>Booker, </em>application of the remedy violated his due process rights. He further argued that he was entitled to an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Finally, Adams objected to the PSI\u2019s reference to the robbery because it implied that he was involved with the robbery. The court overruled the <em>Booker </em>objection, explaining that <em>Booker </em>did not alter the statutory maximum sentence the court could impose. The court also overruled the acceptance-of-responsibility objection because the court could grant an additional one-level reduction only upon the government\u2019s motion. The court then dismissed counts 2 and 3, and sentenced Adams to 115 months imprisonment. In determining this sentence, the court stated that the sentence was appropriate given the nature of Adams\u2019s criminal his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>tory, the need for punishment, and the likelihood of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">On appeal, Adams argues that, because he committed his offense before the Supreme Court decided Booker; application of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding to his sentencing violates due process. He then asserts that the court\u2019s factual determination that he possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense violated <em>Booker\u2019 </em>s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">After <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, -, manuscript op. at 7 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). Notably, the same extra-verdict enhancements remain, and the district court considers the same factual evidence in applying the enhancements as it would under a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745 (11th Cir.2005). Additionally, after <em>Booker, </em>this court applies the same standard of review for applications of guidelines enhancements. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Adams raises two issues on appeal, neither of which has any merit. First, this court has rejected Adams\u2019s argument that the application of <em>Booker </em>violates due process. Adams had fair warning of the potential statutory maximum sentence he faced by the commission of his offense. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1307 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">Second, the district court added the enhancement for the possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense for which Adams initially was in-dieted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After <em>Booker, </em>the court is still required to correctly calculate the guideline range, and there is no constitutional violation in the use of enhancements under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 764-66; <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178-79; <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1307. Additionally, because Adams failed to object to the PSI\u2019s factual findings, he is deemed to have admitted the facts leading to the enhancement and there is no <em>Booker </em>error. <em>See United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 551, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -(2005); <em>see also Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330. Accordingly, the court properly calculated the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">Moreover, the sentence imposed was not only within the statutory range but was reasonable. The district court explained that it found the guidelines range to be adequate and that a sentence at the high end was necessary given the nature of Adams\u2019s criminal history, the need for punishment, and the likelihood of recidivism. As this determination encompasses the criteria of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) for imposing sentence, Adams\u2019s sentence of 115 months is reasonable. <em>See Winingear, </em>manuscript op. at 10; <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-12\">. The district court properly considered the additional felony offense as relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3(a). <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1214 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
