Sookma sought damages and to enjoin defendants from enforcing the state court divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, the district court dismissed this action as a collateral attack on the state court decree. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). The district court also determined Sook-ma\u2019s service of process was defective and, for various reasons, dismissal was appropriate on the merits of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>E.g., Musslewhite v. State Bar of Tex., </em>32 F.3d 942, 945 (5th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>515 U.S. 1103, 115 S.Ct. 2248, 132 L.Ed.2d 256 (1995). We also review <em>de novo </em>a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss being granted for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>536 U.S. 960, 122 S.Ct. 2665, 153 L.Ed.2d 839 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-18\">Sookma asserts conclusionally that the district court applied <em>Rooker-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Feldman </em>erroneously. Based on our review of the record and briefs, the district court did not err in applying this doctrine, in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp. </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005) (applying the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and confining it to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments\u201d); <em>see Liedtke v. State Bar of Texas, </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 906, 115 S.Ct. 271, 130 L.Ed.2d 189 (1994). In any event, Sookma has failed to address the alternate bases for dismissal, including defective service of process, issues of absolute and qualified immunity, and failure to state a claim. By failing to brief these issues, Sookma has abandoned them; it is the same as if she had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is <em>DISMISSED. See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
