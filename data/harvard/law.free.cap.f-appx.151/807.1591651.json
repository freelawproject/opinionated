Moon and her brother agreed to obtain marijuana in Texas and transport it into Florida. They enlisted Moon\u2019s son, Kanz, who had a pilot\u2019s license, to rent and fly the planes used to pick up the drugs. The conspirators stored the drugs at Moon\u2019s apartment and sold the drugs in Florida, South Carolina, and Ohio. Moon and Kanz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>distribute marijuana and cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. Moon was sentenced to three years probation. Kanz was sentenced to twenty-four months imprisonment, but the sentence was reduced to twelve months upon the government\u2019s motion for a reduction based on substantial assistance. After completion of their sentences, Moon and Kanz filed the instant petitions for coram nobis relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Assuming that the writ was available, the magistrate judge recommended that coram nobis relief be denied because case-law established the validity of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power to prohibit controlled substances. The district court adopted the recommendation, over Moon\u2019s and Kanz\u2019s objections, and denied relief. Moon and Kanz requested reconsideration, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">On appeal, Moon and Kanz argue that the district court erred by denying relief because the court\u2019s analysis of the arguments conflicts with Supreme Court precedent and the reasoning of other circuits, and they reiterate that the federal government lacked authority to prohibit their conduct or to invade state sovereignty to prosecute them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of coram nobis relief for abuse of discretion, keeping in mind that \u201can error of law is an abuse of discretion per se.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000)). \u201cIn order to determine whether [Moon and Kanz are] entitled to relief, therefore, [this court] must determine whether the error ... was of such a \u2018fundamental character\u2019 as to have \u2018rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion. This court has rejected the appellants\u2019s argument that federal drug laws are an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>459 F.2d 949, 953 (5th Cir.1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v. Jackson, </em>111 F.3d 101, 102 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>47 F.3d 1101, 1103 (11th Cir.1995). Because there was no error of law, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying coram no-bis relief. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-23\">. The cases were consolidated on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-8\">.They also appear to argue that the government lacks standing because it did not respond to the pleadings before the district court. That argument is without merit, as the United States is the respondent in this action. They further argue that the court erred by denying the requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law. That argument also lacks merit because the alleged findings of fact were the disputed issues, and, therefore, the court did not err by denying the requests. Finally, Moon and Kanz are not entitled to relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), as they cannot use the rules of civil procedure to challenge their criminal convictions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\">. \"A writ of error coram nobis is a remedy available to vacate a conviction when the petitioner has served his sentence and is no longer in custody, as is required for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Peter, </em>310 F.3d at 712. Because Moon and Kanz have completed their sentences and are no longer in custody, the writ would be an available remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-13\">.
