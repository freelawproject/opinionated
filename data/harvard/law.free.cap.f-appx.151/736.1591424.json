He appeals <em>pro se </em>the denial of his federal habeas petition, which was filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">Because Harris filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the provisions of that Act apply. That Act \u201cprevents a federal court from granting habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision either was \u2018contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 or \u2018was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rutherford v. Crosby, </em>385 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">The State of Florida filed six counts against Harris. Each charged sexual battery, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(8)(b), and the lesser included offense of battery, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03. Harris first argues that he was denied due process because the state trial court refused to instruct the jury on an additional statute that Harris contends is also a lesser included offense of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(8)(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have held, however, that in non-capital cases, like this one, the \u201cDue Process Clause does not require a state court to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses.\u201d Perry <em>v. Smith, </em>810 F.2d 1078, 1080 (11th Cir.1987). Thus, the argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">Harris\u2019 initial brief can be fairly construed as also asking this Court to review whether the state trial court\u2019s failure to provide the additional lesser includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>ed offense instruction was an error under state law. We will not reach the merits of that argument. \u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. In conducting habeas review, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 480, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). As we have said, there is no federal due process violation, and that is all we need decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Harris\u2019 second argument is that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for requesting that the jury be instructed that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4)(a) is a lesser included offense of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(8)(b). It is undisputed that trial counsel erred in requesting that instruction because counsel was referring to the revised version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4)(a) that went into effect in October 1999, and thus did not apply to Harris\u2019 crimes, which had occurred in March and April of 1999. Harris says that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s error because counsel should have requested a lesser included offense instruction about a statute that applied to the proceedings (his brief doesn\u2019t say which statute) and that, had counsel done so, the jury would have likely convicted Harris of that other lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), provides the \u201cclearly established ... federal law governing ineffective assistance claims.\u201d <em>Rutherford, </em>385 F.3d at 1308. Under <em>Strickland, </em>Harris \u201cmust demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s performance was outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance ... [and] he must establish a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Rutherford, </em>385 F.3d at 1308 (internal marks and citations omitted). \u201c[Fjailure to establish either is fatal and makes it unnecessary to consider the other.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">On its face, Harris\u2019 argument is that his trial counsel erred simply by requesting that the jury be instructed on the October 1999 version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4)(a). Harris cannot demonstrate that he suffered prejudice from that error. No prejudice attached merely because counsel asked for that to which Harris was not entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Liberally construing Harris\u2019 brief, it may be read to argue that his trial counsel erred by not requesting that the jury be instructed on a different statute. Under this construction as well Harris cannot demonstrate \u201cthat, but for his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Rutherford, </em>385 F.3d at 1308. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal marks and citations omitted). Harris\u2019 assertions that he would have been convicted of the lesser included offense, as opposed to the greater offense, are pure speculation \u2014 speculation both that the state trial court would have decided to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense and that the jury, if instructed on the lesser included offense, would have convicted on it instead of the higher offense. That speculation is insufficient to undermine our confidence in the outcome of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-14\">. Harris\u2019 brief cites Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011(5) as the lesser included offense on which he wanted the jury instructed. We, like the State, assume that Harris meant to cite Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4), which is the statute that Harris had relied on in his \u00a7 2254 petition and argued to the district court. Harris cannot switch statutes on appeal. Of course, as the discussion in the text reflects, which statute is at issue is irrelevant to our resolution of the merits of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
