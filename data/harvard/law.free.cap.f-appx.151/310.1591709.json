Diaz argues that his sentence is unconstitutional, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because he was sentenced under a mandatory guideline scheme. He further argues that the enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">Pursuant to his plea agreement, Diaz waived the right to appeal his sentence or the manner in which it was imposed, except for a sentence above the statutory maximum or an upward departure from the applicable guideline range. The transcript of the plea hearing reflects that the magistrate judge erroneously advised Diaz that he could \u201cstill appeal for an illegal sentence.\u201d This statement inaccurately described the waiver-of-appeal provision contained in Diaz\u2019s plea agreement. Thus, it cannot be said that Diaz knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, Diaz\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar the instant appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">Diaz\u2019s assertion that the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory is \u201cstructural and insusceptible of harmless error analysis\u201d or, alternatively, that the error is presumptively prejudicial has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560-61 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 11, 2005) (No. 05-5297). We review Diaz\u2019s Booker-based argument for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005), <em>peti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>tion for cert. filed, </em>(July 25, 2005) (No. 05-5556). The district court committed error that is plain when it sentenced Diaz under a mandatory guideline scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 733; <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600. Diaz, however, fails to meet his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d at 733-34; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517); <em>see also United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317-18 n. 4 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(July 26, 2005) (No. 05-5535).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">As he concedes, Diaz\u2019s argument that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, Diaz\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
