Nguyen had been convicted of various RICO and Hobbs Act violations and sentenced to life imprisonment with a concurrent twenty-year sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In February 1997, three years after his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nguyen filed a motion in the district court for the Eastern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the court dismissed as untimely. After the district court denied relief, but before the Second Circuit issued its opinion on appeal, the Second Circuit determined that prisoners whose convictions became final before April 24, 1996 had until April 24, 1997 to file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Ross v. Artuz, </em>150 F.3d 97 (2d Cir.1998). Nevertheless, the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Nguyen\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Three years later, in 2001, Nguyen requested permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, which the Second Circuit denied. Also in 2001, Nguyen filed a petition in the district court for the Central District of California for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Nguyen then filed the instant petition, asserting that he was denied due process because counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally defective at sentencing, he was actually innocent because he faced an enhanced penalty based on facts not proven to the jury, and that his sentence was illegal because he was not eligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">The magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed because Nguyen had not shown that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective as required by <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999). The magistrate judge further found that the AEDPA requirements did not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, Nguyen could not show he was actually innocent, and he was not entitled to parole given his federal conviction. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, over Nguyen\u2019s objections, and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">On appeal, Nguyen argues that (1) the district court erred by dismissing his petition because <em>Wofford </em>did not apply to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>circumstances and he was denied the opportunity to fully and fairly present his claims in his original \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, which rendered \u00a7 2255 inadequate and ineffective; (2) he must be permitted to bring a collateral challenge to his sentence based on fundamental fairness and to avoid a miscarriage of justice because his original \u00a7 2255 motion was, in fact, timely, and that the refusal to permit him to bring his claims constituted a suspension of the writ; and (3) he is actually innocent of the enhanced portion of his sentence and he should be eligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Nguyen challenges the legality of his conviction, which properly should be brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 629 (11th Cir.1990). The \u201csavings clause\u201d in \u00a7 2255, however, permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This court in <em>Wofford </em>established a three-prong test to determine the applicability of the savings clause to permit a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking his conviction or sentence. The petitioner must show (1) that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable U.S. Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244; <em>see also Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Here, Nguyen cannot show that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective, as he failed to identify any retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, that he was convicted of a non-existent offense, or that he could not have brought his claim earlier. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. In fact, Nguyen had the opportunity to raise his claims in a timely \u00a7 2255 motion before the district court in New York, but he faded to do so when he did not seek reconsideration of the order denying his original \u00a7 2255 motion and when did not file another \u00a7 2255 within the time period. <em>See Crews v. Wetzel, </em>2005 WL 1652203 (11th Cir. July 14, 2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">Moreover, although Nguyen argues that he was actually innocent of the offenses, his claims relate solely to the enhanced sentence and his allegations center on the government\u2019s failure to prove the enhancement to the jury. This claim falls under legal insufficiency rather than factual innocence, and therefore, does not establish that he was actually innocent. <em>Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1171 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that the actual innocence exception is \u201cexceedingly narrow in scope\u201d and requires proof of factual innocence, not just legal insufficiency), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 926, 122 S.Ct. 1295, 152 L.Ed.2d 208 (2002); <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">Furthermore, this court has rejected the argument that <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>requirements constitute a suspension of the writ. <em>See Wyzykowski v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>226 F.3d 1213, 1217 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Finally, Nguyen filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied, albeit erroneously. When a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from the circuit court prior to filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255, 2244(b)(3); <em>In re Blackshire, </em>98 F.3d 1293, 1293 (11th Cir.1996). A petitioner who has filed and been denied a previous \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive-petition rule simply by filing another petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Nguyen\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-11\">. Nguyen contends that the statutory maximum sentence was twenty years imprisonment, and that his enhanced sentence of life imprisonment was based on facts not found by the jury. He also contends that the enhancement illegally removed his eligibility for parole. To the extent that Nguyen raises a claim under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), such claims are not cognizable in collateral proceedings. <em>See Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864 (11th Cir.2005); <em>In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336.(11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-16\">. <em>United States v. Thai, </em>29 F.3d 785 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\">. Nguyen filed his petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), and, therefore, the provisions of that act govern this appeal. Nguyen is not required to obtain a COA to appeal the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1364 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
