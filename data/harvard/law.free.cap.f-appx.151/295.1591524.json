Wilson argues first that the district court erred in admitting a Government exhibit and expert testimony from Jason Bowen, a witness not qualified as an expert. Bowen, a civil environmental engineer, used the Hazardous Categorization System, commonly referred to as the Haz-Cat, to categorize the substances that Wilson was convicted of discharging. Bowen testified that the discharged substance was a pollutant. While not a chemist, Bowen\u2019s testimony demonstrated that he was well-versed in the operation and methodology of the Haz-Cat. In light of the uncontested testimony at trial regarding the contents of the drums from which the pollutant was discharged, Wilson has not shown that Bowen\u2019s testimony was unreliable or irrelevant. <em>See Vogler v. Blackmore, </em>352 F.3d 150, 154 (5th Cir.2003). Any error in admitting Bowen\u2019s testimony was harmless, given that others testified that the barrels (1) contained garbage, (2) were open when loaded onto the truck headed for the dump site, and (3) were dumped into Greasy Creek. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">The offense of conviction required proof that Wilson \u201cknowingly\u201d discharged a pollutant (or caused one to be discharged) without a permit. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1811, 1319(c)(2)(A); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). Wilson argues that the \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d jury instruction was error because there was insufficient evidence to indicate that he was aware of a high probability of illegal conduct. He also contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the guilty knowledge element of his conviction. Trial testimony established that Wilson hired his cousin, Tony Moreland, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>dispose of the drums containing the pollutant. Moreland testified that Wilson asked him what he was going to do with the barrels, but before he could answer, Wilson said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d Environmental Protection Agency Special Agent Green testified that Wilson admitted that he did not know where Moreland was taking the drums but \u201cindicated that he had knowledge they were going to be disposed of illegally or dumped somewhere.\u201d Given Wilson\u2019s defense of lack of guilty knowledge, the facts adduced at trial fall squarely within \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d territory. When viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence clearly raised the inference that Wilson was aware of a high probability of the criminal activity to be carried out by his coconspirator and that he purposely contrived to avoid learning of the illegal conduct. The district court did not abuse its discretion in giving the deliberate ignorance instruction to the jury. <em>See United States v. </em>Newell, 315 F.3d 510, 528 (5th Cir.2002). Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Wilson was criminally responsible for Moreland\u2019s actions, having willfully associated himself with the criminal venture. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a); <em>United States v. Vasquez </em>953 F.2d 176, 183 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Wilson\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred in using relevant conduct to calculate his sentence under the guidelines. He challenges, <em>inter alia, </em>the guideline used to calculate his base offense level because it applied to offenses involving \u201chazardous\u201d substances rather than mere \u201cpollutants.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Q1.2, 2Q1.3; <em>United States v. Goldfaden, </em>959 F.2d 1324, 1329 (5th Cir.1992). The Government concedes that Wilson\u2019s argument has merit because the district court based its selection of the applicable guideline section on facts outside of the allegations contained in the superseding indictment. Under the applicable harmless error analysis, the Government cannot show \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence that the defendant received.\u201d <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 &amp; n. 4, 286-87 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Wilson\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for resentenc-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
