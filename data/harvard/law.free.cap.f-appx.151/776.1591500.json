Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>De La Ossa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1426, 161 L.Ed.2d 184 (2005). We previously affirmed De La Ossa\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. De La Ossa, </em>124 Fed.Appx. 642 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">In his initial brief on appeal, De La Ossa had argued that the district court erred by denying him a minor-role reduction. He did not raise a Sixth Amendment objection or any other constitutional or legal objection based on the issues addressed by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Ap-prendi </em>principle, in his initial brief or in any other manner before this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">In <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam), we addressed a similar situation: a remand from the Supreme Court with instructions to consider our opinion in light of <em>Booker </em>in an appeal in which the appellant did not raise either a constitutional or <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1262. We applied \u201cour well-established rule that issues ... not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned,\u201d reinstated our previous opinion, and affirmed Dockery\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (citation omitted). Such is the procedure that we will follow in this case because De La Ossa failed to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to his sentence in his initial brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">We reinstate our previous opinion and, upon reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s remand, affirm De La Ossa\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<author id=\"b797-18\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">Binding precedent beginning with <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>273 F.3d 991 (11th Cir.2001), and including <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>which the court relies on, bars us from considering appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim because he did not raise it in his initial brief. I therefore concur in the court\u2019s judgment. As I have stated before, though, most recently in <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>2005 WL 1744939, 2005 U.S.App. LEXIS 15663, at *17 (11th Cir. July 8, 2005) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting from the denial or rehearing en banc), <em>Ardley </em>and its progeny were wrongly decided. Thus, were we writing on a clean slate, I would entertain appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-15\">. By extension, an issue raised under <em>Apprendi </em>raises an issue pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>Booker. See United States v. Grant, </em>397 F.3d 1330, 1331 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-21\">. We have held that the application this prudential rule, in which we treat issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief as abandoned, to foreclose an untimely <em>Booker </em>claim \u201cdoes not result in manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d. 1273 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
