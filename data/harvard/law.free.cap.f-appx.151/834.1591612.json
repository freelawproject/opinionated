On appeal, Jones contends that the district court erred in departing upward from criminal history category V to category VI pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3 because (1) the court failed to compare Jones\u2019 criminal history with the criminal history of other defendants in category VI, and (2) the court did not properly take into account the nature and circumstances of the offense or consider Jones\u2019 history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 allows a district court to depart upward during sentencing \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal histoiy or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d When departing upward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, the district court must first look to the next highest criminal history category. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>989 F.2d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.1993). If the court finds that the higher category adequately reflects the defendant\u2019s past conduct, the court must state its finding and sentence the defendant within that higher criminal histoiy range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts to decide whether the departure is based on a factor that (a) advances the objectives of federal sentencing policy, (b) is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b), and (c) is justified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pressley, </em>345 F.3d 1205, 1209 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">We have held that \u201c[t]he amount by which a district court departs from the Guidelines need only be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimball, </em>291 F.3d 726, 734 (11th Cir.2002). Even if the defendant\u2019s prior offenses do not meet the definition of \u201ccareer offender,\u201d the defendant\u2019s criminal record can justify an upward departure if his prior crimes were substantial in number and serious in character. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>888 F.2d 76, 78-79 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s upward departure was reasonable. The court properly took the guidelines into account in determining the degree of departure. The district court explained that Jones had repeatedly committed criminal offenses since he was fourteen years old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>and found that criminal history category VI more adequately reflected Jones\u2019 criminal history than category V. Specifically, the court found that category V inadequately represented the likelihood that Jones would commit other offenses when he was released from custody. Furthermore, the district court properly considered the sentencing factors found in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), stating that she based the sentence on the seriousness of the offense, deterrence, and incapacitation. The district court did not err by imposing the upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. The amount of the upward departure was appropriate under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">For the same reasons that the district court\u2019s upward departure pursuant to the guidelines and the amount of that departure were appropriate, the resulting sentence was not unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
