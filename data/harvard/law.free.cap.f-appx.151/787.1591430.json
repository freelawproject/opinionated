After review, we affirm Brown\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A9n\">A. The Carjacking</p>\n<p id=\"b808-22\">At trial, the victim of the carjacking, Horace Duncan, Jr., testified that he was walking to his car around midnight when two men asked him for a ride. Duncan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>recognized one of the two men and agreed to give them a ride. The person who Duncan recognized sat in the passenger\u2019s seat and the other person, whom Duncan had never met, sat in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">As Duncan was driving, he felt a gun in the back of his head. The front seat passenger then placed a gun at Duncan\u2019s temple and told Duncan that \u201cthis is a jack move.\u201d The back seat passenger then hit Duncan on the head and told him to get of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">When Duncan got out of the car, the back seat passenger hit him two to three more times until Duncan fell to the ground. The front seat passenger then hit Duncan a couple of times and told Duncan, \u201cyou gonna die here tonight. I\u2019m gonna leave you to die here tonight.\u201d The front seat passenger, later identified as Brown, then shot Duncan and drove away with Duncan\u2019s car and his wallet, which contained Duncan\u2019s driver\u2019s license, his birth certificate, his social security card, and some cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The police later found Duncan, who told the police that he had been robbed and shot. Duncan identified his car as a 1991 Mercury Grand Marquis. Duncan testified that he picked out Brown from a police photo lineup as the front seat passenger in his car that night, and as the one who took his wallet and shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">B. Cross-examination of Duncan</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">During cross-examination at trial, defense counsel asked Duncan about statements he made to police on February 17 and 28 when the police interviewed him about the February 8 carjacking. In an effort to impeach Duncan\u2019s credibility with a prior inconsistent statement, defense counsel attempted to show Duncan a copy of the transcript from Brown\u2019s probation revocation hearing. The district court immediately called counsel to a sidebar conference and told counsel to ask the witness first whether he made a particular statement before attempting to impeach him with a prior inconsistent statement, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">Now, I\u2019m going to say this once during this trial and only once: if we are going to do any examination about prior statements, the rule is that you first ask the witness whether he made the statement. You don\u2019t say, do you recall this, do you recall that. You say, did you say, what. And you ask him whether he made that statement or not, okay. If he admits it, that\u2019s the end of it. If he denies it, then you say, do you recall on such and such a date making a statement to an officer, making a statement in a trial transcript, or whatever where you said so and so. You don\u2019t approach him. You don\u2019t \u2014 in federal court show him the statement unless he asks to see the statement. Now that is the federal rule and that\u2019s the way were going to try this case. Is there any misunderstanding about that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Defense counsel responded that he understood the district court. Defense counsel then stated that he had no further questions for Duncan, and ended the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">C. Police Officers\u2019 Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Officer Ashley Brown testified that he was working in an off-duty capacity as a security officer for a hotel when he heard a call over his radio about Duncan\u2019s car. Officer Brown saw the described car in the vicinity and subsequently stopped it forcibly. Defendant Brown, the driver, jumped out of the car with a gun and started running. Defendant Brown then dropped the gun, which had three live rounds in it. Officer Taharka, who was assisting Officer Brown, apprehended defendant Brown while Officer Brown retrieved the dropped gun. Officer Taharka testified that defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>dant Brown was in possession of Duncan\u2019s driver\u2019s license, social security card, and credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Officer Mydell testified that after defendant Brown was arrested, Officer Mydell obtained from Brown a pair of bloodstained blue jeans and tennis shoes. DNA tests later indicated that the blood matched Duncan\u2019s with a statistical probability of one in four quintillion. Officer Mydell met with Duncan on March 9, showed Duncan a photo lineup, and Duncan identified Brown as his attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to question Officer Mydell about statements Duncan made to Officer Mydell on February 17 when Officer Mydell interviewed Duncan at the hospital. The district court warned defense counsel about eliciting inadmissible hearsay; however, defense counsel stated that he was merely questioning Officer Mydell about the inconsistent statements Duncan made to impeach Duncan, not as substantive evidence. The district court did not allow the cross-examination. The inconsistent statements that defense counsel wanted to inquire about were statements that Duncan made to Officer Mydell at the hospital on February 17, including: (1) that Duncan was driving, not walking, when he stopped upon seeing two black males that he knew; and (2) that Duncan tried to approach the individuals and fight them for his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Later, Officer Bill Cunningham testified regarding similar statements that Duncan made at the hospital. Specifically, Officer Cunningham testified that Duncan told him that Duncan was driving at the time he saw Brown and the other individual. Further, Duncan told Officer Cunningham that it was the other individual he knew, and not Brown. However, Officer Cunningham stated that Duncan was heavily sedated during the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">D. Jury Deliberations</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">During the jury deliberations, the district court received a note from the jury asking whether in order to convict Brown for Count 3, [the possession and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)], \u201cdoes the gun submitted into evidence have to be the gun used in the crime?\u201d The district court responded simply \u201cNo\u201d to the jury\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">The government took the position that the answer was no because on a \u00a7 924(c) count, the government can allege a firearm was used and discharged in a crime but there is no proof required as to the particularity of the firearm and the government need not even have the gun to get a \u00a7 924(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">Defense counsel responded: \u201cYour Hon- or, I thought that for Count Three [the \u00a7 924(c) charge] it had to be the gun that was from Count Two [the \u00a7 922(g)(1) felon-in-possession charge], and that gun would have to be proven to have been in interstate commerce.\u201d The gun submitted into evidence was a .38 caliber special, serial number 08938, which was shown to have traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">The jury found Brown guilty as to all three counts in the indictment, and the district court sentenced Brown to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqp\">A. Cross-examination of Duncan</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">Brown argues that the district court abused its discretion by cutting short his cross-examination of Duncan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion because Brown himself discontinued the cross-examination after the district court instructed him on how to properly cross-examine the victim using prior inconsistent statements. As stated above, after the district court instructed Brown on the proper cross-examination of Duncan, defense counsel stated that he had no further questions for Duncan and ended the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">B. Cross-examination of Officer My-dell</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Brown also contends that the district court abused its discretion by not permitting him to cross-examine Officer Mydell regarding allegedly inconsistent statements that the victim, Horace Duncan, Jr., made to Officer Mydell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown argues that he was not attempting to introduce Duncan\u2019s inconsistent statements to Officer Mydell for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to attack Duncan\u2019s credibility. Brown contends further that his not being permitted to cross-examine Officer Mydell about Duncan\u2019s statements violated his Confrontation Clause rights under the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">\u201c[UJnder Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(A) prior inconsistent statements are not hearsay and are admissible as substantive evidence if given under oath or subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition.\u201d <em>Wilson v. City of Aliceville, </em>779 F.2d 631, 636 (11th Cir.1986); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior inconsistent statements \u201cnot falling within [the] boundaries [of Rule 801] can be used for impeachment under Rule 607, although they are not admissible as substantive evidence.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>779 F.2d at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Officer Mydell\u2019s testimony showing Duncan\u2019s prior inconsistent statements was not offered to prove the truth of the out-of-court assertions but rather to attack the credibility of Duncan\u2019s testimony during trial. However, even assuming such testimony were admissible as impeachment and thus an error occurred, such error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence supporting the verdict, including: (1) the testimony of Officer Brown and Officer Taharka spotting Brown driving Duncan\u2019s car; (2) Officer Taharka finding Duncan\u2019s driver\u2019s license, ATM card and social security card in Brown\u2019s pants pocket; (3) the DNA tests showing that Brown\u2019s pants contained splatters of Duncan\u2019s blood; and (4) Duncan identifying Brown in a photo line-up.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, at least one of the contradictory statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Duncan made was established through the cross-examination of Officer Cunningham.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Consequently, Brown is not entitled to a new trial based on the district court\u2019s limitation of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Mydell.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">C. Jury Question</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Lastly, Brown argues that the district court erred when it responded \u201cNo\u201d to the jury\u2019s question. Before discussing the question and response, we note that Brown makes an additional argument on appeal that he did not make in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In the district court, defense counsel argued that the government had to prove that defendant Brown used and discharged a <em>particular </em>firearm that traveled in interstate commerce in order to convict Brown under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). On appeal, Brown additionally argues that a fatal variance occurred between the indictment and the government\u2019s proof when the district court answered \u201cNo\u201d when the jury asked whether the gun in evidence had to be the gun used in the carjacking crime for purposes of the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) count.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The only gun that the government introduced into evidence was the .38 caliber revolver, serial number 08938. The \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) count of the indictment charged that Brown \u201cdid knowingly and intentionally possess and discharge a firearm, to wit: a Sport Arms .38 caliber special, serial no. 08938.... \u201d Thus, this appeal presents two separate questions: (1) does a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction for use and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence require that the government introduce the gun into evidence and prove the particulars of the gun; and (2) if not, was there a fatal variance between the indictment and the proof in this particular trial requiring reversal of Brown\u2019s convictions because the indictment did include specifics about the gun. The answer to both questions is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">First, we have held that a firearm need not be entered into evidence to convict a defendant on a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) charge. <em>See United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1049 (11th Cir.2002) (concluding a sufficient basis existed for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction because \u201calthough the firearm used by Woodruff was not in evidence, the jury heard testimony about the weapon from three of the victims and viewed photographic evidence depicting the gun\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>334 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that the \u00a7 924(c) charge in the indictment would have been correct \u201cif no mention had been made of the handgun, and the generic term \u2018firearm\u2019 had been used throughout\u201d). Thus, the district court did not err when it told the jury that the gun involved need not be entered in evidence in order to convict Brown for possession and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">Second, although the \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) count referred to the firearm as a \u201c.38 caliber special, serial no. 08938,\u201d there was also no fatal variance in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA variance occurs when the facts proved at trial deviate from the facts contained in the indictment but the essential elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>of the offense are the same.\u201d <em>United States v. Keller, </em>916 F.2d 628, 634 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cThe standard for determining whether a variance is material, and therefore fatal, is twofold: (1) did a variance occur; if so, (2) did the defendant suffer substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>308 F.3d 1147, 1156 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">This Court has concluded that an indictment issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is correct if the generic term \u201cfirearm\u201d is used, and that detail about a firearm listed in the indictment is mere surplusage. <em>See Williams, </em>334 F.3d at 1231-32 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that the fact that the gun in the \u00a7 924(c) count was an \u201cAK-47 rifle\u201d and not a \u201chandgun\u201d as charged in the indictment was not reversible error because \u201cthe word \u2018handgun\u2019 in the indictment was mere surplusage\u201d); <em>see also United States v. McIntosh, </em>23 F.3d 1454, 1457 (8th Cir.1994) (\u201cAllegations in the indictment that are not necessary to establish a violation of a statute are sur-plusage and may be disregarded if the remaining allegations are sufficient to charge a crime.\u201d). In this case, the specifics regarding the type of firearm were mere surplusage because the specific type of firearm is not an element of a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In light of Duncan\u2019s testimony that his assailant had a gun and shot him \u2014 reinforced by the recovery of a bullet in his abdominal cavity \u2014 there is sufficient evidence that Brown possessed and discharged a gun in furtherance of the carjacking. Because all that needs to be shown for a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction is that Brown possessed and discharged a gun, <em>see McIntosh, </em>23 F.3d at 1458, \u201c[njothing in the record suggests that [Brown] was in any way disadvantaged by the inclusion of the surplus language in the indictment.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>334 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">For the above stated reasons, we affirm Brown\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">. As stated earlier, we review the district court's restrictions on cross-examination for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v.

An error is harmless unless 'there is a reasonable likelihood that [it] affected the defendant's substantial rights.' \u201d <em>United States v. Hands, </em>184 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted). In deciding if an error substantially affected the outcome, we weigh the record as a whole (i.e., the facts, context of error, and resulting prejudice) against the evidence of the defendant's guilt. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b811-13\">. \u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed.
