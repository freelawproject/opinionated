Hines appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He argues that the district court erred in departing upward in sentencing him based on his police arrest record and incident report records. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 491-92 (5th Cir.2005). The district court based its decision to depart upward on Hines\u2019s similar criminal convictions involving the use of a firearm, a juvenile negligent homicide, an old cocaine possession, accessory to murder for which the punishment was too lenient, and Hines\u2019s other criminal conduct demonstrating a consistent pattern of criminal behavior. The district court also determined that Hines\u2019s criminal history category substantially underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history and that his criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>history establishes a likelihood that he will commit other crimes in the future. The district court considered the policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The sentence imposed was reasonable for the reasons given by the district court at the sentencing hearing. <em>See Smith, </em>417 F.3d at 489. There is nothing in the record to show that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
