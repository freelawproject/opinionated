We find there is substantial evidence of record supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination that Mr. Castillo is not disabled within the meaning of the Act. No treating, examining, or evaluating physician has indicated that Mr. Castillo was unable or is expected to be unable to work for twelve consecutive months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">2. We further find that the ALJ\u2019s decision comports with the legal standards for disability determination set forth by this Court under the Act and relevant regulations, including our opinion in <em>Watson v. Barnhart, </em>288 F.3d 212 (5th Cir.2002).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">3. We find the ALJ properly considered the disabling effect of each of Mr. Castillo\u2019s raised impairments as well as the combined effect of such impairments in reaching a disability determination. <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1305 (5th Cir.1987). That the ALJ did not specifically cite each and every piece of medical evidence considered does not establish an actual failure to consider the evidence. <em>See Falco v. Shalala, </em>27 F.3d 160, 163 (5th Cir.1994) (rejecting as unnecessary rule requiring ALJ to specifically articulate evidence that supported decision and discuss evidence that was rejected).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">The ALJ\u2019s decision indicates that he properly considered, referenced, and balanced the psychological evaluations of Mr. Castillo, including the opinions of Drs. Aitcheson and Dubin. The ALJ did not err by giving little weight to the opinion of chiropractor Dr. Steve Minors, regarding Mr. Castillo\u2019s mental and emotional condition. Chiropractors are not mental health specialists and the relevant regulations accord less weight to chiropractors than to medical doctors. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d)(1), 404.1527(d)(5); <em>Griego v. Sullivan, </em>940 F.2d 942, 945 (5th Cir.1991) Further, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Mr. Castillo\u2019s moderate depression and anxiety have in the past, or should be expected in the future, to interfere with his ability to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">4. The ALJ\u2019s decision reflects that he properly considered the credibility of Mr. Castillo\u2019s testimony. The ALJ discounted Mr. Castillo\u2019s complaints based on evidence that he takes only over-the-counter pain medications, does not attend ongoing routine medical visits, has not required recent physical therapy, has been treated conservatively, and is able to independently care for himself and perform household chores and repairs. The ALJ additionally notes that examinations have revealed no neurological defect and that Mr. Castillo has been released to work by more than one doctor on more than one occasion. The ALJ reasonably concluded that the medical evidence and other evidence as a whole does not indicate that Mr. Castillo\u2019s ability to perform basic work activities is as limited as he asserts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">5. We have specifically rejected the contention that, under <em>Watson, </em>the ALJ must in every decision articulate a separate and explicit finding that a claimant can maintain a job on a sustained basis. <em>Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 619 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Cir.2003); <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 465 (5th Cir.2005). Usually, the issue of whether a claimant can maintain employment for a significant period of time will be subsumed in the analysis regarding the claimant\u2019s ability to obtain employment. <em>Frank </em>at 619. <em>Watson </em>requires a situation in which, by its nature, the claimant\u2019s physical ailment waxes and wanes in its manifestation of disabling symptoms. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAbsent evidence that a claimant\u2019s ability to maintain employment would be compromised despite his ability to perform employment as an initial matter, or an indication that the ALJ did not appreciate that an ability to perform work on a regular and continuing basis is inherent in the definition of RFC [residual functional capacity],\u201d a separate finding regarding an ability to maintain employment is not required. <em>Dunbar v. Barnhart, </em>330 F.3d 670, 672 (5th Cir.2003).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Mr. Castillo has not presented any evidence indicating that he could work temporarily at a particular level of exertion but could not sustain work at that level. Nor has he offered any evidence that his condition \u201cwaxes and wanes\u201d in frequency or intensity such that his ability to maintain employment was not adequately taken into account in his residual functional capacity determination. <em>Perez </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
