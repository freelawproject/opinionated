On appeal, Brown challenges his enhancement for obstruction of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the portions of his testimony referenced by the district court in support of the enhancement were discrepancies in the testimony of various government \u201csnitches,\u201d and there was no evidence that he intentionally misled the district court or the jury. He contends the district court gave no explanation of how his testimony obstructed or impeded the investigation or prosecution of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we \u201ccontinue to review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines just as we did <em>pre-Booker.\u201d United States v. Ellis, </em>419 F.3d 1189, 1192-193 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThis Court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Machado, </em>333 F.3d 1225, 1227 (11th Cir.2003). When reviewing the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, we have determined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVgx\">Where the district court must make a particularized assessment of the credibility or demeanor of the defendant, we accord special deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, and we review for clear error.... Conversely, where the defendant\u2019s credibility or demeanor is not at issue, and the defendant\u2019s conduct can be clearly set forth in detailed, non-conclusory findings, we review de novo the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am7\"><em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1318 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">Section 3C1.1 provides that a two-level enhancement may be applied to the base offense level if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 cites \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\u201d and \u201cproviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>as examples of conduct to which the enhancement applies. <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 4(b), (f). Perjury is giving \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). \u201cMaterial\u201d means \u201cevidence, fact, statement, or information ... that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 6. \u201c[T]he threshold for materiality under the commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 is \u2018conspicuously low.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Odedina, </em>980 F.2d 705, 707 (11th Cir.1993). (quoting <em>United States v. Dedeker, </em>961 F.2d 164, 167 (11th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The Supreme Court has held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An_\">if a defendant objects to a sentence enhancement resulting from h[is] trial testimony, a district court must review the evidence and make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to or obstruction of justice, or an attempt to do the same, under the perjury definition we have set out. When doing so, it is preferable for a district court to address each element of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding. The district court\u2019s determination that enhancement is required is sufficient, however, if ... the court makes a finding of an obstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-6\"><em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 95, 113 S.Ct. at 1117 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In the instant case, the district court did not err by enhancing Brown\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice. At resentencing, the district court properly explained the factual basis for its finding that Brown obstructed justice by offering perjured testimony and identified numerous specific examples of testimony which it determined to be knowingly false. The district court\u2019s findings are supported by the record, are sufficiently detailed, and clearly reflect the basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not err by applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-11\">. This is the second time we have considered this case. In <em>Brown I, </em>we affirmed Brown's conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded the case on the obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See United States v. Brown, 97 </em>Fed.Appx. 905, -, -, manuscript op. at 13, 16 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). We instructed the district court on remand to make specific perjury findings at resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at -, manuscript op at 16. The district court complied with our mandate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-22\">.
