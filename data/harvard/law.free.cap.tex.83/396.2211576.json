Mainor, then a merchant residing and doing business in the county of Montague, conveyed to the appellee Owen D. Burnette, as trustee, a certain stock of merchandise then in his store in the town of Bowie, to be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of certain debts due by him in the manner specified in said conveyance. Certain creditors of Mainor filed an application with the district judge in said county, stating that Burnette had failed to give bond as required by the statute concerning assignments for the benefit of creditors, and asked the court to appoint an assignee. Appellant was appointed, and after the refusal of Burnette to deliver to him the stock of goods, he brought this suit in the District Court of Dallas County, on March 27, 1890, against Burnette, the trustee, and Blankenship &amp; Blake Company and B. C. Evans Company, for a conversion of the property, alleging, in substance, that on the 8th day of' October, 1887, one J. E. Mainor, who then resided, conducted his busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ness, and had all his property in Montague County, Texas, was insolvent, and in contemplation of insolvency had executed and delivered to the defendant Owen D. Burnette a deed of assignment, conveying to the said Burnette, as assignee, for the benefit of all his creditors, all his, the said Mainor\u2019s, property subject to execution; that the said Burnette was at that time a resident citizen of Dallas County, Texas; that said deed was, and was intended by the said Mainor to be, a general assignment under the laws of Texas of all the said Mainor\u2019s property subject to execution, for the benefit of all his creditors; that the property so assigned consisted principally of a stock of goods, wares, and merchandise, situated in the town of Bowie, Montague County, Texas, of the value of $11,000; that the said Burnette immediately took possession of said stock, and was proceeding to dispose of it; that five days having elapsed, and the said Burnette having failed to give the bond required by law, the creditors of the said Mainor, on October 17, 1887, filed a motion in the District Court of Montague County, Texas, setting forth the facts, and asking that the court appoint some eligible person to act as assignee, who would give the bond required by law, which said motion was on the 18th day of October, 1887, heard by said court and granted, and appellant was appointed by the said court assignee of the said Mainor, and his bond fixed at $11,000; that appellant duly gave said bond and demanded possession of the property from the said Burnette, but that the said Burnette refused; that the said Burnette, together with the other defendants, converted all of said property to their own use, to appellant\u2019s damage in the sum of $11,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">A copy of the deed executed by the said Mainor, and certified copies of said motion and of the order of said District Court appointing appellant assignee, and of the bond, were attached to appellant\u2019s petition and made a part thereof.

The allegations of appellant\u2019s petition and the exhibits thereto attached show that J. E.

Burnette, was not a resident of Montague County, where Mainor resided and conducted his principal business; and that the said Burnette failed to give the bond required by law; upon which state of facts, on application of the creditors of Mainor, the judge of the District Court rightfully appointed appellant assignee of the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-8\">2. The allegations of appellant\u2019s petition show that the appellees converted the property belonging to the estate of J. E.

Burnette, as trustee, when the said Mainor was insolvent and in contemplation of insolvency, is an assignment, and not a chattel mortgage.. Johnson v. Robinson, 68 Texas, 399; Hart v.

Every assignment made by an insolvent debtor, or in contemplation of insolvency, which is intended by the assignor to be an assignment for the benefit of all his creditors, is, under the laws of Texas, a general assignment for the benefit of all such creditors in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims, and however made or expressed, has this effect, and is construed to pass all his property subject to execution whether specified therein or not, and all preferences expressed in such an instrument are void.

The law can not make an assignment for an insolvent debtor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-7\">2. Where an instrument making provision for the payment of a debtor\u2019s debts manifests no intention on the part of the debtor to make a statutory assignment, the courts can not construe it into a statutory assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-8\">3. Before the court can construe an instrument to be a statutory assignment, it must be clear from its context that the debtor intended to make a statutory assignment and not a chattel mortgage or a partial assignment under the common law; otherwise the law, and not his will, controls the disposition of his property. Donoho v. Fish Bros., 58 Texas, 164.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-9\">4. The statute prescribes what character both the assignor and assignee shall have, in order for the instrument to be a statutory assignment. The assignor must be insolvent or in contemplation of insolvency, otherwise the statute of assignment has no application; and likewise the assignee must possess a designated character\u2014that is to say, he must be a resident of the county in which the assignor resides, and if his residence is elsewhere,.then he fails to possess the qualifications required by the statute. Bev. Stats., art. 65; Johnson v. Bobinson, 68 Texas, 399.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-10\">5. If the instrument by which the debtor transfers his property for the payment of his debts to a trustee, residing in a county other than that of the residence of the debtor can be held to be a statutory assignment, then the amendment of the assignment law of 1879, passed In 1883, requiring assignees to be residents of the county in which the assignor resides, is a dead letter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-11\">6. When the statute has been amended so as to cure some defect in an existing law, and the statute clearly expresses the legislative will, the courts are not at liberty to give a construction to it which would defeat the obvious meaning and intention of the law-making department; for whatever may be the opinion of the court as to the policy of a law, it is bound to give effect to the expressed will of the Legislature, in applying it. Thompson v. Buckley, 1 Texas, 33.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-12\">7. When an instrument made by a debtor for the purpose of providing for the payment of certain specified creditors designates the grantee as a trustee, and does not on its face purport to convey all of the debtor\u2019s property, and provides for only certain named creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>with preferences among them, and appoints a nonresident of his county as the trustee to execute such trust, and nowhere uses the words \u201cassignment,\u201d \u201cassign,\u201d or \u201cassignee,\u201d or any other words clearly indicating that the instrument was intended as a statutory assignment, it will be held to be a chattel mortgage, or a partial common law assignment, as the case may be. 65 Texas, 532; 67 Texas, 103; 22 Texas, 717.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b420-3\">GAEEETT, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ayj\"><em>Section </em>B.\u2014By the instrument under which Burnette acquired his right to the possession of the stock of goods, Mainor, who was indebted to the various persons mentioned therein, undertook to transfer, sell, and convey the property to a trustee for the purpose of disposing of the same by sale and applying the proceeds thereof to the payment of his indebtedness as far as the same might be sufficient with the preferences indicated. It was not a chattel mortgage or deed of trust to secure a debt or debts due or to become due by the debtor, who conveyed the property, to the creditors named therein, as no condition of defeasance was either expressed or could be implied from the terms used. A proper construction of the instrument will show its effect to be a conveyance of the stock of goods absolutely to the appellee Burnette, thereby investing him with full and absolute title with a trust as to the proceeds for the purposes expressed. The grantor\u2019s intention was that the title should pass to and become invested in Burnette, with no power on the grantor\u2019s part to avoid or defeat it. The transaction was a direct application of the goods for purpose of sale and the appropriation of the proceeds to the payment of the indebtedness of Mainor, just as much as if A owed debts to B and C which he desired to pay, and delivered to D a horse, and directed him to sell the horse and with the proceeds to pay the debt of B first and then that of C in full if the proceeds were sufficient, but if not, to pay him whatever there might be. Because of any surplus to which A might be entitled no defeasance could be implied, since a defeasance would apply only to the title to the property. The instrument was therefore an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Johnson v. Robinson, 68 Texas, 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u201cEvery assignment made by an insolvent debtor, or in contemplation of insolvency, for the benefit of his creditors, shall provide, except as hereinafter provided, for a distribution of all his real and personal estate, other than that which is by law exempt from execution, among all his creditors in proportion to their respective claims; and however made or expressed, shall have the effect aforesaid, and shall be construed to pass all such estate, whether specified therein or not; and every assignment shall be proved or acknowledged and certified and recorded in the same manner as provided by law in conveyances of real estate or other property.\u201d Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., art. 65a.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>It was alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition that Mainor was insolvent and in contemplation of insolvency, and that he had executed and delivered to the defendant a deed of assignment conveying for the benefit of all his creditors all of his property subject to execution. It is not necessary that these facts should appear from the face of the deed; they may be alleged and proved. An assignment made by an insolvent debtor for the benefit of all his creditors of all his property comes within the law concerning assignment for the benefit of creditors; and any provisions for preference among the creditors will be treated as void. If Mainor was insolvent and his intention was to convey all his property for the benefit of all his creditors, the instrument became a general statutory assignment, no matter how expressed, and his intention to create a preference in favor of some of them can have no effect. Bor do we think it can make any difference that he did not intend that the assignment should come within the law, if in fact it was made under such circumstances and in such manner as to bring it within the act concerning assignments for the benefit of creditors. The intention will be gathered from the instrument itself and the law which enters into it and becomes a part thereof. Every person\u2019s right to dispose of his property is subject to the law, and especially is the right of an insolvent debtor to make disposition of his property as he pleases hedged in and limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The instrument was valid as a general assignment for creditors under the statute, unless the fact that the assignee was not a resident of Montague County, in which the assignor resided, rendered it void. It is provided by the statute, that \u201cevery such assignee shall be a resident of this State and of the county in which the assignor resides or in which his principal business was conducted.\u201d Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., art. 65f. This question has never been passed on in this State. In the case of Johnson v. Robinson, 68 Texas, 399, it appeared from the face of the assignment that the assignees were residents of the State of Kentucky; but the instrument in that case having been held to be a partial common-law assignment, it was not necessary to decide whether that fact would avoid it. We gather from the general purport of the act and the uniform construction thereof that assignments coming within its scope are to be upheld rather than strictly construed. Rb fraudulent act, intent, or purpose of the assignor or assignee can have the effect to defeat an assignment or to deprive the creditors consenting thereto from the benefit thereof, and any such fraudulent intent on the part of the assignee is sufficient cause for his removal. Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., art. 65f. All such assignments, however made or expressed, shall have the effect to provide for the distribution of all the assignor\u2019s real and personal estate among all his creditors in proportion to their respective claims. It has been held that the omission of property from the inventory, the failure to annex an inventory, the failure to include all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the creditors in the schedule, and the failure of the assignee to file a bond, will not avoid the assignment. In the case of Bachrack v. Norton, 132 United States, 337, cited by counsel for appellees as having intimated that the assignment would have been void if the statute had required the assignee to be a resident of the State, the question was not passed upon, and the court said: \u201cIndependently of a statute on the subject, we do not see why, as a mere matter of law, an assignment should be held void because the assignee is not a citizen or resident of the State where the assignment is made and the debtor resides, provided he complies with the conditions prescribed by law.\u201d Some of the States it seems have statutes which make the assignment void when the assignee is a nonresident of the State. Burr, on Assign., sec. 91, notes 7 and 8. We do not think, in the absence of an express declaration of the statute to that effect, that the fact that Burnette was not a resident of Montague County renders the assignment void, and we hold the provision of the statute with reference to the residence of the assignee as directory and not mandatory. If he failed to comply with the conditions prescribed by law for the management of the trust, he would be subject to removal.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b422-8\">Adopted February 16, 1892.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The statute does not require that notice shall be given of the application of creditors to have an assignee appointed on the failure of the assignee named in the deed to file a bond within five days. By analogy to the law by which administrators and guardians are removable without notice, the office is treated as vacant on account of the failure to file the bond as required, and another person is appointed. Article 65o, Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes, is a provision for the removal of the assignee and the appointment of another in his place. When the assignee named in the assignment fails to file a bond it is not \u00e1 question of removal, but rather of declination or refusal, and if the creditors see proper to take advantage of it they may have an assignee appointed. Appellant was appointed in accordance with the statute, and had authority to bring and maintain this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We conclude that the court below erred in sustaining appellees\u2019 demurrers to plaintiff\u2019s petition, and that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
