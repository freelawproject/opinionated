The arbitrators failing to agree selected an umpire. The umpire and one of the arbitrators agreed upon the value of the property. Their award was filed in the District Court. The umpire was not sworn, hut Anderson and the city attorney had indorsed upon the agreement to arbitrate their consent dispensing with the administration of an oath to the arbitrators or the umpire. Anderson sought to compel the clerk of the District Court to enter the award as a judgment of the court. The court refused the motion. <em>Held:</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b125-15\">1.

The answer, that \u201cthe city of Fort Worth was not authorized by law to arbitrate a matter of damages in opening a public street, when the charter of the city prescribed a different method,\u201d presented no legal defense, as the city could legally submit the matter in issue to arbitration; and if such power had been questionable, neither \"respondent nor the city could raise or urge it as a defense.

The charter says that the same shall be done in the manner and controlled by the State laws in force in reference to condemnation of right of way for railway companies and the assessment of damage therefor; the city occupying the position of a railway company; and the laws in reference to application for condemnation of right of way for railway companies, including the measure of damages, right of appeal, and the like, shall apply to an application by said city under its charter for the condemnation of property for the purpose of opening, changing, or widening streets, avenues, or alleys, or for the construction of water mains or sewers.

The two arbitrators disagreed and selected an umpire. The umpire and the arbitrator selected by Anderson agreed to and signed an award fixing the amount of compensation to be paid by the city to Anderson. The arbitrator selected by the city refused to consent to this award. The umpire was not sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">It appears that the city attorney and Anderson indorsed upon the agreement to arbitrate an agreement dispensing with the administration of an oath to the arbitrators or the umpire. The court decided that the award was not so made as to authorize its entry as a judgment of the court, and the motion was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">A number of interesting questions, both of practice and right, are suggested by the record, which we do not think it necessary or proper to now discuss or decide. If it be admitted that in this proceeding the appellant would have the right to have the award, if properly made, entered as the judgment of the court, we think that the omission to swear the umpire would be fatal to his case. The agreement of the city was made with reference to the statute on the subject, one provision of which is that the arbitrators, including the umpire, shall be sworn. Rev. Stats., art. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">It does not appear that the city attorney had any authority to waive this requirement of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">We do not intend to decide that the questions in controversy could have been properly adjudicated in the District Court in an arbitration proceeding under the statute, nor that the proper practice to have an award entered is by a motion against the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
