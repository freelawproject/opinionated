He appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by admitting certain evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">The record supports the following. The defendant, Nathan and Jennifer Greenlaw, and Frank and Tammy Turner knew each other through the Granite State Dart League. In early June 2006, the Turners rented a bedroom in their apartment to the defendant for $50 a week. The defendant did not have access to the Turners\u2019 computer because it was password protected. When he wanted to use a computer, the defendant would visit the Greenlaws to use theirs. The Turners also had permission to use the Greenlaws\u2019 computer. Mr. Greenlaw acknowledged that he saw pop-up advertisements for pornographic websites when he used his computer, but denied ever visiting a pornographic website, printing material from a pornographic website, or downloading a pornographic image.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">On June 23, 2006, Ms. Turner asked the defendant to leave because he had not paid any rent. She told him he had seven days to remove his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>belongings before she would throw them away. The defendant returned to the Turners\u2019 apartment twice between June 24,2006, and June 26,2006, to remove his belongings. He removed his clothing, television and a stereo, but left behind a bureau, bed and part of a computer stand. He then left for a vacation with the Greenlaws in Virginia. He did not contact the Turners again before leaving, and did not return to the Turners\u2019 apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On July 4, 2006, Ms. Turner and her sister cleaned out the room the defendant had rented. In one of the bureaus the defendant left behind, they discovered CDs, memory cards, identification badges and a manila folder. The manila folder contained twenty-three images that appeared to have been generated by a computer printer. Two of the images depicted adult females, and the other twenty-one depicted female children in sexually provocative poses.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Ms. Turner called the police. The Manchester Police Department responded to the Turners\u2019 apartment and took the manila folder containing the pornography, the identification badges, some papers they found in the bureau and five CDs. Three of the CDs were not labeled, one was labeled \u201cBabysitter\u201d and another was labeled \u201cPTCH Vicky.\u201d At the police station, Detective Richard Nanan inserted the CD entitled \u201cPTCH Vicky\u201d into his computer and found that it contained six video clips depicting children engaged in sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On July 9, 2006, Detectives Nanan and Craig went to the Greenlaws\u2019 residence where the defendant had been staying and asked him to come to the police station to answer questions. He agreed. During the ensuing interview, the defendant admitted to police that he owned one CD titled \u201cBabysitter\u201d and another titled \u201cNaughty America,\u201d but denied knowing anything about the pornographic images found in the manila folder. He told the officers he had used the Greenlaws\u2019 computer without their knowledge to download \u201cBabysitter\u201d and \u201cNaughty America\u201d from a file sharing website. The detectives returned to the Greenlaws\u2019 apartment and, with their permission, brought their computer back to the police station for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Detective Craig analyzed the Greenlaws\u2019 computer using a forensics tool kit, or FTK. This FTK report revealed that the Greenlaws\u2019 computer had been used to access child pornography websites such as \u201cExploited Teens.\u201d He also discovered several \u201cgraphic images\u201d in temporary Internet files on the computer. Craig characterized some of the images as child erotica and others as child pornography. The images on the Greenlaws\u2019 computer contained the same type of images found in the manila folder and on the CDs from the Turners\u2019 apartment. He determined that all of the images and websites were accessed between June 2, 2006, and June 23, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The police also compared a fingerprint found on one of the images in the manila folder with those contained on a fingerprint card from the defendant\u2019s arrest in 2004. Two latent print examiners at the state forensics laboratory concluded that the print on the image matched the defendant\u2019s right index fingerprint from the fingerprint card. No fingerprints were found on the CDs.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">At trial, a digital image expert testified that the images in the manila folder depicted real children. The State introduced more than thirty pages of the images found on the Greenlaws\u2019 computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Two of the six indictments with which the defendant was charged alleged possession of the photographs found in the manila folder. The remaining four indictments alleged possession of video files found on the CD labeled \u201cPTCH Vicky.\u201d The defendant was convicted of all six counts of possession of child pornography. On appeal, he argues the trial court erred when it admitted: (1) the fruits of the search of the CDs; (2) the 2004 fingerprint card; and (3) the pornographic material obtained from the Greenlaws\u2019 computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\n<em>I. Videos from the CD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress the CD labeled \u201cPTCH Vicky,\u201d arguing it was obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of his right to privacy under Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, he argued that because he did not abandon his interest in the contents of the bureau, the police should have obtained a search warrant before viewing the contents of the CD. The State contended that the property had been abandoned because the defendant was given ample opportunity to remove his belongings and he did not do so. The trial court denied the motion to suppress because the defendant had no expectation of privacy in the bureau or its contents because he voluntarily abandoned the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution, and cite federal opinions for guidance only. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). Under Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution, a person has the \u201cright to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.\u201d <em>State v. Westerner, </em>140 N.H. 375, 379 (1995); <em>see also </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 19. In determining whether a search or seizure was reasonable, we will analyze whether the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the evidence seized. <em>See Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 353 (1967); <em>State v. Goss, </em>150 N.H. 46, 48-49 (2003). In <em>Goss, </em>we adopted a two-part reasonable expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tion of privacy analysis under Part I, Article 19. <em>Goss, </em>150 N.H. at 49. First, a person must \u201chave exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy,\u201d and, second, that expectation must \u201cbe one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Absent an invasion of the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy, there has been no constitutional violation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u201cWhen a person abandons a possession... he or she gives up the right to be secure from unreasonable searches of that possession.\u201d <em>Westover, </em>140 N.H. at 380; <em>see also Abel v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 217, 241 (1960). Abandonment is determined \u201cbased upon evidence of a combination of act and intent.\u201d <em>Westover, </em>140 N.H. at 380. Intent \u201cis to be ascertained from what the actor said and did since intent, although subjective, is determined from objective facts at hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Also relevant are \u201cwhere and for what length of time the property is relinquished and [its] condition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Whether property has been abandoned is generally a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we will uphold the fact finder\u2019s determination regarding abandonment unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>Our review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, however, is <em>de novo. State v. Sullivan, </em>157 N.H. 124, 129 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We cannot say the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant abandoned the room and its contents was clearly erroneous. Ms. Turner told the defendant that he needed to move out and gave him one week to remove his belongings. He returned to the apartment twice within one week to remove his clothing, and several larger items such as a television and stereo. This demonstrates that the defendant knew he had only one week to remove his property and he was complying with Ms. Turner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">In addition, at no point during his second visit did he indicate to the Turners that he would be returning to take the remaining property. After returning to the Turners\u2019 apartment for the second time, the defendant had no further contact with them. He neither requested more time nor left a forwarding address at which the Turners could contact him regarding the rest of his belongings. Ms. Turner waited an additional five days beyond her original seven-day deadline before she began going through his things. The fact the defendant appeared to have lived elsewhere for approximately two weeks without them indicated that he did not need these items. The defendant\u2019s actions demonstrate a clear intent to abandon the bedroom, including the bureau and the CDs therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The defendant argues that he only temporarily abandoned his property, including the CD. <em>See Westover, </em>140 N.H. at 380-81. We disagree. The defendant left his belongings in the apartment for five days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>expiration of Ms. Turner\u2019s deadline; twelve days lapsed from the time Ms. Turner told him to leave and the time she searched his room. Federal courts have found less time to be enough to constitute abandonment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kress, </em>446 F.2d 358, 361 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 947 (1971) (finding abandonment after absence of only two days). As set forth above, the defendant\u2019s conduct before and during his absence indicated that he intended to abandon his belongings. Although the defendant asserts that the fact he was vacationing \u201cnecessarily implies a temporary rather than permanent absence,\u201d the trial court reasonably found the property had been abandoned based upon all of the circumstances. <em>See Westerner, </em>140 N.H. at 380 (abandonment determined from objective facts at hand).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The defendant also relies on <em>Goss, </em>where we held that a defendant has an expectation of privacy in his trash. <em>Goss, </em>150 N.H. 49-50. <em>Goss </em>is inapplicable because the defendant in this case did not remove the bureau or its contents and place them in the trash, which would have ensured that his belongings would be destroyed. Nor did he instruct the Turners to dispose of his property. Ms. Turner told him that she intended to throw away any items remaining after seven days. This reasonably would entail going through the drawers and any property he left behind. Once he moved out and left his belongings in the room, it was, as the trial court stated, \u201ca virtual certainty\u201d that the Turners would go through them. Therefore, the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items he left behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We conclude that under the State Constitution, there was no protected privacy interest requiring the police to obtain a search warrant before viewing the videos on the CD because the defendant had abandoned it. The Federal Constitution provides no greater protection than the State Constitution under these circumstances. <em>See Goss, </em>150 N.H. at 49. Therefore, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>II. Fingerprint Card from 2001</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Next, we address the defendant\u2019s argument that the 2004 fingerprint card was inadmissible hearsay. At trial, the State introduced the fingerprint card through the testimony of Brian Last, a Manchester police officer assigned to the booking department. The trial court admitted the fingerprint card under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 803(6). The defendant argues that the State failed to lay the proper foundation that the fingerprint card had been created and kept in the ordinary course of business or that it was the regular practice of the police department to create such fingerprint cards. The defendant contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>that the fingerprint card is inadmissible because Officer Last testified that the first time he saw the 2004 fingerprint card was at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u201cRule 803(6) requires that the proponent of the document produce the custodian of the record, or another qualified witness, to testify about the identity and mode of preparation of the proffered document, and to testify that it was made in the regular course of business at or near the time of the transaction recorded.\u201d <em>State v. Wall, </em>154 N.H. 237, 242 (2006). \u201cVerification of the authenticity, regularity and correctness of such records by the official having them in charge, or by another qualified witness, constitutes the proper foundation for admission of the proffered record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cThe \u2018qualified witness\u2019 required by Rule 803(6) need only be someone who understands the system of how the document was made, and need not have participated in the document\u2019s creation or know who created it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The admissibility of evidence is generally within the discretion of the trial court, and we will uphold its rulings unless the exercise of its discretion is unsustainable. <em>Murray v. Developmental Servs. of Sullivan County, </em>149 N.H. 264, 267 (2003). Unless the defendant establishes that such a ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case, we will not disturb it. <em>Id. </em>The defendant has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Although Officer Last testified that he was not \u201ckeeper of the records,\u201d he later said that as a booking officer he fully understood the system of how the fingerprint cards were created. <em>Wall, </em>154 N.H. at 244. He testified that he was \u201cfamiliar with the process of the record-keeping\u201d and had \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the filing system that stored the fingerprint cards. He then described how the cards were created. He also testified that he had been involved in the creation, storage and retrieval of the fingerprint cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Officer Last also testified that fingerprint cards were records the department kept in the normal course of business. <em>Wall, </em>154 N.H. at 242. He explained that the 2004 fingerprint card was on the same form that is \u201cthe standardized form used by the Manchester Police Department.\u201d He then testified that the fingerprint card belonged to the defendant, relying upon information on the card, including the defendant\u2019s name and signature. Because Officer Last testified as to the regularity of the creation of the fingerprint cards, as well as the fact that the fingerprint card in issue was of the same type that is usually created when a defendant is booked, he established the proper foundation that the card was created and maintained in the regular course of business under Rule 803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The defendant argues that because fingerprint cards are not created every time a defendant is arrested and booked, they are not business records within the meaning of Rule 803(6). This argument fails, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>because Officer Last testified that it is the Manchester Police Department\u2019s protocol that defendants be fingerprinted and photographed when they are booked. Although Officer Last testified that \u201c[a] lot of officers\u201d will not create a second fingerprint card when one already exists, he also testified the fingerprint cards are created \u201c[m]ost times.\u201d The State need not show that the cards are always created upon every arrest, but that they are created in the regular course of business. Officer Last\u2019s testimony that it was the regular practice of the Manchester Police Department to fingerprint and photograph defendants upon their first arrest was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the card.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion by admitting the 2004 fingerprint card.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>III. Additional Images Found on Greenlaws\u2019 Computer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Before trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to introduce more than thirty pages of pornographic images from the Greenlaws\u2019 computer. The defendant argues that: (1) the State failed to demonstrate that the evidence was admitted for a purpose other than character or propensity; (2) the State failed to show clear proof that the defendant was the person who downloaded the images on to the Greenlaws\u2019 computer; and (3) the evidence was substantially more prejudicial than probative. The State counters that the images show that the defendant acted knowingly in downloading child pornography, as opposed to adult pornography, and not by accident or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Although \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d is inadmissible \u201cto prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith,\u201d such evidence may be admissible \u201cfor other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 404(b). \u201cThe purpose of Rule 404(b) is to ensure that the defendant is tried on the merits of the crime as charged and to prevent a conviction based upon evidence of other crimes or wrongs.\u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>158 N.H. 708, 711 (2009). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s ruling for an unsustainable exercise of discretion, and will reverse only if it was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712. Because the trial court ruled on the admissibility of the images before trial, \u201cwe consider only what was presented at the pretrial hearing.\u201d <em>State v. Glodgett, </em>144 N.H. 687, 694 (2000) (quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">To be admissible under Rule 404(b): \u201c(1) the evidence must be relevant for a purpose other than proving the defendant\u2019s character or disposition; (2) there must be clear proof that the defendant committed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>act; and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Costello, </em>159 N.H. 113, 118 (2009). The State must prove the admissibility of the bad acts. <em>Id. </em>Here, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision under all three prongs of the Rule 404(b) analysis. Because the trial court made no findings with respect to any of the three prongs, and the defendant did not object to the lack of findings, we review the record to determine whether it supports the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that each prong was met. <em>But see State v. McGlew, </em>139 N.H. 505, 508-10 (1995) (requiring trial courts to make specific findings to support their evidentiary rulings under Rule 404(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u201c[T]o meet its burden under the first prong, the State is required to specify the purpose for which the evidence is offered and articulate the precise chain of reasoning by which the proffered evidence will tend to prove or disprove an issue actually in dispute, without relying upon forbidden inferences of predisposition, character, or propensity.\u201d <em>State v. Kim, </em>153 N.H. 322, 327 (2006). \u201cThat chain of reasoning must demonstrate a sufficient logical connection between the prior acts and the permissible purpose for which the State offers the evidence.\u201d <em>Costello, </em>159 N.H. at 118 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u201cTo be relevant to intent, evidence of other bad acts must be able to support a reliable inference, not dependent on the defendant\u2019s character or propensity, that the defendant had the same intent on the occasions of the charged and uncharged acts.\u201d <em>State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 277 (2007) (quotations omitted). \u201cWe will find sufficient support for a reliable inference of intent only if the defendant\u2019s intent in committing other bad acts and the defendant\u2019s intent in the charged offenses is closely connected by logically significant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> Here, the defendant was charged with possession of child pornography, which required the State to prove the defendant knowingly possessed a \u201cvisual representation of a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d RSA 649-A:3, 1(e). \u201cA person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance that is a material element of an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstances exist.\u201d RSA 626:2,11(b). The evidence found on the Greenlaws\u2019 computer is probative of the defendant\u2019s intent and knowledge because he sought out websites containing child pornography. These websites were accessed repeatedly during the time that the defendant stayed at the Turners\u2019 apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Evidence that the defendant sought and viewed child pornography-on a regular basis is relevant to show the defendant acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d <em>See United, States v. Angle, </em>234 F.3d 326, 343 (7th Cir. 2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 932 (2001) (upholding admission of evidence of other acts in child pornography case to show defendant acted \u201cknowingly\u201d); <em>United States v. Schene, </em>543 F.3d 627, 643 (10th Cir. 2008) (upholding admission of uncharged images of child pornography to show defendant \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d charged images).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The images were also probative of the defendant\u2019s lack of mistake or accident. The defendant told the police that he possessed adult, but not child pornography. The images were relevant to show the defendant sought out child pornography and did not accidentally acquire images of child pornography in pursuit of adult pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erroneously admitted the uncharged images under the second prong of the Rule 404(b) analysis because there was no clear proof that he accessed the material. The \u201cclear proof\u2019 requirement \u201cis satisfied when the State presents evidence firmly establishing that the defendant, and not some other person, committed the prior act.\u201d <em>State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 512-13 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 834 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">To establish clear proof, the State presented the FTK report to demonstrate that any and all child pornography websites and images viewed, downloaded, and visited by users of the Greenlaws\u2019 computer occurred only during the time that the defendant lived with the Turners. The other people who had access to the computer testified that they never used it to access pornography. In addition, the images found on the Greenlaws\u2019 computer were similar to those found in the manila folder and on the CDs. The FTK report and testimony of the -witnesses constitute clear proof that the defendant accessed the material found on the Greenlaws\u2019 computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court erroneously admitted the uncharged images under the third prong of the Rule 404(b) analysis because there was a substantial danger that the jury would consider the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the additional images when deciding his guilt. Under the third prong of Rule 404(b), \u201cevidence of prior bad acts is admissible if the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Beltran, </em>153 N.H. 643, 649 (2006). \u201cEvidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, or provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision upon something other than the established propositions in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not, however, evidence that is merely detrimental to the defendant because it tends to prove his guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAmong the factors we consider in weighing the evidence are: (1) whether the evidence would have a great emotional impact upon a jury; (2) its potential for appealing to a juror\u2019s sense of resentment or outrage; and (3) the extent to which the issue upon which it is offered is established by other evidence, stipulation or inference.\u201d <em>Costello, </em>159 N.H. at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201cWe accord considerable deference to the trial court\u2019s determination in balancing prejudice and probative worth under Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cParticularly pertinent to determining this balance is whether the evidence is relevant to prove an issue that is actually in serious dispute.\u201d <em>Pepin, </em>156 N.H. at 278-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cFirst, we consider the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>Costello, </em>159 N.H. at 123. \u201cDetermining the probative value of evidence entails analyzing <em>how </em>relevant it is.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cRelevant evidence may have limited probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, as discussed above, evidence that the defendant used the Greenlaws\u2019 computer to access child pornography websites and images was highly probative of his knowledge because the State had to prove every element of the crime at trial, including that the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d possessed the child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201cNext, we consider whether the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from admission of this evidence substantially outweighed its probative value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hile evidence of a prior offense or bad act is always prejudicial, the prejudice is frequently outweighed by the probative value of the evidence when the defendant\u2019s knowledge or intent is a contested issue in the case.\u201d <em>Kim, </em>153 N.H. at 331. As noted above, the challenged evidence was probative of the defendant\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In addition, the evidence from the Greenlaws\u2019 computer was not likely to have any greater emotional impact upon the jury than the charged images. Here, the images found on the Greenlaws\u2019 computer were the same type of child pornography and child erotica as were found in the Turners\u2019 apartment. The jury was also shown portions of the videos found on the \u201cPTCH Vicky\u201d CD and the images found in the manila folder. Although the images may have been prejudicial, we cannot conclude that the evidence \u201cwas so inflammatory as to substantially outweigh its probative value.\u201d <em>Costello, </em>159 N.H. at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-10\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
