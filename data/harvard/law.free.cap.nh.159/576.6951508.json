We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The Manchester District Court (Champagne, J.) could have found the following facts. At the time of the assault, the defendant lived with the complainant and her mother and had been the boyfriend of the complainant\u2019s mother for nine years. The complainant, who was then twenty-two years old, was born with disabilities and required daily care such as changing her diapers and assistance with showering, dressing and brushing her teeth. On weekdays, while her mother worked, the complainant attended the Moore Center, an organization providing services for people with acquired brain disorders and developmental disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">On April 24,2008, the complainant\u2019s mother dropped the complainant off at the Moore Center. The complainant was crying and informed her nurse about an incident that had occurred with the defendant that morning. The police were contacted, and the defendant was charged by complaint with having committed sexual assault, in that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">[The defendant did] [p]urposely engage in sexual conduct with [the complainant] 08/18/85, whom he knows to be mentally defective, to wit: did expose his bare penis to her and then told her to touch his bare penis, to which she complied, which can be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">The defendant was tried in Manchester District Court and convicted. On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in: (1) finding that the State proved both that the complainant was mentally defective and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>defendant knew she was mentally defective; and (2) ruling that the complainant was competent to testify. We address the second issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\u2018Whether a witness is competent to testify is a question of law for the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Mills, </em>136 N.H. 46, 49 (1992). \u201cWhere the record supports the court\u2019s determination of competency, we will not disturb that determination absent an [unsustainable exercise] of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Aikens, </em>135 N.H. 569, 571 (1992) (quotation omitted); <em>see State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). \u201cBecause so much depends on the trial court\u2019s firsthand observations of the witness, its conclusion that the witness is competent is entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>State v. Briere, </em>138 N.H. 617, 620 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 601, \u201c[witnesses are presumed competent to testify, . . . [although this presumption may be overcome by findings that the witness \u2018lacks sufficient capacity to observe, remember and narrate as well as understand the duty to tell the truth\u2019 \u2014\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting N.H. R. Ev. 601(b)). The defendant challenges the complainant\u2019s capacity with respect to an understanding of the duty to tell the truth. Specifically, he contends that the record fails to demonstrate both the complainant\u2019s \u201cability to distinguish the truth from a lie, as well as [her ability] to appreciate her personal obligation to tell the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Implicit in an understanding of the duty to tell the truth is an understanding of the distinction between the truth and a lie. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>138 N.H. 649, 653 (1994) (record supported finding of competency where, <em>inter alia, </em>witness \u201cwas able to distinguish between the truth and lies\u201d); <em>State v. St. John, </em>120 N.H. 61, 63 (1980) (evidence supported finding that witness understood the duty to tell the truth where, <em>inter alia, </em>she \u201cdemonstrated that she knew the difference between a lie and the truth\u201d). To determine whether a finding that the complainant possessed such an understanding is sustainable, we examine the record in some depth.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">On direct examination of the complainant, the prosecutor inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">Q. And now do you know the difference between telling the truth and a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">Q. And is it \u2014 is it good or bad to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">A. I\u2019m not sure about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">Q. Is it good or bad to tell a he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">A. No, I\u2019m not sure about the lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-15\">Q. And do you want to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">A. Of course.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>After the complainant testified that it was very cold out that day, the prosecutor asked, \u201cSo if I told you it was hot out today, would that be the truth or would that be a lie?\u201d The complainant responded, \u201cThe truth.\u201d Similarly, after the complainant testified that she, her mother, and her nurse had been at a prior meeting with the prosecutor, the prosecutor asked, \u201c[I]f I said that [the nurse] wasn\u2019t there when we met before, is that the truth or is that a lie?\u201d The complainant answered, \u201cThe truth.\u201d The prosecutor then asked the complainant why she would want to tell the truth and the complainant stated, \u201cBecause I have to get it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On <em>voir dire, </em>the defense attorney asked her whether it is \u201cokay to sometimes lie?\u201d The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">A. Oh, well, sometimes to lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">Q. Can you say that again . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">A. Sometimes is a lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">Q. When is [it] okay to lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">A. Well, that\u2019s a hard question. I don\u2019t know what is a lie, but \u2014 I don\u2019t know what is a lie. I don\u2019t know a lie. I can\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">Q. So can you think of any examples when it\u2019s okay to lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-14\">Q. Can you tell us one of those examples?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-15\">A. What\u2019s that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-16\">Q. When it\u2019s okay to lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-17\">A. That\u2019s a hard question to ask. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is. Oh, man, I can\u2019t remember anything of this, oh, God. I can\u2019t get it all out. I\u2019m here to tell the truth. I\u2019m here to tell the truth of what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-18\">Finally, the trial court questioned the complainant. After asking the complainant to identify what the judge held in his hand, to which she replied, \u201cPen,\u201d the judge asked whether, if he told her what he was holding was a glass, \u201cwould I be lying or would I be telling the truth?\u201d The complainant responded, \u2018What do you mean?\u201d The judge again asked whether, if someone told the complainant what the judge was holding was a glass, \u201cwould that person be lying or telling the truth?\u201d The complainant answered, \u201cA lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-19\">The court then asked the complainant to explain in her own words what it meant to tell the truth. In response, she appears to have tried to recount the assault, to which defense counsel objected. The prosecutor urged the court to defer making a competency evaluation, allow the complainant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>testify and evaluate her competency based upon her testimony \u201cthroughout . . . the course of the trial.\u201d After concluding that it must make a determination of competency before a witness testifies, the court stated that it had one more question for the complainant. The court asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">THE COURT: ... Can you tell me what happens if somebody lies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">A. What do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">THE COURT: Well, that\u2019s what I want to know from you. What happens if somebody lies? They don\u2019t tell the truth? What do you think happens to people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">A. Oh, boy. They get in trouble when they lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The court then ruled that the complainant was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The State asserts that the complainant\u2019s answers support the determination of competency. It contends that although she \u201cwas unable to define \u2018truth;\u2019 or \u2018lie,\u2019... she was able to tell the court that she wanted to tell the truth, that people got into trouble when they lied, and that it would be a lie to call his pen a glass.\u201d The defendant, on the other hand, argues that a single correct answer among a number of incorrect ones cannot establish competency, as a witness giving random answers, would, as a matter of probability, at some point get one answer right. Thus, the defendant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">[A]s a policy matter, if [the complainant\u2019s] testimony suffices to establish competency, Rule 601(b) hardly filters the testimony of any witness. Nearly any witness can fail to answer several basic and highly leading questions about the ability to testify truthfully, as [the complainant] did, eventually can get one answer \u201cright,\u201d as [the complainant] did, and be deemed competent, as [the complainant] was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">We agree with the defendant that the complainant\u2019s single correct answer, considered together with her prior incorrect ones, does not demonstrate that she understood the difference between the truth and a lie. We cannot agree with the State that \u201c[ajfter confusing <em>voir dire </em>from both sides, the trial court was able to cut through the confusion.\u201d Rather, the record shows only that the trial court was able to elicit a correct response to the same type of question that both parties had previously posed and to which the complainant had responded incorrectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">The State cites a number of cases from other jurisdictions for the general proposition that \u201cthe failure of a witness to state clearly the difference between a lie and the truth does not render the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>incompetent to testify.\u201d <em>State v. Pettis, </em>488 A.2d 704, 706 (R.I. 1985) (involving testimony by a mentally impaired thirteen year old girl). We do not disagree; nevertheless, as Chief Justice Brock stated in his dissent in <em>Mills: </em>\u201cAlthough the witness need not utter any \u2018magic words\u2019 indicating that he or she understands the difference between the truth and a lie or the importance of telling the truth, some indication of the witness\u2019s understanding must be apparent on the record.\u201d <em>Mills, </em>136 N.H. at 54 (Brock, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We also acknowledge, as the State emphasizes, that the trial court had the opportunity to observe the complainant\u2019s demeanor firsthand, while we, in reviewing a competency determination, \u201cmust act on a cold record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50 (quotation omitted). Thus, in general, \u201c[b]ecause so much depends upon his observation of the witness, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that [a witness] was competent is entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, citation and brackets omitted). Such deference is not, however, absolute. Rather, \u201c[t]he question is not whether we would have ruled as the trial court did, but <em>whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to ground the finding.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The record in this case simply fails to support the trial court\u2019s finding of competency. Although the complainant was eventually able to identify an incorrect statement as a lie, that answer must be assessed in context with the complainant\u2019s prior faulty attempts to distinguish the truth from a lie and her expressions of confusion over the concepts of truth and falsehood. <em>Cf. People v. Sutherland, </em>743 N.E.2d 1007, 1014 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000) (noting that \u201cone imperfect response to a question is insufficient to invalidate a finding of competency in light of the totality of the responses\u201d), <em>appeal denied, </em>755 N.E.2d 482 (111. 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1105 (2002). We conclude that the complainant\u2019s testimony, as a whole, fails to demonstrate that she understood the distinction between truth and falsehood, and therefore failed to demonstrate that she understood the duty to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The defendant also argues that the State failed to prove that the complainant is mentally defective and that the defendant knew she is mentally defective. \u2018We address this argument because if the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction, the Double Jeopardy Clauses of both the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions would preclude a new trial.\u201d <em>State v. Fuller, </em>147 N.H. 210, 213 (2001). In determining whether the evidence was sufficient, however, we consider all the evidence, including the testimony of the complainant that we previously concluded was erroneously admitted; thus, we adopt for purposes of our state constitutional analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the United States Supreme Court\u2019s standard under the Federal Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See Lockhart v. Nelson, </em>488 U.S. 33, 34 (1988) (holding that \u201cwhere the evidence offered by the State and admitted by the trial court \u2014 whether erroneously or not \u2014 would have been sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude retrial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"> \u201cTo prevail on his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. 331, 350 (2005) (quotation omitted). We held in <em>State v. Frost, </em>141 N.H. 493, 497 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">[A] complainant is \u201cmentally defective\u201d within the meaning of RSA 632-A:2, 1(h) only if he or she (1) suffers from a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d and (2) is incapable of freely arriving at an independent choice whether or not to engage in sexual conduct. The second prong addresses a person\u2019s capacity to appraise in a meaningful way the physical nature and consequences of his or her sexual conduct, including its potential to cause pregnancy or disease. The emphasis is on the individual\u2019s <em>capacity </em>\u2014 capacity to learn about physical consequences and to make a decision based on whatever evaluative process the person chooses to employ, as long as the decision is legitimately the person\u2019s own.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The defendant likens this case to <em>State v. Call, </em>139 N.H. 102 (1994), in which we found the evidence insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was mentally defective. He asserts that, as in <em>Call: </em>(1) there was no expert or medical testimony that the complainant is mentally defective within the meaning of the statute; and (2) the complainant\u2019s \u201ctestimony that she resisted [the defendant\u2019s] advances, by telling him to leave her alone and calling out to her mother . . . undercut[s] the State\u2019s claim with regard to the \u2018mentally defective\u2019 element.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">While we took note of the lack of expert or medical testimony \u201cto describe or explain the victim\u2019s mental condition\u201d in <em>Call, id. </em>at 104, we have never required expert testimony on this issue. Rather, the absence of such evidence in <em>Call </em>was just one ground for the conclusion that \u201c[o]n this state of the record alone, nothing indicates that the victim was incapable of legally consenting to the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, there was evidence from the complainant\u2019s mother that she had been born with disabilities, and that she cannot read. Both the mother and nurse testified as to the complainant\u2019s need for assistance with daily activities such as dressing and maintaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>hygiene. Although the mother was not allowed to testify as to the complainant\u2019s medical diagnosis, the evidence demonstrated that her disabilities were mental as well as physical: her attendance at the Moore Center, an organization providing services for people with acquired brain disorders and developmental disabilities, as well as her own testimony which, as we concluded above, failed to establish her competency as a witness, all support a finding that the complainant suffers from a mental disorder or defect. <em>Call, </em>in which the evidence as to the nature of the victim\u2019s disabilities and limitations was apparently less specific, is factually distinguishable. <em>See id. </em>(noting that witnesses testified that victim was \u201chandicapped,\u201d \u201clooked mentally retarded\u201d and that there was \u201csomething mentally wrong\u201d with her).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><em>Call </em>is also factually distinguishable on the issue of resistance to the assault. The evidence in <em>Call </em>indicated that the victim told the defendant to stop and eventually forced him to stop, demonstrating a clear lack of consent and, by negative inference, possession of the capacity to consent. <em>Id. </em>at 103-04. Here, while the complainant testified that she told the defendant \u201cto leave me alone\u201d and tried to call out for her mother, her testimony indicates confusion about the sexual act taking place. She testified that her reaction was, \u201cwhat are you doing? ... And I\u2019m like, why are you trying to make me touch it? Why are you doing that?\u201d On this record, we cannot say that \u201cno rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State,\u201d <em>Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. at 350 (quotation omitted), could have found that the complainant did not have the \u201ccapacity to appraise in a meaningful way the physical nature and consequences of... sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Frost, </em>141 N.H. at 497. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to show that the complainant was mentally defective within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The defendant next contends that even if the State proved the \u201cmentally defective\u201d element, it failed to prove that the defendant knew that the complainant is mentally defective. Generally, a defendant\u2019s culpable mental state is proven through circumstantial evidence, <em>State v. DiNapoli, </em>149 N.H. 514, 516 (2003), and, \u201c[w]hen the evidence is solely circumstantial, it must exclude all rational conclusions except guilt.\u201d <em>Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. at 350. Nevertheless, in employing this standard, \u201cwe still consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and examine each evidentiary item in context, not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The evidence indicated that the defendant had dated the complainant\u2019s mother for nine years, that he was living with them at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>assault and that he would help put the complainant to bed. Thus, we cannot conclude that no rational trier of fact could find that the defendant knew about the complainant\u2019s mental and physical limitations. The defendant nevertheless contends that the State \u201cdid not prove he knew she was incapable of choosing whether or not to engage in sexual conduct.\u201d We disagree. As the State points out, the complainant testified about her confusion at the time of the assault. The State argues that the defendant\u2019s \u201cobservations of her confusion at the pertinent time and his firsthand awareness of her level of impairment, taken in the light most favorable to the State, lead to only one conclusion: that he knew that [the complainant] was mentally defective within the meaning of the statute.\u201d We conclude that the evidence on this point was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b605-4\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
