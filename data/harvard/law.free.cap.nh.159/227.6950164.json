We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">PSNH, the state\u2019s largest public utility, has historically provided electric generation, transmission and distribution services to a majority of New Hampshire residents. <em>Appeal of Pinetree Power, </em>152 N.H. 92, 93 (2005). The instant matter concerns installing a wet flue gas desulphurization system, commonly known as \u201cscrubber technology,\u201d at Merrimack Station in Bow to reduce the facility\u2019s mercury emissions. Merrimack Station, which burns coal to produce electricity, is one of PSNH\u2019s fossil fuel generation assets. <em>See </em>RSA 369-B:3-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">In June 2006, the legislature enacted the Mercury Emissions Program, <em>see </em>RSA 125-0:11-:18 (Supp. 2008), to reduce \u201cmercury emissions at the coal-burning electric power plants in the state as soon as possible.\u201d RSA 125-0:11,1. The program is intended to \u201cprevent, at a minimum, 80 percent of the aggregated mercury content of the coal burned at these plants from being emitted into the air by no later than the year 2013.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">To accomplish this objective, the legislation specifically requires PSNH to install \u201cthe best known commercially available technology ... at Merrimack Station,\u201d which the New Hampshire Department of Environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>mental Services (DES) has determined is the scrubber technology. <em>Id.; </em>RSA 125-0:11, II. DES has determined that this technology \u201cbest balances the procurement, installation, operation and plant efficiency costs with the projected reductions in mercury and other pollutants from the flue gas streams of Merrimack [Station].\u201d RSA 125-0:11, II. According to the legislature, installing the scrubber technology \u201cis in the public interest of the citizens of New Hampshire and the customers of [PSNH].\u201d RSA 125-0:11, VI; <em>see </em>RSA 125-0:12, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">To ensure that PSNH makes \u201can ongoing and steadfast effort ... to implement practicable technological or operational solutions to achieve significant mercury reductions\u201d even before the scrubber technology is constructed and installed, the legislature has provided PSNH with certain economic performance incentives administered by DES. RSA 125-0:11, IV; <em>see </em>RSA 125-0:16. The legislature has stated that the mercury emission reduction requirements set forth in RSA 125-0:11-:18 \u201crepresent a careful, thoughtful balancing of cost, benefits, and technological feasibility\u201d that should be viewed \u201cas an integrated strategy of non-severable components.\u201d RSA 125-0:11, VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">To comply with the Mercury Emissions Program, PSNH must install the scrubber technology and have it operational at Merrimack Station by July 1, 2013. <em>See </em>RSA 125-0:11, I. Meeting \u201cthis requirement,\u201d however, \u201cis contingent upon obtaining all necessary permits and approvals\u201d from the pertinent regulatory agencies. RSA 125-0:13,1. PSNH must report to the legislature annually regarding its installation of the scrubber technology, including \u201cany updated cost information.\u201d RSA 125-0:13, IX. Under RSA 125-0:18, PSNH \u201cshall recover all prudent costs\u201d of installing the scrubber technology \u201cin a manner approved by the [PUC].\u201d Recovery of these costs \u201cshall be . . . via . . . [PSNH\u2019s] default service charge.\u201d RSA 125-0:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In August 2008, the PUC learned from a securities and exchange report filed by PSNH\u2019s parent company that the cost of installing this technology had risen from $250 million to $457 million. Thereafter, the PUC directed PSNH to file \u201ca comprehensive status report on its installation plans,\u201d including \u201ca detailed cost estimate for the project, an analysis of the anticipated effect of the project on energy service rates, and an analysis of the effect on energy service rates if Merrimack Station were not in the mix of fossil and hydro facilities operated in New Hampshire.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 365:5, :19 (1995). Noting a potential conflict between the legislature\u2019s express finding that installing scrubber technology at Merrimack Station is \u201cin the public interest of the citizens of New Hampshire and the customers of [PSNH],\u201d RSA 125-0:11, VI, and RSA 369-B:3-a, which provides that PSNH may modify its fossil and hydro generation assets <em>only </em>if the PUC finds that it is \u201cin the public interest of retail customers of PSNH to do so,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the PUC also directed PSNH to file a legal memorandum about the extent of the PUC\u2019s authority with respect to the scrubber project. The PUC invited the New Hampshire Office of the Consumer Advocate to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In September 2008, the PUC decided \u201cthat, as a result of the Legislature\u2019s mandate that [PSNH] . . . install scrubber technology by a date certain, and its finding pursuant to RSA 125-0:11 that such installation... is in the public interest . . . , the [PUC] lacks the authority to make a determination pursuant to RSA 369-B:3-a as to whether this particular modification is in the public interest.\u201d The PUC ruled that its authority was \u201climited to determining at a later time the prudence of the costs of complying with the requirements of RSA 125-0:11-18 and the manner of recovery for prudent costs.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 125-0:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">After the PUC issued its order, the petitioners, whom the PUC had neither directed nor invited to participate in its effort to determine its authority over the scrubber project, moved for a rehearing, asserting standing as commercial ratepayers. PSNH objected. The PUC ruled, however, that the petitioners did have standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">The Commercial Ratepayers . . . may be affected financially by changes in PSNH\u2019s default energy service rate either as customers taking default energy service, or as customers of competitive electric suppliers. The electric supply market in PSNH\u2019s service territory is influenced by PSNH\u2019s default service rate because that rate is the backstop for all other competitive offerings. If PSNH\u2019s default service rate increases, competitive offerings may also increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The PUC denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\n<em>II. Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">A party seeking to set aside an order of the PUC has the burden of demonstrating that the order is contrary to law or, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that the order is unjust or unreasonable. RSA 541:13 (2007); <em>see Appeal of Verizon New England, </em>153 N.H. 50, 56 (2005). Findings of fact by the PUC are presumed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. RSA 541:13; <em>see Verizon, </em>153 N.H. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">\n<em>B. Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">PSNH argues that we should dismiss this appeal because the petitioners lack standing to bring it because the injury they allege, future increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>electrical costs as a result of the scrubber project, is neither immediate nor direct. <em>See Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights, </em>142 N.H. 629, 632 (1998). The petitioners counter that they have standing: \u201cAs ratepayers for electricity generated by [PSNH], [they] will be directly affected by the materially increased costs of installation of scrubber technology at Merrimack Station, and by the [PUC\u2019s] Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">A party\u2019s standing is a question of subject matter jurisdiction, which may be addressed at any time. <em>Libertarian Party of N.H. v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>158 N.H. 194, 195 (2008). To have standing to appeal an administrative agency decision to this court, a party must demonstrate that his rights \u201cmay be directly affected by the decision, or in other words, that he has suffered or will suffer an injury in fact.\u201d <em>Appeal of Richards, </em>134 N.H. 148, 154 (quotations and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 899 (1991); <em>see </em>RSA 541:3 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>Appeal of Richards, </em>we addressed in depth the issue of standing to appeal a PUC decision. In that case, the petitioners were ratepayers, who challenged the PUC\u2019s decision to approve a rate plan. <em>Appeal of Richards, </em>134 N.H. at 151. They argued that because \u201cthe rate increases that will be imposed upon them as a result of the PUC\u2019s approval of the rate plan constitute^] an injury in fact,\u201d they had standing to appeal the PUC\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 156 (quotation omitted). We agreed that this \u201cdirect economic injury\u201d was sufficient to confer standing upon the ratepayers. <em>Id. </em>at 156-57. We stated: \u201cCourts in other jurisdictions have held that ratepayers are directly affected by rate decisions and, thus, have standing to challenge them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In contrast, the appeal in <em>Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights </em>did not concern a rate plan. In that case, we held that the ratepayers lacked standing to appeal the PUC\u2019s decision to approve special contracts between PSNH and certain industrial customers. <em>Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights, </em>142 N.H. at 632. We concluded that the ratepayers lacked standing because they did not suffer any immediate or direct injury. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]ny potential injury would arise only through increased rates imposed during a subsequent ratesetting proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The appeal in this case, like the appeal in <em>Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights, </em>is not an appeal of a rate plan. It concerns the PUC\u2019s interpretation of statutes that are unrelated to a rate plan. Here, as in <em>Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights, </em>any potential injury the petitioners may suffer would arise only in a subsequent rate setting proceeding. <em>See </em>RSA 125-0:18 (Supp. 2008) (PSNH \u201cshall be allowed to recover all prudent costs\u201d of installing the scrubber technology \u201cin a manner approved by the [PUC],\u201d and recovery of these costs \u201cshall be ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>via... [PSNH\u2019s] default service charge\u201d). Such future harm is insufficient, as a matter of law, to confer standing upon the petitioners to appeal the PUC\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
