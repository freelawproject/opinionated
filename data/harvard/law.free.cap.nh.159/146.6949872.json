We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">The record supports the following. S.G. is the natural mother of two minor children: Zachary G. and Kandace G. The New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) filed petitions in March 2004 (the 2004 petitions) alleging that Zachary was abused and that Zachary and Kandace were neglected. <em>See </em>RSA 169-C:3,11(d), XIX (2002). Among other things, the petitions alleged repeated physical abuse of Zachary by A.G. (Zachary\u2019s father and S.G.\u2019s husband) and S.G.\u2019s failure to protect Zachary and Kandace from A.G.\u2019s violent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">.The Claremont District Court approved a consent order in May 2004, entered findings of abuse and neglect, granted DCYF legal supervision of the children, prohibited visitation with the father, and required S.G. to undergo psychological and parenting evaluations. The court issued a dispositional order in June 2004 allowing the children to remain in S.G.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>custody under DCYF supervision. The court ordered S.G. to \u201cmaintain a safe and sanitary home\u201d and A.G. to \u201cundergo a batterers evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">After a review hearing in September 2004, the court commended S.G. for \u201ckeeping her home safe and clean\u201d and being \u201creceptive [to suggested] parenting strategies.\u201d It noted, however, that S.G. \u201chas shown that she is unable to keep potentially harmful men out of her life.\u201d The court ordered out-of-home foster care placement for the children and required S.G. to undergo further parental counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The court held another review hearing in December 2004 and found that, although S.G. demonstrated continuing commitment to maintaining the home and developing as a parent, she continued \u201chaving difficulty] . . . keeping inappropriate men out of her home\u201d and refused \u201cto accept any responsibility for the children being removed from her care.\u201d It further noted that A.G. had been on S.G.\u2019s \u201cproperty at least 5 times despite a protective order instructing him to stay away from the residence.\u201d The court ordered S.G. to continue counseling. The court made similar findings and rulings following a March 2005 review hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Over the following months, counselors and professionals working with S.G. made several observations calling into doubt her ability to keep abusive men out of her children\u2019s lives. In a June 2005 addendum to an earlier assessment report, Familystrength counselor Phyllis Ranta noted that S.G. remained hesitant to admit that A.G. abused Zachary, even when confronted with photographs of Zachary\u2019s bruises. Ranta further noted that S.G.\u2019s \u201ccurrent belief that she now truly understands why [A.G.] should not see the children is to be viewed cautiously\u201d in view of her past \u201ccycle of understanding\u201d that inevitably lapses \u201cback to her initial thinking pattern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">A September 2005 report from the guardian ad litem (GAL) indicated that S.G. \u201cdid not feel that it should be her responsibility to keep the children away from their father.\u201d The GAL also found \u201cit . . . highly probable that if the children are returned to [S.G.] she will allow contact between them and [A.G.].\u201d She therefore recommended terminating the parental rights of both parents. As a result, DCYF urged termination of parental rights and adoption as the permanent plan at a September 2005 permanency hearing. The court, however, rejected this plan in October 2005. It ordered DCYF to begin gradual reunification. The court later granted DCYF\u2019s motion to close the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">In October 2006, DCYF filed new petitions for abuse and neglect (the 2006 petitions) against A.G. and S.G. alleging that from June through October 2006, A.G. abused Zachary in S.G.\u2019s home. In January 2007, the Claremont Family Division issued orders of protection after it found that A.G. abused Zachary and that S.G. neglected both children. Specifically, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>found that A.G. resided with the children in S.G.\u2019s home in contravention of previous orders, that A.G. slapped Zachary while in the home and that S.G. knowingly allowed A.G. in the home without taking necessary precautions to ensure Zachary\u2019s safety. The children were placed with a relative. After a February 2007 dispositional hearing, the family division ordered out-of-home foster care placement because of S.G.\u2019s failure to correct the conditions leading to its findings of abuse and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">DCYF petitioned the family division in May 2007 to terminate A.G.\u2019s and S.G.\u2019s parental rights. It referenced the 2004 and 2007 findings of neglect and cited as grounds for termination S.G.\u2019s failure \u201cto correct the conditions leading to the May . . . 2004 finding of neglect despite reasonable efforts under the supervision of the district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">After a February 2008 permanency hearing, the family division ruled that both parents failed to correct the conditions leading to the findings of abuse and neglect. It found that twelve months had passed since the January 2007 finding of neglect against S.G. and that DCYF made reasonable efforts to reunify S.G. and her children. It relieved DCYF from making future efforts towards reunification. Finally, it ordered DCYF to petition for termination of parental rights. DCYF, however, appears not to have filed a petition for termination following the permanency hearing because its May 2007 petition was still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Prior to the family division\u2019s termination hearing, S.G. moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude from the hearing any \u201cattemptO to show that [S.G.] has failed to correct the conditions leading to the May . . . 2004 finding of neglect\u201d because implicit in closing the 2004 case \u201cwas that [S.G.] had met the goals and corrected the conditions that led to the finding of neglect.\u201d The court deferred ruling on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The five-day termination hearing commenced on February 29, 2008, and concluded on June 11, 2008. In its decision, the family division first noted that A.G.\u2019s voluntary relinquishment of parental rights mooted DCYF\u2019s petitions relating to him. It then denied S.G.\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Considering all of the evidence concerning both actions, it ordered termination of S.G.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">On appeal, S.G. argues that the trial court erred by denying her motion <em>in limine. </em>S.G. further challenges the statutory grounds for termination and the sufficiency of evidence supporting the family division\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\n<em>I. Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Before the court may involuntarily terminate parental rights, \u201cthe petitioning party must prove a statutory ground for termination,\u201d <em>In re Antonio W., </em>147 N.H. 408, 412 (2002), and the court \u201cmust consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>whether [termination] is in the child\u2019s best interest,\u201d <em>In re Matthew G., </em>124 N.H. 414, 416 (1983); <em>see </em>RSA 170-C:1 (2002). DCYF called several witnesses at the termination hearing to relate observations from the first abuse and neglect action. Some -witnesses gave opinion testimony in view of evidence from both actions. S.G. contends that the family division erred by denying her motion <em>in limine </em>because collateral and judicial estoppel preclude reconsideration of any such evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\n<em>A. Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"> \u201cSpurred by considerations of judicial economy and a policy of certainty and finality in our legal system, the doctrine[] of . . . collateral estoppel [has] been established to avoid repetitive litigation so that at some point litigation over a particular controversy must come to an end.\u201d <em>Cook v. Sullivan, </em>149 N.H. 774, 777 (2003) (quotation omitted). Thus, \u201c[t]he doctrine ... bars a party to a prior action ... from relitigating any issue or fact actually litigated and determined in the prior action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 778 (quotation omitted). The burden of proving estoppel is on the party asserting it. <em>Appeal of Stanton, </em>147 N.H. 724, 730 (2002). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling unless unsupported by the evidence or legally erroneous. <em>Cardinal Dev. Corp. v. Town of Winchester Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>157 N.H. 710, 715 (2008).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">Three basic conditions must ... be satisfied before collateral estoppel will arise: the issue subject to estoppel must be identical in each action, the first action must have resolved the issue finally on the merits, and the party to be estopped must have appeared as a party in the first action ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\"><em>Cook, </em>149 N.H. at 778 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">S.G. has satisfied her burden of demonstrating these three conditions. There is no dispute that DCYF appeared in the first action and that the relevant issue \u2014 whether S.G. corrected the conditions leading to the 2004 finding of neglect by no longer exposing the children to violent, abusive men \u2014 is germane to both actions. Although that issue was never resolved by an express finding, necessarily implied by the October 2005 order to reunify is a finding, on the merits in a now closed action, that the children \u201cwill not be endangered in the manner adjudicated on the initial petition, if returned home,\u201d RSA 169-C:23, II (2002) (listing prerequisites to reunification). <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 comment <em>j </em>at 261 (1982) (giving preclusive effect to an \u201cissue . . . recognized by the parties as important and by the trier as necessary to the first judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">That S.G. has successfully demonstrated the three conditions of collateral estoppel does not end our inquiry. While we do not accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>DCYF\u2019s broad contention that collateral estoppel does not apply in termination of parental rights proceedings, on occasion we do relax preclusive doctrines, \u201ceven where issues are identical, [if the] potential adverse impact on the public interest... warrants] relitigation.\u201d <em>McNair v. McNair, </em>151 N.H. 843, 353 (2004) (quotation omitted); <em>cf. </em>RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF Judgments \u00a7 28(5) (permitting relitigation of issue where \u201c[t]here is a clear and convincing need for a new determination... because of the potential adverse impact ... on the . . . interests of persons not themselves parties in the initial action . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Given the overriding need to ensure that the children\u2019s best interests are properly protected, <em>see </em>RSA 170-C:1 (2002), and the fact that RSA chapter 170-C broadly admits all \u201crelevant and material information ... to the extent of its probative value,\u201d RSA 170-C:10 (2002), we hold that collateral estoppel is no bar to reconsidering evidence from an earlier action if there exist subsequent and recent incidents of abuse and neglect substantially similar to those in the earlier, closed action. <em>See In re Interest of V.B., </em>370 N.W.2d 119, 121-22 (Neb. 1985); <em>Matter of Newman, </em>619 P.2d 901, 904-06 (Or. Ct. App. 1980), <em>review denied, </em>290 Or. 449 (1981); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a727 comment c at 253; <em>cf. Sheehy v. Sheehy, </em>88 N.H. 223, 226 (1936) (recognizing that res judicata bars subsequent custody determinations absent material change in circumstances). Consequently, collateral estoppel did not preclude consideration of evidence concerning the earlier, closed action because, after its closure, the condition leading to the 2004 findings of neglect \u2014 exposure of the children to violent, abusive men \u2014 again manifested and resulted in new incidents of abuse and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>B. Judicial Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The family division did not unsustainably exercise its discretion by rejecting S.G.\u2019s judicial estoppel argument. <em>See Kelleher v. Marvin Lumber &amp; Cedar Co., </em>152 N.H. 813, 848 (2005). The doctrine of judicial estoppel protects judicial integrity by \u201cpreventing] a party from prevailing in one phase of a case using one argument and then relying upon a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\u201d <em>Pike v. Mullikin, </em>158 N.H. 267, 270 (2009). We doubt whether DCYF could ever be judicially estopped by assertions in a child protective proceeding resulting in reunification if such reunification ultimately proves antithetical to the children\u2019s best interests. Even assuming judicial estoppel could somehow apply, S.G. failed to establish that, by initiating termination proceedings, DCYF took a position \u201cclearly inconsistent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 270, with its earlier motion to close the 2004 petitions given the intervening incidents of abuse and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\n<em>II. Construction and Application of RSA chapter 170-C</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">S.G. next contends that the family division misapplied RSA 170-C:5, III, the statutory grounds for termination relied upon in this action. She further argues that insufficient evidence supported the family division\u2019s findings that she failed to correct conditions leading to a finding of neglect and that termination was in the children\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>A. Grounds for Termination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">We begin by addressing S.G.\u2019s arguments concerning RSA 170-C:5, III. The elements of RSA 170-C:5, III must be proven \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Robert H., </em>118 N.H. 713, 716 (1978), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by In re Craig T., </em>147 N.H. 739, 744-45 (2002). We will not disturb the family division\u2019s finding unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Antonio W., </em>147 N.H. at 412.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">This court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. In interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. Furthermore, we interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. We do not consider legislative history to construe a statute that is clear on its face.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-10\"><em>State v. Balukas, </em>155 N.H. 377, 378-79 (2007) (citations omitted). RSA 170-C:5, III provides for termination where \u201c[t]he parents, subsequent to a finding of child neglect or abuse under RSA 169-C, have failed to correct the conditions leading to such a finding within 12 months of the finding despite reasonable efforts under the direction of the district court to rectify the conditions.\u201d Thus, in order to rely upon RSA 170-C:5, III as grounds for termination, DCYF must demonstrate: (1) a finding of child neglect or abuse under RSA chapter 169-C; (2) a failure to correct the same within twelve months of the finding; and (3) reasonable efforts to correct the condition provided under the direction of the court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">DCYF specified S.G.\u2019s failure to correct the conditions leading to the <em>2001 </em>findings as grounds for termination, and the family division terminated S.G.\u2019s parental rights based upon this allegation. We agree that this was error. RSA 170-C:5, III clearly imports the procedural safeguards and substantive requirements of RSA chapter 169-C. Relying exclusively upon the 2004 findings under RSA 170-C:5, III is tantamount to bypassing RSA chapter 169-C in the termination action by premising the termination petition upon stale RSA chapter 169-C findings of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>While DCYF\u2019s allegation improperly cited the 2004 findings of neglect as grounds for termination, the error was one of form and we will not frustrate the purpose of RSA chapter 170-C by elevating form over substance. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gallagher, </em>157 N.H. 421, 425 (2008); <em>cf. In re Robyn W., </em>124 N.H. 377, 381 (1983) (declining to treat as jurisdictional the court\u2019s failure to observe sixty-day period for the disposition of parental rights termination petition). DCYF complied with RSA 170-C:5, III by obtaining the 2007 findings of abuse and neglect prior to initiating the termination action. It also cited the 2007 findings in its termination petitions and detailed in its allegations how the same behavioral pattern resulted in both the 2004 and 2007 findings. Finally, the substance of the family division\u2019s ruling \u2014 that, beyond a reasonable doubt, S.G. failed to keep violent, abusive men away from Zachary and Kandace \u2014 applies to the 2004 <em>and </em>2007 findings because they were the product of the same <em>condition. See </em>RSA 170-C:5, III (providing termination warranted for failure \u201cto correct the <em>conditions </em>leading to\u201d finding of neglect (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"> S.G. next argues that the termination petitions were premature. While we agree that DCYF\u2019s May 2007 petitions to terminate S.G.\u2019s parental rights were premature because, when filed, twelve months had not elapsed since the January 2007 findings of neglect, we reject S.G.\u2019s argument because she in fact received twelve months to correct the conditions. <em>Cf. McIntire v. Lee, </em>149 N.H. 160, 167 (2003) (noting that judgment will not be disturbed where court can see from entire record that no injury has been done); <em>In re Billy T., </em>124 N.H. 576, 579 (1984) (affirming termination of parental rights because no prejudice suffered by untimely disposition and to allow relitigation antithetical to interest of child). The family division neither began the termination hearing nor issued a termination decree until twelve months after the January 2007 findings of neglect. Furthermore, the family division found that DCYF made reasonable efforts towards reunification during this twelve-month period and S.G. does not challenge this finding. We therefore turn to the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the sufficiency of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The court ordered termination based upon a lack of reasonable assurance that S.G. corrected the children\u2019s exposure to violent, abusive men. Its order was based upon the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Gail Colpas related her observations while assisting S.G. as an assessment worker for DCYF in both the 2004 and 2006 actions. She observed Zachary\u2019s bruising in 2004, contacted police after S.G. informed her that A.G. caused it, and counseled S.G. about the need to keep A.G. away from the children. Colpas filed the 2006 petitions after Zachary informed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>that A.G. hit him in their home. She further testified that Kandace witnessed the incident. Although S.G. took the children to the police department following this incident, Colpas testified that S.G. was unwilling to provide police with information about A.G.\u2019s employment or residence. When Colpas asked S.G. why she did not remove A.G. from the home, S.G. responded: \u201c[T]he best way to handle it is just to ignore him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Stuart Scott worked with Zachary and Kandace as a reunification worker for the Claremont District Office of DCYF between the spring of 2004 and the fall of 2006. He believed S.G. and A.G. \u201cwere in very close contact throughout the ease, despite orders of protection and despite what both sides were telling [him].\u201d Equally troubling was that, while regularly in the home to help S.G., Scott encountered O.L., a live-in boyfriend of S.G., who he believed was not safe to have around the children. This was because Zachary once indicated that O.L. caused bruising on his forehead by lifting him into the ceiling fan. Scott testified about another incident involving O.L. throwing a suitcase at Zachary. Scott also testified about an unannounced visit where he found O.L. home alone with the children despite an order of protection against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">While Scott acknowledged that S.G. was actively involved in counseling programs, he harbored concerns about her progress because she \u201ccontinued to not understand why so much was asked of her\u201d and disputed that she had done anything wrong. He testified that \u201c[s]he would never take responsibility for her involvement in the case.\u201d While Scott at one point changed his opinion in favor of reunification because S.G. was doing well with parenting classes, he changed his mind after S.G. told him that she \u201chad been telling her therapist things that the therapist had wanted to hear, and she didn\u2019t really believe in what was going on with therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Child Protective Service Worker Amanda Cutter became involved with the case around November 2005 when the children were in the process of reunification. She had concerns about reunification because, based upon statements made by S.G., Cutter believed that S.G. still \u201cfelt strongly that [A.G.] could continue or should see the children.\u201d Nevertheless, Cutter ultimately moved to close the first case. After the first action was closed, Cutter received a call from Zachary\u2019s therapist because Zachary was again seeing A.G. She later became involved in this action and conceded at the final hearing that reunification may have compromised the children\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Dr. Kathleen Corcoran, a child therapist who specializes in treating children with post-trauma reactions, worked with Zachary starting in August or September 2006. Zachary \u201cpresented -with moderate to severe PTSD, primarily hypervigilance; worried about his safety; was looking for danger around every corner; difficulty sleeping; impulsivity; nightmares; all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>kinds of worries; low self-esteem.\u201d Corcoran explained the negative influ- \u2022 ence of A.G.\u2019s presence in the home. She testified that Zachary avoided sleeping near windows for fear \u201cthat his dad was going to come in through the window in the middle of the night.\u201d In her opinion, remaining at home with risk of exposure to A.G. was of great concern given Zachary\u2019s continuing fear and his statement \u201cthat his mother was supposed to protect him from being harmed and that she was not able to do so.\u201d Concerning future contact with A.G., she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">My concern with Zach has been he has said that he feels like he can\u2019t trust anyone to protect him. He had wished that his mother would protect him but she didn\u2019t; that he\u2019s been so angry at his father that he wanted him to die; and that he \u2014 it\u2019s very hard for him to feel safe ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Sally Avery, parent aide for Southwestern Community Services, worked with S.G. on parenting strategies beginning around May 2007. Even though S.G. had made progress in her opinion, Avery still had concerns about the children\u2019s safety and S.G.\u2019s ability to recognize the emotional and physical harm abusive men can visit upon Zachary and Kandace.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">CPSW Mark Simino began working as the case manager in May or June of 2007. He testified that S.G. made progress in parenting strategies up to August 2007. He then began having reservations about unsupervised visits, and in mid-December he saw A.G. enter S.G.\u2019s apartment building. Finally, Simono explained that although DCYF\u2019s original plan for S.G. was reunification, DCYF later switched to termination and adoption as the permanency plan because he still could not \u201cstate or justify that these kids will not be harmed in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The GAL, who was first appointed in the summer of 2005, testified that S.G. said early in the case that she believed the children should have a relationship with their father, and that she needed A.G. \u201cbecause he was someone who could control Zachary.\u201d At a December 2005 meeting, during the period of reunification in the first action, S.G. left whether the children would see A.G. up to the GAL. At a team meeting convened after Simino observed A.G. entering S.G.\u2019s apartment building, the GAL recommended visitation between S.G. and the children occur outside S.G.\u2019s home for fear that Zachary would see A.G. In response, S.G. \u201cstood up and swore and stomped out of the meeting and said, no way, I have my rights.\u201d The GAL found this reaction troubling because it again demonstrated S.G.\u2019s failure to appreciate the importance of protecting Zachary over \u201cher rights and her inconvenience at having visits elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Although S.G. is now divorced from A.G. and claims to recognize the threat he poses to the children, other witnesses described several recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>occasions of seeing A.G. and S.G. together, including testimony that A.G. began coming to S.G.\u2019s apartment in February 2008 and had been there every day and night.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">This evidence supports the family division\u2019s finding that S.G. had, beyond a reasonable doubt, failed to correct the conditions leading to the findings of neglect. <em>See </em>RSA 170-C:5, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>B. Best Interests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">After the court finds statutory grounds for termination, it must further consider whether termination is in the children\u2019s best interest. <em>See Antonio W., </em>147 N.H. at 412. The children\u2019s welfare is the \u201cdominant consideration..., which must prevail over the interests of the parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe conclusion of what is in the child\u2019s best interest is not an evidentiary fact, however, and is not required to be established by the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re Shannon M., </em>146 N.H. 22, 28 (2001) (quotation omitted). \u201cRather, the conclusion concerns which of the possible alternative dispositional orders is the most desirable, under a standard giving priority to the assumed interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s finding unless unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Antonio W., </em>147 N.H. at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">With respect to the children\u2019s best interests, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">These children, whose ages are 90 months and 70 months, have been in placement about 36 months, over forty and fifty [percent], respectively, of their entire lives. There is an open neglect case against [S.G.] There was no suggestion during the five days of hearings in this matter that the children might be returned to her in the near future. They need and deserve stability and freedom from fear in order to thrive and become productive and happy adolescents and adults. They have waited long enough for that promise to be delivered upon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The evidence sufficiently supported this finding. Zachary and Kandace had been in multiple out of home placements for a prolonged period. Corcoran concluded Zachary was \u201cgoing to need years in a very safe, very nurturing environment before he can really calm down and settle down and feel safe.\u201d Although Corcoran conceded that terminating S.G.\u2019s parental rights would trigger a grieving process, she ultimately noted that permanency was paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-12\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
