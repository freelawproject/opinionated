He appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by admitting evidence that he was addicted to heroin. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. Around noon on July 5, 2006, fourteen-year-old David Smith was home alone sleeping when he heard a knock on the slider door. He woke up, opened the slider, and saw his neighbor, Stuart Markham, the defendant\u2019s stepson, walking away. Thinking Markham merely wanted to play catch, Smith went back to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Approximately thirty minutes later, Smith heard his dog barking, and as he looked out his bedroom door, he saw someone dressed completely in black, bending down at the slider door. A minute or two later, he heard banging at the door and heard someone calling his dog by name. Thinking it was someone he knew, Smith emerged from his bedroom and saw a man standing in his kitchen. He described the man as clean-shaven, short-haired, standing 5 10 or 5 11, between thirty-five and forty years old and with tattoos of black flames on his forearms and neck. The man told Smith that he had let himself into the house because he had seen someone <em>else </em>trying to break in and he had wanted to let the homeowner know. After about two minutes, the man left and walked into the woods behind the house. Smith noticed that the back door, which was next to the slider, had been ripped off of its hinges; nothing was missing from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The police were called and began investigating immediately. One officer, while walking around the neighborhood, noticed the defendant\u2019s stepson watching him and talking on a cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Within a day or two of the incident, the police gave the media Smith\u2019s description of the intruder. After the news broadcast, the defendant called a friend and asked if he knew a good tattoo artist who could cover up tattoos. The police also received an e-mail from Nicole Irvine, a friend of the defendant\u2019s wife, Kathy Markham-Costello. Irvine testified that, in July 2006, Markham-Costello had called and asked if she could \u201chide out\u201d at Irvine\u2019s house. The police followed every lead arising from the media broadcast and eliminated all suspects except the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">When the police spoke to the defendant, he told them he had been at home on July 5,2006, and had not gone to Smith\u2019s house. He did, however, tell the police he was in the area where the suspect disappeared into the woods behind Smith\u2019s house, but said he was looking for his stepson. He also said he knew the police were looking for a person with tattoos who had entered a nearby property.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The grand jury indicted the defendant for burglary. <em>See </em>RSA 635:1. His wife was charged with hindering apprehension, a charge to which she eventually pled guilty. That charge alleged that on July 5, Markham-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Costello concealed the defendant in the trunk of her car so as to prevent the police from discovering him. In a recorded interview, Markham-Costello told the police that on the afternoon of July 5, she and the defendant were home with her father when, at some point, the defendant left the house to check the mail. When she next saw the defendant, he \u201ccame running into the house, all excited, out of breath and sweaty.\u201d The defendant hid in the trunk of their car as she drove from the house so the police could not find him. Markham-Costello saw police in the area and knew \u201csomething bad happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">At trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to introduce evidence that the defendant was a heroin addict. The State argued that this evidence was admissible to show that the defendant entered Smith\u2019s home with the intent to commit a crime therein, an element of burglary. <em>See </em>RSA 635:1. The State contended that this evidence, coupled with evidence that, at the time of the crime, the defendant was unemployed, would be relevant to show that he entered Smith\u2019s home with the intent to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court allowed the State to introduce the evidence through the testimony of his wife. Markham-Costello testified that, in July 2006, the defendant was addicted to heroin. She told the jury that he was \u201cusually broke\u201d because they had \u201ctwo habits to support.\u201d She testified that in July 2006, the defendant had a heroin \u201cproblem.\u201d She also confirmed that she had told the police on August 3,2006, that the defendant was out of the house and that she thought he was \u201cusing.\u201d Additionally, although she told the jury she was lying when she spoke to police, the jury heard a tape recording of her telling the police that in July 2006, the defendant had recently lost his job and that she supported him financially. Further, she testified that the defendant \u201cis never clean-shaven. Junkies don\u2019t even like to shower, they are not going to get the razor out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In light of this evidence, the trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">You may consider this evidence for the narrow purpose of deciding whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the motive of the defendant in connection with the burglary crime charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">If you believe that the defendant committed the prior illegal act or acts in question, then you may use that evidence in deciding whether the State has met its burden of proof in establishing the motive element of the crime charged; that is, that the defendant entered the pertinent premises with a purpose to commit the crime of theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">You may not, however, use this evidence for any other purpose. Specifically, you may not consider this to be evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>defendant\u2019s character or as proof that the defendant was disposed to commit the crime charged. The defendant\u2019s character is not at issue in this case. Keep in mind that it is your duty \u2014 that your duty is to decide whether the State has proven that the defendant committed the particular crime charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The sole issue for our review is whether admitting evidence that the defendant was a heroin addict at the time of the alleged burglary violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b). We review the trial court\u2019s decision for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 276 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Rule 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The purpose of Rule 404(b) is to ensure that the defendant is tried on the merits of the crime as charged and to prevent a conviction based upon evidence of other crimes or wrongs. <em>State v. Kim, </em>153 N.H. 322, 326 (2006). The evidence must satisfy a three-part test to be admissible under Rule 404(b): (1) the evidence must be relevant for a purpose other than proving the defendant\u2019s character or disposition; (2) there must be clear proof that the defendant committed the act; and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The State bears the burden of demonstrating the admissibility of the prior bad acts. <em>Id. </em>at 327. Here, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to the first and third prongs of the Rule 404(b) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">To meet its burden under the first prong, the State must demonstrate the relevancy of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 326. This requires the State to \u201carticulate the precise chain of reasoning by which the offered evidence will tend to prove or disprove an issue actually in dispute, without relying upon forbidden inferences of predisposition, character, or propensity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327. That chain of reasoning must demonstrate \u201ca sufficient logical connection\u201d between the prior acts and the permissible purpose for which the State offers the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Here, the defendant was charged with burglary, which required the State to prove unauthorized entry with intent to commit a crime therein. <em>See </em>RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>635:1; <em>State v. Collins, </em>133 N.H. 609, 617 (1990). The State contends that the defendant\u2019s heroin addiction was relevant to show that he entered Smith\u2019s home with the motive to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u201cMotive has been defined as supplying the reason that nudges the will and prods the mind to indulge in criminal intent.\u201d <em>Kim, </em>153 N.H. at 328. Whether a defendant\u2019s drug addiction is relevant to show motive to steal is an issue of first impression. Courts that have addressed this issue are divided. <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence of Accused\u2019s Drug Addiction or Use to Show Motive for Theft of Property Other Than Drugs, </em>2 A.L.R. 4th 1298 (1980 &amp; Supp. 2008). Some courts bar the State from introducing evidence of habitual drug use to prove a motive to steal, <em>see, e.g., State v. Mazowski, </em>766 A.2d 1176, 1180 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001) (rejecting State\u2019s assertion that \u201c[b]ecause defendant is a drug addict, ... he is constantly in need of money, he cannot hold onto money, and thus he has a \u2018motive\u2019 to commit crimes\u201d), while others allow it, <em>see, e.g., State v. Henness, </em>679 N.E.2d 686, 694 (Ohio) (\u201cAppellant\u2019s drug addiction and use shows his need for money and, hence, his motive to steal and kill.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 971 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We addressed a related issue in <em>State v. Monroe, </em>142 N.H. 857 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1073 (1999). In <em>Monroe, </em>the defendant sought to show that his son had a motive to kill the victim by presenting evidence of his son\u2019s past drug use. <em>Monroe, </em>142 N.H. at 870. The trial court ruled that this evidence was inadmissible because it was irrelevant, and we agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 871. On appeal, the defendant argued that evidence of his son\u2019s drug use was relevant to show the son\u2019s motive to commit murder. <em>Id. </em>at 871-72. We concluded that absent a \u201csufficient nexus between [the son\u2019s] use of drugs and a motive to murder [the victim], . . . evidence of drug use would only serve as evidence of [the son\u2019s] character or disposition, which is forbidden by Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 872. We did not, however, specify the kind of evidence that would establish a \u201csufficient nexus\u201d between a defendant\u2019s drug use and a motive to commit the alleged crime. We therefore look to other jurisdictions that employ a similar test for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">As a number of courts have recognized, before concluding that there is a logical connection between a defendant\u2019s addiction and his motive to commit a crime, there must first be reason to believe that the defendant was indeed the perpetrator. <em>See State v. LeFever, </em>690 P.2d 574, 578 (Wash. 1984) (en banc), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Collins, </em>771 P.2d 350 (Wash. 1989); <em>see also People v. Cardenas, </em>647 P.2d 569, 575-76 (Cal. 1982) (reversing robbery conviction because lack of credible identification made it \u201creasonably probable that the jury made its determination of guilt based on appellant\u2019s status as a heroin addict... rather than on evidence connecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>him to the crimes\u201d). In an analogous situation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed whether a defendant\u2019s continued poverty was relevant to prove motive to commit a bank robbery. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>172 F.3d 1104, 1106 (9th Cir. 1999). In <em>Mitchell, </em>a bank was robbed at gunpoint. <em>Id. </em>at 1105. The only issue at trial was whether Mitchell was the person who robbed the bank or was mistakenly identified. <em>Id. </em>Because the prosecution\u2019s evidence of identity was weak, it sought to prove that Mitchell was poor to show that he had a motive to rob the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 1106. Although the prosecution was able to prove his poverty leading up to the robbery, evidence also showed that he remained poor after the robbery. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, because poverty is not a \u201cbad act,\u201d the court did not conduct a Rule 404(b) analysis, but rather concluded that the evidence of poverty, without more, was simply not relevant. <em>Id. </em>Quoting Professor Wigmore, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">\u201cThe lack of money by A might be relevant enough to show the probability of A\u2019s desiring to commit a crime in order to obtain money. But the practical result of such a doctrine would be to put a poor person under so much unfair suspicion and at such a relative disadvantage that for reasons of fairness this argument has seldom been countenanced as evidence of the graver crimes, particularly those of violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1108 (quoting II WIGMORE, Evidence \u00a7392 (Chadbourne rev. 1979)). Because the evidence of poverty tended to suggest that Mitchell was the unknown bank robber, the court concluded that the evidence was of \u201cnegligible probative value,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1110, noting that it had little tendency to make it more probable that he was the thief as \u201calmost everyone, poor or not, has a motive to get more money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109. As the court recognized, poverty and addiction have distinctly different effects upon an individual\u2019s restraint and desires, but the court\u2019s reasoning is nonetheless apropos in cases of addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Where the State seeks to introduce drug addiction without first establishing a defendant\u2019s identity as the culprit, his drug addiction has no relevance or probative value as to the motive of an otherwise unknown culprit. In other words, without a sufficient identification of the defendant as the intruder, the necessary chain of reasoning breaks and we need not reach the relationship between drug addiction and motive. In the absence of some identification of the defendant as the intruder, his heroin addiction, though introduced to show motive, would necessarily fill in the missing logical gaps that Rule 404(b) requires a prosecutor to fill. <em>See Gould v. State, </em>579 P.2d 535, 539 (Alaska 1978) (introduction of heroin addiction to provide motive of robber when identity is hotly contested \u201ctoo attenuated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>and possesses] too many gaps\u201d (quotation omitted)). The resulting inference imparted to the jury is: because the defendant is a drug addict he has the general intent to steal, and because drug addicts steal, it is safe to conclude that this particular drug addict is the unknown culprit in this case. Such reasoning allows the impermissible inference of propensity that the rules of evidence are designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Our decision in <em>Kim, </em>as well as cases from other states, reveals that when courts have allowed a prior bad act to be introduced to prove motive, the prosecution actually presented sufficient alternate evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s identity as the perpetrator. <em>Kim, </em>153 N.H. at 325, 328 (holding evidence of defendant\u2019s gambling losses and extramarital affair admissible to show motive to kill when he admitted to police that he drugged and robbed murder victims, but claimed he did not kill them); <em>see State v. Carapezza, </em>191 P.3d 256, 261, 263 (Kan. 2008) (holding crack cocaine addiction admissible to prove motive to kill and rob when accomplice identified defendant and defendant\u2019s cell mates testified she had admitted her actions); <em>Adkins v. Com., </em>96 S.W.3d 779, 783-85, 793 (Ky. 2003) (affirming introduction of drug addiction to prove motive for robbery and murder when defendant admitted to being at victim\u2019s house and substantial physical evidence linked him to the murder); <em>Henness, </em>679 N.E.2d at 694 (holding drug addiction admissible to show motive to rob and kill when defendant had the victim\u2019s car, check book, and credit cards, told his wife and a friend that he had killed the victim in self-defense, sold the car to a drug dealer, and used all the money from forged checks, credit card cash advances and car sale to purchase and use drugs), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 971 (1997). In such cases, the prosecution may introduce the prior bad act to supply the jury with the defendant\u2019s motive for an otherwise senseless crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In this case, Smith\u2019s in-court identification was weak. Smith was unable to identify the defendant in photo arrays after the burglary, nor was he able to identify the defendant when police showed him the defendant\u2019s picture alone. Yet, at trial, he was able to identify the defendant as the man sitting at counsel table. Despite Smith\u2019s difficulty in identifying the defendant, the State was able to introduce strong circumstantial evidence identifying the defendant as the perpetrator: the defendant admitted he was in the area where the suspect disappeared into the woods behind Smith\u2019s house; the defendant\u2019s stepson watched the police investigate the burglary and made multiple cell phone calls while doing so; the police eliminated all suspects except the defendant; the defendant called a friend and asked if he knew a good tattoo artist who could cover up tattoos; the defendant\u2019s wife hid him in the trunk of her car; and, finally, his wife called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>a friend and asked if they could hide out. Based upon the evidence at trial, the jury could have easily concluded that the defendant was indeed the intruder.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Once the State establishes the defendant\u2019s identity, courts in other jurisdictions have ruled that evidence of a defendant\u2019s drug use is only admissible to show motive to commit a theft offense if the State establishes that the defendant: (1) \u201cwas addicted at or near the time of the offense, and, therefore, compelled to obtain the drug\u201d; and (2) \u201clacks sufficient income from legal sources to sustain his ... continuing need for [the drug].\u201d <em>People v. Jones, </em>326 N.W.2d 411, 413 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982); <em>accord Adkins, </em>96 S.W.3d at 793; <em>People v. Maounis, </em>722 N.E.2d 749, 752-53 (Ill. App. Ct. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">These cases stand for the general proposition that before evidence of a defendant\u2019s drug addiction is admissible, the State must first establish a nexus between the defendant\u2019s financial motive to commit the theft offense and his ongoing need to purchase drugs to satisfy his addiction. <em>See Carapezza, </em>191 P.3d at 263. It is not enough for the State merely to show that the defendant was a casual user of drugs. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>181 F. Supp. 2d 904, 907 (N.D. Ill. 2002), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>70 Fed. Appx. 359 (7th Cir. 2003). \u201cA casual user does not experience the same financial pressures as an addict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cit is not drug use <em>per se </em>that supports the underlying inference of financial need that makes the evidence relevant..., but rather a demonstration by the government both that the accused has a significant drug habit or addiction and that he did not have the financial means to support it that makes such evidence of drug use relevant to establish a motive\u201d to commit a theft offense. <em>United States v. Madden, </em>38 F.3d 747, 752 (4th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In this case, there was evidence that in July 2006, the defendant had a heroin \u201chabit\u201d and was a \u201cjunkie,\u201d which was sufficient to establish the first foundational requirement. There was also evidence that in July 2006, the defendant had recently lost his job and was \u201cusually broke,\u201d which was sufficient to establish the second foundational requirement. Because the State provided adequate identity evidence as well as a nexus between the defendant\u2019s heroin addiction and motive to steal, the evidence satisfies the first prong of our Rule 404(b) analysis. Because the defendant concedes that the second prong is satisfied, we turn to the third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Under the third prong, prior bad act evidence is admissible if the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. <em>State v. Smalley, </em>151 N.H. 193, 198 (2004). Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case. <em>State v. Hennessey, </em>142 N.H. 149, 155 (1997). Among the factors we consider in weighing the evidence are: (1) whether the evidence would have a great emotional impact upon a jury; (2) its potential for appealing to a juror\u2019s sense of resentment or outrage; and (3) the extent to which the issue upon which it is offered is established by other evidence, stipulation or inference. <em>Kim,, </em>153 N.H. at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We accord considerable deference to the trial court\u2019s determination in balancing prejudice and probative worth under Rule 404(b). <em>Id. </em>To prevail, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">First, we consider the probative value of the evidence. <em>Smalley, </em>151 N.H. at 199. Determining the probative value of evidence entails analyzing <em>how </em>relevant it is. <em>See id. </em>Relevant evidence may have limited probative value. <em>Id. </em>Here, as established above, evidence that the defendant was addicted to heroin at the time of the charged offense was probative of his motive to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Next, we consider whether the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from admission of this evidence substantially outweighed its probative value. Although we acknowledge that courts in other jurisdictions have found that evidence of a defendant\u2019s heroin use is inflammatory, <em>see State v. Taylor, </em>593 S.E.2d 645, 650 (W. Va. 2004), we cannot say that the evidence in this case was so inflammatory as to substantially outweigh its probative value, <em>see Smalley, </em>151 N.H. at 200. Moreover, the trial court admitted the evidence solely on the issue of motive and its limiting instruction minimized the possibility that the jury would misuse the evidence, thus reducing the potential for unfair prejudice. <em>See Pepin, </em>156 N.H. at 279; <em>State v. Beltran, </em>153 N.H. 643, 652 (2006). The jury is presumed to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions, thus diminishing any potential for unfair prejudice from admitting evidence that the defendant was addicted to heroin. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Because we accord considerable deference to the trial court\u2019s balancing, on the close facts of this case and in light of the foregoing analysis, we cannot say that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by allowing the State to admit evidence that the defendant was a heroin addict.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-10\">BRODERICK, C.J., and Hicks, J., concurred; Dalianis, J., concurred specially.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>DALIANIS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Asz\">concurring specially. Although the majority correctly holds that the defendant\u2019s habitual heroin use was admissible in this case, I disagree with its mandate that the trial court must first determine whether there is sufficient evidence for a jury to find the defendant\u2019s identity as the culprit before the State may introduce evidence that a defendant was a habitual heroin user in financial straits.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Like the majority, I believe that there is a logical connection between the challenged act(s) \u2014 habitual heroin use plus financial difficulties \u2014 and motive to commit the crime charged \u2014 burglary (entry with intent to commit a crime, such as theft) \u2014 that does not depend upon character-based propensity. Evidence that a person is actively addicted to heroin and lacks the financial means to support this addiction is relevant to show motive because this evidence has a tendency to prove that the person committed \u201ca crime in order to gain money to buy drugs.\u201d <em>Adkins v. Com., </em>96 S.W.3d 779, 793 (Ky. 2003). The inference imparted to the jury is that drug addiction when coupled with financial distress gives a person a motive to commit a theft-related crime, which seems to me to be a permissible inference that does not rely upon character or character-related propensity. Drug addiction and financial distress show a need for money, and, therefore, a motive to steal. <em>State v. Henness, </em>679 N.E.2d 686, 694 (Ohio), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 971 (1997); <em>see United States v. Mitchell, </em>172 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir. 1999) (because drug addiction establishes likelihood of desperate need for money \u201cand lack of self-control,\u201d evidence that a person is poor and drug-addicted may be relevant to show motive to commit a crime). Reasoning that a person who is addicted to a drug and who lacks any legitimate source of funds is more likely to have a motive to steal money with which to purchase drugs than a person randomly chosen from the population \u201cdoes not depend on the application of a character-based propensity inference.\u201d Leonard, <em>Character and Motive in Evidence Law, </em>34 LOY. L. REV. 439, 525 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Once this evidence is used to prove motive, I believe that, depending upon the circumstances of the case, the jury <em>should </em>be allowed to infer identity from it. In fact, motive is commonly used to prove identity, and evidence of prior bad acts is one way to prove motive. <em>See id. </em>at 440, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In <em>People v. Talaga, </em>194 N.W.2d 462, 463 (Mich. Ct. App. 1971), for instance, to prove that the defendant participated in the armed robbery, the prosecution sought to admit evidence that he was a heroin addict. The defendant appealed, arguing that evidence of his heroin addiction should have been excluded. <em>Talaga, </em>194 N.W.2d at 462. The appellate court affirmed, holding that it tended to establish a motive for armed robbery and that the motive, in turn, tended to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim that he was at home and knew nothing of the charge made against him. <em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>To the extent that the majority has ruled that evidence of a defendant\u2019s drug addiction plus financial difficulties may <em>never </em>be used to prove motive to steal (and thereby be used to prove identity) <em>unless </em>the State has presented some threshold alternative evidence of identity, I do not favor such a categorical approach. Although I am sensitive to the majority\u2019s concerns, I favor a more case-specific approach. I disagree with the majority\u2019s assumption that the chain of reasoning that connects a defendant\u2019s drug addiction and financial straits to his motive to steal and to his identity as the perpetrator <em>always </em>requires an inference as to the defendant\u2019s \u201ccharacter-based propensity to behave in a particular way.\u201d Leonard, <em>supra </em>at 442. The majority\u2019s opinion could, in the future, lead to the exclusion of prior bad act evidence in the trials of <em>all </em>cases in which identity is an issue, which I believe would be a mistake. <em>See </em>Colb, <em>\u201cWhodunit\u201d Versus \u201cWhat was Done\u201d: When to Admit Character Evidence in Criminal Cases, </em>79 N.C.
