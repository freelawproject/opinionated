We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The record supports the following facts. Anthony and Karen Hayes married in 1977. In July, August, October and November 2006, Karen, who did not have health insurance, received emergency medical treatment at SNHMC for complications stemming from alcoholism, leaving a balance due of $85,238.88. The record contains conflicting evidence about the status of Karen and Anthony\u2019s marriage during this time. While Karen\u2019s medical records indicate that she was living with Anthony, Anthony disputes this, asserting that he and Karen \u201cdid not live as husband and wife for the past seven to eight years . . . when [the medical bills] were . . . incurred.\u201d For example, Anthony testified that sometimes Karen was admitted to SNHMC after being \u201ctaken out of hotels, motels, and other people\u2019s houses.\u201d SNHMC filed suit against the Hayeses, and successfully sought a real estate attachment on two unencumbered parcels owned jointly by the Hayeses. When SNHMC placed an attachment on the properties, Karen and Anthony were still married. The Hayeses were divorced in January 2007 pursuant to a stipulated agreement. Under the terms of the divorce, each party was responsible for his or her own medical expenses not covered by insurance. Specifically, \u201cKaren [was] responsible for paying the debt to [SNHMC] as well as any other medical debts or bills.\u201d Karen received one automobile valued at $1,200, her bank account with a balance of $0.00, and all of her debts. Anthony received the marital properties subject to SNHMC\u2019s attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Prior to trial, SNHMC moved <em>in limine </em>to prohibit Anthony \u201cfrom introducing at trial any information, documentation or witnesses concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>ing or in any way referencing an alleged common law doctrine of elopement.\u201d SNHMC argued that elopement is an affirmative defense, and that Anthony failed to give adequate notice, pursuant to Superior Court Rule 28, that he intended to rely upon this doctrine. Anthony objected, contending that he gave adequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The trial court granted SNHMC\u2019s motion. It ruled that elopement is an affirmative defense, but that Anthony failed to properly raise it. The court found that it would be unfair to require SNHMC to counter this defense, given that \u201cthe legal fact of marriage was not in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of SNHMC against Karen, finding \u201cno issue of material fact\u201d that she was liable for the balance owed to SNHMC. The trial court, however, denied SNHMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Anthony, finding that genuine issues of material fact remained with respect to his liability for Karen\u2019s medical expenses. Following a bench trial on the merits, the trial court found that Anthony was liable, under the doctrine of necessaries, for Karen\u2019s medical debts to SNHMC. During the pendency of these proceedings, Karen passed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">On appeal, Anthony argues that: (1) elopement is not an affirmative defense; (2) even if it is, he provided sufficient notice; (3) pursuant to <em>Cheshire Medical Center v. Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. 187, 190 (1995), SNHMC was required to find that Karen had inadequate funds before seeking reimbursement from Anthony; (4) Karen had sufficient resources to satisfy her debt because Karen jointly owned the two pieces of property attached by SNHMC; and (5) the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment against Karen. SNHMC counters that: (1) elopement is an affirmative defense; (2) Anthony\u2019s interrogatory responses and pleadings did not provide adequate notice; (3) even if the trial court erred by treating elopement as an affirmative defense, that error was harmless because Anthony could not factually support an elopement defense; (4) SNHMC was required only to first seek payment from Karen before pursuing Anthony, which it did; (5) Karen lacked sufficient resources to satisfy her debt to SNHMC; (6) the trial court correctly granted summary judgment against Karen and found Anthony liable under the necessaries doctrine; and (7) Anthony lacks standing to contest the trial court\u2019s summary judgment ruling against Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">\n<em>I. Summary Judgment: Karen Hayes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">We first address, as a preliminary matter, SNHMC\u2019s argument that Anthony lacks standing to appeal the summary judgment against Karen. Specifically, SNHMC contends that only Karen\u2019s estate would have standing to appeal and \u201cas of this time, no estate has been opened,\u201d and that \u201cMr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Hayes has suffered no legal injury that an appeal to this Court will protect and he may not seek relief for the benefit of another.\u201d Although Anthony did not address these contentions in his brief, at oral argument he argued that he has standing to challenge the judgment against Karen because, under the necessaries doctrine, he is potentially liable for her debt. We assume for the purposes of this appeal that Anthony has standing to attack the judgment against Karen.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Anthony argues that the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment against Karen. He contends that whether he and Karen were married for the purposes of liability under the necessaries doctrine, and whether SNHMC\u2019s charges and the medical services provided to Karen were reasonably necessary, were material, disputed issues of fact. He argues that the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment against Karen because the evidence was insufficient for such a ruling. Anthony also maintains that the affidavit supporting SNHMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment was incompetent because the affiant was not a medical practitioner and lacked personal knowledge of the services provided and whether they were medically necessary. SNHMC counters that the applicability of the necessaries doctrine is irrelevant to the validity of the judgment against Karen, Karen\u2019s objection did not comply with RSA 491:8-a (1997), and Anthony failed to present any facts supporting his contention that SNHMC\u2019s charges and services were unreasonable. SNHMC also argues that Anthony failed to preserve his arguments that its charges were not reasonable because of its billing practices and that its affidavit was incompetent because he first raised those arguments in a motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">\u2018When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Everitt v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>159 N.H. 232, 234 (2009). \u201cIf this review does not reveal any genuine issues of material fact, <em>i.e., </em>facts that would affect the outcome of the litigation, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm.\u201d <em>Smith v. HCA Health Services of N.H., </em>159 N.H. 158, 160 (2009). \u2018We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.\u201d Everitt, </em>159 N.H. at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In its motion for summary judgment against Karen, SNHMC contended that it provided medical care to her and that, as a result, she owed SNHMC for the services provided. In support of its motion, SNHMC attached an affidavit from its Credit and Collection Manager who stated that she was \u201cfamiliar with the books and records of [SNHMC]\u201d and had \u201cpersonal knowledge of the matters stated herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>In her objection, Karen denied \u201cthat medical and health care services and/or supplies were properly administered to [her] or that they were reasonable or necessary.\u201d She also asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">In determining whether or not the charges rendered by [SNHMC] in this case are reasonable, the court needs to consider other issues, such as the fact that [SNHMC] is allegedly a non-profit organization and needs to consider billing rates or cash payments as opposed to insurance payments or [Medicaid] payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Karen neither referred to anything in the record nor filed an affidavit contradicting SNHMC\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We agree that whether the Hayeses were married for the purposes of liability under the necessaries doctrine was irrelevant to the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against Karen. Moreover, Karen failed to allege that there were any disputed issues of material fact, or that SNHMC was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The party opposing a motion for summary judgment cannot \u201crest upon mere allegations or denials of [the] pleadings, but [her] response, by affidavits or by reference to depositions, answers to interrogatories, or admissions, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d RSA 491:8-a, IV. Karen failed to refer to any facts in the record, or to present the trial court with an affidavit, supporting her allegations that the hospital\u2019s charges were not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">In her motion to reconsider, Karen raised a new challenge to the affidavit supporting SNHMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">[SNHMC] submitted an Affidavit in support of its Motion For Summary Judgment, along with a copy of an invoice for services that were rendered to the Defendant. The Affidavit was signed by an employee that works in the business department of the hospital, and not by a doctor or a medical practitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">The motion thus challenged the competency of the affidavit. The motion, however, failed to identify any facts supporting Karen\u2019s claim, and failed to demonstrate that SNHMC was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">\n<em>II. The Doctrine of Necessaries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">The ancient common law doctrine of necessaries imposed liability on husbands for \u201cessential goods and services provided to [their wives] by third parties\u201d if they faded to provide their wives \u201cwith such necessaries.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 189 (quotation omitted). Necessaries included \u201cnecessary food, drink, washing, physic, instruction, and a suitable place of residence, with such necessary furniture as is suitable to her condition.\u201d <em>Ray v. Adden, </em>50 N.H. 82, 83 (1870); <em>see Morrison v. Holt, </em>42 N.H. 478, 480 (1861) (legal expenses not necessaries unless husband\u2019s conduct rendered expenses necessary to secure wife\u2019s personal protection or safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">This doctrine originated as a result of draconian legal restrictions on the rights of married women to \u201ccontract, sue, or be sued individually\u201d or exercise control over their property or financial affairs. <em>North Ottawa Community Hosp. v. Kieft, </em>578 N.W.2d 267, 269 (Mich. 1998); <em>Medical Business Associates v. Steiner, </em>588 N.Y.S.2d 890, 892 (App. Div. 1992). A married woman\u2019s contracts \u201c \u2018were absolutely void, \u2014 not merely voidable, like those of infants and lunatics.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 189 (quoting <em>Dunlap v. Dunlap, </em>84 N.H. 352, 353 (1930)). \u201c[U]pon marriage a woman forfeited her legal existence and became the property of her husband,\u201d as, in the eyes of the law, a husband and wife were considered one legal entity. <em>Id.; Steiner, </em>588 N.Y.S.2d at 892. In return for his responsibility for his wife\u2019s support and liability for her torts, a husband was entitled to her \u201csociety.\u201d <em>Drew\u2019s Appeal, </em>57 N.H. 181, 183 (1876).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201cA man has as good a right to his wife, as to the property acquired under a marriage contract; and to divest him of that right without his default, and against his will, would be as flagrant a violation of the principles of justice as the confiscation of his estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\"><em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 188 (quoting <em>Drew\u2019s Appeal, </em>57 N.H. at 183). The husband was \u201cthe sole owner of the family wealth,\u201d and the wife was \u201cviewed as little more than a chattel in the eyes of the law.\u201d <em>N.C. Baptist Hospitals, Inc. v. Harris, </em>354 S.E.2d 471, 474 (N.C. 1987) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Accordingly, the law of necessaries \u201cattempted to obviate some of the victimization which coverture would otherwise have permitted\u201d by \u201cproviding a common-law mechanism by which the duty of support could be enforced.\u201d <em>Kieft, </em>578 N.W.2d at 270 (quotation omitted). It reflected the sad reality that, \u201c[b]eeause the wife could not contract for food, clothing, or medical needs, her husband was obligated to provide her with such necessaries.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 189 (citation and quotation omitted). To obtain compensation from a husband for goods or services provided to his wife, a creditor had to set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case that husband and wife were married, that the husband failed to provide his wife with necessaries, and that the articles or services in question were necessaries \u201caccording to the husband\u2019s situation in life.\u201d <em>Rumney v. Keyes, </em>7 N.H. 571, 580 (1835); <em>see Ott v. Hentall, </em>70 N.H. 231, 232 (1899). If the couple separated, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>husband could nonetheless be liable under the necessaries doctrine if he caused the separation by abandoning his wife, evicting her without reason, or committing some other kind of misconduct that drove the wife out of the marital home. <em>Ott, </em>70 N.H. at 232; <em>Allen, Cummings &amp; Co. v. Aldrich, </em>29 N.H. 63, 73 (1854); <em>Rumney, </em>7 N.H. at 578. However, even if the husband and wife separated by consent, a husband could still be liable for his wife\u2019s necessaries. <em>Pidgin v. Cram, </em>8 N.H. 350, 351 (1836).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Husbands could avoid liability under the necessaries doctrine under certain circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Tebbets v. Hapgood, </em>34 N.H. 420, 421 (1857); <em>Allen, </em>29 N.H. at 73; <em>Rumney, </em>7 N.H. at 578. For example, a husband whose wife \u201celoped\u201d would not be liable for her necessaries. <em>Cogswell v. Tibbetts, </em>3 N.H. 41, 42 (1824); <em>see Rumney, </em>7 N.H. at 580. A wife who voluntarily left her husband to live with an adulterer, or was removed forcibly from the marital home but chose to reside with the adulterer, \u201celoped\u201d for the purposes of the doctrine. <em>Cogswell, </em>3 N.H. at 42. Key to the determination of \u201celopement\u201d was whether the wife had left her husband, committed adultery and also remained beyond his control. <em>Id.; see Rumney, </em>7 N.H. at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\u201cIn modern America, \u2018no longer is the female destined solely for the home and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Steiner, </em>588 N.Y.S.2d at 893 (quoting <em>Stanton v. Stanton, </em>421 U.S. 7, 14-15 (1975)). \u201cThe modern marital relationship is viewed by law as a partnership of equality, an evolution from the nineteenth century relationship of dominance by a husband and submission by a wife who had little standing as an individual person or legal entity.\u201d <em>Forsyth Memorial Hosp., Inc. v. Chisholm, </em>467 S.E.2d 88,90 (N.C. 1996). Undoubtedly, married women today have an \u201cunrestricted right to contract,\u201d and RSA 546-A:2 (2007) \u201cimposes a gender-neutral obligation of spousal support.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 189. The doctrine of necessaries has been characterized as \u201can anachronism that no longer fits contemporary society,\u201d <em>Steiner, </em>588 N.Y.S.2d at 893 (quotation omitted), and some courts have abolished it. <em>See, e.g., Emanuel v. McGriff, </em>596 So. 2d 578, 580 (Ala. 1992); <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s Cty, </em>425 A.2d 1011, 1019 (Md. 1981). In New Hampshire, however, the doctrine endures: we extended it to apply to all married individuals, regardless of gender, <em>see Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 190, and many courts have similarly extended the doctrine to apply to both husbands and wives. <em>See, e.g., </em>Simons, Note, <em>Is the Doctrine of Necessaries Necessary in </em>Florida: <em>Should the Legislature Accept the Challenge of Connor v. Southwest Florida Regional Medical Center?, </em>50 Fla. L. Rev. 933, 939 (1998); <em>Kieft, </em>578 N.W.2d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>When considering the application of the doctrine in the modern day, some courts have outlined a <em>prima facie </em>case under the law of necessaries as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">In order to establish <em>a prima facie </em>case against one spouse for the value of [services or goods] provided to the other spouse, the .. . provider must show that (1) [services or goods] were provided to the receiving spouse, (2) [they] were necessary for the health and well-being of the receiving spouse, (3) the person against whom the action is brought was married to the receiving spouse at the time the [services or goods] were provided, and (4) payment for the necessaries has not been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\"><em>Wesley Long Nursing Center, Inc. v. Harper, </em>No. COA06-1706, 2007 WL 4233643, at *2 (N.C. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2007) (unpublished opinion); <em>see Queen\u2019s Medical Center v. Kagawa, </em>967 P.2d 686, 693 (Haw. Ct. App. 1998); <em>Trident Regional Medical Center v. Evans, </em>454 S.E.2d 343, 345 (S.C. Ct. App. 1995). This approach comports with our own common law on the necessaries doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Ott, </em>70 N.H. at 232; <em>Rumney, </em>7 N.H. at 580. We note that, for the purposes of the necessaries doctrine, hospitals and other medical providers are uniquely situated and, therefore, uniquely likely to seek the application of this doctrine, as, unlike other creditors, medical providers may not turn away patients who require treatment. <em>See Marshfield Clinic v. Discher, </em>314 N.W.2d 326, 329 (Wis. 1982) (noting that hospitals are often forced to respond to patients who require immediate, emergency care).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\n<em>A. Elopement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">We next consider whether elopement is an affirmative or general defense to the law of necessaries. As stated above, the trial court ruled that elopement is an affirmative defense, and barred Anthony from presenting evidence that Karen \u201celoped,\u201d finding that Anthony had failed to give adequate notice of his intention to rely upon that defense. We conclude that \u201celopement\u201d is no longer a defense to the doctrine of necessaries. <em>Cf. Chisholm, </em>467 S.E.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">As noted above, the necessaries doctrine developed during a time when married women were severely restricted in their ability to contract, sue, or be sued, or to exercise control over their property, services, or earnings. <em>See Kieft, </em>578 N.W.2d at 269; <em>Chisholm, </em>467 S.E.2d at 90; <em>Steiner, </em>588 N.Y.S.2d at 892. To defend on the grounds of elopement, the non-debtor spouse had to prove that the debtor spouse left the non-debtor spouse, escaped his or her control and committed adultery. <em>See Cogswell, </em>3 N.H. at 42. Such a defense does not comport with the modern status of marriage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>We have \u201crejected such antiquated and obsolete notions concerning women by modernizing the common law necessaries doctrine to impose liability on a gender-neutral basis and, thereby, making either spouse responsible for the necessary services provided to the other.\u201d <em>Chisholm, </em>467 S.E.2d at 90-91; <em>see Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Given that the \u201chistorical purposes underlying the [elopement] exception to the necessaries doctrine are incompatible with current mores and laws governing modern marital relationships in [New Hampshire],\u201d we find that the elopement exception \u201chas no place in the common law.\u201d <em>Chisholm, </em>467 S.E.2d at 91. <em>But see Bartrom v. Adjustment Bureau, Inc., </em>618 N.E.2d 1, 9-10 (Ind. 1993) (reasoning that common law defenses to application of doctrine of necessaries remain applicable). Rather, we conclude that, under the third prong of the <em>prima facie </em>case that we have outlined above, the creditor \u2014 in this case, the hospital \u2014 must show more than the legal fact of marriage to demonstrate that the parties are \u201cmarried\u201d for the purposes of liability under the necessaries doctrine. <em>See Roach v. Mamakos, </em>764 N.Y.S.2d 539, 541 (Sup. Ct. 2003); <em>National Account Systems, Inc. v. Mercado, </em>481 A.2d 835, 837 (N. J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1984). \u201c[P]roof of an undissolved marriage does not in itself provide the basis for liability to a creditor supplying a spouse with necessaries,\u201d as \u201cin some circumstances a marriage will cease to [exist] for purposes of liability under\u201d the necessaries doctrine. <em>Mercado, </em>481 A.2d at 837. This is a fact-specific, and case-specific, inquiry. <em>See Nichol v. Cierna, </em>195 N.W.2d 233, 235 (Neb. 1972) (noting that each decision with respect to liability under necessaries doctrine \u201cmust necessarily be largely governed by the facts existing in the particular case in which it is rendered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The non-debtor spouse\u2019s liability under the necessaries doctrine depends on a mutual expectation that the spouses will share assets, expenses, and debts. Accordingly, factors to consider in determining whether the marriage is no longer viable for the purposes of the necessaries doctrine might include whether the parties were separated, when they separated, whether they are living apart, and whether they share their living expenses and debt. <em>See Mercado, </em>481 A.2d at 837 (factors to consider in determining liability under necessaries doctrine include whether the parties are separated and have been financially supporting each other). If a marriage has broken down to the extent that spouses are no longer sharing assets or debts, it makes little sense to hold a non-debtor spouse liable for the medical expenses of the other. <em>See id. </em>at 838. <em>But see Kagawa, </em>967 P.2d at 699-700 (non-debtor spouse liable for necessaries until divorce finalized); <em>Bartrom, </em>618 N.E.2d at 9 (holding that \u201cduty of spousal support continues at least until the marriage relationship is dissolved\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>For the reasons described above, \u201celopement\u201d is no longer a defense to the application of the necessaries doctrine; rather, the third party seeking to impose liability on the non-debtor spouse \u2014 in this case, SNHMC \u2014 retains the burden to demonstrate that the parties were \u201cmarried\u201d for the purposes of liability under the necessaries doctrine. Because we hold today that \u201celopement\u201d is not an affirmative defense, we reverse and remand to the trial court for a new trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">\n<em>B. Liability of Non-Debtor Spouse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We next consider Anthony\u2019s argument that SNHMC must determine that his wife could not satisfy her debt before seeking reimbursement from him. Anthony relies primarily upon <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 190. SNHMC argues that it must only seek payment from Karen before pursuing Anthony, relying upon language in <em>Holbrook </em>which states that \u201ca medical provider must first seek payment from the spouse who received its services before pursuing collection from the other spouse.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Under the doctrine of necessaries, \u201ca husband or wife is not liable for necessary medical expenses incurred by his or her spouse unless the resources of the spouse who received the services are <em>insufficient </em>to satisfy the debt.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 187 (emphasis added). Accordingly, \u201cthe spouse who receives the necessary goods or services is primarily liable for payment,\u201d and \u201cthe other spouse is secondarily liable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188. We have held that the doctrine of necessaries renders the non-debtor spouse \u201cliable to the hospital to the extent [his or her spouse\u2019s] estate[] [is] <em>unable to pay </em>for the necessary medical services provided.\u201d <em>St. Joseph Hosp. of Nashua v. Rizzo, </em>141 N.H. 9, 12 (1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The defendant argued before the trial court that SNHMC was required to demonstrate that Karen could not pay for her medical services before pursuing his assets. The trial court stated'that it did \u201cnot necessarily agree with... Mr. Hayes[\u2019] legal position,\u201d citing the language in <em>Holbrook </em>which states that the medical provider must \u201cfirst seek payment from the spouse who received its services before pursuing collection from the other spouse.\u201d The trial court reasoned that the <em>Holbrook </em>\u201clanguage is directed at collection efforts\u201d and \u201cdoes not necessarily restrict a finding of liability.\u201d However, the trial court, \u201c[f]or the purposes of its analysis . . . accepted] [without] deciding the defendant\u2019s legal position\u201d and determined that, even under a standard requiring SNHMC to prove that Karen lacks the resources to pay her debts before pursuing Anthony, SNHMC demonstrated that Karen\u2019s estate could not satisfy the debt to SNHMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">We clarify our holding in <em>Holbrook </em>by confirming that the trial court applied the correct standard when it determined that Karen could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>satisfy her debt to SNHMC. On remand, the trial court should apply the standard set out above, that the non-debtor spouse is liable for his or her spouse\u2019s necessaries if the debtor spouse is unable to pay for his or her necessaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b742-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Conboy, JJ., concurred; HlCKS, J., concurred specially.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b742-7\">Hicks, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_j\">concurring specially. I concur in the judgment of the majority because the issue of abolishing the common law necessaries doctrine was not raised by either party. I write separately, however, because anachronisms in the doctrine, which are evident in the court\u2019s discussion of its origins, raise questions about its continued applicability in the modern world.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The necessaries doctrine \u201coriginated in English common law over three centuries ago when married women had no property or contractual rights and their husbands controlled their financial affairs. . . . The primary purpose of the doctrine was to assure that dependent wives received support from neglectful husbands.\u201d <em>Medical Center Hosp. of Vt v. Lorrain, </em>675 A.2d 1326, 1328 (Vt. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">In <em>Cheshire Medical Center v. Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. 187 (1995), we were called upon to reexamine the necessaries doctrine in light of subsequent changes in the legal status of women. More specifically, <em>Holbrook </em>presented the question whether the doctrine, as it then existed in our common law, violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 188. After chronicling the legal advances that \u201cdissipated the marital disabilities of women,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 189, we concluded that \u201c[t]he traditional formulation of the necessaries doctrine, predicated on anachronistic assumptions about marital relations and female dependence, does not withstand scrutiny under the compelling interest standard,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 190. We then \u201cexpand[ed] the common law doctrine to apply to all married individuals equally, regardless of gender.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Although we purported to \u201cdetermine whether the [necessaries] doctrine should be abolished or revised,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 190, we undertook none of the traditional analysis for determining whether to abolish existing precedent. Thus, while the holding in <em>Holbrook </em>may appear broad, it bears recalling that the specific question before us was whether the gender distinctions in the common law necessaries doctrine violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection. Thus, <em>Holbrook\u2019s </em>revision of the doctrine may be viewed as simply the abolition of gender distinctions that violated equal protection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>rather than a considered expansion of the doctrine. An examination of the doctrine under the traditional factors for determining whether to abrogate precedent, however, reveals that it has long outlived its relevance and should be abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We do not lightly overrule longstanding precedent. <em>See Alonzi v. Northeast Generation Servs. Co., </em>156 N.H. 656, 659 (2008). \u201cThe doctrine of stare decisis demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law, for when governing legal standards are open to revision in every case, deciding cases becomes a mere exercise of judicial will with arbitrary and unpredictable results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659-60 (quotation omitted). Nevertheless, we will abandon precedent when \u201cthe ruling has come to be seen so clearly as error that its enforcement was for that very reason doomed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660 (quotation omitted). In determining whether to overrule prior case law, we consider several factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">(1) whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply in defying practical workability; (2) whether the rule is subject to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling; (3) whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine; and (4) whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Most, if not all, of these factors apply to the common law doctrine of necessaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The necessaries doctrine arose out of the legal disabilities imposed upon married women under the common law; those restrictions on property ownership and contractual capacity are the raison d\u2019etre for the doctrine. As we stated in <em>Holbrook, </em>\u201cBecause the wife could not contract for food, clothing, or medical needs, her husband was obligated to provide her with such \u2018necessaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>140 N.H. at 189 (citation omitted). Without the underlying legal disability of the wife, the common law justification for binding her husband to her contracts for necessaries disappears. <em>See Lorrain, </em>675 A.2d at 1329 (noting that since women now have the same property and contractual rights as men, \u201cthe circumstances that led to the emergence of the necessaries doctrine no longer exist\u201d). Viewed in this light, the doctrine of necessaries is \u201cno more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine\u201d that has been \u201crobbed ... [of its] justification.\u201d <em>Alonzi, </em>156 N.H. at 660 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The doctrine also defies practical workability. <em>See id. </em>As the Supreme Court of Vermont noted in <em>Lorrain, </em>\u201cbecause the husband\u2019s liability under the doctrine had substantial limitations, the doctrine never accomplished its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>purported purpose \u2014 to be an effective support mechanism for neglected wives.\u201d <em>Lorrain, </em>675 A.2d at 1329; <em>see </em>Note, <em>The Unnecessary Doctrine of Necessaries, </em>82 MICH. L. Rev. 1767, 1799 (1984) (concluding that the necessaries doctrine \u201cis generally an ineffective means of providing spousal support\u201d and finding \u201cno persuasive evidence that the doctrine is useful in the context of the narrow support problem it was intended to alleviate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Finally, there appears to be little reliance upon the doctrine \u201cthat would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling\u201d it. <em>Alonzi, </em>156 N.H. at 660 (quotation omitted). In fact, \u201cstudies indicate that in deciding whether to extend credit, creditors give little weight to a married woman\u2019s support rights.\u201d <em>Lorrain, </em>675 A.2d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Consideration of the foregoing factors leads to the conclusion that the common law doctrine of necessaries is no longer viable. Furthermore, while our gender-neutral revision of the doctrine in <em>Holbrook </em>may have alleviated then extant equal protection concerns, it is doubtful that it solved any of the underlying problems with the doctrine or rendered the doctrine more effective in fulfilling its original purpose. There is, in fact, some indication that \u201cthe modern[, gender-neutral] doctrine seems to result in <em>less </em>available credit for needy spouses.\u201d Note, <em>The Unnecessary Doctrine of Necessaries, supra </em>at 1780. As the <em>Lorrain </em>court noted, \u201cIn truth, extension of the doctrine serves creditors\u2019 rights, not spousal support rights,\u201d <em>Lorrain, </em>675 A.2d at 1329, in stark contradiction to its genesis. For the foregoing reasons, should a case presenting the issue come before us, the necessaries doctrine should be abolished.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
