We reverse in part, vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The record supports the following facts. The parties signed a Uniform Support Order approved by the trial court on August 16,2004. The Uniform Support Order in part obligated the petitioner to pay thirty-three percent of any net bonuses in child support. The petitioner was not contractually entitled to any bonuses; his employer paid them voluntarily. In 2005 and 2006, the petitioner received bonuses based upon his prior year\u2019s performance, and he paid the required additional child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">On June 16, 2006, the petitioner received a $90,000 loan from his employer. On March 15, 2007, the petitioner received net loan forgiveness of $29,603.02 from his employer. This credit appeared on his December 21, 2007 pay stub under total earnings (and directly underneath his \u201cRegular Earnings Salary\u201d) as gross \u201cLoan Income\u201d of $43,954. It also appears under after-tax deductions as a net \u201cPersonal Loan\u201d of $29,603.01. The Internal Revenue Service considers loan forgiveness to be taxable income. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a)(12) (2000). Also under total earnings and directly underneath the \u201cLoan Income\u201d line item is a listing entitled \u201cPerf[ormance] Achievement Incentive.\u201d No monetary amount appears directly across from this entry. In comparison, a \u201cPerf Achievement Incentive\u201d line item also appears in the petitioner\u2019s pay stub for December 31, 2006, under total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>earnings (and two entries above his \u201cRegular Earnings Salary\u201d), and his bonus for work performed in 2005 is displayed alongside.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In the note amortization schedule, the March 2007 loan forgiveness appears as a gross \u201c06 Bonus\u201d of $43,954, amounting to a net after-tax $29,603.02 loan payment. Furthermore, the note amortization schedule indicates a second payment of $65,405.94 on June 16, 2007, resulting in a zero balance on the loan. The schedule does not provide an explanation of that second payment, and, unlike the March payment, it does not appear on the petitioner\u2019s pay stub. Aside from the above-described transactions, the petitioner\u2019s employer did not purport to pay him a bonus in 2007 for his performance in 2006, and the petitioner paid the respondent no additional child support in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The respondent filed a petition to modify child support and motion for contempt on August 24, 2007. At the hearing on March 31, 2008, the petitioner acknowledged during offers of proof that he received the loan forgiveness documented in his December 2007 pay stub. However, he represented that this was the only loan forgiveness he had received or would receive; that he had not yet made any payments on the loan himself; and that, contrary to the note amortization schedule, he still had a balance outstanding on the loan. He also said he was unsure why his employer forgave a portion of the loan. When asked by the court whether the loan forgiveness was received in lieu of a bonus, the petitioner\u2019s attorney was similarly unsure, saying that the employer \u201celeet[ed], for whatever reason, to show [the forgiveness] as a very different category of income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The court ruled that the loan forgiveness was \u201ca reduction in the Petitioner\u2019s financial obligations or expenses,\u201d and that it did not constitute \u201cincome\u201d for the purposes of child support. According to the court\u2019s order, \u201c[approximately one-half of [the loan] has been repaid,\u201d and the \u201cLoan Income\u201d on the petitioner\u2019s December 2007 pay stub was \u201ca forgiveness of the balance of the original $90,000 loan.\u201d The respondent filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">On appeal, the respondent argues: (1) that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by not finding that the loan forgiveness was a bonus in disguise; (2) that loan forgiveness constitutes gross income for the purposes of child support as a matter of law; and (3) that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by not finding that the loan forgiveness was a \u201cspecial eireumstance[],\u201d RSA 458-0:5 (Supp. 2008), necessitating an increased child support payment. The respondent contends that the petitioner\u2019s employer forgave the entire $90,000 loan in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The court issued the order giving rise to this appeal in response to, in relevant part, a motion to modify child support. \u201cTrial courts have broad discretion in reviewing and modifying child support orders,\u201d and \u201cwe will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>overturn modification orders only if it clearly appears that the trial court engaged in an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Fulton &amp; Fulton, </em>154 N.H. 264, 269 (2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The respondent first argues that, because the petitioner\u2019s employer decided to grant the petitioner loan forgiveness in lieu of a bonus, the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in failing to treat the loan forgiveness as a bonus. We conclude that, regardless of the employer\u2019s intent, the transaction at issue constitutes a \u201cbonusQ\u201d as enumerated in RSA 458-C:2, IV (Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">We review questions of law <em>de novo. In the Matter of Giacomini &amp; Giacomini, </em>151 N.H. 775, 776 (2005). We interpret statutes based upon \u201cthe plain and ordinary meanings [of] the words used,\u201d and if \u201ca statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond it for further indication of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 776-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">RSA 458-C:2, IV defines gross income for the purposes of child support as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">all income from any source, whether earned or unearned, including, but not limited to, wages, salary, commissions, tips, annuities, social security benefits, trust income, lottery or gambling winnings, interest, dividends, investment income, net rental income, self-employment income, alimony, business profits, pensions, <em>bonuses, </em>and payments from other government programs . . . including, but not limited to, workers\u2019 compensation, veterans\u2019 benefits, unemployment benefits, and disability benefits ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">RSA 458-C:2, IV (emphasis added). In the employment context, \u201cbonus\u201d is defined as \u201cmoney or an equivalent given in addition to the usual compensation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 252 (unabridged ed. 2002). Here, the petitioner\u2019s employer gave the petitioner a loan, at least part of which was ultimately forgiven. The employer forgave this loan in addition to the petitioner\u2019s usual compensation. The only issue is thus whether loan forgiveness, in this context, is \u201can equivalent\u201d of money. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">We have previously held that employer-provided in-kind benefits such as housing and transportation are not an unenumerated source of income under RSA 458-C:2, IV. <em>In the Matter of Clark &amp; Clark, </em>154 N.H. 420, 423 (2006). This is a separate inquiry from whether an employer-provided benefit is a \u201cbonus[]\u201d as enumerated in the statute. However, even if we read <em>Clark </em>to hold that employer-provided housing and transportation do not constitute a \u201cbonus[]\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV, we would reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>In-kind benefits like an apartment or a vehicle are not \u201can equivalent\u201d of money, as they are illiquid assets. However, when a loan is forgiven in part, the portion forgiven essentially becomes a cash payment. Unlike in-Mnd benefits, employees may use a forgiven loan as \u201can equivalent\u201d of money; <em>i.e., </em>in the same fashion as the employee could use a normal bonus. Even if the employee has spent the balance of the loan prior to receiving loan forgiveness, this would not alter the fundamental character of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that the petitioner\u2019s employer loaned the petitioner $90,000, of which the employer forgave at least a portion. This undisputed loan forgiveness was \u201can equivalent\u201d to money that the employer gave the petitioner \u201cin addition to\u201d the petitioner\u2019s \u201cusual compensation.\u201d It thus constitutes a \u201cbonus[]\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We note however that trial courts may, under RSA 458-C:5, consider \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d surrounding an employer-provided loan forgiveness for the purposes of adjusting the application of the child support guidelines. <em>See In the Matter of Carr &amp; Edmunds, </em>156 N.H. 498, 504 (2007) (concluding that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d not enumerated by the statute are economic in nature).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Finally, the respondent argues that the petitioner\u2019s employer forgave the entire $90,000 loan. The exact amount of loan forgiveness the employer provided is a question for the fact finder, and we will not disturb its determination unless unsupported by evidence in the record. <em>Cf In the Matter of Donovan &amp; Donovan, </em>152 N.H. 55, 58-59 (2005) (applying this standard to the question of whether a spouse was \u201cvoluntarily\u201d underemployed). It is not clear from its order whether the trial court determined that the entire loan was forgiven, or merely a portion. Having held that the loan forgiveness is a \u201cbonus[]\u201d under RSA 458-C:2, IV, we vacate the trial court\u2019s findings as to the amount that was forgiven and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Given this holding, we need not address the respondent\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\n<em>Reversed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-10\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
