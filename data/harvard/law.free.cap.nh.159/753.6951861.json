He appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his proposed <em>voir dire </em>question and his motion to reconvene the jury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">The record supports the following. On July 18, 2007, Ricky Menczywor hosted a party at his parents\u2019 home in Cand\u00eda. There were approximately twenty-five people at the party, including Donald Sullivan, his girlfriend, Courtney Coppola, Danielle Morrissey and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">After midnight, Sullivan and Coppola decided to leave. Coppola said goodbye to friends inside the house, while Sullivan went outside to thank Menczywor for hosting the party. Sullivan found Menczywor on the back deck of the house with the defendant. As Sullivan began walking away, the defendant punched him in the face and Menczywor pointed a rifle at Sullivan\u2019s head. The defendant then took Sullivan\u2019s gold chain, earrings, and money from his wallet. The defendant had difficulty taking Sullivan\u2019s watch, so Menczywor handed the gun to the defendant and took the watch. The defendant then returned the gun to Menczywor.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">After the robbery, Sullivan, Coppola and Morrissey left, and Morrissey called the police. About ten state and local police officers arrived at Menczywor\u2019s home. Several partygoers fled into the woods behind the house, while others remained inside the home with the doors locked. After forcing their way into the home, the police conducted a protective sweep that revealed two rifles on the floor near a closet in the back of the house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>One of the ri\u00f1es was loaded. The police found four people inside the home, including the defendant, who was arrested for being a minor in possession of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">During the investigation, Sullivan told the police that a \u201cSpanish\u201d male wearing a red shirt, with a tattoo of the word \u201cBoogie\u201d on his lower forearm, had punched him. The defendant, a Hispanic man, had such a tattoo on his arm. He was wearing a red shirt when the police found him in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendant was indicted on one count of robbery, accomplice to robbery, and simple assault. <em>See </em>RSA 636:1; RSA 626:8, III; RSA 631:2-a, 1(a). Before trial, the defendant submitted five proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions to the trial court, which the court considered in an unrecorded chambers conference. The record does not reflect any further discussion of the request, but the trial court asked the venire four of the five questions. The court did not pose the following question: \u201cAndrew Santiago is Hispanic. He is originally from Puerto Rico and is therefore a United States citizen. Do you feel that because he is originally from Puerto Rico that this would affect your ability to be impartial?\u201d The jury acquitted the defendant on the robbery and simple assault charges, but convicted him of accomplice to robbery. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">After the trial, a defense investigator sent the jurors a questionnaire. One question asked, \u201cWas the race of the defendant a factor in your verdict?\u201d One juror responded, \u201cColor made a differ[e]nce.\u201d Based upon this response, the defendant moved for a new trial, or, in the alternative, to reconvene the jury. The trial court denied the motion, and the defendant also appealed that decision. We consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">\n<em>I. Voir Dire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">The defendant first argues that the trial court\u2019s decision not to pose a question about racial bias during juror <em>voir dire </em>violated his state and federal constitutional rights to be tried by an impartial jury. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 35; U.S. Const, amend. VI. The State counters that this issue was not preserved for appeal because the defendant did not raise these constitutional arguments in the trial court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\"> To preserve an issue for appellate review, a defendant must make a contemporaneous objection that explicitly states the specific grounds of objection. <em>See State v. Ericson, </em>159 N.H. 379, 386 (2009) (citations omitted). Here, the trial court considered the defendant\u2019s proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions in an unrecorded chambers conference and the defendant did not object on the record to the court\u2019s decision not to ask one of the questions. Where a chambers conference is unrecorded and the record is not part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the case before us, \u201cwe cannot speculate as to what occurred.\u201d <em>Carbone v. Tierney, </em>151 N.H. 521, 536 (2004). The fact that there was an unrecorded chambers conference does not \u201crelieve the defendant of his burden to present an adequate record\u201d on appeal. <em>State v. Bergmann, </em>135 N.H. 97, 100 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We have reviewed issues where there was an unrecorded conference and the parties later reconstructed the record to reflect their and the trial court\u2019s understanding of what occurred. <em>See State v. Parra, </em>135 N.H. 306, 308-09 (1992) (finding issue preserved where State and trial court effectively ratified representation by defense counsel that he had previously made specific argument in off-the-record conference). However, no such reconstruction occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The defendant argues that his motion for a new trial adequately preserved his challenge to the trial court\u2019s failure to ask his proposed <em>voir dire </em>question. The defendant\u2019s motion, however, only mentions the proposed <em>voir dire </em>questions in passing. The only issue expressly raised in the motion is a request for a new trial, or, in the alternative, for the trial court to reconvene the jury. He does not separately raise the issue of the <em>voir dire </em>question. Moreover, it is too late to raise such an issue for the first time in a motion for a new trial because the trial court cannot correct any potential error by asking the <em>voir dire </em>question at that point. Therefore, this issue is not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\n<em>II. Alleged Juror Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">We next address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconvene the jury. The defendant contends that the juror\u2019s response to the questionnaire that \u201cColor made a difference\u201d required the trial court to reconvene the jury to see if the verdict was tainted by racial bias. First, he argues that because the trial court found two plausible explanations for the juror\u2019s comment \u2014 as either evidence of prejudice or that the defendant\u2019s identity was in issue \u2014 it should have reconvened the jury to determine which interpretation was correct. Second, he argues the trial court applied an improperly high standard to the defendant\u2019s request to reconvene the jury when it found that \u201ccase law suggests that the reconvening of a jury is a last resort for a trial judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">The State argues that the defendant\u2019s identification was the most contested issue at trial and points out that the defendant was identified by his race five times during the trial. The State contends that because the defendant\u2019s identity was based in large part upon the color of his skin, there was a rational explanation for the juror\u2019s response. The State further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>argues the juror\u2019s responses were vague and unresponsive and the trial court was correct in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to reconvene the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">\u201cNeither party has the legal right to bring the jurors before the trial judge and have them orally examined.\u201d <em>Bunnell v. Lucas, </em>126 N.H. 663,669 (1985) (quotation, brackets and ellipsis omitted). \u201cThis is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>State v. Gordon, </em>141 N.H. 703, 707 (1997) (quotation omitted), and the trial court\u2019s discretion in this respect is broad. <em>Bothwick v. LaBelle, </em>115 N.H. 279, 281 (1975). The trial court may reconvene and interrogate a jury \u201cwhenever [it] is of the opinion that the jury may have made some mistake . . . which produced their verdict.\u201d <em>Caldwell v. Yeatman, </em>91 N.H. 150, 155 (1940). We review the trial court\u2019s decision under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard, and reverse only if the ruling is clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case. <em>See State v. Low, </em>138 N.H. 86, 88 (1993); <em>cf. State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). The question before us, then, is whether the defendant\u2019s allegation raised an issue of jury misconduct such that the court unsustainably exercised its discretion when it declined to explore the matter further by recalling the jurors and subjecting them to oral examination. <em>Caldwell, </em>91 N.H. at 155. Based upon the record before us, we hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion is neither untenable nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In support of his motion for a new trial, the defendant submitted a copy of the juror questionnaire and the juror\u2019s responses. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">1. Was this the first time you\u2019ve served on a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">Yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">2. What led you to convict Mr. Santiago of robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">It was clear that some of the people saw the same thing twice and his tatoo [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-12\">3. Did any other jurors do or say anything that would have influenced your decision? If so, what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-14\">No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-15\">4. What was the most important piece of evidence in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-16\">What was the most important testimony in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-17\">The evidence of his robbery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-18\">5. Was the race of the defendant a factor in your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-19\">Color made a difference</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-20\">6. Did the fact that the defendant is Hispanic come up in deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-22\">She was very good</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>7. What was your impression of the defense attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">Okay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">8. What was your impression of the prosecuting attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">Afford [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">9. What was your impression of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">10. Was there anything the state or the defense could have added (i.e. information; evidence; view) to the trial process, which might have assisted you in your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-11\">More evidence</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-12\"> Viewed in isolation, the juror\u2019s response that \u201cColor made a difference\u201d is troublesome. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>630 N.W.2d 79, 83 (S.D. 2001) (\u201cWhen racial considerations are injected into jury deliberations, the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a fair trial is defeated.\u201d (quotation omitted)). In light of the other questions and answers, however, it is not. For example, when asked, \u201cDid the fact that the defendant is Hispanic come up in deliberations?\u201d, the juror responded, \u201cShe was very good.\u201d When asked, &lt;cWhat was your impression of the defendant?\u201d, the response was \u201cNo.\u201d We agree with the trial court that these answers are \u201ccompletely unresponsive\u201d to the questions asked. We thus agree with the trial court that because \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s race was perhaps the most important part of this case, the\u2019 juror\u2019s answer is entirely reasonable.\u201d Given the ambiguity of the juror\u2019s answers, we cannot conclude that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by deciding not to reconvene the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">Our conclusion is supported by other cases where we have upheld a trial court\u2019s decision to reconvene the jury. <em>See, e.g., Drop Anchor Realty Trust v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>126 N.H. 674, 683 (1985) (upholding reconvening of jury where juror told defense attorney jury improperly calculated amount of damages); <em>Bunnell, </em>126 N.H. at 665, 669 (finding reconvening jury proper where juror informed plaintiff\u2019s counsel jury reached decision by averaging their respective determinations of fault and foreman failed to ask whether each agreed with result); <em>Bothwick, </em>115 N.H. at 281 (affirming trial court\u2019s decision to reconvene jury where jury foreman indicated jury miscalculated damages). The conduct here does not rise to the level of these cases. In those situations a juror told counsel about specific errors the jury made. Here, however, the evidence of potential juror misconduct was ambiguous and susceptible to an interpretation consistent with the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>In <em>State v. Gordon, </em>141 N.H. 703 (1997), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision not to reconvene the jury when, during the weekend layover in jury deliberations, a juror went to the library to research the New Hampshire rape statute. <em>Id. </em>at 707. The affidavit submitted by defense counsel indicated the juror did not disclose this to any other jurors, and that she voted guilty based upon the other evidence she considered. <em>Id. </em>This case is analogous to <em>Gordon </em>in that the defendant alleged no independent misconduct of the juror that affected the verdict in any significant way. When asked to identify \u201cthe most important piece of evidence in this case,\u201d the juror responded, \u201cThe evidence of his robbery\u201d \u2014 an answer devoid of any reference to the defendant\u2019s race. Here, the juror voted guilty not based upon the defendant\u2019s race, but based upon the other evidence the juror considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b779-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
