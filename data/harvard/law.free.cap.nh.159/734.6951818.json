Walker, trustee, appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Fauver, </em>J.) denying its request for an abatement from property taxes assessed by the respondent, Town of Wolfeboro. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The record evidences the following facts. The petitioner owns property in Wolfeboro consisting of a residence -with an attached barn and ninety-three acres of land, including 1,100 feet of frontage on Lake Wentworth. Approximately ninety-one and one-half acres of the property, including nearly the entire lake frontage, has been in current use since 1980. The house and barn are located in the middle of the property on one and one-half acres that are not in current use. Another acre, which is also not in current use, comprises the road leading to the house site, and the road from the house site to both the waterfront and the dock site.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">In January 2006, when the petitioner purchased the property for $4,600,000, its total assessed value was $362,151. The assessed value of the one acre on which the house alone sits (the house site) was $104,500. In August 2006, the Town increased the property\u2019s total assessed value from $362,151 to $3,342,151. The assessment increased because the Town reclassified the house site from \u201cshorefront residential\u201d to \u201cwaterfront estate.\u201d Reclassifying the house site caused its assessment to increase from $104,500 to $2,979,500. The petitioner\u2019s July 2006 tax bill, based upon the property\u2019s total assessed value of $362,151, was $1,987; its December 2006 bill, based upon the property\u2019s total assessed value of $3,342,151, was $37,651.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Because it is undisputed, we assume that the petitioner timely applied to the Town for an abatement of the 2006 property tax due on the house site, and timely appealed the Town\u2019s denial to the superior court. <em>See LSP Assoc. v. Town of Gilford, </em>142 N.H. 369, 371 (1997). At trial, the Town conceded that it should not have reclassified the house site. The Town argued that even if the house site remained classified as \u201cshorefront residential,\u201d the Town had undervalued it significantly. The Town contended that the proper valuation of the house site for tax year 2006 should have been $1,214,351.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Based upon the testimony of the Town\u2019s assessor, the trial court concluded that the Town\u2019s new valuation of the house site was consistent with its fair market value, which the trial court found was $1,275,000 as of April 1,2006. Accordingly, the trial court ruled that the petitioner had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that, using the new assessed value of $1,214,351, the Town had taxed the house site disproportionately. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The petitioner first argues that the trial court erred by upholding the Town\u2019s decision to change the house site\u2019s assessment in August 2006. The petitioner claims that the Town lacked authority to do this. \u201cBecause the power to tax arises solely by statute, the right to tax must be found within the letter of the law and is not to be extended by implication.\u201d <em>Pheasant Lane Realty Trust v. City of Nashua, </em>143 N.H. 140, 143 (1998) (quotation and citations omitted). \u201cAs such, mistaken property tax valuations can be corrected only through legislatively authorized remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, resolving the petitioner\u2019s appeal requires us to construe the pertinent statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Zorn v. Demetri, </em>158 N.H. 437, 438 (2009). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>We construe all parts of a statute together to effectuate its overall purpose and avoid an absurd or unjust result. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we do not consider words and phrases in isolation, but rather within the context of the statute as a whole. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39. This enables us to better discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Pursuant to RSA 76:2 (2003), a tax year runs from April 1 to March 31. Taxes are assessed based upon the value of property located in a town as of April 1. <em>See </em>RSA 74:1 (Supp. 2009) (selectmen of each town must \u201ctake an inventory of all estate liable to be taxed in such town as of April 1\u201d); <em>White v. Lee, </em>124 N.H. 69,76 (1983) (\u201cAssessment of the tax is performed annually by each city and town, based upon their property inventory as of April 1.\u201d). The Town must adjust assessments annually \u201cso that all assessments are reasonably proportional within that municipality.\u201d RSA 75:8,1 (Supp. 2009). Additionally, \u201c[a]t least as often as every fifth year,... the assessors and/or selectmen shall value all real estate within a municipality so that the assessments are valued in accordance with RSA 75:1.\u201d RSA 75:8-a (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The Town collects taxes semi-annually pursuant to RSA 76:15-a (2003), which allows a town to collect taxes \u201cassessed on April 1\u201d in two installments, the first due on July 1, and the second on December 1. Bills for the July 1 installment must be mailed by June 15. RSA 76.T5-a, II. In order for the bills to be prepared, \u201cthe lists of assessed property shall be committed by the selectmen with a warrant under their hands and seal directed to the collector of such town no later than May 15.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first installment may be based upon \u201cthe prior year\u2019s assessed valuation times 1/2 of the previous year\u2019s tax rate.\u201d RSA 76:15-a, I. If, however, \u201cit shall appear to the selectmen or assessors that certain individual properties have physically changed in valuation, they may use the current year\u2019s appraisal times 1/2 the previous year\u2019s tax rate to compute the partial payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Upon receipt of the July payment, the tax collector must credit it \u201ctoward the amount of the taxes eventually assessed against the property.\u201d RSA 76:15-a, II. \u201cA payment of the remainder of the taxes assessed April 1, minus the payment due on July 1 of that year, shall be due and payable December 1.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The trial court did not issue a specific finding as to whether the Town erred when it revised its assessment of the house site in August 2006. \u201cAlthough the trial court did not expressly make this finding, we assume it made all subsidiary findings necessary to support its decision.\u201d <em>Smith v. Lillian V. Donahue Trust, </em>157 N.H. 502, 508 (2008). \u201cWe sustain the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. Town of Hudson, </em>145 N.H. 598,600 (2000) (quotation omitted). The record supports a finding that the Town did not violate the statutory scheme described above by revising the assessment in August.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">As allowed under RSA 76:15-a, the record shows that the Town based the petitioner\u2019s July 1, 2006 semi-annual tax bill upon the prior year\u2019s assessment of $362,151. The petitioner\u2019s December 1, 2006 semi-annual tax bill was based upon the property\u2019s assessment as of April 1, 2006. As the Town\u2019s current assessor explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">A. [T]he second tax bill [is] the actual tax bill of the year, which is ... after the State sets the tax rate and the second bill is your legal bill of the year. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">A. The first tax bill is only an appropriation for money for the Town____[W]hatever we do \u2014 we\u2019re looking at April 1st as the tax date, so let\u2019s say if you\u2019re building a new house . . . [we look at] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>[w]here were you as of April 1st? It may not be changed on the tax card until September or... August... or some time after... that first tax bill went out. But it still reflects what was happening ... on April 1st of . . . that year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The record does not support the petitioner\u2019s contention that the Town twice assessed the value of the house site as of April 1, 2006. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, the assessment reflected on the January and June 2006 tax cards is from the prior year; the assessment reflected on the September 2006 tax card was the property\u2019s assessed value as of April 1, 2006. Although the petitioner also contests the Town\u2019s decision to reclassify the house site from \u201cshorefront residential\u201d to \u201cwaterfront estate,\u201d this argument is moot given the Town\u2019s concession that reclassifying the property was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">To the extent that the petitioner contests the Town\u2019s assessment of other property that is not in current use, we observe that the trial court found that the only assessment in dispute concerned the house site. The petitioner\u2019s tax abatement petition confirms that the petitioner\u2019s appeal to the superior court was limited to this assessment. As the petitioner has failed to argue that the trial court\u2019s finding in this regard was erroneous, we decline to address the validity of any other assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The petitioner next argues that the trial court erred when it concluded that the value of the house site is enhanced by the fact that it is surrounded by current use land. He contends that this court, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s order, should \u201cdisregard any enhancement factors regarding the valuation\u201d of the house site. However, the petitioner\u2019s <em>own </em>experts testified that such enhancement was proper. One of the petitioner\u2019s experts testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">Q. What\u2019s the benefit that\u2019s derived from a piece of property in your opinion that is not in current use, but [is] surrounded by land like this place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">A. Okay. It\u2019s not substantial. I would say it\u2019s about five percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">This expert also testified that in choosing sale properties to which to compare the petitioner\u2019s property, she \u201cwanted to acknowledge that\u201d because of the current use land \u201cthe home site had privacy and control over that privacy.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s other expert also testified that the fact that the house site was surrounded by current use land \u201cboost[ed]\u201d the value of the house site by five percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Moreover, the other experts testifying at trial <em>agreed </em>that the fact that the house site is surrounded by current use land enhanced its value. The Town\u2019s previous assessor, Alice McKinnon, who had set the prior year\u2019s assessment at $104,500, testified that \u201cthe house lot would be worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>more... with the current use land around it.\u201d She testified that if the house lot \u201cwere located somewhere else and . . . wasn\u2019t surrounded by land in current use, it would have been valued at $40,000,\u201d but that because it was surrounded by current use land, she \u201cenhanced that value by more than two . . . and a half times.\u201d Additionally, the Town\u2019s expert testified that it would be proper to enhance the value of the house site because it is surrounded by current use land, although he did not testify that he used such an enhancement in his appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Given this factual record, we conclude that the petitioner has not demonstrated that it preserved for our review the question of whether, as a matter of law, it is proper to enhance the value of land that is not in current use because it is surrounded by current use land. Not only did the petitioner fail to object to testimony that enhancing the value of the house site was proper, the petitioner was, in fact, the <em>proponent </em>of such testimony. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the issue is not preserved for our review, and we decline to address it. <em>See State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 279-80 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Alternatively, the petitioner asserts that we should allow only privacy and location to enhance the value of land surrounded by current use land and should not allow \u201cpassive recreational uses\u201d to enhance the value. As there is no evidence in the record submitted on appeal that the appraisal by the Town\u2019s expert, upon which the trial court relied, enhanced the value of the house site for this reason, we similarly decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The petitioner next contends that the trial court erred by adopting the opinion of the Town\u2019s expert because his methodology was flawed. The petitioner\u2019s assertions in this regard concern the proper weight to be accorded the testimony of the Town\u2019s expert. However, we defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment on such issues as resolving conflicts in the testimony, measuring the credibility of witnesses, and determining the weight to be given evidence. <em>Syncom Indus. v. Wood, </em>155 N.H. 73, 86 (2007). To the extent that the petitioner argues that it met its burden of proving disproportionality solely by showing that the methodology used by the Town\u2019s expert was flawed, we disagree. \u201c[D]isproportionality, and not methodology, is the linchpin in establishing entitlement to a petition for abatement.\u201d <em>Verizon New England v. City of Rochester, </em>151 N.H. 263, 272 (2004); <em>see Porter v. Town of Sanbornton, </em>150 N.H. 363, 369 (2003). \u201c[W]hile it is possible that a flawed methodology may lead to a disproportionate tax burden, the flawed methodology does not, in and of itself, prove the disproportionate result.\u201d <em>Verizon New England, </em>151 N.H. at 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>The petitioner next asserts that the trial court erred by accepting the assessment offered by the Town\u2019s expert and rejecting that offered by other experts. When faced with conflicting testimony, a trier of fact is free to accept or reject an expert\u2019s testimony, in whole or in part. <em>Tzimas v. Coiffures by Michael, </em>135 N.H. 498, 501 (1992). Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to credit the opinion of one expert over the opinions of other experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b760-4\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
