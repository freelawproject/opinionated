The first order denied his motion to enforce settlement. The second and third orders granted the town\u2019s motions for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The following facts are not in dispute. Huard owned and operated an automobile transmission repair business. In 2004, he purchased property at 3 Windham Road, located in a residential zone. He used the property for both residential and business purposes, believing that he could do so pursuant to a use variance granted to prior owners of the property in 1985. The 1985 use variance permitted repair of \u201ccarburetors, fuel pumps alternators, etc.\u201d In August 2006, Huard received a letter from the town\u2019s code compliance officer stating that \u201coperation of an automobile transmission repair business in a residential zone is not allowed,\u201d and that pursuant to article XIII, section 307-88(D) of the town\u2019s zoning ordinance, the 1985 use variance had expired due to non-use for one year or longer. <em>See </em>Pelham, N.H., Rev. Ordinances art. XIII, \u00a7 307-88(D) (2006) (repealed 2007) (\u201c[V]ariances not used for one (1) year or longer shall expire by operation of law at the end of said one year period.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Huard did not appeal the code compliance officer\u2019s decision that the use variance had expired. He did, however, apply for a new use variance in September 2006, which was denied. He did not file a motion for rehearing with the town\u2019s zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) upon its denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>request for a new variance. Instead, in May 2007, he filed a petition for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In March 2007, two months before Huard filed his petition, the town voted to repeal article XIII, section 307-88(D). In light of that change, town counsel drafted a stipulation to stay the superior court action pending further proceedings at the local level. Both parties signed the agreement, and the trial court approved it on October 30, 2007. The stipulation states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">1. [Huard] shall be allowed to resume use of the premises for the transmission repair business, pending a final order or other resolution of the Petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">2. The matter shall be stayed to allow the town\u2019s administrative official to make an administrative decision on the issue whether the original variance can be reasonably construed as permitting the proposed transmission repair use, or such other articulation of this issue as the administrator shall make. The administrative decision shall be made in light of the fact that the provision of the Pelham zoning ordinance that provides for the extinguishment of variances on grounds of discontinued use for a period of over one year has been repealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-8\">3. This administrative decision shall be made within 7 business days of the Court\u2019s approval of this stipulation, and shall be published by providing abutters . . . with notice of the decision by certified mail, and by posting copies in two public places. The notice shall state that an appeal may be taken within 30 days of the decision to the ZBA, and not thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">4. That the provisions of this Stipulation are without prejudice to the rights of the parties to assert such claims or defenses that they may have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">In accordance with the stipulation, the town\u2019s administrative official issued his decision, stating that the 1985 use variance \u201cremains in force today and reasonably encompasses transmission repairs ... as proposed by Huard.\u201d Subsequently, abutters appealed to the ZBA. The ZBA agreed that Huard\u2019s transmission repair business was within the scope of the 1985 variance. However, it also ruled, contrary to the administrative decision, that the 1985 variance had expired due to non-use for longer than one year as a result of a foreclosure on the property in 1989. The ZBA reasoned that, although use variances no longer expire due to non-use occurring after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>2007, the use variance at issue here expired many years earlier under the old zoning ordinance, and thus could not be revived simply because the ordinance had changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Huard filed a motion to enforce settlement, which was denied. The town filed two motions for summary judgment on the claims Huard raised in his May 2007 petition. In the first, the town argued, among other things, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over two of Huard\u2019s claims because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. In the second, the town argued that the ZBA\u2019s decision that Huard\u2019s variance had expired was not an unconstitutional taking. The trial court granted both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Huard first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to enforce settlement. He does not argue that the ZBA erred as a matter of law in finding that his variance was still subject to the repealed one-year expiration provision. He argues only that the ZBA\u2019s conclusion that the repealed ordinance applied to him violated the terms of the stipulation. We limit our analysis, accordingly, to whether the action by the ZBA violated the terms of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Huard essentially argues that the stipulation limited the scope of the local proceeding to one issue: whether his transmission repair business \u201cwas within the scope of the 1985 variance,\u201d and, therefore, that the ZBA\u2019s conclusion that his variance had expired contravenes the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. The town maintains that \u201c[a]ll events that followed from the Stipulation ... were legally permissible and contemplated under the Stipulation.\u201d In denying Huard\u2019s motion, the trial court did not specifically rule upon the meaning of the stipulation. It ruled only that: \u201cIt is clear to the Court that the parties did not have a mutual understanding of the terms of the agreement. There was no meeting of the minds.\u201d We apply the law relevant to our review of stipulations, and we reach the same result as the trial court, albeit on different grounds. <em>See In re Trailer and Plumbing Supplies, </em>133 N.H. 432, 438 (1990) (noting that when a trial court reaches the correct result, but on mistaken grounds, this court will sustain the decision if there are valid alternative grounds to support it).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">A stipulated agreement is contractual in nature and, therefore, is governed by contract rules. <em>Public Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Town of Seabrook, </em>133 N.H. 365, 370 (1990). The interpretation of a contract is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Czumak v. N.H. Div. of Developmental Servs., </em>155 N.H. 368, 373 (2007). When interpreting a written agreement, we give the language used by the parties its reasonable meaning, considering the circumstances and the context in which the agreement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>negotiated, and reading the document as a whole. <em>Id. </em>Absent ambiguity, the parties\u2019 intent will be determined from the plain meaning of the language used in the agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Huard\u2019s assertion that the stipulation limited the scope of the local proceedings to the single issue of whether his transmission repair business \u201cwas within the scope of the 1985 variance\u201d is contrary to its plain meaning. The stipulation states: \u201cThe matter shall be stayed to allow the town\u2019s administrative official to make an administrative decision on the issue whether the original variance can be reasonably construed as permitting the proposed transmission repair use, or such other articulation of this issue as the administrator shall make.\u201d The stipulation further states that abutters would be given notice, that appeals could be taken to the ZBA and that parties could assert such claims and defenses as they might have. The plain meaning of the stipulation does not establish an intent to abrogate the general powers of the ZBA to review an administrative decision. <em>See </em>Pelham, N.H., Rev. Ordinances art. XIII, \u00a7 307-83(A) (2006) (providing that the ZBA has \u201c[t]he power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any... decision ... made by an administrative official in the enforcement of the Zoning Chapter\u201d). By the same token, it does not place any limitation upon what a ZBA appeal proceeding would address or what the outcome of that proceeding would be. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying Huard\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Next, Huard argues that the trial court erred in granting the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment by concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his petition for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. He concedes that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies, but argues that he is not required to do so \u201cif it is obvious that it is a waste of time and will more likely than not result in the denial of his requests.\u201d He argues that he was entitled to proceed directly to the superior court to resolve the purely legal question of \u201cwhether the ZBA can reactivate a repealed zoning ordinance to achieve the result it seeks.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Although the town\u2019s motion requests summary judgment, we construe it as a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The general rule is that administrative remedies must first be exhausted before a party brings a matter to the courts. <em>See Prop. Portfolio Group v. Town of Derry, </em>154 N.H. 610, 616 (2006). The rule \u201cis particularly applicable when . . . substantial questions of fact exist concerning a city zoning ordinance, matters that belong in the first instance to the designated local officials.\u201d <em>V.S.H. Realty, Inc. v. City of Rochester, </em>118 N.H. 778, 782 (1978). \u201c[T]his sound rule is based on the reasonable policies of encouraging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the exercise of administrative expertise, preserving agency autonomy, and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cit is proper to permit the use of the declaratory judgment procedure to challenge the validity of a zoning ordinance ... where the question is one peculiarly suited to judicial rather than administrative treatment and no other adequate remedy is available.\u201d <em>Prop. Portfolio Group, </em>154 N.H. at 616-17 (quotation and ellipses omitted). Under these circumstances, a petitioner is not required to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Whether the one-year expiration provision applied to Huard\u2019s variance and whether his transmission repair business fell within the scope of the variance were both issues involving applications of the town\u2019s zoning ordinance to the facts of his case. These were not questions \u201cpeculiarly suited to judicial rather than administrative treatment.\u201d <em>Prop. Portfolio Group, </em>154 N.H. at 616-17 (quotation omitted). To the contrary, they are precisely the types of issues that involve \u201cfact[s]... concerning a... zoning ordinance, matters that belong in the first instance to the designated local officials.\u201d <em>V.S.H. Realty, Inc., </em>118 N.H. at 782. The ZBA, as the local authority, is better suited to make findings of fact with respect to the characteristics of Huard\u2019s property, the current use of other property in the area of 3 Windham Road, and the impact of the original use variance, all matters, in the first instance, of local concern. As for whether the one-year expiration provision applied to the use variance, resolution of this issue involved issues of fact with respect to the property\u2019s prior ownership and previous use, also matters not \u201cpeculiarly suited to judicial rather than administrative treatment.\u201d <em>Prop. Portfolio Group, </em>154 N.H. at 616-17 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Finally, Huard argues that the trial court erred in granting the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the town\u2019s actions were not an unconstitutional taking of his property. We note that he does not argue that article XIII, section 307-88(D) of the zoning ordinance is facially unconstitutional. He argues only that the town\u2019s application of the ordinance to his variance was an unconstitutional taking because he can no longer conduct his transmission repair business. Specifically, he contends that there were genuine issues of material fact and that we must, accordingly, remand the issue to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s initial grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Bel Air </em>Assocs. <em>v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>158 N.H. 104, 107 (2008) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf there is no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>summary judgment is proper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). An issue of fact is material if it affects the outcome of the litigation under the applicable substantive law. <em>N.E. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. City of Franklin, </em>141 N.H. 449, 452 (1996). We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Bel Air </em>Assocs., 158 N.H. at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We first address Huard\u2019s claim under the State Constitution, and cite federal opinions for guidance only. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 233 (1983) . Under Part I, Article 12 of the New Hampshire Constitution, \u201c[n]o part of a man\u2019s property shall be taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his consent.\u201d A governmental regulation can be a taking, even if the land is not physically taken, if it is an arbitrary or unreasonable restriction which substantially deprives the owner of the economically viable use of his land. <em>Burrows v. City of Keene, </em>121 N.H. 590, 597-98 (1981); <em>Smith v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>136 N.H. 337, 346 (1992). \u201cLimitations on use create a taking if they are so restrictive as to be economically impracticable, resulting in a substantial reduction in the value of the property and preventing the private owner from enjoying worthwhile rights or benefits in the property.\u201d <em>Pennichuck Corp. v. City of Nashua, </em>152 N.H. 729, 733-34 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">In Huard\u2019s objection to the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment and his accompanying affidavit, he failed to set forth any facts that would affect the outcome of the litigation under the applicable substantive law. Huard asserted that the garage where he repaired transmissions is \u201cunattractive.\u201d He further asserted that the inability to repair transmissions adversely affects the value of the property, but he did not present any evidence indicating to what degree. Without any supporting evidence, he contended that his property \u201ccannot be used for anything,\u201d but also conceded that \u201cthe house i[s] all right to live in.\u201d He further acknowledged that the owner from whom he bought the property operated a business other than transmission repair without objection from the town, indicating that a different type of business use is permissible on his property. In addition, his affidavit alleged that abutters were interested in purchasing his land, a fact which supports its economic viability. <em>See Claridge v. N.H. Wetlands Bd., </em>125 N.H. 745, 748 (1984) (noting that trial court\u2019s findings that land could be sold to abutters supported its conclusion that the property continued to have economic value).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">These assertions fail to support a claim that the ZBA\u2019s application of the zoning ordinance substantially denied him the economically viable use of his land. Although Huard may not be permitted to use the property precisely as he wishes, he has not demonstrated that a genuine issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>material fact exists as to whether the value of his property has been substantially destroyed. <em>See Funtown v. Town of Conway, </em>127 N.H. 312, 318 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Neither the procedural posture nor the facts of this case are like those at issue in <em>City of Keene v. Burrows, </em>121 N.H. 590 (1981). <em>Burrows </em>considered the question of whether Keene\u2019s designation of the plaintiffs\u2019 property as part of a conservation district constituted a taking requiring compensation under the State Constitution. <em>Burrows, </em>121 N.H. at 594, 601. In that case, the plaintiffs purchased 124 acres of woodland for the purpose of subdividing it into lots. <em>Id. </em>at 594. The city, seeking to preserve its open spaces, offered to buy the land from the plaintiffs, but at a cost far below their purchase price and its assessed value for tax purposes. <em>Id. </em>The parties could not agree to a sale price, and the plaintiffs went forward with their development plans. <em>Id. </em>at 595. Subsequently, the city amended its zoning ordinance to include 109 of the plaintiffs\u2019 124 acres in a conservation zone in which development was prohibited. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We held that the city\u2019s action constituted a taking under Part I, Article 12 of the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 601. We stated that the right to just compensation for a taking of property necessarily limits the police power and that the government cannot, through regulation, indirectly effect a taking without paying compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. We concluded that \u201c[f]rom the outset, it was plain that the city wished that the plaintiffs\u2019 land be devoted to open space,\u201d and, instead of paying for this result, obtained it by \u201cprohibiting] all normal private development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The expiration of a use variance is not equivalent to the prohibition of all normal private development. The record indicates that although transmission repairs are not permitted on Huard\u2019s property, other types of business may be permissible. Even if this is not the case, however, Huard purchased his property for both residential and business purposes, and he acknowledges that his ability to live in the house is unaffected by whether or not the property has a use variance. Further, the record is devoid of evidence regarding appraisals of the property or estimates of how the inability to repair transmissions on it affects its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The Federal Constitution offers Huard no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances. <em>See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 1019 (1992). Therefore, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>To the extent that Huard argues that the conduct of the ZBA violated his right to due process, this argument was not raised in the notice of appeal. Accordingly, we will not address it. <em>Guyotte v. O\u2019Neill, </em>157 N.H. 616, 623 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b596-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
