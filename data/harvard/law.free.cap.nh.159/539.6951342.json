The respondent, Town of Barrington (town), appealed the issuance to the New Hampshire Wetlands Council (wetlands council or council). The wetlands council remanded the matter to DES. Garrison Place now appeals. We reverse the wetlands council\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">The following facts are drawn from the administrative record. USA Springs, Inc. filed a request with DES for a large groundwater withdrawal permit pursuant to RSA chapter 485-C. On July 1, 2004, DES granted the withdrawal permit subject to certain conditions. Condition 5 required USA Springs to implement a wetlands monitoring program to track the impact of the large groundwater withdrawal on groundwater and wetlands, including Barrington Prime Wetland #40 (the prime wetland). Condition 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>set forth various \u201cMitigation Requirements\u201d to apply \u201c[i]n the event that adverse impacts occur.\u201d Condition 6 requires that USA Springs immediately stop or reduce the groundwater withdrawal if the monitoring devices detect any adverse impact on the water level of the prime wetland.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Garrison Place constructed six monitoring devices in and adjacent to the prime wetland. In November 2004, Garrison Place filed an after-the-fact request with DES to obtain a Prime Wetlands permit that would allow it to retain the six monitoring devices. DES may not issue such a permit \u201cunless the department is able, specifically, to find clear and convincing evidence on the basis of all information considered by the department, and after public hearing, that the proposed activity, either alone or in conjunction with other human activity, will not result in the significant net loss of any of the values set forth in RSA 482-A:l.\u201d RSA 482-A:ll, IV (Supp. 2008). DES approved Garrison Place\u2019s request for a wetlands permit. DES denied the town\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and the town appealed to the wetlands council.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The wetlands council denied the town\u2019s appeal. The town filed a motion for reconsideration, which the council granted in part. The council remanded the case to DES, finding \u201cthat DES failed, in its written decision, to properly separate and specify the \u2018clear and convincing evidence\u2019 it used to support its decision relative to the prime wetlands as required by RSA 482-A:ll, IV.\u201d Under the statutory scheme then in effect, decisions of the council were appealable to the superior court. RSA 482-A:10, VIII (2001) (amended 2008). Both parties appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On September 26, 2006, the superior court affirmed the decision of the wetlands council, ruling that \u201cDES did not specifically state [by clear and convincing evidence] that the activity will not result in a significant net loss.\u201d The superior court remanded the matter to DES to specify the clear and convincing evidence it relied upon to reach its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In October 2006, DES issued an amended decision. DES relied upon information acquired in the groundwater withdrawal permit proceedings and public hearings in determining that the installation and operation of the six monitoring devices would not result in the significant net loss of any values set forth in RSA 482-A:l. Specifically, DES determined that the installation and operation of the monitoring devices \u201caffects three very small areas\u201d and would \u201cnot damage or destroy the affected wetlands complex or adversely affect its natural functions and values in any significant way.\u201d It also found that Conditions 5 and 6 of the withdrawal permit assured that the large groundwater withdrawal would have no negative effect on the prime wetland because the monitoring devices would provide the data needed to require the reduction or the cessation of the large groundwater withdrawal. The town filed a motion for reconsideration, which DES denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The town appealed to the wetlands council. In September 2008, the council determined that DES had again failed to set forth the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d supporting its finding that there would be no significant loss to wetlands values. The council rejected DES\u2019 conclusion that the mitigation requirements of the groundwater withdrawal permit could serve as \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d because \u201cCondition 6 contemplates a scenario where there is an adverse impact to the prime wetland.\u201d The wetlands council, therefore, remanded the matter to DES to set forth \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d supporting its conclusion \u201cthat an impact to a prime wetland which triggers the mitigation requirement of Condition 6 of the [groundwater withdrawal permit] will not result in the significant net loss of any of the values set forth in RSA 482-A:l.\u201d Garrison Place moved for a rehearing, which the wetlands council denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Garrison Place argues the wetlands council acted unlawfully and unreasonably by: (1) \u201cfailing to follow the superior court\u2019s order that DES is required to accept as clear and convincing evidence in this proceeding the findings made in connection with the issuance of USA Springs\u2019 large groundwater withdrawal permit relative to [the prime wetland]\u201d; (2) \u201cconstruing the term \u2018other human activity\u2019 in RSA 482-A:ll, IV to encompass the large groundwater withdrawal permitted to USA Springs under RSA 485-C\u201d; and (3) \u201cnot treating the findings made in connection with the USA Springs\u2019 large groundwater withdrawal permit relative to [the prime wetland] as binding in this proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Our standard of review of the wetlands council\u2019s decision is set forth in RSA 541:13, which provides: \u201c[A]ll findings of the [wetlands council] upon all questions of fact properly before it shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable; and the order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law, unless the court is satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence before it, that such order is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d RSA 541:13 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">With respect to the first issue, we understand Garrison Place\u2019s argument to be that the wetlands council\u2019s order, ruling that DES failed to identify clear and convincing evidence that supports the issuance of the wetlands permit, was clearly unreasonable or unlawful. Addressing that issue requires us to consider the standard of review governing appeals to the wetlands council, which is set forth in RSA 482-A:10, V:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">The appeal shall be determined upon the record below. The burden of proof shall be on the party seeking to set aside the department\u2019s decision to show that the decision is unlawful or unreasonable. All findings of the department upon all questions of fact properly before it shall be prima facie lawful and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>See Greenland Conservation Comm\u2019n v. N.H. Wetlands Council, </em>154 N.H. 529, 544 (2006) (setting forth wetlands council\u2019s standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u201c[W]e first examine the language found in the statute and where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to words used.\u201d <em>State v. Cobb, </em>143 N.H. 638, 643 (1999) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond [it] for further indications of legislative intent.\u201d <em>State v. Comeau, </em>142 N.H. 84, 86 (1997) (quotation omitted). \u201cCourts can neither ignore the plain language of the legislation nor add words which the lawmakers did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Appeal of Astro Spectacular, </em>138 N.H. 298, 300 (1994) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Under the plain language of RSA 482-A-.10, V, the wetlands council\u2019s review of DES decisions is deferential. The party appealing to the council bears the burden of presenting \u201cthe [c]ouncil with a preponderance of clear and concise evidence that otherwise persuades the [c]ouncil such a decision was unreasonable and/or unlawful.\u201d <em>Greenland Conservation Comm\u2019n, </em>154 N.H. at 543. As noted by the council itself, the council \u201ccannot substitute its independent judgment of the facts and circumstances of a decision for that used by DES in its own deliberations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">DES found that \u201cthe installation and operation of the six specified monitoring devices, either alone or in conjunction with other human activity, will not result in the significant net loss of any of the values set forth in RSA 482-A:l.\u201d The DES decision that set forth the clear and convincing evidence was lengthy and detailed. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">a. The installation and operation of the six monitoring devices affects three very small areas totaling approximately two square feet. [The prime wetland] is approximately 29.1 acres in size (per Prime Wetland Report received March 18,1991). The installation and operation of the monitoring devices, including related human activity such as walking to the monitors and collecting data (without additional dredging, filling or constructing other structures) will not damage or destroy the affected wetlands complex or adversely affect its natural functions and values in any significant way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">b. On July 1,2004 the Department issued large Groundwater Withdrawal Permit No. LGWP-2004-0003 .... Condition 5 of the [groundwater withdrawal permit] specified the details of the location, installation, monitoring and reporting requirements for the six monitoring wells that are the subject of this permit. Condition 6 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the [groundwater withdrawal permit] specified the mitigation requirements in the event that adverse impacts, including adverse impact to wetlands, occur. Condition 6 requires that the groundwater withdrawals be reduced in a phased manner, or stopped completely, to mitigate or prevent adverse impacts to wetlands, including [the prime wetland]. The installation of the monitoring devices and collection of data from the monitoring devices assure that the large groundwater withdrawal authorized [sic] the [groundwater withdrawal permit] will have no negative effect on the health, vitality, and natural conditions of [the prime wetland] by providing the data needed to require reductions or the cessation of the large water withdrawals. The monitoring devices installed in [the prime wetland] assure that there will be no significant loss of any of the values set forth in RSA [482-A:l] as a result of the large groundwater withdrawal authorized by the [groundwater withdrawal permit].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">On appeal, the wetlands council concluded that the DES order was inadequate and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Condition 6 of the [groundwater withdrawal permit] concerns mitigation requirements in the event that there are adverse impacts to wetlands, including the prime wetland at issue. As Condition 6 contemplates a scenario where there is an adverse impact to the prime wetland, the Council finds and concludes that DES has not set forth the clear and convincing evidence it used to support its conclusion that such an impact will not result in the significant net loss of any of the values set forth in RSA 482-A:l.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We disagree. Under RSA 482-A:ll, IV, DES must determine whether \u201cthe proposed activity, either alone or in conjunction with other human activity\u201d will result in the significant net loss of any wetlands values. In paragraph a of its order, DES focused on the proposed activity of installing and operating the six monitoring devices. It specifically found that the devices, \u201cincluding related human activity such as walking to the monitors and collecting data,\u201d would not \u201cadversely affect [the prime wetland\u2019s] natural functions and values in any significant way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">In paragraph b, DES focused on the impact of other human activity, to wit, the groundwater withdrawal, on wetlands values. DES concluded that the monitoring devices \u201cassure that there will be no significant loss of any of the values set forth in RSA [482-A:l] as a result of the large groundwater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>withdrawal\u201d because the monitoring devices would \u201cprovid[e] the data needed to require reductions or the cessation of the large water withdrawals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In its analysis, the wetlands council stated that DES did not provide clear and convincing evidence that if the mitigation requirements of Condition 6 are triggered by an adverse impact \u201cthat such an impact will not result in the significant net loss of\u2019 wetlands values. As DES stated, however, such adverse impacts should not result in the significant loss of wetlands values because the monitoring devices themselves, in addition to the mitigation requirements of Condition 6, assure that groundwater withdrawal will be reduced or halted before any significant loss of RSA 482-A:l values occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">DES\u2019 findings are precisely the type that are entitled to deference under RSA 482-A:10, Y. Therefore, the wetlands council acted unreasonably in reversing the decision of DES. Because we reverse on this issue we need not address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Hicks and Conboy, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
