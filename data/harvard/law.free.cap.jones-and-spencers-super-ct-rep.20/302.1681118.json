Andrews, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqb\">I. The complaint is sufficient. The material allegations where the words are defamatory on their face, and in the English language, are : that defendant with malice (Viele <em>v. </em>Gray, 10 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>1), spoke in the hearing or presence of any persons (Wood <em>v. </em>Gilchrist, 1 <em>C. R. </em>117), concerning the plaintiff <em>{Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 535), the false, slanderous matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-8\">II. The words are actionable, <em>per se, </em>because they impute to plaintiff an indictable offense, and involving moral turpitude <em>(Penal Code, </em>\u00a7 322 ; Martin <em>v. </em>Stillwell, 13 <em>Johns. </em>275 ; Wright <em>v. </em>Paige, 36 <em>Barb. </em>438; 3 <em>Keyes, </em>581; Anon., <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>643; Brayne <em>v. </em>Cooper, 5 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>249 ; Huckle <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 1 <em>C. B. N. S. </em>114). It was therefore unnecessary to plead an innuendo or an averment that the words uttered were intended to impute the offense (More <em>v. </em>Bennett, 48 <em>N. Y. </em>472 ; Carroll <em>v. </em>White, 33 <em>Barb. </em>615 ; Croswell <em>v. </em>Weed, 25 <em>Wend. </em>621). It is sufficient to say they were uttered concerning the plaintiff (Wesley <em>v. </em>Bennett, 5 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>498; Malone <em>v. </em>Stilwell, 15 <em>Ib. </em>426 ; <em>Code Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 535).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-9\"><em>J. H. Whitelegge, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Q\">If the words charged to have been spoken, were in fact uttered by defendant, there is po fact therein disclosed whereby the court can determine that the language was applied to, or had the remotest reference to the plaintiff. The complaint alleges no facts showing either that plaintiff was \u201cthose people,\u201d or that she was \u201cup-st-airs,\u201d at any place at or near Ho. 11 Grand street, or elsewhere in that neighborhood, or that she was known there. The allegation that the words were spoken of, and \u201cconcerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>plaintiff,\u201d and the words :\u2014\u201c Meaning thereby this plaintiff,\u201d are insufficient to constitute a cause of action when connected with the alleged slanderous words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">The language charged to defendant relates to a plurality of people, having no relation to or with the plaintiff, so far as the complaint shows. In Fleishman <em>v. </em>Bennett) in which the main question involved was, whether the libelous language set up applied to the plaintiff, the court of appeals (87 <em>N. Y. </em>231), say : <em>\u201c </em>An innuendo in a complaint . . . does not enlarge the matter constituting the alleged libel, but only explains its application ; and when not justified by the alleged libelous statement to which it refers, so that rejecting it, the words are not libelous, a demurrer will He.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-6\">By the Court.\u2014Truax, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">Section 535 of the Code of Civil Procedure says that it is not necessary, in an action for Hbel or slander, to state in the complaint any extrinsic fact, for the purpose of showing the application to the plaintiff, of the defamatory matter ; but the plaintiff may state, generaHy, that it was published or spoken concerning him.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The words here are actionable <em>per se. </em>The only ex-, trinsic fact necessary for the plaintiff to show in order to maintain her action, is the fact that she was one of those people up-stairs. She has aUeged, in the words of the Code, that they were spoken \" \u2018 concerning \u201d her, and by demurring to the complaint, the defendant has admitted the truth of this aHegation. On the trial the plaintiff could have proved under this allegation, that she was one of those people up-stairs (Wesley <em>v. </em>Bennett, 6 <em>Duer, </em>688 ; 5 <em>Abb. </em>498 ; Malone <em>v. </em>Stilwell, 15 <em>Ib. </em>421 ; Parker <em>v. </em>Raymond, 3 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>343).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">This case is to be distinguished from the case of Fleischmann <em>v. </em>Bennett (87 <em>N. Y. </em>231). In that case the libelous article assailed the firm of Gaff, Fleischmann &amp; Co., but the plaintiff alleged, and on the demurrer it was taken as true, that he was not, and never had been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>member of that firm, and, therefore, the court held that the words used had no application to the plaintiff. It is as though the plaintiff in this case, had alleged that she was not one of \u201cthose \u00a1Deople up-stairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The judgment and order appealed from are reversed, and a new trial is ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Sedgwick, Oh. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
