One of the cases in which the right to arrest depends on the nature of the action, is where the action is brought to recover damages for a personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>(\u00a7 519). In this case, the person of the plaintiff was injured through the negligence of the defendant, who has been arrested on an execution against the person. This execution he moves to set aside, on the ground that the words personal injury, in section 519, as defined by section 3313, mean only libel, slander, criminal conversation, seduction, malicious prosecution, assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other actionable injury, of like nature, to the person of the plaintiff, or of another. That is, that the defendant can be arrested only when the injury is willful. This construction is opposed to the authorities (Haines <em>v. </em>Joralemon, 2 <em>Civ. Pro. [McC.] </em>196 ; Keeler <em>v. </em>Clark, 18 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>151; Miller <em>v. </em>Scherder, 2 <em>N. Y. </em>262), and is not warranted by the Code, for section 553 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a woman cannot be arrested except . . . for a willful injury to person, character or property; in other words, a man may be arrested for any injury to the person of another, while a woman can only he arrested for a willful injury to the person of another.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b255-7\"><em>Boot &amp; Strong, </em>attorneys, and <em>Theron H. Strong, </em>of counsel for appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Aq6Y\">I. The provisions of the Code relating to executions against the person, are not intended to and do not warrant the issue of an execution against the person in an action for negligence. By settled rules of statutory construction the words \u201c other actionable injury\u201d are limited and restrained by the words which precede them to other actionable injuries of the very same kind as those specified, <em>(a) </em>The actions specified all involve the elements of willful injury, one in which the intent of the author of the injury is prominent. Hone of them are cases of omission ; all are cases of commission, in which the direct, positive and intentional act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>of a person produces injury to another. They are none of them cases of carelessness ; all are cases of willfulness. (6) There are many other instances not mentioned, of actionable injuries of the same nature as those specified, to which the term \u201cother actionable injury\u201d applies, such as nuisances by obstructing highways, placing a spring gun or trap on land over which others are licensed to pass, keeping mischievous animals, leasing property infected with contagious diseases, and other actions of a like nature, (c) It is to such cases that the words, \u201cother actionable injury\u201d apply. \u201cWhere general words follow particular words, the rule is to construe the former as to things or persons particularly mentioned \u201d <em>(Sedgwick Statutory Constr. </em>360 ; Sandman <em>v. </em>Breach, 7 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>96 ; St. Louis <em>v. </em>Laughlin, 49 <em>Mo. </em>559 ; State <em>v. </em>Pemberton, 30 <em>Ib. </em>376 ; <em>Maxwell\u2019s Interpretation Statutes, </em>297 ; Kitchen <em>v. </em>Shaw, 6 <em>A. &amp; E. </em>729; Williams <em>v. </em>Golden, <em>L. R. 1 C. &amp; P. </em>69 ; Rex <em>v. </em>Sanders, 9 <em>C. &amp; P. </em>79 ; Clark <em>v. </em>Gaskarth, 8 <em>Taunt. </em>431; <em>Hardcastle\u2019s Statutory Laws, </em>83 ; Ashbury Co. <em>v. </em>Riche, <em>L. R. </em>7 <em>H. L. </em>653 ; <em>Potter\u2019s Dwarris Statutes, </em>292 ; Rex <em>v. </em>Manchester Co., 1 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>630 ; Casher <em>v. </em>Holmes, 2 <em>B. &amp; Ad. </em>592; East London Water Works <em>v. </em>Mile End Town, 17 <em>Q. B. </em>512). In Trustees Exempt Fireman\u2019s Fund <em>v. </em>Boome (93 <em>N. Y. </em>313), it was held that a case may be within the law and yet not within the intention of the legislature (Citing People <em>ex rel. </em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Davenport, 91 <em>N. Y. </em>574 ; People <em>v. </em>Fire Association of Phila., 92 <em>Ib. </em>311).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201cIf the construction contended for by the defendant were the right one, section 553 would be.unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u201cThe motion to vacate the order of arrest is denied, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>II. It is confidently claimed that the words \u201c other actionable injury,\u201d being general words following particular words, are restrained and limited by the latter, and the learned judge at special term plainly erred in supposing that this construction was opposed to the authorities, or rendered section 553, unnecessary, (a) The cases cited in the opinion are not authorities on this question (Weber <em>v. </em>Black, 18 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>154; Miller <em>v. </em>Scherer, 2 <em>N. Y. </em>262 ; Haines <em>v. </em>Jerolomon, 2 <em>Civ. Pro. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>Rep, </em>[McC.] 196), are to be distinguished. (6) Nor is section 553 rendered unnecessary. The learned justice supposed otherwise, because the word \u201cwillful,\u201d in connection with the words \u201c injury to person,\u201d would be unnecessary. But this cannot be correct, for, if the section was abrogated, a woman might be arrested whenever a man could be. The section is necessary to limit a female\u2019s liability to arrest, and the present question of construction has nothing to do with the matter of necessity. The construction contended for, takes nothing away from section 553 ; it repeals nothing ; it nullifies nothing. Section 3343 leaves section 553 to stand as before, but applies the same rule to men respecting personal injuries which applied to women, The most that could be claimed would be that the word \u2018\u00a3willful \u201d might, upon the rule of construction contended for, be unnecessary in connection with the words \u201c injury to person,\u201d but it is plainly necessary in conuection with the words \u201ccharacter or property,\u201d and this would hardly be a reason for remodelling the entire section. But section 549 was enacted long before section 3343, and was really a re-enactment of section 179 of the old Code, passed before any limitation or definition of the term \u201c personal injury.\u201d So far, however, from defeating the construction claimed, it aids it\u2014the definition of the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d manifesting a disposition to harmonize and unify the grounds of arrest respecting both sexes.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">III. The construction contended for is also supported by legislative intent, as manifested, and by the course of judicial decision. The provision in the old Code was much broader even than in the present Oode, the expression there being \u201c or where the action is for an injury to person or character \u201d (\u00a7 179), thus including all possible injuries either of omission or commission where character or person was involved <em>(Code Pro. </em>\u00a7 179 ; see \u00a7 228 as to executions against the person). And yet Judge Freedman questioned its applicability to <em>all </em>forms of action, and denied its application to a case of death through negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>gence, although such a case was really within the letter of the law (Ryall <em>v. </em>Kennedy, 41 <em>Super. Ct. </em>531). The present Code is by no means so broad,1 omitting the words, \u201cinjury to character,\u201d and restricting somewhat the words injury to person, and defining their limitation (\u00a7 549, as explained by \u00a7 3343). But it can never be that the legislature could intend such a rule, if adopted, to be other than of general application, and yet how impossible of general application it would be if it prevailed. In cases against the mayor, aldermen, &amp;c., against whom would the execution run? In cases against railroad corporations, express companies, steamship lines, building corporations, are they all to be exempt because the rule does not admit of practical application, and yet enforce it as against mere private owners of real property or common conveyances ? No rule so discriminating or unjust could be within the legislative intent. The course of decision is also in favor of the construction contended for (Parker <em>v. </em>Spear, 49 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>2; 62 <em>How. Pr. </em>394; Ryall <em>v. </em>Kennedy, 41 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>531; Davis <em>v. </em>Scott, 15 <em>Abb. </em>227; Gribbs <em>v. </em>Larabee, 23 <em>Wis. </em>495 ; Etna Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Schuler, 28 <em>Hun, </em>338 ; Catlin <em>v. </em>Adirondack Co., 81 <em>N. Y. </em>689, reversing 20 <em>Hun, </em>19).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b258-5\"><em>Bichard S. Newcombe, </em>attorney, and <em>Albert Cardozo, </em>of counsel for respondent, argued:</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AAL\">I. Section 1487 authorizes execution against the person : 1. Where the right to arrest the defendant depends on the nature of the action. Section 549 provides for arrest in actions : Subd. 2. \u201cTo recover damages for a personal injury.\u201d And by section 3343, subd. 9, it is declared that \u201ca personal injury\u201d includes libel, slander, criminal conversation, seduction, malicious prosecution, also an assault, battery, false imprisonment, or other actionable injury to the person either of the plaintiff or of another. The provision is as broad as it can be ; it specifies some, and in order to be full and general, it adds, \u201cor other actionable injury to the person,\u201d etc. That the cause of complaint in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>case was an actionable \u201cinjury to the person,\u201d admits of no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">II. That an execution may be issued against the body in an action based on negligence was decided in Catlin <em>v. </em>Adirondack Co. (20 <em>Hun, </em>19). See Parker <em>v. </em>Spear (62 <em>How. Pr. </em>394); \u00c6tna Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Shuler (28 <em>Ib. </em>340).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">III. The case of Ryall <em>v. </em>Kennedy (41 <em>Super. Ct. </em>531), relied on by the defendant, decided only that an action brought by an administrator for the killing of the intestate was not an action for personal injuries. But Ryall <em>v. </em>Kennedy has no relevancy to the present question. It was decided in 1877, and was based upon sections 288,179, 181 of the Code as then existing.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">IV. This construction is maintained by a comparison of the sections of the Code. Section 553 provides that a woman cannot be arrested except for willful injury ; but there is no such restriction as respects a man.</p>\n<author id=\"b259-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A-f\">The order should be affirmed with costs upon the opinion of the learned judge at special term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
