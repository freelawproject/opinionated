Hardy, </em>attorney, and of counsel for appellant, as affecting the questions considered in the opinion argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1D\">I. Where several unite in an assault and battery, all are equally responsible for the entire damages ; one cannot excuse himself by showing the insignificance of his participation, as, compared with that of the others ; and the person injured can elect which particular one of the number he will sue to the exclusion of the others ; he may sue any or all <em>(Cooley on Torts, </em>134 <em>; </em>2 <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>\u00a7 621; Bishop <em>v. </em>Ely, 9 <em>Johns. </em>294 ; Hume <em>v. </em>Oldacre, 1 <em>Stark. </em>351; Bell <em>v. </em>Morrison, 27 <em>Miss. </em>68).</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-11\">II. It was assault and battery to lay hands upon the plaintiff with intent to eject, him from his tavern. He was at least tenant at will, and the defendant, lessee, could not repossess himself of the premises as against such a tenant, either by force or otherwise, until the expiration of at least thirty days\u2019 notice to quit, under the statute (3 <em>R. S. </em>[7 ed.] p. 2201, P. II., C. I., T. IV., \u00a77 ; Jackson <em>ex d. </em>Livingston <em>v. </em>Bryan, 1 <em>Johns. </em>322 ; Larned <em>v. </em>Hudson, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>104). But the 1st May, 1883, having passed without the duration of plaintiff\u2019s occupancy of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>premises after said date, being specified between the parties, the defendant became a tenant for one year to May 1, 1884 (2 <em>R. S. </em>[7 ed.] p. 2200, \u00a7 1; <em>McAdam Landlord &amp; Tenant, </em>32-36; Tuomey <em>v. </em>Dunn, 42 <em>Super. Ct. </em>291; <em>Washburn Real Prop. </em>512 ; Jackson <em>ex dem. </em>Livingston <em>v. </em>Bryan, <em>supra). </em>The entry by defendant with intent to deforce plaintiff, was trespass (Littlejohn <em>v. </em>Attrill, 94 <em>N. Y. </em>619 ; <em>Cooley on Torts, </em>316, and cases ; Six Carpenter\u2019s Case, 8 <em>Co. </em>290 ; S. C., 1 <em>Smith\u2019s L. C. </em>216 ; 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>212, 213). When plaintiff was locked out of his front door he did not lose his possession ; for his absence was temporary, and he left his goods and servants upon the premises, and his entry at the side door was rightful <em>(Cooley on Torts, </em>322, 324, and cases ; Littlejohn <em>v. </em>Attrill, <em>supra; </em>1 <em>Phillips Ev. </em>201; <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>\u00a7 108). Whether he had once lost his possession or not, when the plaintiff had again promptly effected actual entrance into his premises, his presence there was lawful and of right, and his use of force to get in could not qualify his legal right to remain there (Hyatt <em>v. </em>Wood, 4 <em>Johns. </em>150 ; Estes <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 8 <em>Wend. </em>555 ; Filkins <em>v. </em>People, 69 <em>N. Y. </em>101, 105 ; 1 <em>Washburn Real Prop. </em>530, \u00a7\u00a7 30, 537, 539 ; Jackson <em>ex </em>dem. Stansbury <em>v. </em>Farmer, 9 <em>Wend. </em>201 ; Ives <em>v. </em>Ives, 13 <em>Johns. </em>235 ; Wilde <em>v. </em>Cantillon, 1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>123 ; Wood <em>v. </em>Phillips, 43 N. <em>Y. </em>157). There can be no forcible entry as against a mere trespasser, for where the rightful occupant asserts his rights promptly, the trespasser cannot acquire even naked possession <em>(Cooley on Torts, </em>322, 324, cases cited, and authorities, <em>supra). </em>And, as a question of civil rights (as distinguished from the rights of the people), at issue in a civil court in a civil action, the plaintiff would have been fully justified in using force to defend his possession and his goods, and even to put the defendant and his party out of the place (Bliss <em>v. </em>Johnson, <em>N. Y. </em>534 ; <em>Cooley on Torts, </em>322, 324, cases and authorities, <em>supra). </em>And the plaintiff, when he had entered his side door, being in actual possession of premises to which he had the right of possession, the act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the defendant and his confederates in thrusting him out, was an assault and battery (Woods <em>v. </em>Phillips, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>157).</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-5\"><em>George W. Savage, </em>attorney, and <em>John </em>D. <em>Townsend, </em>of counsel for respondent, as bearing on the questions considered in the opinion, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATm4\">I. The plaintiff, upon the evidence, was a tenant at will, and, had he required it, would have been entitled to a month\u2019s notice in writing before he could have been deprived of possession (Larned <em>v. </em>Hudson, 60 <em>N. Y. </em>104; 3 <em>R. S. </em>2201, \u00a7 7, Banks\u2019 7th ed).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">II. The plaintiff was not forcibly evicted. He left the premises of his own volition, after full knowledge that the defendant had sold them to another party, and had demanded possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">HI. Being thus out of possession the plaintiff had no right to use force in attempting to regain possession of the premises (Pollen <em>v. </em>Brewer, 7 <em>C. B. [N. S] </em>371; Parsons <em>v. </em>Brown, 15 <em>Barb. </em>590 ; Sampson <em>v. </em>Henry, 11 <em>Pick. </em>387).</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">IV. As matter of fact, the defendant himself neither assaulted the plaintiff nor aided or abetted any one else in doing so.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ATq\">The learned judge below, on all the testimony, dismissed the complaint. So far as this was done on the ground that there was no evidence that the defendant made either an assault or battery upon the plaintiff, two things are to be said. First, there was some testimony that the defendant pushed the plaintiff. Second, although the greater part of the violence done to the plaintiff, as he testified, was done by others than the defendant, there was testimony enough to take the verdict of the jury as to whether the defendant, being present, did not instigate and encourage those who actually used physical violence upon the plaintiff. If he did, in legal effect he was guilty of assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The important question is whether the persons who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>used the force upon the plaintiff, were justified in that, upon the ground that there was no more force used than was necessary to prevent the plaintiff entering into possession of premises, of which the defendant or his vendee were rightfully in possession, while the plaintiff had no right of possession. The premises referred to were a barroom, which had fixtures belonging to plaintiff, and another room opening into the bar-room. There was there other property belonging to the plaintiff. The defendant was a lessee of the premises. By an agreement it clearly appeared that the defendant had allowed the plaintiff to go into possession of the premises for the purpose of doing business there. The plaintiff was in possession in his own right, and not as servant or agent of the defendant. On a day in February, the defendant, without any former notice to the plaintiff to remove from the premises, entered them in company with several others and told the plaintiff that he must leave at once, he the defendant having sold the place to one of the persons. The plaintiff asserted that the place was his, and he had a right to remain. He in no way yielded or acquiesced in the demand made by the defendant, unless he did so by the following conduct on his part:\u2014For the purpose of giving a message to a boy, to be taken to his lawyer, he went to the front door and stood near it for a moment, when those on the inside shut the door and locked it. These facts do not incontrovertibly show that the plaintiff voluntarily abandoned possession to the defendant. There are some strong indications to the contrary. At least the verdict of the jury have been taken on this point. If the plaintiff did not voluntarily abandon or surrender the possession of the premises, the defendant or his vendee did not go into possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On the facts, that in this case show the rights of the opposing parties, it would seem that the plaintiff\u2019s right to possession had not been ended by the notice to leave at once, but could be ended only upon giving a reasonable time within which to remove. If other facts were known, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>it might be possible to say whether the law had fixed the time of notice. It is only necessary now to say that notice to leave forthwith was not enough, the plaintiff being in by consent of defendant, and not therefore, a trespasser or anything of that nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On the notice that was given, as it was accompanied by a notice to the plaintiff to get his property together, he would be rightfully in possession until a time proper for such a transaction should pass. But it' seem clear from any point of view that he had not left the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">On the front door being locked, he went to a back door to the rooms, broke it open and entered. Forthwith, the parties inside attacked him, used the violence that has been referred to, and forced him outside of the door, and the vendee of the defendant has remained since then in occupation. As it has been determined that the plaintiff had not gone out of possession and the defendant or his vendee had not entered into it, or that it does not appear so uncontrovertibly, the defendant\u2019s violence, if he were guilty of it, was used to put the plaintiff out of possession by force, and this was illegal, and the force was not used to prevent the plaintiff entering forcibly upon the defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">There were facts that entitled the plaintiff at least to a verdict of the jury as to whether he had left or abandoned possession, before he attempted to re-enter through the back door, and as to whether the defendant was guilty of assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
