The omission of Baker, as justice of the peace, to fender a judgment on the verdict, within the proper time, was a failure on his part to perform a judicial act required by law, but does not constitute a breach of his bond conditioned that he \u201cshall well and truly perform every <em>ministerial </em>act that is enjoined \u25a0\u2022upon him by law, and by virtue of said office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
