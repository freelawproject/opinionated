Smiley after the taking effect of the act of April 3, 1861 (S. &amp; S. 389), which provides that the \u201crights in action,\u201d etc., of any married woman, belonging to her at her marriage, shall \u201cbe and remain her separate property, and under her sole control.\u201d At the time of her marriage the husband was indebted to her for personal services, and upon his death she brought an action against his administrator to recover the debt. The common pleas and district courts of Ashland county held that she was not entitled to recover, and she now asks leave to file a petition in error to reverse their judgments.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-8\"><em>Burns &amp; Dickey, </em>for the motion:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-9\">Prior to the passage of the act of 1861 (S. &amp; S. 389), the husband, by virtue of the marital relation, possessed the absolute right to reduce to possession the choses in action of the wife against her will. Therefore, in cases like the present, where, by the marriage, the husband became incapable to take any active steps further to reduce such choses in action to possession, it was held that the marriage, by operation of-law, operated as such reduction. <em>We </em>understand this to be the principle announced in 7 Ohio St. 30. To decide the case at bar against us, the court must hold that there are some rights belonging to a woman at her marriage, which <em>shall not remain her separate property, and under her sole control. </em>If the legislature intended the exception, why was it not made by express provision ? Power <em>v. </em>Lester, 17 How. Pr. 413, is directly in point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-10\"><em>McCombs &amp; Curtis, </em>contra:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-11\">The debt claimed from the estate of the plaintiff\u2019s deceased hus544] band was extinguished by the marital relation. 1 Ld. *Raym. 515; Cro, Car. 551; 1 Bla.

The legislature certainly did not intend by that act that such a claim, after remaining for perhaps fifty years or more in abeyance, bearing interest, without the means of enforcing payment, should survive to the wife. See Curtis <em>v. </em>Brooks, 37 Barb. 476.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b505-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa2\">Leave must be refused. A debt due to a woman is extinguished by her intermarriage with the debtor. The statute of 1861 only operates upon debts of hers not so extinguished, and can not be construed as reviving the debt after her husband\u2019s decease, and enabling her to recover it from his administrator. It. was not intended by the act to create for her new rights, but simply to take away the husband\u2019s control over such as she had.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\n<em>Leave refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
