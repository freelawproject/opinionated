Brown <em>v. </em>The State of Ohio.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-5\">I. By the act of April 12, 1858 (2 S. &amp; C. Stat. 1606, sec. 15), the party advising, aiding, or participating in an embezzlement of public money, by an officer or person intrusted with it, is himself guilty of embezzlement, although he be not himself an officer, or person intrusted with public money.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A-j\">2.. In an indictment under that act, it is sufficient to allege that the money embezzled was public money, belonging to the several municipalities named in the act, or to one or more of them, without stating the respective amounts belonging to each.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-7\">3. Nor is it necessary that the jury in their verdict of guilty should find these specific amounts, provided they find the whole amount embezzled.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-9\">4. A description of one of said municipalities as \u201can organized <em>borough </em>and village,\u201d is a good description of an organized village.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A0ZN\">f&gt;. An indictment charging the defendant with taking public money from the possession of the officer, by the consent and assistance of the latter, is an indictment for participating and aiding in an embezzlement committed by the officer, and is not an indictment for larceny.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-11\">6. The crime of advising, aiding, or participating in an embezzlement by a public officer, is made by said act a distinct and substantive offense, and the party guilty of it may be put upon his trial and convicted, before the conviction of the embezzling officer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-13\">7. \"Where parties are jointly indicted, the court has power, upon good cause shown, to order a change of venue as to either of the defendants, upon his motion alone.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-15\">\u20228. Such motion and order necessarily involve and include a motion and order for a separate trial of the party making the motion, and have all the force and effect of a motion and order for both purposes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-16\">9. Where a <em>venire </em>for a struck jury is set aside on motion of defendant, and a new jury is, by order of the court, drawn, summoned, and impaneled in the cause, without objection from the defendant, this is no error in the proceeding of which a defendant can avail himself.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-18\">10. Where separate trials are awarded to parties jointly indicted, each is a competent witness for the state upon the trial of the other, without being first acquitted or convicted, and without a <em>nolle prosequi </em>being first entered upon the indictment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-19\">II. The' fact that such accomplice has committed perjury On a former examination, touching the same subject-matter, even where he admits the fact upon his present examination, but where ho has not been legally convicted of the perjury, only affects *his credit, and does not render him in- '[497 competent, or necessarily render his testimony incredible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b461-20\">12. It is not error in the court to instruct the jury that they may find the defendant guilty upon the testimony of such accomplice, corroborated as to one or more material facts by other reliable evidence, nothwithstanding his infamy and complicity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>13. A general verdict of guilty against a party charged with aiding and participating in an embezzlement by a public officer is sufficient, without finding directly or specifically that the officer is guilty of the embezzlement charged.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-5\">14. Under such an indictment, it is not necessary that the jury should find-whether the act of the defendant was an act of aiding or an act of participation in the embezzlement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-6\">15. The rule that a general verdict upon several counts will be sustained where-either count is good, applies as well to that part of the verdict finding the-amount of monej' embezzled as it does to that part which finds the general, guilt of the defendant. . <em>(</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-8\">16. Where the defendant is shown to have made false statements, which from\u2019 their nature might have been prompted either by his guilt of the crime-charged, or by other sinister motives, it is not error in the court to refuse tc instruct the jury to which motive they should rather attribute it, and leave the question of motive to the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-9\">17. Proof of a continuous series of conversions of money by an officer to the use of another, in pursuance of a conspiracy between them, will support a verdict of the jury finding the aggregate sum as the amount of a single, embezzlement.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\">Error to the court of common pleas of Licking county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-11\">' This case is very voluminous. The record contains over seven* hundred pages, the charge of the court covers fifty-six pages, and-there are twenty-four assignments of. error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-12\">The original case was an indictment found at the April term, 1867, of the court of common pleas of Coshocton county, charging* Samuel Ketchum, the treasurer of the county, with embezzlement,, and the plaintiff in error, James M. Brown, with advising, aiding,, and participating in the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-13\">The indictment is founded on the 15th section of the act of April 12,1858. 2 S. &amp; C. 1606. That section, so far as applicable to the-present case, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-14\">\u201cThat if any officer or other person charged with the collection, receipt, safe-keeping, transfer, or disbursement of the public money,, or any part thereof, belonging to the state, or to any county, township, or organized city or village in this state, shall convert to his own use, or to the use of any other person or persons, body corpoporate, association, or party whatever, in any way whatever; . . . or if any person shall advise, aid, or participate in any such act, every such act shall he deemed and held in law to be an embezzle-498] mont of so *much of the said moneys ... as shall be-thus converted; which is hereby declared to be a high crime and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>misdemeanor, and, upon prosecution, trial by indictment, and conviction thereof, before any court of this state having jurisdiction thereof, such officer, or person or persons, shall be sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary, . . . and also to a fine equal to' double the amount of money ... so embezzled as aforesaid, . . . to be enforced by execution, . . . for the use only of the party or parties whose money . . . has been so embezzled. Any failure or refusal to pay over or produce the public money, or any part thereof, ... or to account to, or make settlement with, any proper and legal authority, of the official accounts of such officer or person, shall be held and taken as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of such embezzlement. And upon the trial of any such officer or person, ... it shall be sufficient evidence, for the purpose of showing a balance against him, to produce a transcript from the books of the auditor of state, or comptroller of the treasury, or the auditor of the county, or the records of the commissioners of the of the county,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajr\">The indictment contains six counts. The first and second counts were abandoned on the trial, and need not be further noticed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">In the third, fourth, and sixth counts, it is charged that Ketchum converted the money to the use of Brown, and that Brown aided in the act; and in two of them \u2014 the third and fourth \u2014 that he aided and participated in the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-10\">The fifth count charges, substantially, that Brown, with the consent and by the assistance of Ketchum, took the money from the treasury, which was in the possession of Ketchum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-11\">In each of the four counts not abandoned, the public money charged to have been converted is described as twenty-two thousand and thirty-six dollars. In three of them \u2014 the fourth, fifth, and sixth, it is alleged to be money belonging to the State of Ohio, the county of Coshocton, the several townships therein, and an organized village (or, as it is described in one count, an organized <em>borough </em>and village) therein, but without stating the amount belonging to each, or to either municipality. In the other count \u2014 \u25a0 the third \u2014 the several amounts ^belonging to the state, the [499 county, and the village, and the aggregate amounts belonging to the townships, are given, with an averment that the several amounts belonging to the respective townships are unknown to the grand jury-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-13\">Upon being arraigned, Brown pleaded not guilty, and on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>motion, and good cause shown, the venue of the trial, <em>as to him, </em>was, by order of the court, changed to the adjoining county of Licking, and the papers and proceedings duly certified and forwarded to the court of common pleas of the latter county, agreeably to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">Before the' trial term in Licking county, on application of Brown, a struck jury was drawn,-and a venire issued and served upon them. But upon return of the venire the court, on motion of Brown, set the venire aside, for the reason that it had no seal, and by order of the court, and without any objection from Brown, a new jury was drawn and summoned to try the case; and no new venire was ever issued for the struck jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">\"When the case was called for trial, Brown objected and protested that he could not lawfully be put upon his trial till Ketchum should be first convicted; but the court overruled the objection, and the trial proceeded. The same question was afterward raised by motion to instruct the jury that Brown could not be tried or convicted until Ketchum should bo first convicted, and the court overruled the motion. To all which Brown excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">Brown then asked the court to order the prosecuting attorney to \u2022elect whether he would go to trial upon the fifth count alone, or upon the other five counts of the indictment, on the alleged ground that the fifth count charged a larceny, and the other counts an embezzlement. But the court held that the fifth count was a count for \u2022embezzlement, and overruled the motion. To which Brown also \u2022excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">On the trial of the case, at the January term, 1869, the prosecuting attorney called - said Samuel Ketchum as a witness, and Brown objected to him as such, on the ground that ho stood indicted as a co-defendant, and could not therefore be a witness until he was acquitted or convicted, or otherwise disharged from the in-.500] dictment. This objection was overruled, *and exception \u2022duly taken, and Ketchum was sworn and examined as a witness in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">The jury returned a verdict of not guilty upon the two counts which were abandoned, and a general verdict of guilty upon the last four counts, finding by their verdict that the money so embezzled was \u201ctwenty thousand dollars,\u201d without further specification as to the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\"><em>A </em>motion for a new trial was made by Brown, alleging, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>.\u25a0grounds therefor, among other things, that the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence, and that one of the jurors was disqualified. This motion was overruled, and Brown was sentenced to the penitentiary for five years, and adjudged to pay a fine of forty thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">The ground of objection to the juror need not be set forth, as this court hold that it was not sustained by proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">A bill of exceptions, accompanying the record, embodies all the \u2022evidence, as well as the charge of the court. It also sets forth various rulings of the court, in regard to the admission and rejection \u25a0of testimony upon the trial, and certain charges asked, on behalf of Brown, to be given to the jury, and refused by the court. \u25a0Only a small part of the bill of exceptions need be set forth, in order to an understanding of the points decided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">The only direct evidence in the case was the testimony of Ketchum. All the other evidence was circumstantial, and of itself inconclusive, but was relied Upon as corroborant of his story. To understand the points made in regard to this corroborating evidence, and some of the instructions refused by the court, it will be necessary to -set forth the substance of Ketehum\u2019s testimony. It \u2022was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">Ketchum was treasurer of Cochocton county for the years 1858 and 1859. Just before the June settlement, 1858, he found himself a defaulter to the amount of some $2,000. He confidentially made known the fact to Brown, and borrowed of him $3,000, \u201c to \u25a0carry him past the June settlement,\u201d giving to Brown his note and mortgage for the amount. This loan was repaid out of the first money coming into the treasury; but Brown refused to give up the note and mortgage, and suggested to Ketchum that he was liable to a prosecution for the embezzlement. In August or September, 1858, ^Ketchum assented to a scheme which had been [501 frequently urged upon him by Brown, to deliver over to Brown all \u25a0the money that should come into the treasury that season, and then get up a pretended robbery of the treasury. In pursuance \u2022of' this scheme, Ketchum delivered to Brown, at various times, and in sums not recollected, some $15,000 prior to the 21st of January, 1859. On the night of the last-named day the robbery was <em>enacted. </em>That is to say, Ketchum delivered to Brown the money \u25a0still remaining in the treasury, being some $5,000 or $6,000, and, by the assistance of Brown, caused himself to be \u201cgagged\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>securely bound. Brown retired with the money, and Ketchum remained lying upon the fioqr of the office, in this helpless condition, till a'late hour of the night, when he made some outciy and was relieved by his friends. He can not state the exact amount so converted to Brown\u2019s use, but it was the whole amount of his defalcation, as ascertained and stated in his subsequent settlements with the county and state authorities, less the $2,000 defalcation which existed at the settlement in June, 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-4\">Ketchum also says that, shortly before the robbery, Brown exacted from him the execution of a promissory note to Brown for $18,000, and two smaller notes, as a guaranty that Ketchum would not \u201cgo back on him\u201d \u2014 that is, would not take any one else into the scheme, or inform on Brown. He also says, in substance, that Brown forged the name of one Ferguson to the $18,000 note, and procured him, Ketchum, to certify in writing that he saw Ferguson sign the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">Ketchum admitted in his examination that he had committed 'willful and corrupt perjury on several occasions in regard to this matter. He and Brown kept the affair a secret between them for six or seven years. During this time, two innocent, persons were arrested and indicted for the supposed robbery, and Ketchum testified in their cases to a real robbery, committed by two men somewhat of their appearance. Subsequently, Brown was indicted as one of the two robbers, and Ketchum gave the same testimony in his case, and to the effect that one of the robbers had somewhat Brown\u2019s appearance, but he could not say Brown was the man. ' Up to this time, which was about March 1, 1867, Brown had set up no 502] *claim under these notes of Ketchum, but had kept them suppressed. But upon learning that Ketchum had charged him with the robbery, Brown for the first time produced the $18,000 note, and by virtue of a warrant of attorney attached to it, took judgment for a large balance claimed to be due thereon. He also, at or about the same time, filed affidavits against Ketchum, charging him with the embezzlement, and with the forgery of Ferguson\u2019s name to the note. Ketchum, as he says, then for the first time made known the real transaction \u2014 the embezzlement and mock robbery \u2014 and the result was the present indictment against himself and Brown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">After the testimony of Ketchum, the state offered in evidence the boobs containing the settlements referred to by Ketchum, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>purpose of proving the amount of Ketehum\u2019s embezzlement. These \u2022were objected to by counsel for Brown, but were admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-5\">The state also, for the purpose of showing that these notes were-not founded upon any real consideration, and of corroborating' Ketchum\u2019s testimony, gave evidence tending to show the amount of Brown\u2019s apparent means before the protended robbery. Among other things for this purpose, the state gave in evidence a sworn statement of Brown, made some time subsequent to the robbery, in a suit against him and his brothers and sisters, by a deceased brother\u2019s administrators, in regard to the assets of an alleged partnership ; in which suit it was to Brown\u2019s advantage to make his property and effects appear as small as possible. In this statement Brown professes to Enumerate all his property, notes, and effects, but entirely omits any mention of the notes in question. His counsel asked the court to charge the jury, that if they found it was to-the interest of Brown, in the suit where the statement was made, to suppress the notes, they should attribute his false statement rather to that motive than to his consciousness of guilt in the present case. This instruction the court refused, and left it to the jury to-say what the- real motive was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">Other facts appearing in the case are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the court; as, also, are the points argued by counsel, so-far as they are decided.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-7\"><em>*George B.

Objectionsscem to have met the court at every stage of its proceeding. They were interposed to the indictment; to the time, manner, and place-of trial; to the evidence, the instructions of the court, the verdict, and the judgment. Within the reasonable limits of a report we can-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>do little more than simply state and decide the various points presented. We will briefly -consider them in the order in which they arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Four of the assignments of error relate to the sufficiency of the indictment, or, rather, of the four counts on which the defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In the first place, it is claimed that the indictment is bad as to Brown, because it does not allege that he was a public officer, or person intrusted with public money.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The argument seems to be, that as the statute declares the aider \u25a0or participator guilty of \u201c embezzlement,\u201d it must refer to and mean a person having charge of the public money, or in some way \u25a0connected with its keeping or control; otherwise, it is said, he could not be guilty of embezzlement. We do not so understand the statute. It is true, that the statute makes the act of aiding or partici\u25a0506] pating in embezzlement *itself an act of embezzlement. But that is a mere statutory name for the offense. The statute defines two substantive offenses. One is the conversion of public money by the party intrusted with it. The other is the advising, aiding, \u25a0or participating in the act of conversion, by <em>any </em>person. Each act is declared by the statute to be an \u201c embezzlement\u201d and a \u201c misdemeanor,\u201d in as unequivocal and direct language as could be employed for the purpose. Its plain declaration is, that \u201c any person \u201d who advises, aids,, or participates in the conversion of public money by a party intrusted therewith, is himself guilty of embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Another objection to the indictment is, that it does not set forth what portion of the money embezzled belonged to the respective municipalities named, but merely the aggregate amount belonging to them all. The same objection is made to that part of the verdict \u25a0of the jury which finds the amount embezzled.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">To. this assignment of error it is sufficient to say that, in one \u25a0count, these several amounts are set forth, except as to the town-i'sbips, and as to them the aggregate amount is given, with an averment that the respective amounts owned by each township are unknown to the grand jury. But we hold that these particular statements were not necessary. The substance of the offense defined by the statute consists in converting \u201cpublic money,\u201d and all that is therein said as to the ownership of the money may well be regarded as mere amplifications of the words \u201cpublic money.\u201d They are no more than specifications as to what is and what is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>public money. Their significance is, to denote the <em>kind </em>of money that may be the subject of embezzlement, and not its ownership. It seems to us therefore, that it is sufficient in an indictment under the act to allege that the money was public money, belonging to the several municipalities therein named, or to one or more of them. In a strict legal sense, no particular or specific part of this money belonged to either municipality more than to another. Certain undivided portions of it were payable to each of them, and in that \u25a0sense, which is undoubtedly the statutory sense, belonged to them. But there is. no reason to suppose that it was any part of the intention of the \u00ablegislature to have the several amounts ascor- [507 tained and specified in the indictment. It is only necessary the indictment should show that it was public money in the statutory sense, that is, that it was public money belonging to these descriptions of municipalities. This sufficiently appears in every count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">If we are right in this, it follows, of course, that the jury may well find in a single sum the whole amount embezzled, irrespective of the proportions owned by each municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The third objection made to the in.didtment is that in one of its counts an organized <em>borough and </em>village, instead of an organized village, is alleged to have been one of the owners of the money emr bezzled. The proof was also objected to, because it showed that the real owner was the village of Coshocton, and not a borough and village.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">This is certainly a small objection, and it is not well taken. The words \u201c borough and village \u201d are to be understood as duplicate or cumulative names of the same thing. Such are common in established forms of indictments, and proof of either\u2018is sufficient on the trial. Besides, this alleged defect is only found in one of the counts, leaving three good counts to support the verdict. Whether a borough is a village, and whether we have any boroughs in Ohio, the questions argupd by counsel, we need not now decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The remaining objection to the indictment is that it misjoins sevr eral offenses which are subject to unlike punishments. In other words, it is claimed that the fifth count, instead of being, as all the others are, a count for embezzlement, is a count for larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The charge in the fifth count, in brief, is that Brown, with the assistance and consent of Netehum, took the money from the treasury. Such an act is no larceny. The money was lawfully in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>possession of Ketchum, and was taken therefrom by his consent. Hut was it embezzlement ? In other words, did Ketchum convert the money to Brown\u2019s use, and did Brown participate in the act <em>T </em>We answer in the affirmative. As they acted in concert, every act of each was also the act of the other. If Brown took the money from the safe, Ketchum also took it; and if Brown converted the-508] *money to his own use, so did also Ketchum convert it to-Brown\u2019s use; and surely, if Ketchum did so take and convert the money to Brown\u2019s use, it will not be denied that Brown participated in the act. We think, therefore, that the fifth count contains a good charge of embezzlement, and that the court did not err in refusing to put the state to its election. It would be a strange construction of this statute to hold that a county treasurer who throws-open the doors of the safe, and voluntarily permits an accomplice to take the public money therefrom, is not guilty of embezzlement; and it would be equally strange to hold that the accomplice, under such circumstances, would not be guilty of participation in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">But it is said the court erred in putting Brown .upon his trial before the trial and conviction of Ketchum; and that the court fell into the same error in its refusal to instruct the jury that Brown could not be convicted, unless the conviction of Ketchum was first shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The well known common-law rule, -that an accessory can not bo tried or convicted until the principal offender has been first convicted, we do not deny. But the statute under which this indictment was found, as we understand it, makes the crime of advising, aiding, or participating in an embezzlement a substantive and independent offense. In so holding, we are only following the decisions of this court in the cases of Nolan <em>v. </em>The State, 19 Ohio, 131, and Allen <em>v. </em>The State, 10 Ohio St. 287. In those cases, the court hold that under the 36th section of the crimes act of March 7,1835, which subjects aiders, abettors, and procurers to like punishment as pi\u2019incipal offenders under the act, such aiders, abettors, and procurers are guilty of substantive and distinct offenses. If there is any difference in this respect between the two acts, the one now under consideration is the more strongly worded for such a construction. By this act the adviser, aider, or participator is not only made liable, as by the act of 1835, to like punishment as the principal offender, but he is declared to be guilty of the same offense. His act is declared, equally with the act of the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509, 510\">*509, 510</page-number>offender, to be an \u201c embezzlement \u201d and a \u201c misdemeanor.\u201d Either may, therefore, be tried and convicted independent of the other.. The two offenses *are as distinctive and independent as are [509 the crime of larceny and the crime of concealing the stolen goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The next point in order is, that the court of common pleas of Licking county had no jurisdiction of the ease. There is no .law, say the counsel, for removing \u201chalf of a case\u201d to an adjoining county. Both defendants, they contend, must join in the application for a change of venue, and the cause must bo removed as to both, or not at all. And the counsel say, further, that if such is not the law in cases where separate trials have first been ordered, such is the law in the present case, because no order of the kind had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">It seems' quite clear to us that a motion by one of two persons jointly indicted, for a change of venue as to him alone, necessarily involves and includes a motion fora separate trial; and that .the granting of such motion necessarily involves and includes the granting of a separate trial also. There was, then, in fact, an order-for a separate trial, as well as an order for a change of venue, both made on motion of the defendant; and it can hardly be seriously-denied that, for the purposes of a change of venue under the statute, and indeed for most purposes, the cases are to be considered, after an order for separate trials, as separate and distinct indictments. Such was expressly held to be the law in one of the cases-referred to (Allen <em>v. </em>The State, 10 Ohio St. 287). There is, therefore, no good ground for either form of this objection. Brown\u2019s-case had become a separate case, by virtue of the order for separate-trials, and that \u201cwhole case \u201d was removed to Licking county.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">As to the question whether the court erred in failing to order a second venire for the struck jury, and impaneling a new jury to try the case, it is enough for the present case to say that the defectivevenire was set aside at defendant\u2019s request, and that the new jury was impaneled vpthout objection by him. He took no exception to the proceeding, and what was done was done upon his motion, or with his acquiescence and concurrence. If the objection ever could have been made, it was waived. Wo see no error in this. .</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The next question is : Was Ketchum a competent witness for the state, standing as he did jointly indicted with Brown ?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">,*The authorities already cited answer this question in the [510' affirmative. Where separate trials are awarded to parties jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Indicted, each is a competent witness for the state, upon the trial of \u2018the other, without being first acquitted or convicted, and without a <em>.nolle prosequi </em>being first entered upon the indictment. The objection goes to his credit, and not to his competency. This has been \"the settled law of the state for years; and surely the present is no \u25a0\u00a1time to change it, when the manifest tendency of our legislation is \u25a0to narrow, instead of enlarging, the grounds of objection to the competency of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">But it is contended that if Ketchum was competent when called to the stand, he became incompetent, or, rather, his testimony wholly and utterly incredible, by his subsequent admission that he , had been guilty of perjury in his former examination in relation to the same subject-matter, and that the court erred in refusing so to instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The law seems to us to be otherwise. The fact of perjury, even \u25a0when admitted by the witness upon the stand, without a legal conviction of perjury, does not render him incompetent, or necessarily .and wholly unworthy of credit. We think the court did not err in \u00a1refusing the instruction asked, and instructing the jury that they might find the defendant guilty upon the testimony of Ketchum, \u00abcorroborated as to one or more material facts, notwithstanding his .infamy, and complicity in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Did the court err in its instruction to the jury with regard to Brown\u2019s motive in suppressing these notes ? We think not. Where \u2022 a party is shown to have made false statements, which, from their nature, might have been prompted by his consciousness of guilt, or 'by other sinister motives, it is for the jury, and not for the court, to -.say, from all the circumstances, to which motive it should rather be attributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The objection to the competency of this evidence is answered, we \u25a0think, by saying that it was not offered to prove that Brown had \u00a1sworn to a false statement. The apparent object was to show that his statement was substantially true, to wit, that these suppressed .511] notes were mere nullities or ^fictions, supported by no real consider ation, and therefore no real part of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Yarious other exceptions are taken to the charge of the court, but it is not necessary to notice them further than to say we do not -deem them well taken. It is true, as counsel say, that the charge 'is of unusual length ; but that is rather matter of taste than of daw. The court laid down to the jury many propositions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>which might better have been omitted, but, it seems to us, laid them down correctly, and with sufficient clearness \u2014 certainly with sufficient fullness. And while some of the objections to isolated parts of the charge might seem well founded,-as a whole the charge .seems to us to be unexceptionable in point of law. The court tells the jury, it is true, that they may \u201clook at the whole life \u201d of the defendant. But the context shows clearly that the court meant \u201cso far as his life is shown by the evidence;\u2019\u2019 which, in fact, does \u2022seem to cover a very large portion of his life. Again, the court \u25a0says: \u201cAnd other evidence there is, as the state claims, to identify certain money the defendant had in his possession,\u201d etc.; by whicB. the court, in view of the whole charge, can only mean to say that the state <em>claims </em>that there was such evidence. And so of other parts of the court\u2019s charge, and its commentaries upon the evidence; ns a whole, it seems to us to be impartial, and in accordance with rthe law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Nor do we deem it necessary particularly to notice the many \u00abexceptions taken to the orders of the court admitting testimony on the part of the. state. They involve no questions useful to be reported. The answer to most of these exceptions is found in the fact that the evidence was offered only for a qualified purpose, and that the jury were instructed only to consider it in that light. 'The books containing settlements made by Ketchum, if they were not competent, as against Brown, to show the amount of the embezzlement, were at least competent to show the amount testified to by Ketchum; for he testified that the amount received by Brown -was the amount appearing in the books, less a certain sum. ' Other papers and documents were admitted/which were competent, not .as evidence of their verity, but as circumstances ^explanatory [512 of the motives and conduct of Brown, and in that light only, as we \u25a0understand the court, were the jury instructed to regard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Four several exceptions are taken to the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The first of these is that it does not find Ketchum guilty of con\u25a0verting the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">This exception is not true in fact. The verdict finds Brown .guilty, and his guilt necessarily involves th^ guilt of Ketchum. It is not a verdict <em>against </em>Ketchum. As to him it is a nullity. ' It is a verdict against Brown alone, but as to him it is a verdict finding fhe guilt of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In the second place it is objected that the jury did not find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>whether the guilt of Brown consisted in aiding or participating in-the embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The obvious answer to this objection is that Brown is charged* in the indictment with both aiding and participating; and the-jury, by their general verdict, have found him guilty of both. The-jury do not, as counsel seem to suppose, find that Brown is guilty of aiding, as charged in one count, and of participating, as charged-in a different count. They find him guilty of both offenses (if they are different' offenses) under each count. If there is any one-good count in the indictment, then the verdict must stand as a sufficient finding of both offenses under that count alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">A third objection made to the verdict is that the jury do not find at what several times, or in what several amounts, the money was-converted; or how much of it consisted of the money specified in the several counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Nothing is better settled than the rule that a general verdict' upon several counts will be sustained where either count is good. We perceive no reason why this rule is not equally applicable to-that part of the verdict finding the amount of money embezzled, as to that part of it which finds the general guilt of the defendant. Both are charged, and both must be found to enable the court to-pronounce the proper penalty. Now, each count of this indictment charges Brown with participating in the embezzlement of $20,036. The jury have found him guilty on all four of the counts.. In theory the indictment charges Brown with four several embez513] zlements, and *the jury thus found him guilty of embezzling-four times that amount. If this were true in fact, the court would inflict four several punishments. . But it is only a fiction, and the several counts are only so many forms of charging a single offense. Brown can not claim the benefit of the fiction without submitting-to its burden. For the purposes of this question, then, the indictment is to be regarded as charging a single act of embezzlement, as if there was but a single count, and that the amount of that single-embezzlement was $20,036. The jury have found a less amount. They have found him guilty of embezzling $20,000, as charged in <em>either </em>of the counts of-the indictment. The court will look to see-if there is one good count among them, and if there is, the court will inflict the punishment as upon that count. Still the court will only inflict one punishment, because there is in fact but one offense-</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The last error assigned is, that the verdict is against the evidence-</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>And first under this head is an objection very similar to the last \u00abone considered, though not identical with it. It is, that the evidence shows there was in fact an indefinite number of separate and distinct acts of embezzlement, and that the jury could only properly find the amount embezzled at one time \u2014 or at most only the amount embezzled at four several times, corresponding with the four counts of the indictment \u2014 whereas they have found the aggregate amount. 'The answer is, that the evidence shows a continuous series of conversions of the money, in pursuance of a conspiracy. Such evidence is sufficient to support a finding by the jury of the aggregate sum as the amount of a single' embezzlement. It was in fact and in law a single embezzlement. Were it otherwise, the particular conversions could never be ascertained or proven, and there would have to be, in some cases, almost as many counts in the indictment as there were dollars in the money embezzled.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">But the main ground assumed under this assignment is, that the verdict of .guilty against Brown is against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">*This is purely a question of fact, and its consideration in- [514 volves nothing, perhaps, that can be useful in a report of the case. 'The testimony is exceedingly voluminous, and I will content myself with a single comment upon its general nature and bearing. Its \u25a0vital part is' the story told by Ketchum. Without that, there is -clearly nothing beyond a mere case of suspicion; and yet with that story, corroborated as it is by the other evidence in the case, there .is sufficient to warrant the conviction, provided the story of Ketchum \u25a0can be at all supported as <em>probable </em>or <em>reasonable in itself. </em>That it is not probable and reasonable in itself, is the proposition mainly \u25a0insisted upon by counsel. They say it is extremely inprobable that Ketchum should agree to commit this crime, and to give all its fruits to an accomplice, with these notes for $19,600 thrown in, and reservo nothing to himself but the pleasure of being tied and gagged. I confess that at first view this story appeared to me utterly improbable ; but on reflection I have changed my mind. It is a strange story, and yet its very strangeness affords a kind of evidence of its truth, when considered in connection with the surrounding circumstances. The two elements which most abound in this story \u2014 strangeness jmd self-crimination \u2014 are seldom found in the fabrications of a false witness. Such fabrications are always aimed to be plausible, and \u2022exculpatory of the witness. Told in a different form, what is Ketchum\u2019s story? It is this: Ketchum had innocently become a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>defaulter, and was distressed over his loss; Erown knows the fact,, and adds to Ketchum\u2019s distress by a <em>quasi </em>threat of exposure, artfully suggesting, at the same time, that <em>if </em>a robbery of the treasury should happen, Ketchum would be relieved. The idea takes with Ketchum, who thenceforth prays for a robber. Brown answers and says: \u201c I myself will be the robber if you will sufficiently indemniiyme. If I rob you, I will be in your power; you will only have to-inform on me and send me to the penitentiary: give me an equal weapon to hold over your head, and I will run all the risks of the-robbery. Give me your notes for more than you are worth, and give me written evidence that you forged Ferguson\u2019s name to one of the notes, and then we will both have ample guarantees that. 515] *the notes, the forgery, and the-robbery will forever be suppressed.\u201d The bargain is struck, and the robbery enacted. And these weapons, thus put into each other\u2019s hands, are the very weapons used when the war subsequently breaks out between them. The first blow struck by Ketchum is a prosecution of Brown for the-robbery, and Brown responds by a judgment on the $18,000 note, and a prosecution for the forgery. The only available weapon leftKetchum was the truth of the transaction, and he at last falls back upon that. Looked at in this light, I am not prepared to say that the story is improbable in itself; but supported as it is by the other proof \u2014 Brown\u2019s utter failure to account for these notes, and their suppression upon any other theory than that of Ketchum, the apparent sudden increase of Brown\u2019s monetary means, his concealment of money in the cellar, the false account he gave as to the source from which he had obtained money, and other evidence in the case\u2014 we are quite unable to say that the jury were not right in finding-it to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The law requiring a review of the facts on jjetition in error has-imposed upon the court an immense labor in the present case. We-have not shrunk from that labor. The result is the conviction that the rulings of the court and finding of the jury are in accordance with the law and the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">Day, C.
