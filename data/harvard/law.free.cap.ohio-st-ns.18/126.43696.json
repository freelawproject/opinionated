The facts of the case are specially found by the court, and are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-12\">In 1863, the plaintiff, John B. Rostetter, in whom was vested the naked legal title of land which in equity belonged to his wife, at her request, bargained and sold the same to the defendant, William G. Grant, who was ignorant of the wife\u2019s right therein. Part of the purchase money was paid in hand, and, by the written contract of sale, Rostetter bound himself to make a conveyance, by good and sufficient warranty deed, upon payment of the remainder of tho purchase money, at a specified time. At the end of the period fixed, Grant tendered the remainder of the purchase money and demanded \u00a1a deed. Rostetter declined to make the deed, on the alleged ground that his wife refused her assent thereto, or to join in its execution; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the fact being, however, that she was willing and offered to join ire the deed, on the condition that the purchase money should be paid' or secured to her, instead of her husband; and she refused to sign the deed solely because the husband desired her so to refuse, and would not consent to her receiving or having the money. Grant thereupon filed his petition in the common pleas against Rostetter, asking for a specific execution of the contract. The wife also was made a party defendant, after the cause came into the distinct court, and she there filed an answer, in which she alleges that she is un127] willing to join in the deed of conveyance; and *prays that her husband may be adjudged and decreed to convey the land to-trustees for her use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">Upon this state of fact, the district court adjudged and ordered that the contract of sale should be specifically executed, by Grant\u2019spaying the remainder of the purchase money into court, for the use-of the wife, and by Rostetter\u2019s conveying the land to Grant by good and sufficient warranty deed, \u201cfree and Slear from all claims of his-wife.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">The errors alleged are, in substance, that the court rendered a decree for specific execution, whereas it should have ordered the-land to be conveyed to the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-7\">\u2022 Since the filing of the petition in error, the wife has died, and her legal representatives have been made parties.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-8\"><em>John McSweeney, Bierce &amp; Pease, </em>and <em>Meyer &amp; Manderson, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-9\"><em>Meyer &amp; Manderson </em>argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-10\">1. The doctrine that a court of equity will lend its aid to compel the specific performance of an agreement by which a husband covenants that his wife shall execute a conveyance to bar her of her' estate, when the performance is resisted on the ground of the wife\u2019s-refusal to join in the conveyance, has long since been exploded in England. It was never adopted or recognized by the courts in this country. 2 Story\u2019s Eq., secs. 731, 735; Paul <em>v. </em>Young, 4 Am. Law Reg. 412; Young <em>v. </em>Paul, 2 Stock.

Act of 1846, [128 respecting the rights and interests of married women in their real estate. 44 Ohio L. 75. See also the act of 1861.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-6\">2. The principle of <em>estoppel in pais </em>can not be set up in this case ,-against Catharine Rostetter or her heirs, by reason of her acts as a <em>feme covert; </em>we need scarcely inquire into the policy of applying the principle of <em>estoppel in pais </em>to the acts of married women generally respecting their real estate. The facts found by the court in its decree would not warrant the application of the principle of <em>estoppel in pais </em>against Catharine Rostetter, or her heirs, so as to -debar her, or them, of the estate in question, in favor of Grant, even in case that she had been a <em>feme sole </em>at the time of the negotiations and the making of the contract, and in all respocts acted as she did as <em>feme covert. </em>To give that effect to the rule, the party who seeks its application must be an <em>innocent purchaser; </em>and must have acted on the strength of the representations, or been deceived into so acting by the fraudulent concealment of the true owner. He must have purchased the property, not merely contracted to purchase it; he must have paid the purchase money, not merely contracted to pay it; and he must have been placed in possession and received a conveyance; and all this without actual notice of the true owner\u2019s title or claim, up to the time of this full complexion of the purchase.

The-additional trifle which he has paid was paid after he had notice.

That, under the facts of the case, Mrs. Bostetter was not entitled to a decree securing to her the real estate in question as her separate property; that her conduct in reference to the sale to Grant would preclude her from the benefits of such a decree as against him, and that her coverture makes no difference in this regard.

That Grant being an innocent purchaser and Mrs. Bostetter having assented to the sale, he was entitled to a deed from Bostetter, conveying a good title clear of dower \u2014 a conveyance he Is able to make; and that as she is to have the purchase money her equitable rights are protected. That a court of equity should, in case of a contract by the husband to convejq decree a specific performance by him, when it appears that, by his <em>procuration and fraud, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>his wife refuses to join with him in executing the necessary papers. \"This is not such a case as that of Young <em>v. </em>Paul, 2 Stock. Ch. 401.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-4\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ags\">We see no error in this decree to the injury of cither -of the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The husband complains of it, for the alleged reason that it requires him to coerce his wife into the execution of a deed. Tho answer to this complaint is, that the wife need not sign the deed. 'The full legal title is in the husband, and his deed alone will pass that title to the purchaser. The wife can have no claim for dower, either in her own land, or in land hold by her husband as mere \u25a0trustee. She has either a right to the whole estate, or to no part of it; and if she has a right to the whole, it is a mere equitable right \u2014 a right to go into equity and compel a conveyance of tho -legal title. This is precisely what she is attempting to do in tho \u25a0present case. She has no title which she can <em>retain, </em>by refusing to join in a conveyance. If anything, she has a mere right to <em>acquire </em>\u25a0the title. The husband, therefore, has no just ground to complain of this decree. It only requires him to fulfill his plain and admitted agreement, by executing his own deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Has the wife any just ground, to complain of the decree? She says that Grant, not having completed the purchase, can not claim the rights of an innocent purchaser without notice; and that no <em>estoppel </em>can be pleaded against her, as she is a married woman; and she <em>therefore </em>claims that the court erred in refusing to order the title of the land vested in a trustee for her use. But the title has already been vested in a trustee for her use. Why change the trustee? Surely, another can not be found more watchful of her interests, or more willing to subserve them, even to the violation of his *own contracts and rights, than her husband has been. [13\u00a3! There seems to be a perfect accord between the husband and wife in this matter. When she requests him to soil, he sells, and when she requests him to disregard the contract of sale, he disregards it. No danger of her interests suffering in his hands. As often as he happens to sell at a low price he will get her to object, and then rescind the contract; until he shall finally make a satisfactory sale, perhaps for more than it is worth, and then he will, at her request, .ask for a specific execution. If tho court had placed the property in tho hands of another trustee for her use, as she requested, surely one of the duties of that trustee would be to sell the nroperty ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>cording to her directions. That is just what the husband did. If her counsel are right now, in contending that no sale or conveyance is valid unless she joins in the deed, the new trustee would be-as powerless to sell the land as the old one; and she might as well have the title vested in her own name at once. Any attempt by the new trustee to sell her land- \u2014 especially if the land should happen to rise in value after making the contract of sale \u2014 -might only result in another suit like the present. <em>We </em>hold the law to be that, as soon as her trustee, the husband, bargained and sold the land <em>at her request </em>to Grant, her equity was changed from the land to the-purchase money; in equity the land became the property of Grant,, and the purchase money became hers. There is, therefore, in the-case no question of \u201c purchaser without notice,\u201d or of \u201c estoppel,\u201d or of the power of a court, of chancery to decree against the husband a conveyance of the estate of the wife. Rostctter was a trustee, and the contract of sale, made by him at the request of his-wife, the <em>cestui que trust, </em>was made in the legitimate exercise of his powers as such trustee, and should be specifically executed, notwithstanding the objection of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-6\">Day, C.
