Allen, being the owner of cer- [235 tain real estate, conveyed the same to John Allen, and afterward, in the year 1864, married Polly A. Allen, whom he left as his \u25a0widow at his decease in May, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-13\">On July 30,1866, the appraisers of John M. Allen\u2019s estate set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>off for a year\u2019s support of this widow and her child the sum of' three hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">The district court, at its .September term, 1867, upon petition of John M. Allen\u2019s administrator, found that the conveyance of the real estate by John M. Allen to John Allen was made with intent to defraud one Elizabeth Davis, then a creditor of John M. Allen ; and that the two Allens, John M. and John, were parties to the-fraud, and that John Allen took the title upon a secret trust to hold it for John M. Allen ; and the court adjudged the deed to be void, as to creditors, subsequent as well as antecedent, and ordered a. purchaser of the real estate from John Allen to pay to the administrator of John M. Allen so much of the purchase money that them remained unpaid as would be necessary to pay the debts of the-decedent and the costs of administration ; and in default, that the real estate be sold, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">Such subsequent proceedings were had as to present the question, whether the allowance of three hundred dollars for the year\u2019s support of the widow and child was such a debt of the decedent as-should be paid by resort to the real estate thus fraudulently conveyed. The district court, at its September term, 1868, held that, it was such a debt, and adjudged accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-7\">This holding is assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-8\"><em>Wood &amp; </em>Pond, for the motion :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-9\">The conveyance to John Allen being held void only as against, creditors, it remained good as against the grantor or any claiming under him. Burgett <em>v. </em>Burgett, 1 Ohio, 469; Barton <em>v. </em>Morris, 15 Ohio, 408 ; 18 Ohio, 418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-10\">The widow and child of the grantor, as to the allowance for their year\u2019s support, are not his creditors within the meaning of these decisions, but are simply claimants under him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-11\">286] *1. The statute (S. &amp; C., 574, 575, sections 44 \u2014 47), which provides for the allowance, clearly contemplates that it shall be set. off to the widow and child as claimants under the decedent, as a preferred distributive share of the property and effects which actually belonged to him at the time of his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-12\">2. The allowance to the widow and child is not in the nature of a debt of John M. Allen. There was no right to have it set off until after he died, and it was not fixed until the appraisers actually set it off. Had the widow and child died before it was set off, it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>not have been set off afterward. Adams <em>v. </em>Adams, 10 Met. 170 Dorah <em>v. </em>Dorah, 4 Ohio St. 292. As it is the <em>widow, </em>and not the <em>wife, </em>who is entitled to dower (Reynolds <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 24 Wend. 193), so it is only after the death of the husband and father that, the widow and child have any claim to have the allowance sot off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">3. To constitute the widow and child, as to the allowance, creditors, there must have been a liability to pay a sum certain existing' against the decedent prior to his death; but an-allowance once made may be increased or diminished by the court. A <em>debt </em>is not susceptible of such adjudication.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-6\"><em>E. M. Stanbery, </em>contra :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">The conveyance was decreed to be void as to creditors, subsequent as well as antecedent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">The statute treats the allowance as. a preferred <em>debt. </em>S. &amp; C., 580, 581, secs. 83, 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">The funeral expenses are <em>debts </em>of the estate, yet they are not debts by contract of the decedent, but are created by statute from necessity, and are preferred to all other debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-10\">The right to a year\u2019s support is of such a nature as not to be affected by any act of the decedent, and contains all the qualities of a debt. Collier <em>v. </em>Collier\u2019s Ex\u2019r, 3 Ohio St. 369 ; Dorah\u2019s Adm\u2019r <em>v. </em>Dorah\u2019s Ex\u2019r, 4 Ohio St. 292.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-11\">This fraudulent grantee has no equities, as against this widow and child; and unless there is <em>clear </em>error, the decree of the district court should not be disturbed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-12\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AB6\">We are of opinion that the district court did not err in the holding complained of. The real estate in question *was liable, in the hands of the fraudulent grantee of the . [237 decedent, for the payment of his debts. The allowance of a sum of money to the widow and child, under section 45 of the administrative act (S. &amp; C. 575), is classed in section 82, pp. 580, 581, among \u201c the debts of the deceased,\u201d to be paid in the order specified in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
