The proposition that suit could not be maintained on a contract relating to land, and not to be performed within a year, unless in writing, was merely an abstract proposition. Such a principle was entirely out of the case, being a suit not upon the contract but for the debt that grew up from the use of the premises, under the circumstances. Wick performed his part of the contract, parted with his coal, lost and surrendered his store patronage. The contract was only used for two purposes \u2014 to show the relation of landlord and tenant between the parties, and the value of the rent as fixed by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b183-8\">No error was committed by the court in admitting evidence of the parol contract to fix the price of rent, and in admitting evidence of the execution of the contract by Wick, and of a holding under it. 1 Scam. 210; 3 Parsons on Contr. 35, note c; 38, 58, note y; Stone <em>v. </em>Dennison, 13 Pick. 1; Williams <em>v. </em>Sherman, 7 Wend. 109; Wilson <em>v. </em>Trustees, 8 Ohio, 180; Baxter <em>v. </em>Gay and Wife, 11 Conn. 122; Bowler <em>v. </em>Bell, 20 Johns. 340; Scott <em>v. </em>Harrison, 2 McLean, 180; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Blaney &amp; Morgan <em>v. </em>Hoke, 14 Ohio St. 291; Walbridge <em>v. </em>Despaid, 15 N.

Plaintiffs-in error had the land. It was the waiver of certain claims of Wick, entirely collateral to the lease under which the land was-held. The agreement was not, therefore, within the statute of frauds. Hoby <em>v. </em>Roebuck &amp; Palmer, 7 Taunton, 157; Donnellan v. Read, 3 Barn. &amp; Ad. 897, 904; Chemy v.

(4 ed.) 317-20, and cases cited ; Walker\u2019s Am. Law, 440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-10\">The agreement .of Wick did not extend beyond the year. He-withdrew his claim of forfeiture and his right to claim damages, and gave the plaintiffs in ex-ror time on the three cents a ton on. coal already mined. Wick\u2019s giving up of his claims was not required to be in writing. Nothing was to be done to complete it.. When they \" settled,\u201d Wick\u2019s claims were gone, and his pai't of the .agreement was executed. The agreement of the plaintiffs in error-to pay the three and four cents a ton, when the consideration moving from Wick was executed at the time of making the agreement, was not within the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-11\">Under the cii-cumstances, it would be a fraud upon the rights of Wick to .enforce the statute. Why are not the plaintiffs in error-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>bound, to pay such claims thus surrendered by \"Wick, and enjoyed by them, the same as the tenant is bound to pay for repairs, or the-purchaser to pay for goods delivered, although the payment may extend more than a year from the making of the agreement ? The-new agreement having been executed by Wick, it is entirely immaterial whether any new possession was taken of the premises or any new holding was created.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">The \u201c store contract \u201d is founded upon a sufficient consideration. It was made the time the lease was, and was delivered with it, and was made in consideration of the making of the lease, and in pursuance of an agreement made at the same time, and therefore is a part of the lease itself and supported by the same consideration. 2' Parsons on Contr. 66, 67 ; Colburn <em>v. </em>Dawson, 4 Eng. L. &amp; E. 378.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">*The stipulations of the \u201c store contract,\u201d on the part of [194-Arms and his assigns, are of such a nature that, when left entirely unperformed, such non-performance would constitute a sufficient consideration for the new agreement to pay three and four cents a ton. If in addition to the agreement of Arms and his assigns to perform legal acts, they also agreed to do other things which were illegal, yet as the stipulations of the <em>\u201c </em>store contract \u201d are separate- and distinct, they are bound to perform such things as are legal, although other things which are illegal are incorporated into the-agreement. 1 Parsons on Contr. 980, 981; Leavit <em>v. </em>Palmer, 3 Comst. 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-7\">The waiver of his right of forfeiture, and the surrender of bis-right to claim damages for the entire non-performance of the \u201cstore-contract,\u201d by Wick, constituted a sufficient consideration for the-making of the new agreement.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-8\"><em>F. E. </em>Hutchins, for plaintiffs in error, in reply :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">According to the petition and proof, the contract stipulates for much more, on the part of Wick, than a surrender of an inchoate right to insist upon a forfeiture, and his claim for damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">The statements in the petition are susceptible of but one meaning. Crawford &amp; Murray had forfeited their rights under the lease. Wick had taked advantage of it, and given them notice thereof, and to quit the premises, thereby divesting the estate, and now the parties meet to negotiate terms by whieh the lessees are to-be permitted to continue to hold and occupy the premises, notwithstanding said forfeiture and such termination of the precedent es~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tate, and Wick agrees to permit them to continue to hold the term, :and occupy the premises ; and <em>for this, </em>and for the waiver of the \u25a0claims for damages, the lessees agree to pay this additional rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\">This is what the petition and contract, as there stated, assumes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-6\">Now, if this contract had been put in writing and properly exe\u25a0cuted by the parties, there could, of course, be no doubt that it would convey an interest and estate in lands, and just what it purported to -convey, provided \"Wick had such interest or estate to 195] -grant; and equally of course is it, that any ^contract which, if in writing, would convey an estate in lands, is within the statute, if not in writing; and so of this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-7\">But it is claimed that this agreement, on the part of Crawford &amp; Murray, is not within this branch of the statute, for the reason that its consideration, or the promise of Wick, was <em>an executed consideration, </em>and it is said the statute does not apply to such. We deny that such was the case in fact, or that Wick\u2019s promise, as averred in the petition, either executed itself, or was ever executed by him. But even if it be a case of executed consideration on the part of Wick, we still claim the action can not be maintained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">I presume it will not be contended that an oral agreement to buy and pay for a farm, or to take and pay for goods, after more than a year, or to accept and occupy under a lease, with, in each case, a tender of performance on the other side, and refusal to accept as agreed, would support ai? action, either for the purchase price or rent, or for damages for a broach of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\">Whenever a recovery is had, in such case, it is always either upon the ground of part performance, or that the purchaser or tenant <em>has had the property or term, </em>and therefore should pay for it. But, in the latter case, <em>the recovery is not upon the contract. </em>1 Parsons on Contr. 315, 316, 520; Brown on Stat. of Frauds, secs. 124, 125 (and authorities cited), 126, 226, 263, 117, 504; Fisher <em>v. </em>Wilson, 18 Ind. 133; Teal <em>v. </em>Auty, 2 Brod. &amp; Bing. 99; 6 E.

(marg.) 274; Townsend <em>.v. </em>Townsend, 6 Met. 319.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-10\">It is claimed by counsel for defendant, that this agreement sued \u2022upon is not within the statute of frauds, because, upon Wick\u2019s side, dhe agreement was not only susceptible of performance, but was vm fact performed within one year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>I claim that this is not, in fact, true ; and that if true, it would not prevent the statute from operating upon the other parts of the agreement. Brown on Stat. of Frauds, secs. 286, 291; 2 Parsons on Contr. 319 ; 1 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cas., notes to Peter <em>v. </em>Compton.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">*Wick\u2019s promise to release his claim for damages, under [196 the lease and store contract, did not execute itself, and operate per .se as such release, irrespective of whether Crawford &amp; Murray performed their corresponding promise or not, but only became such release in fact, upon the performance by Crawford &amp; Murray of their promise. An agreement to release damages or waive a forfeiture does not operate per <em>se </em>as such <em>without the payment of the consideration.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">The statute equally prohibits an action upon either side of \u201c any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof,\u201d except in writing. There is just as much reason for prohibiting the bringing an action upon one side \u25a0of a contract as upon the other. Broadwell <em>v. </em>Getman, 2 Denio, 87.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-7\">The whole petition, with the account attached, and the charge of the court, show that the action was brought and tried upon the special agreement.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-8\">Brinkerhoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASE\">This is a petition in error, filed in the district court, and reserved for decision here, by which it is sought to reverse a judgment of the court of common pleas. The plaintiffs in error were defendants below, and the defendant in error was plaintiff below.</p>\n<p id=\"ASS\">The petition in the original case is very far from being a model of that clearness and conciseness of statement which the code of civil procedure prescribes, but we gather from it that the plaintiff below, \"Wick, with several other parties who were owners in common with him of fractional portions of certain coal lands, on the 15th of June, 1855, executed to one Arms a lease of such coal lands, with certain mining rights and privileges therein specified, for the term of twenty-five years, giving the right of immediate possession, and recognizing the right of the lessee to assign his term under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">It does not appear that Anything was done under the lease by Arms, the lessee; but on April 17, 1856, he sold and assigned the lease and term to Crawford &amp; Murray, the plaintiffs in error, who thereby covenanted with said lessee to perform his covenants in the lease; and thereupon, Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Murray went into posses-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197, 198\">*197, 198</page-number>197] sion of the demised premises, *and continued to hold the same- and mine coal therefrom, until long after the making of the alleged verbal contract hereinafter mentioned, and on which this suit is-brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The petition also shows that contemporaneously with the execution of the lease to Arms, Wick <em>alone </em>entered into a side contract with him, which is known in these proceedings as \u201cthe store contract,\u201d and. the stipulations of which, on the assignment of the lease by Arms to the defendants below, they agreed with him to-perform \u201c so far as <em>he </em>was bound to perform them.\u201d This store contract, being an important element in this case, and having features so unique that I fear no synopsis could do it justice, I set out. entire, in order to a full understanding of the case, and because it. seems to me to be well deserving of such perpetual remembrance as the process of embalming in a book of law reports can confer. It is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">. \u201cThis agreement, made this first day of January, A. d. 1856, by and between Charles D. Arms of the first part, and Hugh B.

Wick.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Such being the contract relations of the parties, and Crawford &amp; Murray having, as is alleged, become delinquent in the performance of the stipulations of the lease on their part, and having-failed to influence the trade and patronage of their employes in-accordance with their obligations assumed under the store contract, and Wick threatening to exact and enforce a forfeiture of their-term under the lease, and having taken preliminary steps to that end, and claiming damages for their failui\u2019e to fulfill \u201cthe store contract,\u201d the parties, in March, 1858, mot together and entered into the parol contract on which the original action in this case-was brought, and which was in substance this:</p>\n<p id=\"AsB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>In consideration that \"Wick would forbear to enforce the forfeiture of the lease against the plaintiffs in error, and would permit, them to continue to occupy and work the demised premises'in accordance with the terms of the original lease, and would relinquish his claim for damages on account of their non-performance of the stipulations of the store contract, Crawford &amp; Murray agree to pay him three cents per ton on all -coal already mined, and four cents per ton on all coal thereafter to be mined under said lease, in addition to the payments ^stipulated for in the lease; and this [201 not only on Wick\u2019s share of the coal mined, and to be mined, but also on the shares of the other owners of the leased premises in common with him, who were not parties to this parol contract. The non-payment of the three and four cents per ton thus agreed to bo paid, and also the non-performance of certain stipulations of the original lease, are the breaches assigned; and on the ground of which a judgment for damages is prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The defendants below demurred generally to the petition. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendants below answered, denying any delinquency by them in the performance of the coveenants of the original lease by which any forfeiture by thorn was incurred, denying that Wick had taken the proper steps to forfeit the same, denying the making by them of the parol contract alleged in the petition, and their liability to pay the said three and four cents per ton, as claimed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The ease was tried to a jury, and Wick had a verdict for $6,712.42. The defendants below moved for a new trial on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court had erred in various rulings as to the admissibility of evidence, in its charge as given to the jury, in refusing to charge as requested by defendants below, and that the verdict was not sustained by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The motion for a new trial was overruled, and judgment was rendered on the verdict. Thereupon a bill of exceptions was taken embodying the various rulings of the court upon the trial, its charge as given, its refusal to charge as requested, and all the evidence in the case. The defendants below now make, by their assignments of error, substantially the same points made by them on their motion for a new trial below.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">On the argument of the case in this court counsel have made and elaborately argued numerous questions which-we do not find it necessary to consider, or even to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>We are of opinion that on tbe case made by the pleadings and evidence the plaintiff below was not entitled to recover ; and that the court of common pleas erred in overruling the motion for a new trial; and this for two reasons :</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">202]* <bracketnum>*1.</bracketnum> The contract on which the action was brought, not being in writing, was clearly within the statute of frauds. It was a contract for an interest in lands and tenements ; for a right to use, occupy, and enjoy lands and tenements; to mine coal within and upon them, and to pay rent for them; and there was no such performance of the contract as to take it out of the operation of the statute. The evidence shows that Wick, on his part, did simply nothing. He ceased to threaten to exact a forfeiture of the original lease, and took no further steps to enforce such forfeiture; while \u2022Crawford &amp; Murray, on their part, continued to pay, and Wick to receive, the rents stipulated for in the orginal lease <em>ond no more, </em>all the time up to the final surrender of the term by Crawford &amp; Murray and the acceptance of the surrender by Wick. Crawford .&amp; Murray did not yield up possession of the demised premises at \u2022or about the time of the making of the alleged parol contract, but, for years afterward, continued to occupy them right on wlthoru. visible change; the possession of the demised premises was continuous and unbroken, and is referable as well to the old, as to the new or supplemental lease. The case of Armstrong <em>v. </em>Kattenhorn 11 Ohio, 265, is very closely analogous to the present case, so far as this question is concerned, and is conclusive of it. It is there \u2022decided, that \u201c a tenant in possession, in case of a parol agreement for different terms of holding, if no acts are performed which \u2022clearly show that the possession is continued under the last agreement, it will be referred to the original tenancy, and such parol \u25a0contract will be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> Because the court below erred in recognizing, as it did, both, in its charge to the jury as given, and in refusing to charge as .asked, the relinquishment by Wick of a claim of damages for the non-performance of the stipulations of the store contract, as being .a valid consideration for the contract sued on. The contract sued on rested, as is alleged in the petition, on two items of consideration, to wit, forbearance to exact a forfeiture of the old lease, and the claim for damages under the store contract. But if the store contract was fatally tainted with illegality and wholly void, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203, 204\">*203, 204</page-number>mo valid *claim of damages for its breach could exist to [203 .constitute a consideration for a new contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">This much being premised, let us look into this store contract, und at the principles of law bearing upon it. It is an elementary doctrine, that contracts in general restraint of trade are unlawful, and therefore void; though as a general rule, agreements which \u2022\u2022stipulate only for a partial or particular restraint, are recognized ;as valid. Metcalf on Contracts, 232. To this latter general rule, however, there is an important exception which must not be overlooked ; and which is thus stated in a book of high and venerable authority. \u201c Whatsoever a man may lawfully forbear, <em>that </em>he may \u2022oblige himself against; <em>except where a third person is </em>wronged, or the <em>public </em>is prejudiced by it.\u201d C. J. Wilmot\u2019s Opinions, Low <em>v. </em>Peers, 377. And the learned chief justice adds, in treating of this \u25a0.subject, on the next page, \u201c It is the duty of all courts of justice to keep their eye steadily upon the interest of the public, even in the .administration of commutative justice; and when they find an action is founded upon a claim injurious to the public, <em>and which has a bad tendency, </em>to give it no countenance or assistance <em>in foro civili.\u2019\u201d </em>Now, in the light of these principles, retaining our common sense in its integrity, and not allowing our vision to be obscured by so flimsy a veil as that which is attempted to be cast over the provisions of this contract by the use of the fair-seeming phrases, \u201cin a reasonable and proper manner \u201d\u2022 \u2014 \u25a0\u201c so far as the same can be reasonably and fairly done \u201d \u2014 and the like, let us look into some of the particular provisions of this store contract; into its .general scope and tendency, and into the character and aims of the scheme which it embodies, organizes and discloses.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Selecting, now, a single gem from the casket of precious things, we hold it up to the light. Here it is. The lessees agree that they will not \u201c accept, receive, or pay any order or orders drawn by any of\u201d their \u201c employes or agents, or their representatives, for goods, wares or merchandise, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 purchased by him or them \u2022of any other store, firm, or persons, nor <em>give </em>any such employes or agents any order or orders to any other store, firm, or persons, for goods, wares, or merchandise, *or any note of other evi- [204 dence of indebtedness, in order that the same may be disposed of \u2022or transferred for goods, wares, or merchandise, contrary to the spirit of this agreement,\u201d etc. Now, throwing over these stipulations a mantle of charity broad enough to cover a multitude of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>sins, and with a webb thick and dense enough to conceal from our flight their otherwise obvious intention, what is their <em>tendency, </em>and what would be their probable practical operation ? A lessee of a coal-mine who submits to a contract, the terms of which are so repulsive and degrading to himself, may well bo supposed to be far from independent on the score of pecuniary means; and the last stipulation in the above extract from the contract presupposes that he will become indebted to his workmen, and hence be obliged to give them <em>\u201c </em>notes or other evidences of indebtedness,\u201d to be by them transferred for personal and family necessaries. Suppose such a case to occur. The lessee becomes indebted to his workmen. Perhaps the mine has not yet become productive, or the means of transportation are not obtainable, or the market for coal happens to be glutted. The workmen want provisions and clothing for themselves and families, and the notes of their employer to be negotiated in exchange for these necessaries; and these they can have, but in such a way only as to hedge them out from the benefit of competition among shopkeepers. They must take their notes to the store of Wick, and trust to his sensitive conscience and regard for fair and just dealing, first, as to the amount of discount they must allow him on their notes transferred to him, and second, as to prices ho will exact for the goods they receive in exchange. Again, the terms of the contract presupposes, and assuredly it is no violent presumption, that circumstances may exist which will render it necessary for the workman to anticipate his wages. Suppose such a case. Sorely needed wages are not yet earned. Perhaps he is ill, and has to await the return of health to earn them. At all events, pay-day is yet in the future. He goes or sends around among the retail shoj&gt;s, and being known as one of Crawford &amp; Murray\u2019s coal diggers, he finds that, for some inexplicable reason, prices of needed articles are 205] high at Wick\u2019s, while at other shops they are ^comparatively low. The simple soul prefers to deal with some one of the latter. He goes to its proprietor, states his situation and necessities, and proposes the purchase of certain necessaries, and for the price of them to give an order on his employer to be paid out of his wages when they accrue. The shopkeeper answers, \u201c Yes, you can have-what you need at the regular prices named, provided your employer will accept your order. Call again to-morrow, and in the-meantime I will see him and so be able to give you an answer.\u2019* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Accordingly, on the next day, he calls again, and is told that his-employer says that he is under a contract to accept no order from a workman unless it be given on Mr. Wick. And so he too is-turned over to the alternative of either doing without the things-which he needs, or of subjecting himself to the tender mercies of \u201c the party of the other part \u201d to the store contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Having thus, in the most moderate colors which my estimate of the character and tendency of this store contract permits, endeavored to. depict one of its characteristic features, I place it side by side with the time-honored principles announced by Chief Justice Wilmot, and submit it to the ordeal of those principles: \u201cWhatsoever a man may lawfully forbear, that he may oblige himself against; <em>except where a third person is </em>wronged, or the public is prejudiced by it.\u201d \u201cIt is the duty of all courts of justice to keep their eye steadily upon the interest of the public, even in the administration of commutative justice; and when they find an action is-founded upon a claim injurious to the public, <em>and which has a lad tendency, </em>to give it no countenance or assistance in <em>\u2018foro civili.\u2019 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">A majority of the court are of opinion that the particular segment of the store contract above commented on, being in restraint of trade, and naturally tending in its practical operation to inflict wrong, disadvantage and suffering upon third persons, is-unlawful; and being in its character inseparable from the other-provisions of the contract, it taints the' whole. Met. 216, 247; 11 Wheat. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">I have invited special attention to that portion of the store contract above remarked upon, not because I regard the legal *or [206 moral character, or the practical tendency of that portion of the contract as being exceptional, when compared with its other provisions, or with the contract as a whole, but rather by way of illustration of the character and tendency of the whole scheme which the contract embodies, organizes, and discloses. It 'is but one of a litter, in which the family resemblance, apparent in the aspect of all, sufficiently establishes a common parentage, and precludes the hypothesis of a case of superfetation by a plurality of sires.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">It is said in Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, vol. 2, p. 299, that <em>\u201c </em>as to bonds entered into in restraint of trade, it seems to have been always admitted, and hath been frequently adjudged, that a bond restraining trade in general, as that a person shall not follow such a trade in any part of the kingdom, is void; the reasons whereof are that such bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tends to a monoply, and is against the public good; deprives the party of his means of livelihood; enables masters to lay hardships upon their servants\u201d and \u201capprentices; tends to.oppression,\u201d etc. And so, on the next page it is added, \u201cif the condition of a bond is that the obligor shall not buy any sheeps-trotters of any person of whom the obligee had bought or should buy, this is .void, being a. restraint of trade, and tending to a monoply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The majority of the court are of opinion, that viewing this store \u25a0contract as a whole, and the scheme which it embodies, it comes \u25a0clearly within the reasons thus stated, on the ground of which it is the policy of the law to avoid certain contracts, and to overthrow every superstructure which is reared upon them as a foundation. It tends to restrain trade in a manner operating naturally and .almost inevitably to the injury of others; it tends to unwaiTantable monoply, to extortion, and to the depriving of the hireling of the full benefit of his wages when earned, and of the benefit of such legitimate credit as he might have on the basis of wages to be earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">I have not been able to find any direct precedent for holding that \u25a0.a contract whereby the influence of an employer over his employes is sold to, and for the benefit of a third person, is void; nor have I been able to find any to the contrary. But knowing, as we do, that the relation of employer and employe is, to a great extent, one 207] of mutual dependence, *but a dependence generally preponderating in favor of the employer and against the employe; and when it is easy to see that in the fast-coming future, as manufacturing and mining operations aro enlarged and multiplied, as population becomes more dense, and the labor market becomes more and more choked by the increasing number of competing hands for its employ, the dependence of the laborer on his employer will become greater and more influential, I can not but think, and, speaking for myself alone, I must say that such ought to be the law; and it seems to me that such a case would come clearly enough within the scope of principles already established to warrant a court, governed by a just and forecasting judicial policy, in declaring that a contract for the sale of an employer\u2019s influence over his employes, in respect to matters of trade, is in itself alone so liable to abuse, so dangerous in its tendency, and so likely to tempt hard, grasping, and greedy men to the easy practice \u25a0of extortion and oppression upon a dependent class, as, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>language of Chief Justice Wilmot, to forbid its receiving either \u201ccountenance or assistance in <em>foro civili.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The store contract, then, being wholly unlawful and void, the giving up of a claim of damages for a breach-of its stipulations furnished no consideration for any new contract. And in so far as such relinquishment of claim entered into and constituted the-basis of the contract sued on, so far, to say the least of it, the-latter was without consideration; and the court below erred in refusing so to charge the jury, and in its distinct recognition of the-validity of the store contract in its charge as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Judgment reversed, new trial awarded, and cause remanded to-the common pleas.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-7\">Day, C.
