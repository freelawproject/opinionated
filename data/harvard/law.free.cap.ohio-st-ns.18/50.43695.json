Andrews.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b54-5\">1. A board of county commissioners, at tbe solicitation of tbe directors of a railroad company, without being authorized by law, issued to the company orders on the county treasury to the amount of $15,000, payable at a future day, for the purpose of aiding the company to build its road, and for the orders received $20,000 of the income bonds of the company. The orders were not applied to the purpose for which they were issued; but, before they were paid, the commissioners took the personal bond of. the directors in the penal sum of $20,000, conditioned that, whereas the orders had been issued to enable the company to complete its road, and they had been otherwise used, without so doing, the bond should be void, if the road was finished in a specified time, and then paid the orders as they afterward became due. <em>Held, </em>the orders having been issued without authority, and in violation of the constitution and laws of the state, were illegal and void; and the bond of the directors to the commissioners, having been taken in furtherance of the illegal purpose for which the orders were made and paid, was taken in violation of the public policy of the state, and is, therefore, void; and, though the condition of the bond be broken, no recovery 50] \u201ccan be had thereon, for either the penal sum named therein, or the amount paid on the illegal orders.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b54-7\">2. In an action on the bond for its penal sum, the petition contained, in addition to the statement of such cause of action, allegations claimed to show a right to recover upon the ground of fraud in the procurement of the orders, and an implied liability to pay their amount, hut which showed that the right to such recovery was barred by the statute of limitations: <em>Held, </em>that it was not error to sustain a demurrer to the petition.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b54-9\">3. Upon leave to file an amended petition in the action on the bond, in addition to amending the original cause of action, a new and distinct cause of action, then barred by the statute of limitations, was stated along with the .amended cause of action on the bond: <em>Held, </em>that, under the provisions of the code, it was not error to sustain a motion of the defendant to strike from the amended petition all matter not material to a cause of action on the bond.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-11\">Error. Reserved in tbe district court of Delaware county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-12\">On the 2d day of January, 1863, the plaintiffs filed their petition in the court of common pleas for Delaware county, against Hiram Gr. Andrews and Joshua Judy, in which they averred that on the 28th day of January, 1857, Hiram G-. Andrews and Joshua Judy, together with Charles Anthony and Obed Horr (both of whom have since died), executed and delivered to the board of county commissioners of said county, their bond, under their hands and seals, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that wo, Charles Anthony, Obed Horr, Joshua Judy, and Hiram G\\ Andrews, of the State of Ohio, are held and firmly bound unto the commissioners of Deleware county, in the State of Ohio, aforesaid, in the penal sum of twenty thousand dollars, for the payment of which we bind ourselves, our heirs, and administrators. Signed and sealed with our seals this 28th day of January, A. d. 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2d\">\u201c The conditions of the above obligation are these: that whereas heretofore, to wit, at a special session of the board of the commissioners of the county aforesaid, held in the town of Delaware, in said county, on the 21st day of August, A. d. 1855, said commissioners authorized and directed the auditor of said county, upon certain conditions, to execute and deliver to the Springfield, Mt. Yernon and Pittsburg Railroad Company, three several county orders for the sum of five thousand dollars each, making the sum total'of fifteen thousand dollars, payable in one, two, and three years from the date thereof, to be used by said railroad company to relieve them of their pecuniary embarrassment, and enable them to prosecute *the work upon said road to a speedy completion to its [51 eastern terminus; and whereas said orders having been issued by said auditor, and delivered to said railroad company, the said Hiram G. Andrews subsequently, with the consent of said railroad company, negotiated said orders to the Delaware Branch Bank of the State of Ohio, to satisfy a judgment in favor of said bank against said Andrews and others, obtained in the Clark county common pleas, November 6, 1854 ; and whereas the proceeds of said orders were not used by said railroad company in completing the work upon said road, east of Delaware, according to the meaning and intent of said commissioners; and whereas, said road still remains unfinished: Now, the condition of the above obligation is such that if the pres-, ent Springfield, Mt. Yernon and Pittsburg Railroad Company proceed within a reasonable time from this date, and not to exceed five years from this date, to finish and complete said road to its eastern terminus, then the above obligation to be void, and of no effect ; otherwise, to be and remain in full force and virtue in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">\u201c The plaintiffs further say, that the said Springfield, Mt.

And thereupon, at the same time, said commissioners, fully believing said representations of said Andrews, Judy, Anthony, and Horr to be true, and relying thereupon, and having no knowledge or suspicion of the secret purpose aforesaid, \u25a0of said Andrews, Judy, Anthony, and Horr, and prevailed on by them so to do, did cause the auditor of said county to draw and deliver to said company three negotiable orders on the treasurer of said county, commonly called county orders, of that date, each for $5,000, and payable, respectively, at one, two, and three years after their date, with interest; which county orders were delivered to \u2022said company, in pursuance of the premises, for said $20,000 of mortgage bonds, and upon the conditions mentioned in said orders of said commissioners, so far as said conditions had not been rescinded \u25a0or removed by any or either of said orders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">That said representations made by said Andrews, Judy, Anthony, \u25a0and Horr were false, and known by them to be false when they made them as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-9\">That afterward, and before the 25th day of August, 1856, the said Springfield, Mt.

Branch Bank, the three county orders aforesaid, in part payment \u25a0of the judgment aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">That said mortgaged bonds, when delivered as aforesaid to said \u25a0commissioners, were of little or no value, and are now wholly \u2022valueless, the said railroad company being wholly insolvent, and without any means whatever; and the plaintiffs now hero bring the same into court, and offer to re-deliver the same to said company, or to transfer the same, without recourse to the defendants, upon being repaid the amount, with interest, of said county orders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">That, on August 23,1856, the said Hiram G-. Andrews, in consideration of the premises, executed and delivered to the plaintiffs his certain writing obligatory of that date, a copy whereof is attached to the petition as a part thereof, and is the same as the bond before recited, except that it is signed by Andrews alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">That, on January 28, 1857, the said Andrews, Judy, Anthony, and Horr executed to the plaintiffs the bond of that date, in lieu of, and on cancellation of the bond of the date of August 23, 1856; which bond so executed and delivered to them, dated January 28, 1857, is copied and made a part of the amended petition, and is in \u2022the same language as that recited in the-original petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">That the said three county orders were paid by said county, at their maturity respectively, with interest from their date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">That afterward, and before the commencement of this action, the said Anthony and Horr departed this life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-10\">That at the date of said last-mentioned writing obligatory, Lakeville aforesaid was, and it ever since has been, the duly established eastern terminus of said Springfield, Mt. Yernon and Pittsburg Railroad. Nevertheless, although more than five years have elapsed since the date of said last-mentioned writing obligatory, yet the said Springfield, Mt. Yernon and Pittsburg Railroad Company has not finished and completed its road to Lakeville aforesaid, nor to any other place established as an eastern terminus thereof. On the \u25a0contrary, no part of said road, east of said village of Delaware, has been completed; nor has the said railroad company, or the said Andrews, Judy, Anthony, and Horr, or any or either of *them, [58 \u25a0ever repaid to said county the money paid by it in redemption of said county orders, or any part thereof. By means of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>premises an action hath accrued to the plaintiffs to have and demand of the defendants the said sum of $20,000, in said last-mentioned writing obligatory mentioned. Yet the said defendants-have not \u00a1laid, nor did said Anthony and Horr, or either of them, pay in their lifetime, respectively, nor have all or any or either off said obligors paid to the plaintiffs the said sum of $20,000, or any part thereof; to the damage of the plaintiffs $20,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">The plaintiffs therefore ask for a judgment against the defendants-for $20,000, the debt aforesaid, and also for $20,000, their damages-aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">Copies of the records of the proceedings of the commissioners-are attached to and made part of the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">The defendant moved the court to strike from the amended petition certain matter claimed to be irrelevant, and \u201call allegations-therein relating to the supposed representations, made by the defendants to the plaintiffs, and ail allegations therein relating to the falsity of such supposed representations. Also, all allegations therein charging the defendants with fraud or fraudulent combination in procuring the plaintiffs to issue the county orders for-$15,000 therein mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">That part of the petition sought to be stricken out was particularly specified in the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">The court granted the motion, and ordered the matter specified in it to be stricken out as \u201cirrelevant and prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">To the petition, thus amended, the defendant demurred. Theeourt sustained the demurrer, and rendered judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-11\">To all the rulings of the court the plaintiffs duly excepted, and filed their petition in error in the district court to reverse the judgment of the common pleas. The case was reserved in the district-court for decision in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-12\"><em>A. G. Thurman </em>and <em>Carper &amp; Van Deman, </em>for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-13\">I. The common pleas erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer-to plaintiff\u2019s original petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-14\">57] <em>*Point </em>1. The instrument sued on being under seal imports a sufficient consideration; and it was not necessary, in declaring-on it, to state a consideration. Indeed, it needs no consideration. 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 366; Chitty on Contr. (9 Am. ed.) 4, 5; 3 P. Wms. 222.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Point 2. </em>The court can not say that the recitals in the condition are a statement of the consideration. They do not purport to be, \u2022and there is no <em>legal </em>intendment that they are. Hence, it matters not whether they show a sufficient consideration or not. If they do, of course the bond is valid. If they do not, yet, inasmuch as \u2022they do not purport to be a statement of the consideration, the presumption of law remains that the instrument, being under seal, is founded upon a sufficient consideration. 1 Greenl. Ev. 24, 25, sec. 19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-5\"><em>Point </em>3. Hence, to sustain the demurrer, the demurrant must show <em>that in no possible case could there have been a valid consideration for the bond. </em>For, if there could be such a case, the court is bound to presume it upon demurrer to the petition. 1 Greenl., supra ; 2 Brock. 96, 97 ; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 221; 1 Parson's on Contr. 354, note <em>s; 2 </em>Ohio St. 592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\"><em>Point </em>4. If it be said that the commissioners had no authority to issue the county orders to the railroad company, and that, conse.quently, no legal consideration for the bond could arise out of that \u2022transaction, we reply:</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">(1.) There is no such defect of authority apparent upon the bond \u25a0or petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">(2.) Divers cases may be supposed that would make the transaction legal. 10 Ohio St. 241; 5 Id. 119.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-9\"><em>Point </em>5. We have so far proceeded as if want of consideration would defeat the action. But, in truth, no such defense is admissible. Our former statute authorizing it was repealed by the code. Hence, the common-law rule, prohibiting such a defense against a specialty, again prevails. As to this rule, see Vrooman <em>v. </em>Phelps, 2 Johns. 177; Dorlan <em>v. </em>Sammis, Id. 179, note; Dorr <em>v. </em>Munsell, 13 Id. 430; Page <em>v. </em>Trufant, 2 Mass. 158, 161, 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-10\"><em>Point </em>6. Even in equity the same rule prevails. Chitty on Contr. (9 Am. ed.) 4, 5, notes <em>y </em>and <em>z, </em>and cases cited; Franco <em>v. </em>Bolton, 3 Ves. Jr. 368; Gray <em>v. </em>Matthias, 5 Id. 286; 6 *Humph. [58 234; Hinge <em>v. </em>Moore, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 61; 1 Story\u2019s Eq., see. 245.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-11\"><em>Point </em>7. But were the consideration for the bond apparent on its face, and were it admitted that the commissioners transcended their authority in issuing the county orders, yet the bond would be good; for there was nothing fraudulent, nothing <em>malum in se, </em>in what they did. They simply parted with county funds under a mistake of the law. So it must be presumed. For the law always pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>sumes innocence in the absence of proof of guilt. 1 Greenl. Ev. sees. 34, 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGv\">In such a case a bond to indemnify them, or to secure the object for which they parted with their money, given, <em>not to procure them to do the illegal act, hut after they had done it, and without any preexisting agreement to give it, </em>is perfectly valid. Doty <em>v. </em>Wilson, 14 Johns. 378; Given <em>v. </em>Driggs, 1 Caine, 450; Marchioness of Annandale <em>v. </em>Harris, 2 P. Wms. 432; Fox <em>v. </em>Tilley, 6 Mod.

Jr. 288, 289, notes; Kneeland <em>v. </em>Rogus, 2 Hall\u2019s Sup. C. 587, 588.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">II. The common pleas erred in striking out a portion of the-amended petition. The ground of the motion to strike out was- \u201c irrelevancy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">If the amended petition, in its integrity, stated no cause of action,, the plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the order to strike out. But we insist:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-9\"><em>Point </em>1. The amended petition states a good cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\">(1.) If either point 5 or point 7, under head I., is sound, then-a good .cause of action upon the bond is stated in the amended, petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-11\">(2.) A mistake of law will be relieved against, even where both parties are innocent. <em>A fortiori </em>will it be relieved against in favor of ah innocent party against a guilty party who, by fraudulent, representations and contrivances, led the former into mistake. 10' 59] Ohio, 85-90; 11 Id. 223-232; *11 Id.. 486; 19 Id. 21-24; 10-Ohio St. 544; Coventry <em>v. </em>Barton, 17 Johns. 142.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-12\">(3.) It follows, that an obligation given by the guilty party to-the innocent party to repair the consequences of such a mistake, is supported by a sufficient consideration, and is valid. As shown by the cases above cited, relief against the mistake may be obtained, in equity (and in some cases at law, perhaps). Equity and good morals require reparation, and no principle of law or of public-policy prohibits it. A bond for that purpose is, therefore, plainly valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-13\">On the case, then, made by the amended petition, which (supposing the commissioners to have transcended their authority) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>one of a mistake of law into which they were drawn by the fraud of the defendant and his confederates, there is a good cause of action on the bond. And the case is particularly strong for the-plaintiffs, inasmuch as the funds obtained from them went to the benefit of the defendant and his confederates, being secretly applied by them to discharge the judgment against them in favor of the Delaware Branch Bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\">(4.) But if a case for a recovery on the bond is not made, yet one for a recovery of the amount of the county orders, $15,000, with interest, is stated. And this for the reasons shown.in two-paragraphs next preceding. This is not a case for the application,, as against the plaintiffs, of the maxim, <em>ex turpi causa non oritur actio. </em>They are not chargeable with any turptitude, and even if they violated the law or the constitution, that, under the circumstances, will not prevent their recovery. Brooks <em>v. </em>Martin, 2 Wallace \u2022U. S. 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\"><em>Point 2. </em>The matter stricken out of the amended petition was relevant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">This is sufficiently obvious from what has already been said.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">We have only to add that, <em>\u201c </em>irrelevancy \u201d is one thing, \u201c insufficiency \u201d is another. As to irrelevancy, the question is, \u201c is the matter relevant to the <em>alleged </em>cause of action or defense?\u201d not whether the alleged cause or defense is sufficient.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az6\">It is claimed that the court of common pleas erred: 1. In sustaining the demurrer to the original petition; 2. In granting the motion of the defendant to strike out of the amended petition irrelevant matter; 3. In sustaining the demurrer to the amended .petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">All the questions that were made by the demurrer to the original petition are raised upon the demurrer to the amended petition, and it will not therefore be necessary to give a separate consideration to the ruling of the court upon the demurrer interposed to the original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The original petition is manifestly based upon the bond alone. It is equally evident that by the amended petition a recovery on the bond is sought, without any indication of a purpose to add another cause of action by having it \u201c separately stated and numbered,\u201d ns required by section 86 of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The amended petition differed from the original, chiefly, in stating-fully all the circumstances that gave rise to the bond, or that which-constituted the consideration therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In determining whether the court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the amended petition, the first question presented for our determination is, whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover on. the bond, which was the real ground of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">It is apparent upon the face of the bond, as well as from the allegations in the petition by way of inducement to the bond, that it. &lt;83] was not given for the repayment of a sum of *money obtained' of the commissioners. It does not purport to be given for that purpose, nor did the defendant in fact even receive any money of them. The orders amounted-to $15,000; and the sum named in the first bond, as well as in the bond in suit executed in lieu of that, was-$20,000. Moreover, that amount is called the \u201cpenal sum,\u201d to be-paid only on failure of the railroad company to complete its road in a specified time. It is not an obligation for the unconditional payment of any sum of money whatever. It is more in the nature-of a covenant to finish the road, or to secure its completion, than a. promise to pay money. The completion of the railroad is the primary object of the bond; the payment of \u201c the penal sum \u201d of money is soeondary. This is evident from the recitals in the \u201c conditions\u201d of the bond. From them it ajjpears that the orders were issued to-the railroad company, \u201c to bo used by said railroad company to relieve them of their embarrassment, and to enable them to prosecute-the work upon said road to a speedy completion to its eastern terminus,\u201d and that the orders had been applied to another purpose,, leaving the road \u201cunfinished.\u201d These are the reasons assigned in the bond for the obligation to pay the \u201cpenal sum\u201d named therein, on failure of the company to complete the road within the time mentioned. The bond was to be void as an obligation to pay money,, if the purpose for which the orders were issued was accomplished. It thus appears that the bond was taken to secure the completion-of the road (the end for which the orders were isst\u00eded), rather than for the payment of a sum of money.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The orders had been issued to the railroad company, as stated in tha bond, \u201c to enable them to prosecute the work to a speedy completion.\u201d It is manifest that the bond was taken in furtherance-of the same object that was sought to be attained by the issuing-of the orders to the railroad company. Had the road been finished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the purpose for which the orders were issued at one time, and the-bond taken at another, would have been attained, and the intended mission of both fully accomplished and ended. The obligors in the bond would have been relieved from all liability thereon. Neither \u201cthe penal sum of twenty thousand dollars,\u201d nor the amount *of the orders, or any sum paid thereon, could, in [64 that event, be recovered on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The county orders were made payable in one, two, and three-years respectively after their date. The first became due August 23,1856. It appears, from the bond taken of the defendant on that day, that the commissioners had at that time been informed that the railroad company had not used the orders in constructing-the road, but had suffered them to be applied on a debt of the defendant, which, it is shown by the petition, had been incurred for the benefit of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Instead of refusing to pay the orders, as undoubtedly they might, have done, the commissioners made the orders available to the-company by payment, on receiving the bond of the defendant in-the nature of a guaranty that the road should be built.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">It is evident that the whole object and purpose of the commissioners in this entire series of transactions \u2014 the issuing the orders, the taking the bond, and the consequent payment of the orders\u2014 were, just what is expressed in the bond, to relieve the company of its pecuniary embarrassment, and to enable it to finish the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Were these transactions within the legal powers of the board of commissioners ?</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">In Treadwell <em>v. </em>The Commissioners (11 Ohio St. 190), it was. held that \u201c a board of commissioners of a county is a <em>quasi </em>corpo-. ration, \u2018 a local organization which, for purposes of civil administration, is invested with a few of the functions characteristic of-a. corporate existence. A grant of powers to such a corporation, must be strictly construed.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The \u201c act establishing boards of county commissioners, and prescribing their duties,\u201d confers upon them power to perform only \u201c such duties as now are, or hereafter may be, required of them by law.\u201d S. &amp; C. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">We do not find among the powers conferred or duties imposed upon the commissioners, anything that would authorize them to-purchase railroad bonds with the county funds, or to loan the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65, 66\">*65, 66</page-number>\u25a0credit or money of the county to aid railroad corporations to build \u25a0their roads, however desirable it may be to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u202265] *But the commissioners in undertaking to draw money from the county treasury to pay for railroad bonds, or to enable a railroad company to build its road, without authority conferred upon them so to do, not only transcended their powers, but were acting in violation of the fundamental law of the state. It is a provision of the constitution that \u201cNo money shall be drawn from \u2022any county or township treasury, except by authority of law.\u201d Art. 10, sec. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Nor, indeed, could the legislature authorize county commissioners to issue orders, or dispose of county funds as a loan of county credit or money for the purpose stated in the bond. The 6th section of the 8th article of the constitution prohibits it, as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u201c Seo. 6. The general assembly shall never authorize any county, \u25a0city, town, or township, by vote of its citizens or otherwise, to become a stockholder in any joint stock company, corporation, or association whatever; or to raise money for, or loan its credit to, or in aid of, any such company, corporation, or association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">It is true that it is shown by the petition, that for the $15,000 of county orders the commissioners received in return $20,000 in the mortgage bonds of the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">If it might be claimed that this transaction was not literally within the prohibition of the section of the constitution above \u2022quoted, it can not be denied that it was in contravention of the policy clearly indicated thereby. If the legislature were forbidden to authorize such transactions, the commissioners, who derive their powers from it, were not less so prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">It follows that the county orders mentioned in the bond, issued without legal authority, and in violation of the public policy of the state, were void. They imposed no legal obligation on the county in favor of the company to which they were delivered; nor is anything shown in the petition \u2014 if indeed it were legally possible \u2014 to render them of any more value in the hands of a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">When the first order became due, and after they had learned of the misapplication of the orders, the commissioners, instead of re-66] fusing to pay them, as they ought to have done, *took the bond \u25a0of the defendant to secure the accomplishment of the object for which the illegal orders were issued, and paid them as they became due. The money was paid, as the orders were made, in \u201caid of\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the railroad company. Though the money may not have been paid' upon the faith of the bond of the defendant alone, it was evidently taken, in fact, to enable the company \u201cto raise money\u201d on the illegal orders, or in furtherance of the object for which they were-\u25a0made.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The second bond \u2014 the one in suit \u2014 was substituted for the first,, a short time after that was made, in pursuance of an agreement, between the parties when the first was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The bond was not taken for $15,000, the amount of the orders, but for $20,000, the amount of the railroad bonds that had been-received for the orders. It did not purport to secure the return of the money to be advanced, but rather to secure the value of the-railroad bonds by a completion of the road, or, if that failed, an amount of money equal to that of the railroad bonds, and greater than that of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Moreover, as if this was intended to ratify the original transaction, the commissioners retain the mortgage \"bonds that they received for the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The money was paid on the orders after the delivery of the defendant\u2019s bonds: the first order was paid on the day the first bond was given, and the others after the date of the bond in suit. Hence it woitld seem that the bond was taken to keep alive and make-effective the illegal orders, so that they might be available to the-company for the accomplishment of the purposes for which the orders were issued. The bond thus entered into and became a part-of the transactions of the board of commissioners in the unauthorized and illegal disposition of the county credit and county money in aid of the railroad corporation. The whole transaction was clearly against the spirit and policy of the constitution and laws of the state. To sustain transactions like these would nullify the salutary prohibitions of the constitution, and open wide the door to-the very evils thereby sought to bo obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The majority of the court, therefore, hold that the bond, as well as the orders, were illegal and void; and that an action can not be-maintained thereon to recover either the \u201cpenal *sum of [67 twenty thousand dollars,\u201d or the amount paid on the illegal orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">But it is claimed that, although the bond may be void, a case is made in the amended petition, \u201c to recover at least the amount of the county orders, $15,000, and interest-.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">If this can be done, it must be either upon the ground of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>fraudulent procurement of the orders, or of an implied promise of the defendant to repay their amount to the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">It was settled in Sturges <em>v. </em>Burton, 8 Ohio St. 215, that the .statutory bar arising from lapse of time, is available on demurrer, when the facts requisite to constitute the bar are shown by the pleading to which the demurrer is interposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">An action for the recovery of money on the ground of fraud is barred in four years after the discovery of the fraud. The first bond was dated August 23, 1856. It is apparent from the condition, of the bond, as well as from other facts stated in the petition, that the fraud complained of was known by the commissioners at that time. This action was commenced January 2, 1863, more than four years after the discovery of the alleged fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">For myself, I do not see how the plaintiffs could, at any time, -maintain an action against the defendant on an implied promise to pay the plaintiffs either the amount of the orders or the money paid thereon. The orders were not issued to the defendant, nor was the money paid to him. Whatever benefit was derived from -either, came to the defendant from the railroad company. The railroad company was the immediate beneficiary of the plaintiffs. 31oreover, the orders and the bond upon which the money was paid were illegal, and the commissioners by this suit still affirm and .stand upon the illegal bond. It is an elementary principle that, \u201c Where money has been actually paid over, in pursuance of an Illegal contract, it can not be recovered back; for the court will not assist such a transaction in any way.\u201d Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims [645],</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">If, however, it be conceded that an action could have been maintained, on an implied liability upon the facts alleged in the amended *68] petition; if it arose when the orders were procured, *or when they were applied in payment of the judgment against the defendant \u2014 the only time when he derived any benefit from the \u2022transaction \u2014 a period of more than six years had elapsed before the commencement of this suit, and the action would be barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">But if an action accrued against the defendant on an implied liability when the money was paid to the railroad company, or to the bank to which they had been negotiated, still there exists, it seems to us, insuperable obstacles to a reversal of the judgment \u2022of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The original petition was based upon the bond alone ; and, from, \u2022,a careful perusal of the amended petition, it would seem that no \u2022other ground or cause of action was intended to be inserted in that. There is no attempt to state more than one cause of action by distinct and separate statements. Much of the matter set forth in the amended petition was not necessary to a full statement of that cause of action. Before the demurrer to the amended petition was filed, the defendant availed himself of the provisions of the \u2022code, by filing his motion to strike out of the amended petition certain specified matter claimed by him to be \u201c irrelevant,\u201d also all .allegations \u201crelating to the supposed representations made by the \u2022defendants to the plaintiffs,\u201d and charges of fraud alleged against them. The motion was broad enough in its terms to embrace sub\u25a0stantially all matter that was either irrelevant or redundant to a \u25a0single cause of action based on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It is difficult to see how the fraudulent, representations alleged to have been made in procuring the county orders, are materially relevant in an action on the bond given after the fraud was discovered, to secure the purpose for which the misapplied orders were made, since the efficacy of the bond in no manner depended upon the alleged representations when the orders were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">But if the amended petition be construed as having, in addition to an amended cause of action on the bond, another cause of action interlarded with, and masked under that, it can hardly be \u25a0claimed that the court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s motion by striking out all the matter that was redundant to the action on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">*When the amended petition was filed, more than six years [69 had elapsed after the orders were fully paid. The ruling of the court, in sustaining the motion, at once expurgated the petition of matter not material to the action on the bond, and was also equivalent to a refusal to so far extend the leave to amend as to permit the plaintiffs to ingraft on to the original cause of action a new and \u2022distinct cause of action that was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The discretionary powers conferred upon the court by the code, in relation to the amendment and modification of pleadings, are so ample we can not say that the court erred in sustaining the motion of the defendant to strike from the amended petition the matter specified in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">This motion was made and sustained before the demurrer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>amended petition was filed. The petition then contained no cause-of action but that on the bond alone. There was no ease for a recovery on an implied liability for money paid, or for money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">For the reasons already stated, a majority of the court hold that, the court below did not err in sustaining the demurrer to the-amended petition; and for the same reasons there was no error in-the ruling, on the demurrer to the original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">It follows that the judgment of the court of common pleas must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-7\">Brinkerhoff, Scott, and White, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b72-8\">Welch, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">dissenting. I can not concur in this opinion. I see\u00a1 no technical reason, and surely there is no reason injustice, why the county should not recover back its money, and recover it upon this bond. The reason assigned is, that the bond is founded upon-an \u201cillegal \u201d consideration, or was given to enforce the performance of an \u201c illegal \u201d act. The answer to this is threefold:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> The act complained of \u2014 paying out county money for railroad purposes \u2014 is in no sense an illegal or criminal act within the meaning of the rule of law on that subject. It was simply an <em>unauthorized </em>act. It involved no turpitude or immorality, and violated no-TO] penal provision of law. In fact, *it violated <em>no </em>provision of law. The prohibition in the constitution operates upon the legislature, and not upon the officers of the county; much less does it operate upon the county itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> It was not the act of the county, the real plaintiff in this action, but the act of its agents, the commissioners. It is well known- and well settled (Carder <em>v. </em>Comm\u2019rs of Fayette Co., 16 Ohio St. 369), ihat the \u201ccounty commissioners\u201d is another name for the <em>county </em>itself, in actions for and against the county, while in most cases it means the <em>officers or agents </em>of the county. It is unnecessary to say that the commissioners acted in the latter character-when they paid out this money. If the act, then, was ever so \u201c illegal \u201d or criminal, the commissioners themselves stood liable to-the county. If the agents of the county illegally, as by embezzlement, take money from the county, surely it can be recoveredvback,. and they can not be allowed to set up their own guilt as a defense. .And if <em>they </em>can not, it is difficult to see upon what ground their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>accomplices </em>in crime, especially those at whose instance it was committed and who reaped all its fruits, should fare any better. The-provision of the constitution, on which the illegality of the transaction is predicated, was intended for the protection of the <em>people \u2014the tax-payers </em>\u2014 of the county against improvident appropriation of the county money by its agents. It seems to me a strange application of the rule of law referred to \u2014 the rule which denies to a <em>guilty party </em>an action against his accomplice in guilt \u2014 to say that a violation of this constitutional provision by the agents of the county and their accomplices shall work an <em>injury </em>to the <em>people </em>of the county, the very party for whose <em>benefit </em>it was inserted. This is utterly at variance with <em>the purpose </em>underlying that rule of law, which is, that crime shall be discouraged by refusing aid to the-guilty, and not that it shall be encouraged by permitting it to be set up as a defense against the innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> But it does not appear upon the face of the bond, or in the-matters set up in the amended petition, that either the consideration or the object of the bond was illegal, or even unauthorized. Legally and technically, the bond imports a <em>debt, </em>founded upon a <em>presumed </em>consideration, subject to be discharged upon the happening of a named condition. I know *that such is often only [71 the <em>form </em>of the paper, while in reality it is to be regarded in the-light of a <em>covenant </em>to do the act specified in the condition; and that, when it is impeached for illegality, the court will look through its-form and inquire into its real object. Lot us do so in this case. Its object was not to enforce the payment of money out of the-county treasury by the commissioners. If it had been, the bond, would have been given <em>by </em>them, and not <em>to </em>them. If it was given, to secure the performance of <em>any </em>act then, it was an act to be performed by the defendants. That act must have been, either the-<em>building of a railroad, </em>or the <em>repayment of the money to the county. </em>I say, in fair legal effect, it was the latter. Either object, however,, is <em>lawful. </em>It is certainly not unlawful to build railroads; and' although it may be unlawful to take county money to build them with \u2014 and still more unlawful to apply the money to private purposes after you have received it \u2014 it certainly is not unlawful to-<em>refund </em>the money to the county. It is, perhaps, therefore, entirely immaterial whether we hold the object of that bond to be the building of the road, or the repayment of the money. It can, however, in no just sense, be said to be the former. The penalty of the bond. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\"was wholly <em>inadequate </em>for such a purpose, while it was just about the amount of the county money and interest. Besides, the condition is, not that so much <em>money shall he expended </em>on the road, or that <em>defendants </em>shall build the road, but that if the road shall be built the bond shall be void. The original object, the <em>laying out of the. money </em>upon the road was abandoned, and instead, a bond for $20,000 was taken, conditioned to be void if the road should be built. The parties had a year and more in which to reflect on this matter, and to find out their <em>mistake. </em>We must presume they had \u2022done so, and that at the date of the bond they knew the law, and /that this money should be paid back to the county. If their bond will bear a ponstruction consistent with the intention to secure the restoration of the money, as honest men should have done, we are bound to give it that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">But if we hold that their real object was to enforce the <em>building </em>72] <em>of the </em>road, I can not see but that they are equally ^liable. It was a lawful object, and they bound themselves in their solemn bond either to build the road or pay $20,000 to the county. What good reason is there why they should not be held to their bond, .and compelled to do <em>one or </em>the <em>other. </em>It may be true, that they /should have given an <em>absolute </em>bond for the $20,000. They chose not to do so, and to insist upon the insertion of a <em>condition </em>for their \u2022own benefit, and that condition they now admit is wholly unfulfilled.\u2019 They <em>got the money, and agreed to build the </em>road, and both these facts appear upon a bond in which they acknowledge tkem\u25a0selves indebted to the county in the sum of $20,000. Grant that it was unlawful to pay out the money to build the road, surely it was lawful to build the road with the money, after it had been paid out, ,-and to give a bond for that purpose. If it is unlawful to obtain \u2022county money to build a county railroad, it is more unlawful to \u25a0obtain it for that purpose and then refuse to-build the road; and it .seems to mo that a bond, binding the party to do <em>one or the other, </em>\u2022ought to be held good.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">If we consider the matters set up in the amended petition \u2014 as I think we must \u2014 how do the defendants stand before the court? They stand before us admitting that they <em>fraudulently </em>procured this money from county commissioners, whose only fault is that they too readily believed the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations; that they violated the promise upon which the money was obtained\u2014 \u25a0\u25a0\u00bfhat it should be used in building the railroad; and that they now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>propose to violate their solemn agreement under seal, either to pay the $20,000 at the end of the five years, or to build the railroad. And they set up these several <em>wrongful acts </em>\u2014 \u201cillegal contract,\u201d they call them \u2014 as a defense against an action by the county to recover the money. I can not concur in the opinion that such a defense ought to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">I am unable to see that the case is varied by the fact that the funds consisted in <em>county orders. </em>Whether these orders were equivalent to money, is immaterial. The parties considered and treated them as money. The defendants paid them out as such, and should now be estopped from denying their validity, and thus asserting that the treasurer is liable *for wrongfully paying them at [73 maturity to their assignees, or that the latter is liable to the county, for money thus received upon orders delivered to them in payment of the defendants\u2019 own debt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
