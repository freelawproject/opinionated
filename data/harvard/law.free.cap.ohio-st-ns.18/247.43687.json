The favor you have done me, and which it announces you are still ready to do, is such as to lay me under the-greatest obligations. I had heard of the sale, but could not learn who was the purchaser; and twice I wrote to you, requesting you to take the trouble to make inquiry and give me information, but the letters must have miscarried, as I am sure, bad either of them got to your hands, my request would have been complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-10\">\u201c I now request that the property may he transferred to General *James O\u2019Harra, of this place, and that you will be pleased [. 48' to send him a certificate that the transfer has been made upon the books, or give, should he send a special messenger, the certificate to-that person, and draw upon him for the money you are in advance,.' which, if I had known it, should not have stood over so long.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>This letter was inclosed by O\u2019Harra to Gillman in the following letter, dated Pittsburg, September 10, 1811.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">\u201c Dear Sir : Inclosed you will receive General A.

I have now, sir, found a friend who will advance the sum necessary; that is, as far as ten thousand dollars. Though that .sum may not entirely cover the whole debt, it will come so near it that the balance, if any, could, I suppose, be easily accommodated; and you releasing the property, on receiving it, would release me from the greatest misery, and, at the same time, lay me UDder an \u2022everlasting obligation to you, without any injury to yourself; for I have no doubt that you could turn the money to much better .\u2022account than the furnace and lands will ever produce.

and that he afterward exercised acts of ownership over it, such as paying the taxes, etc.; and, in addition to that, there was a silence of St. Clair and his heirs for the period of about forty years; and if they found facts that would raise a strong equity in O\u2019Harra and his heirs to the beneficial ownership of the land, that -then they had a right to presume a grant from St. Clair to O\u2019Harra for the lands; that it made no difference as to the right of the jury to presume such grant upon such a stare of facts being proved, whether the evidence on the trial of this case tended to show that .\u2022such a grant ever had or had not been made by St. Clair to O\u2019Harra.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">The court refused the following charge requested by the defendants below: \u201c That if they found that the defendants were innocent or <em>bona fide </em>purchasers of the disputed premises, without notice of any other title in the plaintiff than the said supposed tax deed do O\u2019Harra, they must find for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">The court further charged that a recovery could not be had upon the collector\u2019s tax deed, \u201cbecause the taxes upon said premises and upon the other lands of St. Clair had been added together, and said premises sold at such tax sale for the taxes, etc., due upon all St. Clair\u2019s Ohio Company\u2019s purchase lands, as well as upon this 'tract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The court further charged the jury: \u201cThat if the said St. Clair Rnew of the said objection to said tax sale, and so knowing *it, [250 induced O\u2019Harra to advance the money due on account thereof\u2014 \u25a0O\u2019Harra being ignorant of such objection \u2014 and to take the deed to himself therefor, with the view to become the owner of such lands -through and by such tax deed, St. Clair and all claiming under him were estopped from insisting upon such objection to said deed; but If St. Clair was ignorant of such objection, and made such arrangement with O\u2019Harra to advance such money and receive such conveyance, or if O\u2019Harra was aware of such objection as well as St. j-Clair, no such estoppel would arise; that St. Clair had a right to \u25a0suppose the collector had conformed to the law in his proceedings to sell said lands for taxes; and the fact that St. Clair, by his letter of June 22,1811. constituted Gillman, the purchaser at said tax sale, his agent to do the things specified in said letter, and that Gillman, in transacting the business, knew of the objection, while St. Clair was in fact ignorant of it, would not estop St. Clair or those claiming under him from objecting to the deed; for it then might well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>have' been that St. Clair\u2019s ignorance of the errors in the tax sale-caused him to order or request G-illman to do what he directed him-to do by that letter; that the jury must further find such agreement or arrangements to have been made between St. Clair and O\u2019Harra, and that if St. Clair was ignorant of such objection, toestop him would require the jury to find that such ignorance on his part existed from his gross neglect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">The defendants excepted to the charge as given, and to the refusal' to charge as requested by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendantsfi'led their motion for a new trial, on the grounds that the court admitted improper evidence to be given by the plaintiff;

All the acts done by O\u2019Harra and his agents are referable to the tax deed. The acquiescence of St. Clair and his heirs is referable to the same thing;, for, being non-residents of Ohio, the law of Ohio as to these tax' proceedings and deed being void or valid is <em>a fact </em>to them, and' knowledge of it is not brought home to them. They must be held to have supposed the deed valid as a tax deed, because the presumption of law was that the officers did their duty according to law in the premises.

To countenance a claim on the part of St. Clair\u2019s heirs, under such circumstances, would be to sanction a clear fraud, or, at the least, <em>gross negligence </em>on the part of St. Clair himself, and his heirs after him. They stood by a long time, knowing O\u2019Harra\u2019s disbursements, and knowing their own rights, or having the means of knowing them, and made no objection.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b237-6\">Day, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0L\">The action in the court below was for the recovery of a section of land. Both parties claim title under Gen. St. Clair. The plaintiff in the action, as devisee of Gen. O\u2019Harra, claimed title from St. Clair under a <em>\u201c </em>presumptive grant,\u201d and by a collector\u2019s \u25a0deed to O\u2019Harra on a sale of the land for taxes. The defendants claimed title by deed from the heirs of St. Clair. They claim that the tax deed is void, and that the presumption of a grant is rebutted, because all the facts from which such a presumption can \u00a1arise are referable to the actual grant under the tax sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">It is conceded that the tax deed is void, for irregularities in the sale under which it was made. But it is claimed that the defendants are estopped from insisting upon the invalidity of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The arrangement by which O\u2019Harra obtained the deed was entered into with St. Clair after the defective sale for taxes was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>made, and before the deed was executed. On the question of the' estoppel, the court charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201c That if St. Clair knew of the said objection to said tax sale, and-so knowing it, induced O\u2019Harra to advance the money due on account thereof \u2014 O\u2019Harra being ignorant of such objection \u2014 and to&gt; take the deed to himself therefor, with the view to become the' owner of such lands through and by such tax deed, St. Clair and. all claiming under him were estopped from insisting upon such-objection to said deed ; but if St. Clair was ignorant of such objection, and made such arrangement with O\u2019Harra to advance sucb money and receive such conveyance, or if O\u2019Harra was aware of such objection as well as St. Clair, no such estoppel would arise;. . . . .' . that the jury must further find such agreement 253] *or arrangements to have been made between St. Clair and O\u2019Harra; and that if St. Clair was ignorant of such objection, <em>to estop Mm </em>would require the jury to find that such ignorance on his-part existed from his gross neglect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">. The clear implication of the last clause of the charge is that if St. Clair\u2019s ignorance of the defects in the tax sale existed from his-gross neglect or want of slight diligence to be informed thereof, he would be estopped from insisting on the objection to the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The jury might, then, fairly understand the charge, when taken together, to be that the estoppel claimed arises if St. Clair, by the exercise of slight diligence, might have known the defect in the tax sale, the same as it would had he known it in fact, and concealed it from O\u2019Harra.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In the entire absence of proof of any diligence whatever on the-part of St. Clair, to be informed of the correctness of the proceedings in the tax sale, the jury, with this understanding of the law, might readily find that his ignorance \u201c existed from his gross neglect,\u201d and that he would, therefore, be estopped from insisting upon the objection to the deed, whether he was ignorant of it or not,, when he made the arrangement with O\u2019Harra.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">This would be carrying the doctrine of <em>estoppel in </em>pais, as a muniment of title in real estate, to an extent not warranted by the authorities, nor by the principles upon which it is founded... The rule-adopted in the charge requires no vigilance on the part of O\u2019Harra, as the purchaser of the estate, nor that the seller should do or say anything to deceive the buyer. \u201cWithout any duty resting upon St. Clair, more than upon O\u2019Harra, to be informed about the valid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ity of the tax sale, his failure to exercise some diligence to be informed about it, without requiring any diligence on the part of O\u2019Harra, is, alone, made a fraud equivalent to the willful concealment of the fact if it had been known.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The same principle, applied to any case where knowledge is a material ingredient of fraud, would so modify the rule that a part}' will be held to know what he might know by the exercise of some' degree of diligence; and the question would *be, not whether [254 he knowingly mistakes or conceals a fact, but whether he would do' so if properly informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Under the charge in question, the jury were warranted in finding for the plaintiff below, although they found St. Clair entirely ignorant of any defect in the tax sale, and that he was actuated by the utmost good faith in the transaction, if they further found that he exercised no diligence to be correctly informed on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">We see nothing in this case to take it out of the rule laid down in McAfferty <em>v. </em>Conover\u2019s Lessee, 7 Ohio St. 99 : \u201c To work an <em>estoppel in pais, </em>and forfeit title, the acts and declarations of the owner must, in general, be <em>willful; </em>that is, with knowledge of his rights, or with intention to deceive the other party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Moreover, there does not appear to have been anything said by St. Clair that was not true, or anything done by him to mislead the other party. The defect in the tax sale was unknown to him, and OHarra was in no way deceived, in that respect, by him. The defect was a matter of public record, open and ascertainable to each of them equally. No special confidence, as to the validity of the tax sale, was reposed by OHarra in St. Clair. It was no more the duty of the one than the other to be vigilant to ascertain about the validity of the sale. If the transaction was a sale of real estate, it ,was as much the duty of the purchaser as of the seller, to beware of defects in the title. Their mutual ignorance of the invalidity of the tax sale no more affected the conscience of one than the other; and it maybe more unconscionable to enforce the invalid tax sale against one party, than it would be against the other to set it aside, and leave the parties to their rights, as they would then exist. That depends upon other matters not taken into the account in the part of the charge under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The charge, in the particular referred to, was, at least, calculated to mislead the jury, in a matter material to the case; and, upon the construction of which it was fairly susceptible, it was clearly erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>noons. For this reason, the cause must bo reversed, and the cause remanded for another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">255] *As to the other questions raised in the case, we express no opinion, for the reason that, upon the re-trial of the case, they may come up in a form so far modified by the facts as to make their present determination of little utility to the parties.</p>\n<judges id=\"b240-6\">Brinkerhoff, Scott, and White, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b240-7\">Welch, J., did not sit in the case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
