J. Andrews </em>and <em>M. R. </em>Keith, for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-12\">The question presented on this record involves merely the interpretation of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-13\">The plaintiff claims that it gives to him the <em>exclusive </em>right to-run sleeping-cars over the entire line, and every part of it, for the-term therein specified, and that such intent plainly appears upon the contract itself. The grant is of the exclusive right to run one- or more sleeping cars on and over the railroads of the defendants,. \u201c for the purpose of accommodating passengers traveling on said roads.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-14\">The language is general, evincing no intention to discriminate-between persons traveling on three of the roads and persons traveling on two of them; containing no words of restriction or limitation, but comprehending, as it seems to us, the whole line, and every part of the line \u2014 the through passengers and all other passengers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-15\">The limitation in the contract is not to the business or the pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>sengers, but merely to the mode in which the grant shall be carried into effect, that is, by attaching the cars to the night passenger express through train between Cleveland and Cincinnati. This view of the contract is aided by reference to the last clause, which provides for its renewal after three years, \u201c <em>provided that the parties of the first part desire a continuance of sleeping-cars on their roads;\u201d </em>showing that the enterprise was merely experimental, and that the agreement was intended to embrace the whole subject of supplying sleeping-cars on these roads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\">The contract is to be liberally interpreted in favor of the plaintiff. 9 Cushing, 45-56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-7\">The circumstances attendant upon making the contract show that our construction of it is the true one. The putting of sleeping-cars upon this line was an untried and doubtful experiment\u2014 so doubtful that these companies would not undertake it at thoir own hazard, or upon their own responsibility; and the exclusive .grant of the use of these roads for three years, for the transportation of all persons occupying sleeping-cars upon them, or either of them, was no more than a just and reasonable one for the expense and risk of building and running the sleeping-cars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-8\">557] *If it had boon understood that this <em>exclusive </em>grant related merely to <em>through </em>passengers, and that these roads reserved the right to put on the line, or permit others to put on the line, sleeping-cars other than those of the plaintiff, for the transportation of all the other passengers, and that they might not only do this, but might refuse to carry in the sleeping-cars of the plaintiff any other than through passengers; or if it had been understood that, under 'this <em>exclusive </em>grant, the Columbus and Xenia Eailroad Company .and the Little Miami Eailroad Company were loft at liberty to put, or permit others to put, upon the lino between Columbus and Cincinnati (a distance of more than half the entire line of the defendants) any number of sleeping-cars to be run in the night passenger express through train, 'and in direct competition with the sleeping-\u25a0cars of the assignors of the plaintiff, and that, too, without one word in the grant expressing or alluding to such a reservation or qualification, it is easy to see that the contract would never have '\u25a0\u25a0been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-9\">The contract is not in restraint of trade. 3 Pick. 188. So far from it, it was an attempt on the part of the defendants to increase, -without risk or expense to themselves, the accommodation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>public. But if it were held to be a contract in restraint of trade,, it is a legal and valid contract tested by the rules established by this court. It is limited as to time. It is founded upon a sufficient consideration. It is reasonable and not oppressive.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-4\"><em>D Thew Wright, </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">The contract means that plaintiff has only the exclusive right to run sleeping-cars the whole distance between Cincinnati and Cleveland, \u201c which said ears maybe run each way every night over-the line of said road between Cleveland and Cincinnati, in connection with the night passenger express through trains between said cities;\u201d and defendants therefore insist that allowing other sleeping-cars to run between Cincinnati and Columbus was no broach of the contract. Stanley has the exclusive right to rum sleeping-cars on the through train from Cincinnati to Cleveland, the whole distance. Del. &amp; Rar. Canal and C. &amp; A. R. &amp; T. Co. <em>v. </em>Rar. &amp; Del. Bay R. R. Co., 1 C. E. Green, 921, 362, 367.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-6\">*Wo insist that the construction Stanley puts upon the con- [558-tract would make it <em>ultra vires </em>and illegal; and wo understand it to be well settled that when an agreement is susceptible of two constructions, one of which would make it illegal and void and the-other valid, the latter construction will be adopted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-7\">It may be competent for each of these roads to say that Mr.. Stanley may run his cars over their individual lines, but when he-says they go further and give him the right to run not only over-their own lines, but those of the other defendants, then we say they have no such power, and if such is the contract it is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-8\">We claim that each road has said that he may run cars in this-<em>through </em>night train for <em>-through </em>business, and no other, so far as each road has the power to contract, which is for its own road' merely; and yet this suit is against the Cleveland and Columbus-road, because the Little Miami and Columbus and Xenia have-allowed cars to run on their lines.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-9\">Noav, what power had the Cleveland and Columbus road to contract and say that the other defendants should not run just such-cars as they pleased? If they did so contract, the contract is simply void, for the Cleveland road had no such power. The Little Miami, if so disposed, could give the Cleveland road no such power.

That agreement purports to have been made between the defendants, of the first part, and other parties, of whom the plaintiff is the assignee, of the second part; and its first article or memorandum is as follows: \u201c The said parties of the first part hereby grant unto said parties of the second part, the exclusive right and privilege to run one or more of \u2018Woodruff\u2019s patent couch .and seat passenger cars,\u2019 and any kind of sleeping-cars, bn and over the railroads of said parties of the first part, for the purpose of ac\u2022commodating passengers traveling on said roads, which said cars may bo run each way, every night, over the line of said roads, between Cleveland and Cincinnati, in connection with the night passenger express through train between said cities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The plaintiff admits that during the term provided for by the contract, no sleeping cars other than his own were at any time used on that portion of the line of said roads which belongs to the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad Company, and which -extends from Cleveland to Columbus. But he claims to recover, as upon a joint contract, against all the defendants, because sleopingcars other than his were permitted to be used and run over the southern portion of the line, owned by the two other defendants, and extending from Columbus to Cincinnati. The court below hold that such use of sleeping-cars other than the plaintiff's, upon .a portion of the line only, for the accommodation of passengers supon other lines of road, not passing to or through Cleveland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>-would not constitute a breach of the contract. Was this construction of the contract erroneous? Was it the intention of the parties to prevent each of the defendants from forming running connections with other roads, and providing such sleeping accommodations thereon as public convenience might require ? \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A train leaving Cincinnati for the east, on the Little Miami road, though drawn by a single locomotive, may consist of cars intended to be transferred to other roads at various points on its line. A portion of the ears may be ^intended for Marietta, to be [560 transferred to that road at Loveland; another portion may be filled with passengers for Wheeling or Pittsburg, each to be transferred at Columbus to the roads leading to those points; whilst another portion of the same train may be intended for transfer at Columbus to the Cleveland road, and properly constitute \u201c the night passenger express through train between Cincinnati and Cleveland,\u201d described in the contract. If no sleeping-cars could be attached to any portion of the train intended for those other routes, and not to pass \u2022over any part of the Cleveland road, it must be readily seen that the convenience of passengers, which was the avowed object of the \u2022contract, would be seriously limited and curtailed ; and that, too, without a corresponding benefit to the plaintiff; for very few passengers bound for Wheeling or Pittsburg, and expecting to reach Columbus about midnight, would take a sleeping-car which they must leave at that unseasonable hour. A construction which would thus make the contract militate against the convenience and comfort of the traveling public should not be given to it, unless it can not be fairly construed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">By the terms of the agreement, the plaintiff\u2019s sleeping-cars were to be run- over the railroads of the defendants, for the purpose of accommodating passengers traveling on <em>said roads </em>\u201d (without adding the words \u201c <em>or either of </em>them\"); and they were to bo run each way, every night, over <em>the line of said roads between Cleveland and Cin-cinnati.\u201d </em>And they were, further, to be run <em>\u201cin connection with the night passenger express through trains between said cities.\" </em>This language contemplates the roads of the three defendants as contitutiag one continuous line, extending from Cleveland to Cincinnati; and the arrangements between the defendants had doubtless made it such, practically, as to through passengers, though neither road had .-any concern with travel not passing over its portion of the line. 'The transit over the whole line, from its length, we may reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561, 562\">*561, 562</page-number>suppose, would occupy the most, if not the whole, of one night;; and little, if any, patronage could be expected for the sleeping-cars, except from those who would be, substantially, through passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The contract was, no doubt, intended to secure to the plaintiff\u2019s 561] ^assignors the exclusive right to furnish sleeping-cars for the accommodation of this through travel. But it is by no means clear that it was intended to prohibit each of the defendants from furnishing similar accommodations, through other agencies, to passengers upon other lines of railroad, though connected by running-arrangements with this night express train of defendants, so as to-be carried thereby <em>over some part </em>of the line between Cleveland and Cincinnati.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">An act of the legislature of New Jersey relative to certain canal and railroad transportation companies, prohibited, during the continuance of their charters, the construction of any other railroad or railroads in that state, without, the consent of said companies,, which should be intended or used for the transportation of passengers or merchandise <em>between </em>the cities of Now York and Philadelphia, or to compete in business with the railroad authorized by that act; and it was held by the court of chancery of that state-that the grant of this exclusive privilege operated only to protect the <em>through </em>business, <em>from city to city, </em>and not between intermediate places, and over any or every part of the route between the said-cities. 1 C. E. Green, 321. This case, referred to by counsel for-defendants, is, we think, somewhat similar to the present. It istruo, that was the case of a grant, which, as against the public, would bo construed strictly. But the same principle would require doubtful language in a contract, not to bo construed adversely to-the public interests or convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">No arrangements are shown to have been made among the defendants which gave the directory of the northern section of the-lino any control over such transportation as concerned the southern alone, or <em>vice versa. </em>If each of the defendants became bound, by this contract, in respect to passengers not transported over any part of its own section of the line, then in respect to such transportation each defendant became a surety or guarantor for its co-defendants. Its power to make such a contract of suretyship or-guaranty is, to say the least, questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">562] *By the' 24th section of the general railroad act of 1852,, each of the defendants was authorized to make running arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ments with the others in respect to traved or freight passing over the whole line, or from one section of it to the other. But a contract of guaranty by one of the defendants in respect to business on sections of the line other than its own, in which it had no interest and over which it could exercise no control, is quite a different affair. The plaintiff neither claimed in his petition, nor offered to prove upon the trial, that any sleeping-cars other than his own were permitted to be used, at any time during the continuance of the contract, upon any part of the northern section of the line; yet he claimed a joint judgment against all the defendants. His claim, as to the joint character of the contract, was sustained by the court below, and, we are inclined to think, properly sustained. And this feature of the contract is not to be lost sight of, in giving a reasonable construction to its stipulations. A construction which would render a defendant liable for breaches in which it had no agency, no interest, and no power of prevention, is not.to be favored. We can not reasonably presume, without language clearly to that effect, that such was the intention of the parties; but should rather presume that they intended to contract only in reference to through business, in which all had a common interest. A majority of the court think that the terms of the contract, considered with reference to the subject-matter, warrant this construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b521-6\">Day, C.
