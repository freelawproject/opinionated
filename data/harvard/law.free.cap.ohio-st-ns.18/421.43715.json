The state gave evidence tending to prove the forgery &lt;on the duplicate in the treasurer\u2019s hands, as charged in the indictment, this being the book on which the state claimed the forgery was committed. Smith objected to the admission of these books in evidence, but the court overruled the objection and permitted page 342 of both books to go in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">Smith now seeks to reverse this sentence and judgment upon the ground, among others, that the document set out in the indictment, is not a record.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-8\"><em>Kernan &amp; Kernan, </em>and <em>Lawrence &amp; Howenstine, </em>for Smith:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-9\">The duplicate is not a <em>record, </em>and the alleged forgery is therefore-not a crime. 2 Burrill\u2019s Law Dic., title, \u201cRecord,\u201d 386; 2 Bouv.

The tax duplicate charged to have been falsely-altered is not a record, as it is charged to bo in the indictment, within, the meaning of section 22 of the crimes act of March 26, 1835, as amended by act of March 24, 1865, defining the crime of forgery. S. &amp; S. 264. The statute, it will be observed, makes it forgery to-falsely make, alter, etc., \u201c any <em>record </em>or <em>other authentic matter of a public nature\u2019\u2019 </em>with intent, etc. Had the indictment in this case-charged the tax duplicate to b\u00f3 \u201c authentic matter of a public nature\u201d other than a record, the question presented would have been different. But the only question we now decide is the one presented in the case, to wit, is a tax duplicate a <em>record </em>within - the meaning of the section of the statute mentioned'? We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"ASN\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
