That subsequent to-the date of the agreement and within the time prescribed thereby, Brooks &amp; English, attorneys, made an examination of the title of said land and informed the defendant that the title was unsatisfactory to them because of certain charges against the said land which were encumbrances upon the same as well as on account of ambiguities in the description of the said land. Wherefore the plaintiff claims that there is justly due and payable to him the hand payment made to the defendant, viz: the sum of one thousand ($1,000) dollars, with interest from June 11, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-4\">The defendant avers in the third paragraph of his affidavit of defense that there are no encumbrances on said land except the encumbrances mentioned in the articles of agreement, \u2018and that there are no ambiguities in the description of said land, but that said land is accurately described in said agreement; and that the refusal to pass said title by Brooks &amp; English is unreasonable and without foundation; that the title to said land,is perfectly good and marketable; and he further avers in a supplemental affidavit of defense that the reason the plaintiff did not consummate the transaction in accordance with the agreement attached to the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim was not that there was any defect in the title or that there was any ambiguity in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>description of tlie land, but because he preferred to purchase another farm elsewhere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-4\">Brooks &amp; English, attorneys, by this agreement were constituted agents of the plaintiff and their rights in the premises could rise no higher than the rights of the plaintiff himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">We believe that the questions here raised are controlled by Dillinger v. Ogden, 244 Pa. 20, where it is said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">\u201cThe vendees were not at liberty to refuse arbitrarily to accept. They could not reject the title capriciously. If it was good, they were bound to take it. Abundant \u00bfuthority is to be found for this position. Thus in Folliard v. Wallace, 2 Johns. (N. Y.) 395, the grantee of land covenanted that he would pay the purchase-money to the grantor \u2018three months after he should be well satisfied that the title was undisputed and good against all other claims.\u2019 In an action for the purchase-money, Chief Justice (afterward Chancellor) Kent said, (p. 402) \u2018Nor Avill it do for the defendant to say he Avas not satisfied Avith his title, Avithout showing some laAvful encumbrance or claim existing against it. A simple allegation of dissatisfaction, Avithout some good reason assigned for it, might be a mere pretext, and cannot be regarded. If the defendant were left at liberty to judge for himself when he Avas satisfied, it would totally destroy the obligation, and the agreement would be absolutely void.......The law in this case Avill determine for the. defendant when he ought to be satisfied.\u2019 In Moot v. Investment Assn., 157 N. Y. 201, an action for the recovery of purchase-money, Martin, J., said (p. 211) : \u2018But it is said that the language of the contract was that the deed should convey a good and satisfactory title. Much stress is placed upon the word \u201csatisfactory.\u201d We think that word in no way changes the contract. A good title must be regarded as a satisfactory one.\u2019 The language of Chief Justice Kent in Folliard v. Wallace, cited above, is then quoted, And it is further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>said: \u2018This doctrine Avas reasserted in Brooklyn v. Brooklyn City B. B. Co., 47 N. Y. 475 (479), and again in Miesell v. Globe Mutual Life Insurance Co., 76 N. Y. 115 (119).\u2019\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">It may be that the attorney for the defendant could have said in so many Avords that Brooks &amp; English were capriciously and arbitrarily dissatisfied Avith the title to the land in order to help their client avoid the contract he had entered into, but what is pleaded in the affidavit of defense amounts to the same thing, and we think sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">And now, November 27, 1916, the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense is discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>Avas the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-8\"><em>John B. Brooks, </em>with him <em>Charles II. English, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtW\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, unless the defendant positively denies that the title was not satisfactory to Brooks &amp; English, and that they refused to pass the title: Quigley v. DeHass, 82 Pa. 267; Messner v. Lancaster County, 23 Pa. 291; McHugh v. Philadelphia, 62 Pa. Superior Ct. 550; Citizens Trust &amp; Surety Co. v. Howell, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 255.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-9\">The defendant in his affidavit of defense does not anyAvhere deny that Brooks &amp; English refused to pass the title. At the most, it is only an inference from the supplemental affidavit that Brooks &amp; English were satisfied. Avith the title, and this is not sufficient. He should not. leave it to inference, but should deny specifically and unequivocally that Brooks &amp; English refused to pass the title: Class v. Kingsley, 142 Pa. 636; Peck v. Jones, 70 Pa. 83; Myers v. Kipp, 20 Pa. Superior Ct. 311; Galena M. &amp; S. Co. v. Frazier, 20 Pa. Superior Ct. 394; Moore v. Somerset, 6 W. &amp; S. 262; Arons v. Kopf, 21 Pa.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The court below discharged a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and the only question raised on this appeal is the sufficiency of the averments in the affidavit, \u2014 that the attorneys for the appellant unreasonably and capriciously and without foundation in fact suggested defects in the title to be passed. The affidavit does specifically aver facts which, if true, can point to no other conclusion than that the excuse set up by the appellant for not carrying out his agreement was an afterthought, and that the real reason for not complying with the terms of his contract was that he had bought another farm and declined to purchase the one mentioned in the agreement and to lose the $1,000 hand-money forfeit. The facts averred by the plaintiff to sustain his action are emphatically denied in the affidavits, and the latter are to be taken as true under the pleadings. The reasons given in the opinion filed in the court below are sufficient to prevent a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
