Under this contract the construction company was to pay Smyser-Royer Company the sum of $4,975 from time to time as the work progressed. Smyser-Royer Company completed its contract about June of 1914, when there was due to it by the construction company $4,477.06. The construction company and Smyser-Royer Company had various dealing with each other, and in January of 1915 the Smyser-Royer Company wrote a letter to the construction company to the effect that if the construction company would cancel a contract it had for certain work with one R. C. Ballinger, so that a new contract for the same work could be en- \u25a0 tered into direct with Ballinger by the Smyser-Royer Company, the Smyser-Royer Company would pay the construction company $210 when they had received payment in full under the contract with Ballinger. Under this letter $210 became due by Smyser-Royer Company on January 24, 1916, when that company received its final payment from Ballinger. On January 15, 1915, the construction company assigned this agreement to the use-plaintiffs, Daly, Wielandt &amp; Company, who on February 17, 1915, notified the Smyser-Royer Company of this assignment. Subsequently the Standard Engineer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ing and Construction Company was adjudicated a bankrupt. It appeared that the Smyser-Royer Company did not prove its claim against the Standard Engineering and Construction Company in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-2\">Defendant presented, inter alia, the following point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-3\">6.

Under the law defendants were compelled to prove-this claim against the bankrupt estate within one year, from the adjudication of bankruptcy\u2014 this they failed to do \u2014 they cannot, therefore, prove this claim in this court by means of this set-off, and your verdict must be for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

The court below held that it was, pro tanto, a good set-off, and reserved a point as to whether it was invalidated under the provisions of Section 57n of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. The plaintiff moved for judgment n. o. v., which the court refused, and from the judgment entered has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">1. Appellant argues that the set-off could not be maintained. Section 57n provides: \u201cClaims shall not be allowed against a bankrupt estate subsequent to one year after the adjudication; or if they are liquidated by litigation and the final judgment therein is rendered within thirty days before or after the expiration of such time, then within sixty days after the rendition of such judgment.\u201d Under this section it has been held that to the extent of. the claim .made against a debtor, a counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>claim of such debtor against the bankrupt may be set off although it was not proved against the bankrupt\u2019s estate; but the surplus in favor of the creditor of the bankrupt cannot be recovered: N. &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Graham, 145 Fed. 809 (C. C. A.); and see Wagner v. Burn-ham, 224 Pa. 586, which reaffirms the principle in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">2. It is further contended that the evidence raised a question for the jury. The plaintiff filed no reply to the counterclaim, introduced no evidence relating to it, and mpst be held to have admitted the facts alleged therein under Rule 9, of the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">3. The set-off was good against the use-plaintiff. The right assigned was a mere chose-in-action, not negotiable, and the assignee acquired no greater right against the debtor than the assignor had: Pulaski Ave., 235 Pa. 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">4. The counterclaim was only good in so far as it extinguished the liability for $210, and for this purpose the Municipal Court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
