Elizabeth died January 20, 1842, during the lifetime of her husband, leaving a will dated January 18, 1840, wherein she attempted to exercise the power of appointment contained in the deed of trust. By this will she gave the ground rent to her executors in trust for her husband, Samuel, during his life and after his death in trust for her grandson, James Wright Hazlehurst. Samuel died July 9,1849. James died July 7,1915, leaving to survive him three children, Elizabeth Borie Hazlehurst, born June 1,1861, intermarried with Daniel Lam-mot; Henry McKean Hazlehurst, born December 27, 1867, and Alice M. Hazlehurst, born May 20,1871, intermarried with Edmund C. Taylor. James by his will devised the residue of his estate, including said ground rent, to the Home of the Merciful Saviour for Crippled Children. The plaintiffs in the interpleader are the children of James, and the defendant is the devisee under his will. The will having been probated before the passage of the Act of 27th of April, 1855, P. L. 368, it is contended on behalf of plaintiffs that James took an estate tail in the ground rent, which, upon his death, vested in Ms chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dren in tail. On behalf of defendant it is contended that James took a fee simple, and the ground rent therefore passed under his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AiUK\">The entire estate over which Elizabeth had power to appoint, including the ground rent, was devised to her executors in trust for her husband Samuel for life. After his death the ground rent was to be held in trust for James for life \u201cand from and after his decease in trust for his lawful issue then living, in such shares and for such estates as the said issue would have taken if my said grandson had died intestate, seized of an estate in fee simple in the said rent charge, and for want of such issue, then in trust for the sole and separate use of\u201d six children of testatrix and their respective heirs share and share alike. The said testatrix further provided: \u201cFinally, if for any cause the devises and bequests in favor of my son John, and my said grandson for life, with remainder to their appointees and issue respectively, shall be found upon principles of law to exceed my power in the premises then I do direct limit appoint and give the said share and the said ground rent respectively, to my said son and grandson respectively their respective heirs, executors and administrators forever, and not merely for life as aforesaid.\u201d \u2022 The reference to the son John relates to other provisions in the will not involving the ground rent in question..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">Elizabeth did not have absolute control over the disposition of the property. She could exercise the appointment by will or deed only during coverture, and if by deed only with the consent and approbation of one or more of the trustees. The remoteness of the estate appointed by her under her will must therefore be measured from the time of the creation of the power in the original deed: Lawrence\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 354.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">What was the nature of the estate limited by her will? It is contended that it was an estate tail and Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Watts 447, is cited as authority for this contention. In that case the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Court repeated the rule then declared to' be settled, that if a devise be made to one in fee and if he die without issue, or on failure of issue, or for want of issue, or without leaving issue, then over to another in fee, the estate of the first taker is a fee tail, which if he have issue, passes to them ad infinitum by descent as tenants in tail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-3\">The same opinion, however, states important exceptions to the rule. Where the contingency is, if the first taker die without issue before arriving at the age of twenty-one, or if he die unmarried and without issue, or if he die without leaving issue behind him, or living at the time of his decease, the testator has been considered as meaning a failure of issue within a fixed period and not an indefinite failure of issue. See also Lee v. San-son, 245 Pa. 392. In the case at bar (aside from the fact that James did not take an estate in fee, but only an equitable estate), the will provides for the gift over in trust for his issue living at the time of his death. In our opinion this takes the case out of the general rule stated in Eichelberger v. Barnitz and brings it within the exception, because a particular time is fixed (that is the time of the death of James), and definite persons as a class are selected (that is the issue living at that time). The estate taken by James was therefore not an estate tail. If it was not, his children could be held to take only by disregard of the rule against perpetuities. The trust created in 1808 was for the life of Elizabeth. By her will she appointed the estate for her husband for life and after his death for her grandson, James, for life. She, her husband and James were the only persons who could come within the limitation of lives in being and twenty-one years after. The estate had to vest under the rule against perpetuities within twenty-one years after the death of Samuel, the survivor of Elizabeth. Samuel. died in 1849. Whether the three children of James were born within twenty-one years after the death of Samuel, or not, is unimportant. The question is not who might have taken but who must have taken. There was no gift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>to these children within a period of twenty-one years after the death of the survivor of Samuel and Elizabeth, but the gift to them was not to take place until after the death of James, which occurred in 1915. Measuring from the date of the original instrument in 1808, we have an estate which finally was to vest in 1915, after a life estate in one who was not in being at the time of the creation of the trust and who has been in the enjoyment of the income for sixty-six years after the death of the last life in being. It is beyond question a gift over after this life estate is invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-2\">Anticipating this possibility, the testatrix provided that if it should be found upon principles of law that she had exceeded her powers, she gave the ground rent to her grandson James absolutely, and he by his will devised the \u25a0 same to the defendant in this interpleader. Judgment must therefore be rendered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-3\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-4\"><em>G.

By virtue of it, there was conveyed to trustees named certain real estate \u201cin trust for the sole and separate use of Elizabeth (the wife) with power of appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ment by will.\u201d In 1809 the trustees and the said Elizabeth conveyed a lot of ground in the City of Philadelphia reserving the annual rent, the ownership of which is the question in controversy between the parties. Elizabeth, the wife of the settlor, died in 1842 during the lifetime of her husband, having first made her will in which she exercised or attempted to exercise the power of appointment created by the deed of settlement. By this will she gave the ground rent in question to her executors in trust for her husband, Samuel, during his life and at the expiration of that life estate, then over to her grandson, James W. Hazlehurst, \u201cfor his use during his life and from and after his decease for his lawful issue then living,\u201d etc. The grandson of the testatrix lived until the year 1915, Avhen he died leaving to survive him several children, the plaintiffs in the present action. Their claim rests on the proposition that their father, James, under the will of his grandmother, took an estate in fee tail. It was held by the learned court below that no such estate was created and that the nominal devise over at the death of James contained in the will would violate the law against perpetuities. His Honor, Judge Ferguson, in the court beloAV, filed a learned opinion which, as we view it, furnishes convincing reasons for the conclusion reached. After discussing the case of Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Watts 447, the learned judge says: \u201cIn the case at bar the will provides for the gift over in trust for his issue living at the time of his death. In our opinion this takes the case out of the general rule stated in Eichelberger v. Barnitz and brings it within the exception, because a particular time is fixed (that is the time of the death of James) and definite persons as a Class are selected (that is the issue living at that time). The estate taken by James was therefore not an estate tail. If it was not, his children could be held to take only by a disregard of the rule against perpetuities.\u201d The opinion then proceeds by a line of reasoning to which we can see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>no successful answer to establish the proposition above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">Being satisfied as we are the conclusion reached by the court below was correct, we shall not attempt to elaborate further the interesting question presented in an admirable way in the brief of the learned counsel for ap: pellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
