The consideration upon which the plaintiff parted with his money failed. Unless something to the contrary appeared in the contract of subscription, he was therefore entitled to receive back from the organizers the money paid by him. As Avas said in Hudson v. West, 189 Pa. 491, \u201cThey received the plaintiff\u2019s money in consideration that they would form a company and give him stock therein......and they did nothing of the kind. They certainly cannot keep the plaintiff\u2019s money in those circumstances. Their want of success in the formation of the company is no concern of the plaintiff, and it is no defense in this action.\u201d See Lieb v. Painter, 42 Pa. Superior Ct. 399; Cook on Corporations, 6th Ed., Page 563; 10 Cyc. 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">If the agreement allows the sum subscribed or an indefinite part thereof to be used for the purposes of organizing the company, the subscriber cannot recover back in an action at laAv any part of the amount subscribed, but his remedy is a bill in equity for an accounting, but we are led to the conclusion that only the $5 referred to therein as \u201ca subscribed premium\u201d was available for the expenses of organization. ' Evidently the par value of the shares was to remain intact, and only the five dollars Heated as undivided profits Avas to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>be used for expenses. The words \u201cparts of which\u201d refer to the nearer antecedent substantive, i. e., \u201cthe subscribed premium\u201d of five dollars. The use of the plural \u201cparts\u201d has no significance as five dollars standing alone can be divided into parts as readily as the sums five dollars and fifty dollars considered together. The intention was that parts of the five dollars might be used from time to time as occasion demanded.. The five dollars Avas a separate fund, and the promoters in their expenditures Avere limited to it. We find nothing in the agreement which authorized the promoters of the enterprise to exhaust, or eArnti to consume in part, the amount specifically subscribed for capital stock. In the absence of an agreement to the contrary the promoters must bear the loss consequent to the collapse of the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
