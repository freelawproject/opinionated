Bodek, covering a period of about six months, the plaintiff referred to the original sales slip and discovered that a mistake had been made in sending the bill, statements and letters to the husband, and \u25a0 that after consulting their attorney they decided to bring an action against the defendant, Mrs. Joseph J. Bodek, in an attempt to collect the amount due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-6\">\u201cThe defendant testified she never bought the diamond bar pin upon\u2019her own credit; that her husband had ordered it and that she was with him when the purchase was made. Also, she testified that on a previous occasion she had purchased a bracelet from the plaintiffs which her husband did not like when she exhibited it to him, he demanding, it should be returned and that something else should be purchased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">\u201cIn rebuttal the plaintiffs\u2019 salesman testified that the defendant was alone when the diamond bar pin was purchased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-8\">Judgment for plaintiff for $230.

A. \u2014 Yes, sir. Q. \u2014 You sold this diamond bar pin? A. \u2014 Yes, sir...... The understanding with me was the pin was to be charged and sent to her......Q. \u2014 Did she say anything to you about it? A. \u2014 To charge the pin to her. Q. \u2014 Did she say that? A. \u2014 Yes, sir. Q. \u2014 ......Now did she or did she not say that? A. \u2014 She said to charge and send it to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVOf\">The court found for plaintiffs, refused judgment n. o. v., and from the judgment entered upon the finding we have this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">\u2019 Appellant contends that she was presumptively acting as her husband\u2019s agent in the transaction, and cites, inter alia: Moore v. Copley, 165 Pa. 294; Brouse v. Oliger, 36 Pa. Superior Ct. 399; and Clothier v. Wolff, 66 Pa. Superior Ct. 328; to which we might add: McCreery v. Scully, 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 524. This line of cases has two distinguishing features. There was no evidence that the wife undertook to pay, and the goods sold were family necessaries. Here we have express testimony that de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>fendant undertook to pay, and no evidence to show the article purchased was a family necessary. While plaintiffs\u2019 evidence is in some respects inconsistent, this inconsistency was for the trial judge whose finding is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
