This court, speaking through Rice, P. J., in Reznor Hotel Company\u2019s License, 34 Pa. Superior Ct. 525, decided the very question to the contrary. We quote, from the opinion in that case: \u201cThe fact that the place is necessary, either as a hotel or as an eating house for public accommodation does not necessarily and under all circumstances compel the conclusion that a license to the applicant to sell intoxicating liquors by retail at such place is necessary. In other words, not every place that may be necessary as a hotel or as an eating house for public accommodation is entitled as matter of right to' be licensed to sell liquors if the other statutory requirements are complied with.\u201d This was followed by our brother, Kephakt, in Cox\u2019s License, 60 Pa. Superior Ct. 128, wherein it is held that it was proper to consider the question of the accommodation that might be furnished to travelers, but that the ability to afford such accommodations furnished only a persuasive reason why the privilege to sell should be granted, but that it was not necessarily controlling. The appellant urges that we should recede from our former position by reason of the decision in Leister\u2019s App., 20 W. N. C. 224 (1887), to which no reference was made in the Reznor Case. In Leister\u2019s Appeal, the lay judges found that the tavern in question was necessary for the accommodation of the public and the entertainment of travelers, but refused the license. Afterward they filed another opinion giving additional reasons for refusing the license. The Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, stated that the first opinion of the lay judges put them in the awkward position of a clear violation of the prescriptions of the act of assembly, but that having, asserted other facts upon which the decision was premised their order should be sustained. The decision of the question before the Supreme Court did not require an expression of opinion as to the first action of the lay judges and, therefore, is mere dictum. As was clearly pointed out by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Rice in Reznor\u2019s License, supra, under the Acts of March 11,1834, P. L. 119, and April 14,1859, P. L. 653, the necessity for an \u201cinn, hotel or tavern\u201d being found, the right to the license might necessarily follow, but the Acts of March 22,1867, P. L. 40, and May 13,1887, P. L. 108, make the necessity of \u201cthe license\u201d the determining factor. The Supreme Court in the opinion in Leister\u2019s Appeal, supra, makes no reference to this distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The order of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
