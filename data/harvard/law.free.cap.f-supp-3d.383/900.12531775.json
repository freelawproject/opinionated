Having carefully considered the parties' papers, relevant legal authority, and the record in the case, and having had the benefit of oral argument, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Darkspilver's motion to quash for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 9, 2019, Petitioner Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society of Pennsylvania (\"Watch Tower\") filed this action to request that the Court issue a subpoena pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") to Reddit, Inc. to discovery the identity of Darkspilver (the pseudonym used by someone who posted on Reddit). On January 16, 2019, the Clerk issued the subpoena. Watch Tower served the subpoena on Reddit on January 24, 2010. (Dkt. 12 (Declaration of Paul D. Polidoro), \u00b6 11.) Reddit has not yet provided Darkspilver's identity and filed a document stating that it joins in Darkspilver's motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Darkspilver was raised as a Jehovah's Witness and has been a member of that community his\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   whole life. (Dkt. 8-1 (Declaration of John Doe (Darkspilver)), \u00b6 3.) Many of Darkspilver's friends and family members are currently active Jehovah's Witnesses, and Darkspilver considers himself a practicing Jehovah's Witness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Darkspilver states that there are aspects of the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses' teachings and practices that he questions and that he does not feel as though he can openly discuss his views with other members of the community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4.) He states that different opinions and questions are strongly discouraged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Darkspilver states that, in his experience, people who voice their disagreement or doubts \"face rejection [by] and disapproval\" from other members of the Jehovah's Witness community, including leadership and ordinary members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those who openly disagree with the organization's teachings publicly may be labelled \"apostates\" and be \"excommunicated\" or \"disfellowshipped\" from the community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Other Jehovah's Witnesses, including friends and family members, cut off ordinary social interactions with people who\n   have been disfellowshipped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Darkspilver has personal knowledge of people who, after voicing certain opinions, have been shunned by Jehovah's Witnesses, including people with whom they had close relationships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Reddit is a social media platform where people can post to different forums. Reddit allows people to use pseudonyms to communicate. For the past few years, Darkspilver has participated in a Reddit forum for self-described former Jehovah's Witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5.) Although Darkspilver does not consider himself a \"former\" member, he believes that it is the only place he has been able to discuss and debate matters related to the Jehovah's Witnesses freely and openly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Darkspilver also chose Reddit because of his ability to communicate anonymously on the site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Darkspilver states that keeping his name and identity private is necessary for him to feel comfortable participating in open discussions about religious teachings and practice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Darkspilver does not live in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6.) According to a map made by participants in the Jehovah's Witness forum, many of the participants reside in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6; Dkt. 12, \u00b6 9; Dkt. 12-4 (Ex. D (2,869 subscribers contributed to the map; 1,944 of those subscribers reside in the United States).) Watch Tower states that, as of April 9, 2019, there were \"34.1 thousand reported subscribers\" to the Reddit forum, which is an increase from the approximately 29,000 subscribers in November 2018 before Watch Tower issued the subpoena regarding Darkspilver. (Dkt. 12, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8.) Watch Tower issued notices of copyright infringement under the DMCA to Darkspilver and to one other subscriber to the Reddit forum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 7, 2019, Reddit informed Darkspilver of Watch Tower's subpoena for Darkspilver's identifying information based on two of Darkspilver's anonymous posts in the Reddit forum: (1) an advertisement and (2) a chart. (Dkt. 8-1, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.) Watch Tower states that both of these items are copyrighted works. (Dkt. 12, \u00b6 2.) The advertisement, which was published in a Watchtower magazine, encourages people to make donations to the Jehovah's Witnesses and directs readers to make donations through the website donate.jw.org. (Dkt. 8-1, \u00b6 8; Dkt. 8-2 (Ex. A).) Darkspilver states that, to his knowledge, both the Watchtower magazine and the advertisement are available for free online. (Dkt. 8-1, \u00b6 8.) Watch Tower published this advertisement on line at JW.ORG and on the back cover of the 32-page November 2018 issue of The Watchtower - Announcing Jehovah's Kingdom. (Dkt. 12, \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/watchtower-study-november-2018.) Darkspilver's stated that his reason for posting the advertisement on the Reddit forum was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   to show how openly the organization was petitioning for financial donations from members, to illustrate the organization's use of commercial advertising design, and to point out the organization's encouragement of online donations. All of these represented major changes from the teachings and practices the organization had ... espoused in the past. [Darkspilver] wanted to inform others and spark discussion about the organization's tone, message, and fundraising practices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Dkt. 8-1, \u00b6 9.) Darkspilver did not make any money by posting the advertisement on the forum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Darkspilver also posted a screenshot of a chart with information about the personal data the Jehovah's Witness organization stores and processes along with citations to relevant provisions of a European Union data privacy law called the General Data\n   Protection Regulation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10; Dkt. 8-4 (Ex. C).) The chart was an internal document that Watch Tower did not intend to publicly distribute. (Dkt. 12, \u00b6 2.) Darkspilver created this image by using data in an Excel file that he re-formatted to make it more visually appealing and easy to read on a screen. The Excel file that Darkspilver used to create this image is attached as Exhibit D to his declaration. (Dkt. 8-1, \u00b6 10; Dkt. 8-5 (Ex. D).) Darkspilver's stated that his reason for posting the chart on the Reddit forum was \"to provide information to people in the Jehovah's Witness community about the type of information the organization actually stores and what it does with that information.\" (Dkt. 8-1, \u00b6 11.) Darkspilver is \"aware of concerns that some former Jehovah's Witnesses have with respect to data the organization collects and stores,\" including \"records of the number of hours individual Witnesses spend doing direct evangelical outreach\" and \"internal handling of many issues, including abuse allegations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Darkspilver concludes: \"Although some people are concerned about data in the organization's possession, I am concerned about excessive deletion of stored information, largely because it might include information about past abuses (or the handling of past abuses) that might be helpful in the future for discovering or substantiating claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Darkspilver has serious concerns about Watch Tower obtaining his identity. He believes that it would chill his speech and would damage or destroy his relationships with friends and family who remain active members of the Jehovah's Witness community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.) Darkspilver believes that Watch Tower would be able to use information from Reddit to determine his real identity based on the information the Jehovah's Witnesses have collected about him, including his name and address. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Darkspilver explains that he has been part of the Jehovah's Witness community his whole life, and so the pain of social exclusion would be overwhelming. Additionally, if his identity is revealed, Darkspilver would not feel comfortable talking about his experience openly online. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Darkspilver would not have shared truthful information or commentary regarding the Jehovah's Witness organization if he knew that his name would be revealed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Darkspilver has already stopped posting on the former Jehovah's Witness Reddit forum and, if his identity is disclosed, he will not begin again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In support of his motion, Darkspilver also submits newspaper articles recounting stories from former Jehovah's Witnesses who were shunned or disfellowshipped from the religion. (Dkt. 8-6 (Declaration of Alexandra Moss); Dkt. 8-7 (Ex. A).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Watch Tower submits messages from subscribers to the Reddit forum after Darkspilver filed this motion to quash the subpoena. (Dkt. 12, \u00b6 7; Dkt. 12-1 (Ex. A).) Some subscribers posted messages stating that their speech would not be chilled by Watch Tower's efforts to obtain the identity of people they accuse of copyright infringement, but it is unclear if those users are, like Darkspilver, current members of the Jehovah's Witnesses. (Dkt. 12-2 (Ex. B).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Watch Tower is not Darkspilver's local church and does not have the ability to excommunicate him from his local congregation. (Dkt. 12, \u00b6 10.) Watch Tower states that no person who has been the subject of a DMCA subpoena has been excommunicated from his or her local church as a result of Watch Tower's learning his or her identity and that Watch Tower has not disclosed to the public the names of individuals who were the subjects of DMCA subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Watch Tower contends that the advertisement and the chart are protected by\n   copyright and that Darkspilver infringed Watch Tower's copyright by posting them. Darkspilver counters that his identity is protected by the First Amendment right to free speech and that his posting of these items were non-infringing fair use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion Is Not Untimely.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Watch Tower argues that the Court should reject Darkspilver's motion as untimely. However, the authority upon which Watch Tower relies applies to parties. Darkspilver is not a party to a lawsuit and was not even the recipient to of the subpoena. According to Watch Tower, Darkspilver should have moved to quash before the return date on the subpoena - February 15, 2019. But Darkspilver did not even have notice of the subpoena until after that date, on February 22, 2019. Moreover, it is undisputed that Reddit has not yet responded to the subpoena. Therefore, the Court finds that the motion is not untimely and will address the merits of Darkspilver's motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether the First Amendment Applies.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Watch Tower disputes that Darkspilver's speech is entitled to any protection under the First Amendment. According to Watch Tower, because Darkspilver resides outside of the United States, applying the First Amendment to his speech would be impermissible as an extraterritorial application of American law. For support, Watch Tower cites two cases evaluating different constitutional provisions - the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

In that case, the Court rejected the exterritorial application of the Fourth Amendment to a search conducted in Mexico of a Mexican resident and citizen's homes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5121\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/259/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5121\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/259/\">\n    at 262, 274-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5121\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/259/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In contrast, here, the constitutional right at stake is a different constitutional amendment - the First Amendment - and the asserted violation does not concern merely extraterritorial conduct. The subpoena here was issued by a Court in the United States, on behalf of a United States company (Watch Tower) and was directed against another United States company (Reddit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, the First Amendment protects the audience as well as the speaker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Desai v. Hersh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572244\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/719/670/#p676\">\n    719 F.Supp. 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (\"The first amendment shields the actions of speakers for the benefit of their audience.). As another court in this District explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The First Amendment does protect the public of this country. As Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in\n   <em>\n    A Quantity of Copies of Books v. State of Kansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there is a '\n   <em>\n    right of the public\n   </em>\n   in a free society to unobstructed circulation of nonobscenebooks' (emphasis added). The First Amendment surely was designed to protect the rights of readers and distributors of publications no less than those of writers or printers. Indeed, the essence of the First Amendment right to freedom of the press is not so much the right to print as it is the right to read. The rights of readers are not to be curtailed because of the geographical origin of printed materials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. 18 Packages of Magazines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"371415\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/238/846/#p847\">\n    238 F.Supp. 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847-48 (N.D.

As the Ninth Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The First Amendment interests in this case are not confined to the personal rights of [Plaintiffs].... Freedom of the press was not guaranteed solely to shield persons engaged in newspaper work from unwarranted governmental harassment. The larger purpose was to protect public access to information. Freedom of association was secured not only to protect the privacy of those who assert their rights in litigation, but also to shelter all persons from unjustifiable governmental prying into their associations with lawful groups. In the context of litigation, vindication of these public rights secured by the First Amendment is primarily committed to persons who are also asserting their individual constitutional rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"719598\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/466/1059/#p1083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although the exact percentage of subscribers to Reddit forum who live in United States is unknown, the only data before the Court suggests that a substantial number are United States residents.

Watch Tower argues that it laid out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of copyright infringement in its subpoena application. (Dkt. 11 (Watch Tower's Opp.) at pp. 13-14.) However, the application does not actually address the registration of any copyright or otherwise show that either the advertisement or the chart is a copyright protected work. The application simply states that that Darkspilver's posts infringe a copyright held by Watch Tower and cite to the declaration of Paul D. Polidoro in support of the subpoena application. (Dkt. 1 (Subpoena Application) at p.1.) The declaration does not address the copyright protections of either the advertisement or the chart. (Dkt. 2 (Declaration of Paul D. Polidoro in Support of Subpoena Application).) In the declaration in support of its opposition to the motion to quash, Mr. Polidoro states that \"Watch Tower is the copyright owner of the both\" the advertisement and the chart. (Dkt. 12, \u00b6 2.) This brief statement is the full extent of Watch Tower's evidence in support of its claim that it owns a valid copyright in the record before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Advertisement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Darkspilver does not contest that Watch Tower registered the publication in which the advertisement was included and thus does not contest copyright ownership for the advertisement. (Dkt. 8 (Mot. to Quash) at p. 10.) \"A certificate of registration from the U.S. Copyright Office raises the presumption of copyright validity and ownership.\"\n   <em>\n    Unicolors, Inc. v.

Therefore, for purposes of this motion, the Court will assume that the advertisement is part of a registered work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, Darkspilver does not contest that he posted copies of the advertisement on the Reddit forum. Therefore, the Court finds that Watch Tower has demonstrated a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of copyright infringement for the advertisement. Darkspilver argues that Watch Tower has not made a sufficient showing because his posting of the advertisement fell under the doctrine of fair use. However, Darkspilver bears the burden to prove the defense of fair use. Therefore, Watch Tower does not need to counter this defense in order to demonstrate a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of\n   copyright infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that Watch Tower has met its showing under the first prong as to the advertisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Chart\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is not clear that the chart meets the minimum standards of originality required for copyright protection. Watch Tower has not yet registered the chart. Therefore, the chart is not entitled to a presumption of copyright validity and Watch Tower must submit evidence to make the requisite showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Victor Lalli Enterprises, Inc. v.

Although a compilation of preexisting facts could meet the minimum for copyright protection if it features original selection, coordination or arrangement of those facts, the court found that the plaintiff's compilation failed to meet this minimum requirement. \"Although novelty is not required, some 'modicum of creativity' is necessary to transform simple compilation into copyrightable expression.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527041\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/936/671/#p673\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Feist Publications, Inc. v.

The court held that the charts were not entitled to copyright protection because the format of the charts lacked selectivity in what was reported and in how it was reported.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Here, Watch Tower summarily argues that \"the layout, design, and word choice [of the chart] are all creative in nature,\" with no supporting evidence. In the absence of any supporting evidence, the Court finds that Watch Tower has not met its burden to show, with competent evidence, its ownership of a valid copyright in the chart. Therefore, Watch Tower fails to demonstrate a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of copyright infringement with respect to the chart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Balancing of Harms.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because the Court finds that Watch Tower demonstrates a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of copyright infringement with respect to the advertisement, the Court will address the second prong - comparing the magnitude of the harms that would be caused to the competing interests by a ruling in favor of Watch Tower and by a ruling in favor of Darkspilver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Darkspilver presents evidence to show that revealing his identity to Watch Tower would chill his speech on the Reddit forum. He selected that forum because it was a place where he could communicate anonymously with other current and former Jehovah's Witnesses. (Dkt. 8-1.) He is concerned that, if Watch Tower discovers his identity, the revelation of his identity would damage or destroy his relationships with friends and family who are active members of the Jehovah's Witness community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.) Speaking anonymously is necessary for him to feel comfortable participating in open discussions about religious teachings and practice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5.) Darkspilver has already stopped posting on the Reddit forum and will not begin again if his identity is revealed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Watch Tower disputes Darkspilver's assertion that his free speech will be chilled by citing to statements made by other individuals posting on the Reddit forum stating that they would not be deterred from speaking and by the fact that the size of the forum has grown since Watch Tower\n   issued the subpoena. (Dkt. 12-2.) Considering that this is a forum for former Jehovah's Witnesses - people who have already left the religion and, presumably, the community - it is not surprising that some expressed that they would not be deterred from speaking if their identities were revealed. But select quotes from others do not undermine\n   <em>\n    Darkspilver's\n   </em>\n   expressed concern over speaking openly about\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   views on Jehovah Witness' practices. Moreover, to the extent other current Jehovah's Witnesses are publishing anonymous posts on this Reddit forum, they also might have concerns similar to Darkspilver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Watch Tower further argues that Watch Tower is not Darkspilver's local church and has no ability to excommunicate him from his local congregation. (Polidoro Decl., \u00b6 10.) Nevertheless, Darkspilver has expressed substantial concerns over having his identity revealed to anyone in the Jehovah's Witness community. The Court finds that Darkspilver has demonstrated significant harms if his identity were revealed publicly or even if it were revealed to Jehovah's Witnesses in his congregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On the other hand, if Watch Tower cannot determine Darkspilver's identity, Watch Tower would lose its ability to enforce its copyright. However, in evaluating the balance of the harms, the Court finds that it should address Darkspilver's defense of fair use. As the Ninth Circuit has made clear, although Darkspilver bears the burden of demonstrating fair use, \"for purposes of the DMCA - fair use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses.... [F]air use is 'authorized by law[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   , 815 F.3d at 1153 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1151 (\"Fair use is not just excused by the law, it is wholly authorized by the law.\") Moreover, because fair use is a non-infringing use authorized by statute, a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before issuing a takedown notification under the DMCA, which is required before obtaining a subpoena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1153 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A), 512(h)(4). If Darkspilver's posting of the advertisement was fair use, then it was not infringing and Watch Tower suffered no harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, the fair use doctrine is also relevant because Darkspilver is asserting a First Amendment right to comment on the advertisement.

Therefore, his use was presumptively fair. Moreover, his stated purpose was to evoke conversation about the Jehovah's Witnesses fundraising methods. He wanted \"to show openly the organization was petitioning for financial donations from members, to illustrate the organization's use of commercial advertising design, and to point out the organization's encouragement of online donations.\" (Dkt. 8-1, \u00b6 9.) According to Darkspilver, these fundraising methods were a major change from the teachings and practices the Jehovah's Witnesses had espoused in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He posted the advertisement to \"inform others and spark discussion about the organization's tone, message, and fundraising practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Watch Tower does not challenge this motivation.

However, the advertisement that Darkspilver posted directs people to visit the website to make a donation. Nevertheless, Watch Tower has not yet had a chance to conduct discovery on its copyright claim or to engage an expert to conduct a market analysis. Perhaps Watch Tower, if provided the opportunity, could demonstrate that fewer people visited its website after Darkspilver's posting. The Court is hesitant to deprive Watch Tower of the opportunity to develop its claim and supporting evidence before it has even filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In balancing the harms, while considering the fair use defense, the Court finds that they tip sharply in Darkspilver's favor. However, the Court notes that Darkspilver's concerns stem largely out of his fear that those in his congregation will discover his identity and shun him. If Reddit reveals Darkspilver's identity to Watch Tower's counsel, under an \"attorney's eyes only\" restriction, then any harm to Darkspilver would be alleviated. This restriction would enable Watch Tower to pursue its copyright claim without causing harm to Darkspilver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, the Court HEREBY GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Darkspilver's motion to quash.
