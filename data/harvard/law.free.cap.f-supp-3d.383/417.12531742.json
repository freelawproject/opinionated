Upon consideration of the parties' motions for summary judgment, and the responses thereto, the motions will be denied for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Humana is a healthcare insurance company that routinely requests copies of medical records from healthcare providers to audit post-payment claims for treatment of the healthcare providers' members that use Humana's insurance plans. In addition to traditional health care plans, Humana contracts with the Centers for Medicare\n   and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") to provide Medicare Advantage plans as an alternative to traditional Medicare coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to requests for copies of medical records, some healthcare providers send them to Humana directly, while others contract with release of information (\"ROI\") providers, such as MRO, to send those records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When MRO contracts with healthcare providers to assist them in copying and delivering medical records to the persons or entities that request those records from the healthcare providers, it generally is paid by the requesters of the records, not the healthcare providers. Although Humana and MRO have no formal contractual relationship, the parties do not dispute that when MRO sends copies of medical records to Humana, Humana reimburses MRO for the copies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Most states have enacted statutes and regulations that address requirements and limitations regarding the payment for obtaining copies of medical records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For each state in which MRO operates, it has adopted a rate schedule based on the state rate provisions, or if none, what it has determined to be a reasonable rate (the \"State Rate\"). MRO's position is that \"[o]ne of the norms of the industry is that Requesters will pay the 'state rate' for medical records in the state the health care provider is located in.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From 2010 to 2012, MRO routinely and primarily pre-billed its State Rate to Humana for record requests and was paid the invoiced amount by Humana. In 2012, after disputes arose over Humana's failure to pay invoices in advance of the receipt of the records, a telephone conference was held on January 8, 2013, between employees of MRO and Humana. Although the conversation was not memorialized in writing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and there were no specific discussions about continuing to pay State Rates,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the result of the call was that MRO would eliminate the pre-bill requirement and Humana would pay the outstanding invoices and future invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2015, Humana sent a notice of its new reimbursement payment policy (the \"Policy\") to all of its healthcare providers and gave a copy to MRO, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Payment for copying fees shall be made at:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   a. The rate explicitly outlined in the physicians or other health care provider's contract, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   b. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) rate of 12 cents per page or up to $ 25 maximum per record, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   c. In the case of commercial claims, the rate outlined in the state statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ...Humana does\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   prepay for records, and reimbursement is made once record requests are fulfilled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Beginning in July 2015, Humana stopped paying MRO its requested invoice amount for medical records, and started applying the CMS rate for many of the record requests fulfilled by MRO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Humana asserts that the vast majority of the invoices at issue were for requests related to Medicare Advantage plans administered by Humana, which are regulated by CMS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because there was no contract between Humana and MRO, Humana contends that the CMS rate of 12 cents per page or up to $ 25 maximum per record as the basis for medical record reimbursement for Medicare Advantage plans applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   MRO contends that the State Rate, which Humana had always paid before, is the appropriate one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The underlying purpose of summary judgment is to avoid a pointless trial in cases where it is unnecessary and would only cause delay and expense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   A court will award summary judgment on a claim or part of a claim where there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   A fact is \"material\" if it could affect the outcome of the suit, given the applicable substantive law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   A dispute is \"genuine\" if the evidence presented \"is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In evaluating a summary judgment motion, a court \"must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\" and make every reasonable inference in that party's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, a court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the party opposing summary judgment must support each essential element of the opposition with concrete evidence in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, if, after making all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, the court determines that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. MRO's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment to Preclude Humana's Fourteenth Affirmative Defense\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   MRO argues that Humana's fourteenth affirmative defense-that the rates\n   it pays are \"legally permissible\"-is unsupported as a matter of law and should be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The evidence in the record shows that CMS explicitly permits two types of entities to reimburse at the CMS rate-Quality Improvement Organizations (\"QIO\") and Recovery Audit Contractors (\"RAC\"). CMS contracts with QIOs to perform reviews of certain Medicare service providers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and contracts with RACs for the purpose of reviewing claims and identifying Medicare underpayments and overpayments and recouping overpayments made to healthcare providers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   QIOs are entitled to the CMS rate under federal regulations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on March 26, 2012, CMS issued an update on its website stating that RACs are entitled to the CMS rate, effective April 1, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although it is undisputed that Humana is neither a QIO nor an RAC,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   this does not necessarily prohibit it from legally being able to utilize the CMS rate for its plans, such as Medicare Advantage. MRO has not established as a matter of law that Humana is barred from using the CMS rate in its Policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   or whether the rates\n   would be understood to apply to Medicare Advantage plans-an issue that may ultimately affect the outcome of the suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, summary judgment on Humana's fourteenth affirmative defense will be denied, and this defense will not be stricken at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Humana's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Promissory Estoppel Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under Pennsylvania law, promissory estoppel is an \"equitable remedy to a contract dispute...[which] makes otherwise unenforceable agreements binding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   A plaintiff must prove that: \"(1) the promisor made a promise that he should have reasonably expected to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee; (2) the promisee actually took action or refrained from taking action in reliance on the promise; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   There must be an\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   promise between the promisor and the promisee; a \"broad or vague implied promise\" will be deemed insufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   To qualify as an express promise, courts have held that the promise must indicate with \"reasonable certainty\" the intent of the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Humana argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on MRO's promissory estoppel claim because MRO has not shown that Humana provided any express promise to reimburse MRO at State Rates for copies of medical records. MRO concedes that \"there were no specific discussions surrounding [S]tate [R]ate[s]\" during the January 8, 2013 telephone call between MRO and Humana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, Humana may have made an express promise to pay State Rates in its May 2015 Policy, which provided that \"[i]n the case of commercial claims,\" payment for copying fees would be made at \"the rate outlined in the state statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy itself does not define \"commercial claims,\" and based on the current record, the Court cannot determine as a matter of law whether requests for records related to Humana's Medicare Advantage claims are commercial claims payable at the State Rates, or whether the CMS rate reasonably could be understood to apply in such circumstances. Industry practices explained through witnesses and possibly expert testimony would assist in decoding the language of this Policy in\n   order to understand the significance of what promises Humana made in the Policy. Humana's motion for summary judgment on the promissory estoppel claim against it therefore will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Unjust Enrichment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Unjust enrichment is essentially an equitable doctrine which arises from a quasi-contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish a claim for unjust enrichment in Pennsylvania, a plaintiff must prove: \"(1) a benefit conferred on the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) appreciation of such benefit by the defendant; and (3) acceptance and retention of such benefit under circumstances such that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment to the plaintiff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The most significant element is whether the enrichment of the defendant is \"unjust,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   which requires that the plaintiff show that the defendant \" 'either wrongfully secured or passively received a benefit that...would be unconscionable for [it] to retain.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Damages are measured by the reasonable value of the services rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Humana first contends that it is a third party that benefits from the contracts between MRO and healthcare providers, and that because it neither directly requested the benefit from MRO nor misled\n   MRO into performing, no benefit was conferred on Humana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Humana's argument, however, ignores the working relationship and industry practice between ROI providers, who assist healthcare providers in copying and delivering medical records to those who request them, and the requesters, who generally pay fees for those services. This relationship involves more than simply a defendant being a third-party beneficiary to a contract, as Humana and MRO have been involved in direct dealings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   notwithstanding the absence of a formal contract. Unjust enrichment is intended to apply to this type of relationship where no written agreement or express contract is found.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Humana also asserts that summary judgment should be granted in its favor because it paid MRO for the copies of the medical records at issue, and there is no evidence that Humana's payment was not equal to a reasonable value for the records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, its argument that it provided some payment to MRO is at odds with the equitable nature of unjust enrichment; some payment to a plaintiff for the benefit conferred does not eradicate whether it is nonetheless \"unjust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, there is competing evidence in the record as to what is considered a reasonable value for MRO's services based on industry practices and previous transactions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Pennsylvania courts have held that \"[r]easonable value is what someone normally receives for a given service in the ordinary course of its business from the community that it serves,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   a question which usually involves a fact-intensive inquiry for a jury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   summary judgment on MRO's unjust enrichment claim will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, MRO's motion for partial summary judgment and\n   Humana's motion for summary judgment will be denied. An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Although the operative Amended Complaint also alleges a breach of contract claim against Humana, MRO provided in a joint status report on August 31, 2017, that it \"does not intend to move forward on its breach-of- contract claim (Count I).\" Joint Status Report [Doc.
