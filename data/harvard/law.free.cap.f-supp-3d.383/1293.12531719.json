STEELE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the defendant's motion for summary judgment and the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment. (Docs. 50, 51). The parties have submitted briefs and evidentiary materials in support of their respective positions, (Docs. 50-52, 54-55, 58-59), and the motions are ripe for resolution. After careful consideration, the Court concludes that the defendant's motion is due to be denied and the plaintiff's motion granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the amended complaint, (Doc. 9), the plaintiff was employed by the defendant, the owner of a number of Burger King restaurants. The plaintiff sought FMLA leave in February 2017 to care for her hospitalized mother but did not receive such leave and instead was terminated days later. The complaint asserts claims for interference with the plaintiff's FMLA rights and retaliation for exercising those rights. The defendant seeks summary judgment as to both claims. The plaintiff seeks summary judgment as to her interference claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Summary judgment should be granted only if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

The defendant argues these communications did not suffice because the plaintiff did not also notify Human Resources of her need for leave. The defendant's FMLA policy, as expressed in its employee handbook, includes the statement that \"[e]mployees should notify their supervisor and Human Resources for approval for a leave\"; the policy later states that \"[a]ll employees requesting FMLA leave must provide Human Resources with verbal or written notice of the need for the leave.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The defendant assumes that an employer's \"usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave\" means, when the employer has an FMLA policy addressing such matters, the employer's requirements for requesting FMLA leave specifically, even if those requirements differ from, and are more onerous than, its requirements for requesting leave in general. The defendant cites a number of cases that indulge the same assumption without subjecting it to critical analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   For reasons that follow, the Court rejects this reading of the regulations and concludes that the relevant notice and procedural requirements are those governing leave generally, not FMLA leave specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As always, analysis begins with the text. The regulations speak in terms of the usual and customary requirements for requesting \"leave,\" not those for requesting \"FMLA leave.\" The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") knew the difference, as it uses the terms \"FMLA leave,\" \"FMLA-qualifying leave\" and \"FMLA-protected leave\" at least ten times in Section 825.302. The regulation also uses the unadorned \"leave\" repeatedly, but the context makes clear what is intended. Subsections (a), (b) and (c) are each introduced with the phrase, \"FMLA leave\" or \"FMLA-qualifying leave,\" and subsequent usages of \"leave\" within those subsections plainly refer to the FMLA leave mentioned initially. Subsection (f) addresses intermittent or reduced-schedule leave and so obviously addresses FMLA leave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Subsection (d) is different, as it begins with five consecutive references to \"leave,\" the first of which is the presently relevant grant of permission to enforce compliance with the employer's usual and customary requirements \"for requesting leave.\" As subsections (a), (b) and (c) reflect, if these requirements were those for requesting \"FMLA leave\" specifically, subsection (d) would have followed the pattern of the preceding subsections and employed that phrase to introduce the provision. Moreover, the first usage of \"FMLA leave\" in subsection (d) appears in the following sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Unusual circumstances would include situations such as when an employee is unable to comply with the employer's policy that requests for\n   <em>\n    leave\n   </em>\n   should be made by contacting a specific number because on the day the employee needs to provide notice of his or her need for\n   <em>\n    FMLA leave\n   </em>\n   there is no one to answer the call-in number and the voice mail box is full.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.302\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added).

The agency's use of \"leave\" rather than \"FMLA leave\" in subsection (d) must be presumed to be purposeful and to reflect its intention that the usual and customary requirements an employer may enforce in the FMLA context are those generally applicable to other forms of leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under Section 825.303, \"in the case of an emergency requiring leave because of a FMLA-qualifying reason, written advance notice pursuant to an employer's internal rules and procedures may not be required when FMLA leave is involved.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.303\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

First, \"[a]n employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave does not need to expressly assert rights under the Act or even mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation to provide notice ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.301\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

These provisions protect an employee from being denied FMLA leave based on the employee's lack of understanding that her need for leave is potentially FMLA-qualifying. It would seem a curious regime that would grant such protection only to effectively negate it by requiring the employee to follow an explicitly FMLA-specific notice procedure - which she would do only if she understood that her leave could be FMLA-qualifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, \"the employer may take appropriate action under its internal rules and procedures for failure to follow its usual and customary notification rules, absent unusual circumstances, as long as the actions are taken in a manner that does not discriminate against employees taking FMLA leave.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.304\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). It would seem difficult to discriminate in the enforcement of notification rules unless the same rules apply to both FMLA leave and non-FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The language of the regulations readily supports a reading that restricts the \"usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave\" to those requirements applicable to leave generally and that does not permit employers to deny leave based on a failure to comply with more stringent notice and procedural requirements applicable to FMLA requests but not to other forms of leave.

Both sections preclude the employer from delaying or denying FMLA leave when \"unusual circumstances justify\" the employee's failure to comply with the employer's usual and customary notice and procedural requirements for leave. The plaintiff argues that this case presents unusual circumstances justifying her failure to contact Human Resources. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The following facts are uncontroverted. In late November 2016, as it was finalizing its acquisition of 190 stores, the defendant required its newly acquired employees to complete and/or sign a number of online documents. These included at least: a job application; a W-4; an I-9; payroll documents; and the 31-page employee handbook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employees in the plaintiff's store were required to come to the office, log in and complete all these tasks while on the clock and working a shift, and they took an average of ten minutes to complete all these assignments; the defendant did not instruct Owes to ensure that employees had enough time to read the handbook, and Owes did not tell the plaintiff to take the necessary time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff did not read the handbook or its 2\u00bd-page FMLA policy, because she did not have time to do so, since she was running a shift; indeed, it was not possible to complete all the paperwork and read the handbook in ten minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff did electronically sign or initial the final page of the handbook eight times, including to acknowledge that she had received a copy of the handbook and that she understood her responsibility to read and comply with its policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   She\n   did not, however, actually receive a physical copy of the handbook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did the defendant conduct any training in the plaintiff's store regarding the handbook in general or the FMLA policy in particular.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   When completing her online paperwork, the plaintiff had the option to print out the handbook but did not do so; neither did any other employee of the plaintiff's store, to Owes' knowledge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   At some point during the plaintiff's employment, Owes printed a copy of the handbook and left it in the store.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   If employees create a user name and password when completing their online paperwork, they can log in to the platform remotely at other times and access the handbook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Between November 24, 2016, when she completed her online paperwork, and February 13, 2017, when her employment was terminated, the plaintiff did not obtain or review the employee handbook and did not know the defendant's policy regarding whom to contact if she wanted FMLA leave. She did not know whether the FMLA applied to employees of the defendant and, until approximately February 8, 2017, she was unaware of the FMLA's existence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The defendant trained its newly acquired managers, but it did not address the FMLA policy with them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the plaintiff sought time off to assist her hospitalized mother in February 2017, Owes did not know what the defendant's FMLA policy was, because no one had ever told her and she had never read the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant advertised its \"respect policy\" by placing posters in its restaurants that advised employees to contact Human Resources, but it did not do so with regard to its FMLA policy or its notice requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As noted, the defendant's FMLA policy requires employees to \"notify their supervisor and Human Resources for approval for a leave.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is the defendant's policy (not expressed in the handbook) that a manager, upon becoming aware of an employee's need for leave that might qualify for FMLA leave, must inform the employee of their entitlement to FMLA leave and must tell the employee to contact Human Resources, and managers are so instructed. Furthermore, Human Resources will accept notice from a store manager in lieu of the employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The following facts regarding the plaintiff's efforts to obtain leave are also uncontroverted. On Friday, February 3, 2017, the physician for the plaintiff's mother advised the family that the mother had a serious infection that would require hospitalization and surgery. On Saturday, February 4, 2017, the physician called the mother to advise that, because her culture from the previous day showed growth, and because her clinical examinations showed deterioration over the past few days, she would be admitted to the hospital over the\n   weekend, with a procedure set for Monday.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff worked her shift Saturday afternoon, and while there she told Owes that her mother was in a life-or-death situation that required surgery, and that she needed a week off to be with her. Owes said to take all the time she needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On Sunday, February 5, 2017, the plaintiff's mother was admitted to the hospital. The plaintiff ended up finding her own substitute to cover her Sunday evening shift.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   About 7:00 p.m., Owes informed the plaintiff that she (Owes) would not work the 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. shift on Monday the sixth because she had pink eye and that the plaintiff would have to work the shift instead; the plaintiff responded that Morrissette would have to find someone to work in her place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   She then texted Morrissette, \"Can you get someone to cover my shift for a few days please i have to be with my momna [sic] right now,\" to which Morrissette responded, \"Let [Owes] know. I have no one.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff related this response to Owes, who tried to reach Morrissette, but Morrissette would not answer the phone or text Owes back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff ultimately did not work on Monday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The plaintiff was scheduled to work from 4:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, February 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the night of Monday, February 6, Owes texted the plaintiff to ask, \"Are you going to be able to open in the morning?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff responded, \"no I might can't come back for a few days,\" and Owes understood the plaintiff had requested this time off to care for her mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Owes nevertheless changed her query to a command, instructing the plaintiff to open the store Tuesday morning because Owes had a morning medical appointment; the plaintiff responded, \"ok.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On Tuesday, February 7, the plaintiff overslept due to caring for her mother, but she came in and did her job, leaving late morning after Owes arrived to relieve her. Owes wrote up a verbal warning disciplinary notice for tardiness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The plaintiff was scheduled to work the early shift on Wednesday, February 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff had by this time asked for leave due to her mother's hospitalization twice (on Saturday and Sunday) and had then reminded Owes of her unavailability (on Monday). Owes had told her on Saturday to take all the time she needed and, while she had then required the plaintiff to work a partial shift on Tuesday morning when Owes could not cover for her, Owes did not request or demand that the plaintiff work her Wednesday shift. The plaintiff concluded, reasonably, that she was not required to report to work on Wednesday.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Around 7:00 a.m. on Wednesday, Owes texted the plaintiff, \"You supposed to been to work this morning today was supposed to be me off day I take that as a no call no show.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though Owes admits it was\n   not the plaintiff's job to find a replacement but the responsibility of Owes and Morrissette to do so, Owes wrote up a \"final written warning\" based on the plaintiff's failure to show up for work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Around 8:00 a.m., Morrissette (who had been silent since Sunday evening) texted the plaintiff, \"No call no show this morning? No phone call. One more will lead to termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The plaintiff was not scheduled to work on Thursday the ninth or Friday the tenth, but she was scheduled to work Saturday the eleventh and Sunday the twelfth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about Wednesday the eighth, the plaintiff learned from her aunt about the existence of the FMLA and her right to leave, and on that date she went to the store office and told both Owes and Morrissette that she needed to file FMLA, which they said was fine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff handed Morrissette a note from her mother's doctor and told Morrissette that her mother was in a very bad state and that she needed time off to tend to her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff asked Morrissette how to go about obtaining FMLA leave, but Morrissette never - then or later - told her she needed to call Human Resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   On Wednesday and Thursday, the plaintiff asked Morrissette several times - both in person and by text - for the forms needed to file for FMLA leave, and Morrissette's response was always that she was working on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff also asked Owes for help in obtaining FMLA leave, but Owes said to deal with Morrissette because she knew nothing about the FMLA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On the morning of Thursday the ninth, the plaintiff requested by text that Morrissette get her the necessary papers by Friday so as to avoid another no call no show. Morrissette responded that she \"need[ed] a phone call.\" Two hours later, Morrissette texted that she had not forgotten but was \"waiting on the response.\" Four hours later (after a reminder from the plaintiff), Morrissette texted, \"Give me to after this webcast and I'll call again.\" About an hour later, Morrissette sent a cryptic message: \"\n   <em>\n    April.thomas@gpshospitality.com.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thomas was the defendant's Human Resources employee in charge of FMLA administration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the plaintiff did not know that, and Morrissette did not tell her; nor did Morrissette tell the plaintiff she needed to contact Thomas in order to request FMLA leave. The plaintiff, not understanding this unexplained text, called Morrissette and asked for help because she did not know what to do. Morrissette responded, \"I sent you what you needed, figure it out on your own.\" The plaintiff clicked on the link, but it brought her to a whole lot of confusing stuff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On Monday, February 13, barely a week after first requesting leave, the plaintiff's employment was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To summarize, the defendant's FMLA policy requires an employee to give notice to both her supervisor and Human Resources. The defendant also requires a manager receiving notice of a potentially FMLA-qualifying need for leave to tell the\n   employee to contact Human Resources. The plaintiff gave Owes notice of her need for potentially FMLA-qualifying leave on at least February 3, February 5 and February 8. The plaintiff gave Morrissette notice of her need for potentially FMLA-qualifying leave on at least February 4 and February 8. Neither Owes nor Morrissette, however, though both are managers, told the plaintiff to contact Human Resources. The responsibility for the plaintiff's failure, therefore, lies with the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The defendant quibbles with the characterization of the manager's responsibility as being \"policy,\" (Doc. 55 at 15), but that is the word the defendant's witness employed, and the deposition excerpt on which the defendant relies does not retract it, at least not with respect to telling the employee to contact Human Resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the broader point is that, regardless of whether the obligation is mentioned in the employee handbook or formalized in a \"policy,\" the defendant \"require[s]\" its managers \"to tell the employee to reach out to human resources.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no room for debate in that absolute statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The defendant's only other argument is that it is really the plaintiff's fault she did not contact Human Resources, on the theory that the employee handbook states she had to do so and that she was constructively aware of this requirement. The handbook, however, requires the employee to contact both her supervisor and Human Resources, and it does not require that the latter notice precede the former. (On the contrary, an instruction for the manager to tell the employee to contact Human Resources would be superfluous if the defendant required or expected that an employee's notice would always be made initially to Human Resources.) The plaintiff therefore followed the notice requirement by giving notice first to Owes and Morrissette; at that point, the burden shifted to Owes and Morrissette to direct the plaintiff to Human Resources, a burden they failed to satisfy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The defendant has chosen a particularly bad set of facts for arguing that the plaintiff was required to contact Human Resources without management fulfilling its duty of telling her to do so. It is uncontroverted that it was impossible for employees to read the employee handbook in the amount of time allocated for them to complete all their employment paperwork, and it is more than a little unrealistic to expect an employee bombarded with a 31-page handbook on top of all her employment papers to absorb and retain, in the span of a few minutes, the mounds of minutiae contained therein even could she clap eyes on the whole. Nor did the defendant train its newly acquired employees on the FMLA policy or post notice information in the plaintiff's store, as it did for its respect policy. Even Owes, as store manager, was wholly ignorant of the defendant's FMLA policy - as, it appears, was Morrissette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The defendant argues that its cavalier approach to informing employees of its FMLA notice requirements is immaterial because the plaintiff could have printed out the handbook when she completed her employment paperwork, could have reviewed the copy of the handbook kept in the store office, or could have found the handbook online. Perhaps, but by the same token the\n   plaintiff could have asked Owes and Morrissette for FMLA-qualifying leave - as she did - which likewise should have resulted in the plaintiff's timely awareness of how to proceed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \"What circumstances qualify as 'unusual' is not well defined in the regulations or in case law ....\"\n   <em>\n    Villegas v.

The Court agrees that if the facts underlying an asserted unusual circumstance are in dispute, the jury must find those facts.

On such a claim, the plaintiff need not \"prove a causal connection between her leave request and her termination,\" because \"the employer's motives are irrelevant\"; rather, the employer must prove, as an affirmative defense, \"that it would have discharged [the plaintiff] for a reason wholly unrelated to the FMLA leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Spakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085932\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1307/#p1309\">\n    631 F.3d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The plaintiff does not address whether she was still entitled to FMLA leave at the time she was terminated, so as to fall within the pattern of\n   <em>\n    Spakes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , and the Court perceives no clear answer. Because the plaintiff's mother remained hospitalized and the plaintiff continued to care for her, the plaintiff maintained a qualifying reason for FMLA leave, but it is unclear whether her requests for leave sought time off for any period following her February 12 shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Termination can also constitute interference when an employer discharges an employee while out on FMLA leave, thereby interfering with the employee's substantive right to reinstatement following FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Connor v. PCA Family Health Plan, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232576\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/1349/#p1353\">\n    200 F.3d 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1353-55 (11th Cir. 2000). Because the plaintiff was denied FMLA leave, it is not\n   clear that a right to reinstatement at the conclusion of such leave was ever triggered, and the plaintiff does not address the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Rather than seeking to fall within either of these common paradigms, the plaintiff proposes a new one. The plaintiff notes that her termination, according to Owes, was based on: her tardiness for her February 7 shift; her failure to show for her February 8 shift; her tardiness for her February 12 shift; and her insubordination during her February 12 shift, which stemmed from a disagreement over the plaintiff's requested FMLA leave. (Doc. 50 at 18-20). The Court agrees that the evidence probably would preclude the defendant from successfully raising as an affirmative defense that the discharge was wholly unrelated to FMLA leave, but the antecedent question is whether termination based on infractions occurring while the employee is working due to an improper denial of FMLA leave renders the termination an interference with the plaintiff's substantive rights under the FMLA. The position is not implausible, but the plaintiff offers no authority in support, and the Court declines to fill in the gaps on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Summary.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The defendant's only argument in support of its motion for summary judgment - that the plaintiff's failure to contact Human Resources disqualified her from receiving FMLA leave - fails for two reasons: (1) the FMLA and its implementing regulations do not permit an employer to deny FMLA leave based on FMLA-specific notice requirements of the employer that exceed the employer's notice requirements applicable to other forms of leave; and (2) even if heightened notice requirements unique to FMLA leave requests are enforceable, the defendant's violation of its own requirement that its managers direct employees requesting potentially FMLA-qualifying leave to contact Human Resources places on the defendant the blame for the plaintiff's failure to contact Human Resources, and these unusual circumstances justify the plaintiff's failure to comply with the defendant's FMLA-specific notice requirement. For both reasons, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Based on the law and uncontroverted facts: (1) the defendant is a covered entity; (2) the plaintiff is an eligible employee; (3) the plaintiff had a qualifying reason for taking FMLA leave; (4) the plaintiff gave timely and adequate notice to the appropriate representative of the defendant; and (5) the defendant thereafter denied the plaintiff her substantive right to FMLA leave by requiring her to work despite her request for leave. The plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to her interference claim is therefore due to be granted with respect to liability based on denial of FMLA leave. Because legal questions remain unanswered, the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment with respect to liability based on her termination is due to be denied. Because the plaintiff did not address damages or any other remedy, her motion for summary judgment with respect to relief is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 51 at 20-21). Because, as discussed in Parts I.D.1 and I.D.2, the plaintiff was not required to contact Human Resources in order to satisfy all applicable notice requirements, her failure to do so does not prevent her from establishing the first element of her prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As to the remaining elements of a prima facie case, termination is unquestionably an adverse employment action, and the close temporal proximity between the plaintiff's termination and her protected conduct - of which both Owes and Morrissette were aware - easily satisfies the causal element.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The defendant identifies its legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for terminating the plaintiff as follows: that, on February 12, the plaintiff refused to work her assigned schedule, called Owes a bitch, and told her to come get her store, (Doc. 51 at 21-22), conduct Owes described as insubordination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a legally permissible reason for termination, and the defendant has presented evidence both that the episode occurred and that Owes relied on it. The plaintiff, however, has ample evidence allowing a properly functioning jury to find that the defendant's articulated reason is a pretext for unlawful retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   First, the exceptionally close temporal proximity between the plaintiff's protected activity and her termination remains equally powerful evidence at the pretext stage of analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.

As the plaintiff states, she \"is her own best comparator.\" (Doc. 54 at 29). For Owes to suddenly treat the plaintiff's language as a terminable offense after tolerating it and engaging in it herself undermines the defendant's position that the plaintiff was discharged due to her choice of words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In a similar vein is Owes' inconsistent treatment of the plaintiff regarding tardiness and absences. Owes concedes that, prior to her final week of employment, the plaintiff had been late and had been a no call no show, yet Owes had never disciplined her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only during that final week, immediately after the plaintiff invoked her FMLA rights, did her absences and tardiness become a disciplinary issue, and a reasonable jury could conclude that this alteration was prompted by the plaintiff's protected conduct and that her termination was similarly motivated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The defendant does not now assert that the plaintiff's two episodes of lateness and one no call no show were reasons for her termination. This is a changed position, as Owes testified that the plaintiff was terminated for being late and for being a no call no show.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   So also the defendant in its interrogatory responses identified \"excessive absenteeism\" as a reason for the plaintiff's termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"We have recognized that an employer's failure to articulate clearly and consistently the reason for an employee's discharge may serve as evidence of pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Hurlbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31263\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/1286/#p1298\">\n    439 F.3d at 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Most damaging to the defendant is Owes' admission that she was frustrated and angry because the plaintiff's need for leave was forcing Owes to work extra shifts and longer hours. The plaintiff meanwhile remained unsatisfied, because she was still having to work some shifts, and this situation created the tension between the two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   A reasonable jury could conclude that Owes was simmering with resentment because of the plaintiff's efforts to obtain FMLA-protected leave and simply snapped on February 12, firing her based on those efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The plaintiff's version of the events of February 12 only strengthens the retaliatory inference. When the plaintiff showed up for her shift on February 12, she saw the schedule Owes had prepared for the next week, which had the plaintiff working overnight shifts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff called Owes and told her she could not work all those overnights because she had to tend to her mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the course of this conversation, the plaintiff told Owes to \"stop acting like a bitch,\" to which Owes responded, \"you're a bitch.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly after this conversation, the plaintiff texted Owes, \"I'm not about to work all these overnight [sic].\" Owes responded, \"Now you want to text me and you are not allowed to open anymore.\" Owes expressed resentment that the plaintiff \"just come in like I owe you\" and concluded, \"So see what [Morrissette]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   has to say about your schedule.\" The plaintiff replied, in three rapid-fire texts, \"OK, so what I'm not doing it\"; \"ok that find [sic]\"; and \"you can come and get your store I'll leave.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this exchange, a reasonable jury could find that the plaintiff expressed a desire not to work overnight shifts due to an FMLA-qualifying reason and that Owes, taking offense at the plaintiff's presumption, promptly fired her precisely because she - yet again - sought FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The foregoing is not an exhaustive catalogue of evidence that could support a jury determination of pretext, but it is more than sufficient to demonstrate that a reasonable jury could find the defendant's articulated non-retaliatory reason a pretext for unlawful retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The defendant ignores this evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom, instead insisting that \"[i]ntervening acts of misconduct ... can break the causal chain\" between protected activity and adverse employment action.

(Doc. 55 at 17). This obscure action, the significance of which Morrissette refused to share with the plaintiff, patently does not support the proposition that Morrissette \"instructed Plaintiff to contact April Thomas to request FMLA leave.\" (Doc. 58 at 2). Moreover, and as discussed in Part I.E, the defendant had already unlawfully interfered with the plaintiff's FMLA rights prior to Morrissette's text, which text could not unring that bell even had it accomplished what the defendant contends.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    The defendant also stresses that the number for Human Resources was one of many listed on the communication board in the store office. (Doc. 55 at 13-14; Doc. 52-2 at 14).
