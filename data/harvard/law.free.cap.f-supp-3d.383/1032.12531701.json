Plaintiff was hired by 7-Eleven's predecessor on July 10, 1978, as a Field Representative. Plaintiff left the company in 1984 but returned to 7-Eleven in Las Vegas in 1996 as a Field Consultant. In 1999, Plaintiff transferred to San Diego. Plaintiff was employed by 7-Eleven as a Field Consultant in San Diego from 1999 to March 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's duties as a Field Consultant involved overseeing a group of 7-Eleven stores across Southern California and Southern Nevada to assist franchisees with store operations, including displays and merchandising. The Field Consultant position required extensive walking, stooping, bending, reaching, and stretching. As a Field Consultant, Plaintiff was a salary Grade 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While merchandising in a franchisee's store in 2012, Plaintiff sustained a knee injury and suffered a meniscal tear. Plaintiff sustained additional injures in an on-the-job car accident in 2013 and suffered injuries to her shoulder, neck, back, and knees. As a result, Plaintiff took a medical leave of absence from 7-Eleven beginning in November 2013. Plaintiff ultimately underwent a right knee replacement surgery and a surgery on her left shoulder, in addition to other forms of treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 2, 2016, Michael Kelsey, a Leave of Absence Specialist who performed work for 7-Eleven, reached out to Plaintiff to discuss her work status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Dep. II, Ex. 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's doctors provided her with permanent work restrictions resulting from her work-related injuries. Kelsey requested Plaintiff submit a current copy of her resume so 7-Eleven could evaluate her qualifications for other\n   available positions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Dep. I, Ex. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2016, Plaintiff informed Kelsey that she was scheduled to undergo an additional surgery on her right knee and reiterated that her status is still \"permanent and stationary.\" Plaintiff Dep. I, Ex. 4. Plaintiff further noted that due to her work restrictions, she \"cannot return to the position of Field Consultant, and must have a position that fits those limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012940\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was released by her doctors to return to work with restrictions in August 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Dep.

Plaintiff again indicated that she was unable to return to the Field Consultant position, \"but can accept positions with limited walking and kneeling, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012940\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff informed Kelsey that she saw a posting on 7-Eleven's job posting website for a Senior Real Estate Representative (\"SRER\") position with the company and believed she could manage this position with her current limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012940\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff applied for a SRER position while on leave. Plaintiff interviewed with Jeffrey Tucker and Teresa Opsahl, but Tucker was the sole decision-maker for the SRER position. The SRER position was a Grade 24 position and would have been a promotion for Plaintiff. Tucker ultimately selected a woman named Bobbie King for the position at the end of January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff visited 7-Eleven's job posting website regularly and was unable to identify any positions, aside from the SRER position, that she was interested in and that she believed she was qualified for and could be transferred to in light of her work restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Dep. II at 245-46.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") in March 2017 claiming age, race, sex, and disability discrimination in connection with 7-Eleven's failure to hire her for the SRER position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Dep. I, Ex. 14. In September 2017, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights letter, and closed its file on the charge. Plaintiff Dep. I, Ex. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 9, 2018, Kelsey emailed Plaintiff and advised her that \"[c]urrently[ ] there is no available position at Grade 23 or lower in San Diego or Las Vegas that could be modified with a reasonable accommodation to physically require only light walking and allow the employee to primarily work from home.\" Plaintiff Dep. II, Ex. 33. 7-Eleven provided Plaintiff sixty (60) days to apply for and return to work for 7-Eleven.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012940\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff responded to Kelsey's email, and inquired as to whether 7-Eleven would only consider her for positions that are Grade 23 or lower.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012940\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Kelsey informed Plaintiff that she would be considered for \"any opportunity that she applied for.\" Kelsey Dep. at 40.

No. 32-4. Specifically, Defendant seeks to exclude: (1) an email dated March 4, 2018, from Plaintiff to Kelsey, attached to the declaration of Joshua Arnold (Doc. No. 28-2, hereinafter \"Arnold Decl.\") as Exhibit 24; (2) the declaration of Fe Demasco in its entirety, attached to the declaration of Joshua Arnold as Exhibit 28; and (3) several excerpts of Plaintiff's declaration, attached to the declaration of Joshua Arnold as Exhibit 29. The Court ordered supplemental briefing on the objections to give Plaintiff an opportunity to respond. Plaintiff filed a supplemental brief on May 9, 2019, and Defendant filed a responsive supplemental brief on May 13, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 35, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, with respect to the Kelsey email, Defendant argues that Plaintiff produced the email for the first time at Kelsey's deposition on February 28, 2019-after the February 8, 2019 discovery deadline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, Defendant seeks to exclude the email as untimely. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(c) provides in part that \"[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule\n   26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). The party facing sanctions bears the burden of demonstrating the late disclosure was substantially justified or is harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yeti by Molly, Ltd. v. Deckers Outdoor Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9501104\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/1101/#p1107\">\n    259 F.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1107 (9th Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, Defendant contends the failure to timely produce the email was not substantially justified or harmless, as Plaintiff's counsel was copied on the email.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arnold Decl., Ex. 24. The Court agrees. Plaintiff and her counsel have been in possession of the email since March 4, 2018, and Plaintiff provides no explanation as to why she did not produce the email with her initial disclosures, or why she did not supplement her initial disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a),(e). Rather, Plaintiff argues that \"as Plaintiff understands it, discovery was open\" and further asserts that Defendant also produced new documents after the discovery deadline. Doc. No. 35 at 2. Plaintiff's argument regarding the discovery deadline is unavailing, as Judge Dembin was clear in his order that the short extension was for the \"sole purpose\" of accommodating the remaining six depositions. Doc. No. 22 at 2. Moreover, the fact that Defendant may have also produced documents after the discovery deadline is irrelevant to the instant dispute and does not serve as a substantial justification for Plaintiff's delay.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Macias v. Perez\n   </em>\n   , No. 10cv973-MMA (BGS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202669475\">\n    2011 WL 2669475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D. Cal. July 7, 2011) (finding no substantial justification where the plaintiff submitted expert report after the applicable deadline because the expert was in trial and could not be reached before the discovery deadline). Nor has Plaintiff shown that the delay was harmless. As Defendant points out, the untimely disclosure \"deprived 7-Eleven of the opportunity to ask Plaintiff, or any of the other deposed witnesses, about the document.\" Doc. No. 36 at 2. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's objection to the March 4, 2018 email (Arnold Decl., Ex. 24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that Plaintiff never disclosed Demasco as a witness during discovery; thus, her declaration should be excluded as untimely pursuant to Rule 37.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 32-4 at 3, 5. As noted above, \"[i]f a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, Defendant argues Plaintiff's non-disclosure is not substantially justified or harmless. In opposition, Plaintiff asserts Demasco's declaration is admissible because Plaintiff identified someone named \"Faye\" at her deposition (Plaintiff Dep. I at 34, 103-104), and in her initial disclosures, after listing people Plaintiff knew to be relevant, Plaintiff disclosed \"other persons associated with Defendant\" (Doc. No. 35-1 (hereinafter \"Arnold Supp. Decl.\"), Ex. 1.). With respect to identifying someone named \"Faye\" at Plaintiff's deposition, Defendant points out that Plaintiff only identified her by her first name, and could not provide a last name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 32-4 at 3. \"[T]he identity of Ms. Demasco, as well as the nature and extent of her purported relevant knowledge, only became\n   known to 7-Eleven through her subject declaration.\" Doc. No. 36 at 4. \"The mere mention of a witness name in a deposition or document is generally not sufficient\" to put the other party on notice that the individual is being disclosed as a trial witness.\n   <em>\n    Classical Silk, Inc. v. Dolan Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-9224-AB (MRWx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207638112\">\n    2016 WL 7638112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2016). Additionally, Plaintiff's argument that simply listing \"other persons associated with Defendant\" in her initial disclosures is somehow sufficient to put Defendant on notice of Demasco's identity is unavailing. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate her non-disclosure was substantially justified or harmless. Plaintiff's failure to supplement her initial disclosures deprived Defendant of the opportunity to notice Demasco's deposition and explore the basis for the opinions set forth in her declaration. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's objection to Demasco's declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, Defendant objects to paragraphs 6, 8, and 9 of Plaintiff's declaration. Specifically, Defendant argues that: (1) a portion of paragraph 9 contradicts Plaintiff's deposition testimony and is subject to the sham affidavit rule; (2) a portion of paragraph 9 is unsupported by personal knowledge and thus lacks foundation; and (3) portions of paragraphs 6 and 8 are time-barred and irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Nor is it disputed that Plaintiff was subject to an adverse employment decision (i.e., non-selection for the SRER position). Thus, the remaining element of Plaintiff's prima facie case is whether Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   her disability. Plaintiff contends that the causation element of her disability discrimination claim is met because of a \"hiring freeze\" that occurred after she first applied for one of eleven available SRER positions. Doc. No. 28 at 15. Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that Tucker, a white male in his thirties, received multiple promotions, whereas Plaintiff \"spent her last 22 years getting great reviews and no promotions as a field consultant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p745\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiff claims that when she disclosed her disability during the interview, Tucker and Opsahl \"were turned off in a way that no other aspect of the interview turned them off.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Here, in reviewing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to set forth evidence\n   establishing a discriminatory motive. First, Plaintiff claims that after she applied for the SRER position, she was told the SRER positions \"will no longer be filled at all\" due to a hiring freeze. Doc. No. 28 at 15. Plaintiff claims that Senior Management Talent Acquisition Recruiter, Donovanh Fabia, does not recall any hiring freeze during 2016, and that he would have known if there had been such a hiring freeze.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Plaintiff asserts she \"is entitled to an inference that 7-Eleven did not want to place Plaintiff in a[ ] SRER position, despite her qualifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, at his deposition, Fabia testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Q. Do you recall there being a hiring freeze in 2016?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A. I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Q. As a recruiter would you expect to be aware of a hiring freeze for positions you're attempting to fill?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Q. Do you recall any hiring freeze during your employment with 7-Eleven?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   A. I do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Q. And when was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   A. I can't answer those dates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Q. And with that hiring freeze is it for a particular selected role or literally everybody throughout the company, the one you remember?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A It would be throughout the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q. You recall that [a hiring freeze] occurred, but you can't recall when; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Fabia Dep. at 94-95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiff's contention, Fabia does recall there being a hiring freeze during his five-year employment with 7-Eleven. That Fabia does not recall the specific dates of the hiring freeze does not support Plaintiff's argument that Fabia does not recall any hiring freeze. As such, Fabia's testimony does not support Plaintiff's argument. Additionally, Plaintiff points to no other evidence or legal authority to support her claim that she is entitled to an inference that 7-Eleven did not want to place her in a SRER position. In fact, Defendant posted an opening for a SRER position in 2017, after the hiring freeze, and Plaintiff interviewed for the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, Plaintiff's speculation regarding Tucker's various promotions is insufficient to show Plaintiff was discriminated against based on her disability. Plaintiff fails to submit any evidence establishing that she and Tucker are similarly situated employees. Specifically, Plaintiff submits no evidence regarding when Tucker received his various promotions, whether Plaintiff applied for any of the positions Tucker was selected for, and whether Plaintiff was even disabled at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, as noted above, Plaintiff mischaracterizes Tucker's deposition testimony. Tucker testified that Plaintiff \"was a good candidate but\n   <em>\n    she had answered a question\n   </em>\n   that somewhat turned both [he and Opsahl] off to the role.\" Tucker Dep. at 43 (emphasis added). When asked why she wanted the SRER position, Plaintiff replied that she \"was just looking for a job where she could still be a part of the company that didn't require, you know, all the issues that she was having physically, and that, you know, what enticed her about it was that she wanted to just sit in a car and count cars at intersections.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Tucker did not \"use[ ] common euphemisms for age and disability discrimination.\" Doc. No. 28 at 16. Rather, Plaintiff's counsel used those terms in questioning Tucker. Thus, in the absence of any evidence, Plaintiff's arguments are speculative and insufficient to demonstrate discriminatory motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, because Plaintiff offers no admissible evidence to support her claim that her disability was a determining factor\n   in her not receiving the promotion to an SRER position, Plaintiff's claim fails as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weil v.
