He seeks to have his indictment dismissed because the Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") in his underlying deportation did not specify an exact time and location at which to appear. Despite having attended the hearing in question, Porras-Avila claims that this omission voids not only his initial 2006 deportation, but all of his subsequent removals. Consequently, he claims this flaw in his underlying immigration proceedings deals a fatal blow to the Government's current attempts to prosecute him for illegal reentry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Porras-Avila, a citizen of Mexico, apparently entered the United States at least by 1999 as he was convicted of a misdemeanor Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and sentenced to 30 days in custody in Hidalgo County, Texas in June of that year.\n   <em>\n    State of Texas v. Juan Angel Porras\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-164783-B, County Court of Law No. Two, Hidalgo County, Texas. He was again convicted of a DWI in 2002 and sentenced to 180 days in custody under the name of David Guerrero, Jr.\n   <em>\n    State of Texas v. David Guerrero, Jr.\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-203939-A, County Court of Law No. One, Hidalgo County, Texas. After this second DWI he was arrested for a third DWI in 2005. This conviction was a felony. He was sentenced to two years in custody.\n   <em>\n    State of Texas v. Juan Angel Avila Porras\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-0087-06-F, 398th Judicial District Court, Hidalgo County, Texas. After being released, he was formally deported through the Brownsville Port of Entry. It was this deportation that is the basis for the Motion to Dismiss, and it will be discussed in more detail below. He was deported on November 2, 2006 and returned illegally on November 10, 2006. He was then arrested on a fourth DWI charge in 2008. Sometime after that fourth DWI arrest, but before those charges were resolved, he was charged with illegal reentry and given 75 days in custody.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Juan Angel Porras-Avila\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:08-po-01790 (S.D. Tex. 2008). He was then deported on June 3, 2008 through the Presidio Port of Entry. He returned illegally on October 29, 2008, was again convicted of illegal reentry, and was sentenced to 100 days in custody.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Juan Angel Porras-Avila\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:08-po-06766 (S.D. Tex. 2008). He was deported on February 14, 2009 through the Hidalgo Port of Entry. He then returned to the United States, but the time and place of that return is not clear from the record. Nevertheless, it is clear that on April 30, 2013 he was actually convicted of the 2008 DWI, his second felony DWI, and was sentenced to two years in custody.\n   <em>\n    State of Texas v. Juan Angela Avila Porras\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-3575-08-F, 332nd Judicial District Court, Hidalgo County, Texas. This led to his return to immigration custody and another deportation in August of 2014 through the Laredo Port of Entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record before this Court does not show how or when he returned to the United States after the 2014 deportation. Nevertheless, in 2017 he was once again in the United States and once again was convicted of a DWI-his third felony DWI-and was sentenced on January 31, 2017 to five years imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    State of Texas v. Juan Angel Avila Porras\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-0207-17-F, 332nd District Court, Hidalgo County, Texas. It is this arrest and imprisonment that concluded with his being turned over to federal authorities for prosecution in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Basis for the Dismissal Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As stated earlier, Porras-Avila's 2006 deportation is the subject matter of this motion. Porras-Avila was in the custody of immigration officials in 2006. It is unclear if he came into custody by virtue of his 2005 arrest for DWI or by some other means. Regardless, on August 23, 2006 he was served with his NTA. Importantly, that notice had the following as to the date and time of the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The NTA was personally served on the Defendant on October 9, 2006. He waived his 10-day notice period and requested a prompt hearing. He attended the hearing and, based upon his own admissions, he was found to be removable. He voluntarily waived his appeal and was ultimately deported on November 2, 2006 based upon the order of the immigration judge. He was subsequently deported on March 20, 2008; October, 29, 2008; February 5, 2009; and August 5, 2014-all based upon a reinstatement of this 2006 deportation order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Porras-Avila claims that all his deportations (except for the original one) relate back to or are reinstatements of his 2006 removal and that his original 2006 deportation order was defective due to the lack of a designated date and time on the NTA. He claims that because of this defective notice, the immigration court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and thus his 2006 deportation and all subsequent deportations were invalid and void. Consequently, he argues that there is no valid removal on which to base an illegal reentry indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The United States (\"Government\") argues that these claims distort the two Supreme Court cases upon which the Defendant relies and that not only was Porras-Avila eventually informed of the date, time, and location of his hearing, but it is beyond dispute that he attended and participated. As a result, the Government contends that whatever ambiguities or defects may have existed in the original notice were cured by subsequent actual notice and that the immigration judge had jurisdiction when Defendant was ordered deported. Further, the Government argues that the motion to dismiss the indictment is an impermissible collateral attack on the order of removal and as such is contrary to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both sides cite multiple court decisions which support their respective positions. Consequently, this Court has a number of different opinions from which to seek guidance. (See Appendix \"A\" for a list of opinions which support the position of the Defendant and Appendix \"B\" for a list of opinions supporting the Government's position.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court reviewed a Notice to Appear containing \"notice\" provisions similar to those cited in the instant case but in a civil context. The exact question the Court answered was framed by Justice Sotomayor, the author of the majority opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Accordingly, the dispositive question in this case is much narrower, but no less vital: Does a \"notice to appear\" that does not specify the \"time and place at which the proceedings will be held,\" as requested by \u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)(i), trigger the stop-time rule?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thus, the basic issue was whether \"... if the Government serves a noncitizen with a document that is labeled 'notice to appear,' but the document fails to specify either the time or the place of the removal proceedings, does it trigger the stop-time rule [found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) and which stops the time for which an alien might qualify for cancellation of removal].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2110. It is important to note that Pereira never received any notice of the time and place of the hearing and as a consequence did not attend the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Supreme Court held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ... common sense compels the conclusion that a notice that does not specify when and where to appear for a removal proceeding is not a \"notice to appear\" that triggers the stop-time rule.\n   <em>\n    If the three words \"notice to appear\" mean anything in this context, they must mean that, at a minimum, the Government has to provide noncitizens \"notice\" of the information, i.e., the \"time\" and \"place,\" that would enable them \"to appear\" at the removal hearing in the first place\n   </em>\n   . Conveying such time-and-place information to a noncitizen is an essential function of a notice to appear, for without it, the Government cannot reasonably expect the noncitizen to appear for his removal proceedings. To hold otherwise would empower the Government to trigger the stop-time rule merely by sending noncitizens a barebones document labeled \"Notice to Appear,\" with no mention of the time and place of the removal proceedings, even though such documents would do little if anything to facilitate appearance at those proceedings. \" 'We are not willing to impute to Congress ... such [a] contradictory and absurd purpose,' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ct. at 2115-2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The majority opinion emphasized that the Court was only answering the narrow question posed to it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   It therefore follows that, if a \"notice to appear\" for purposes of \u00a7 1229(b)(1) must include the time-and-place information, a \"notice to appear\" for purposes of the stop-time rule under \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) must as well.

The instant case obviously does not involve the stop-time rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   is a criminal case that discusses the very statute under which Porras-Avila is charged. In that case, the Supreme Court addressed whether a defendant\n   in a \u00a7 1326 case could collaterally attack his prior deportation. In that case it was conceded, for purposes of the appeal, that the group of deportees, including the Respondent, were deported in proceedings that did not comport with due process requirements. Because the prior deportation is an element of a 1326 violation, the Court held that if the prior deportation involved a lack of due process, the Respondent could collaterally attack the current illegal reentry prosecution. Many courts throughout the nation have subsequently reached similar conclusions if there were underlying due process deprivations in the deportation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Application of These Supreme Court Decisions to the Instant Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant's attack on his pending indictment really involves two interrelated questions: 1) Can he collaterally attack his prior removals in this 1326 criminal case; and 2) Are his prior deportations void? The Court will take them in reverse order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Validity of The Prior Removals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant essentially claims that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that an NTA without the exact time and date of the deportation hearing renders the entire hearing process jurisdictionally fatal. He contends that if the notice was flawed, then the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction and any subsequent deportation is void and of no effect. Moreover, his argument further suggests that this notice, if initially defective, cannot later be remedied by actual notice. In support of his contentions Defendant cites an array of district court cases from throughout the country including many from this Circuit and this District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the reasoning in support of Defendant's position is fairly consistent between cases, this Court will address their reasoning generally through the discussion of one or two cases, as well as the applicable statutory and regulatory framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Initially,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which sets the requirements for the contents of a NTA, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In removal proceedings under section 1229(a) of this title, written notice shall be given in person to the alien ... specifying the following: ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (G)(i) the time and place at which the proceedings will be held.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Current immigration regulations provide that \"jurisdiction [in the immigration court] vests ... when a charging document is filed with the Immigration Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Some courts have concluded that if the initial Notice to Appear is lacking in any manner, it does not constitute a Notice to Appear. If it does not constitute a Notice to Appear, then those courts conclude the immigration judge did not have jurisdiction. Without jurisdiction the removal must be void. If the removal is void, the alien cannot subsequently be prosecuted for illegal reentry.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pedroza-Rocha\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:18-CR-1286,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206629649\">\n    2018 WL 6629649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.

These cases necessarily entail a broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   in that they explicitly hold that the Supreme Court found that no jurisdiction exists if a specific time and place is not included on the initial NTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This Court cannot agree with that basic proposition because the Supreme Court never made such a holding. In fact, it is\n   clear that the majority opinion was purposefully narrow. The word \"jurisdiction\" does not appear anywhere in the\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   majority opinion. To read that requirement into the majority's opinion either assumes that the majority of the Supreme Court did not understand the significance of that term or that they were purposefully trying to hide the opinion's real meaning from the rest of the federal judiciary. This Court will not presume either. If the Supreme Court had wanted to reach this result it could have easily held that the failure to include the time and place of a hearing in the NTA is jurisdictional. It did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Indeed, the Fifth Circuit has already noted that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is to be narrowly read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

The Supreme Court held that an NTA that lacks this information does not trigger the rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2113.\n   <em>\n    The Supreme Court did not discuss the issue of jurisdiction\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2107.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on two grounds. First, it addresses the \"narrow question\" of whether a defective NTA triggers the \"stop-time rule\" in determining relief under the immigration laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2109-10. Second, the appellant in that case never received notice of his hearing and never appeared for or participated in that hearing. Here, the \"stop-time rule\" is not at issue. Moreover, despite the statutory defect in his initial NTA, Defendant appeared for his hearing on October 19, 2000, and at the hearing had an opportunity to be heard. Defendant was then personally served with a Notice of Hearing indicating the date, time, and place for his second and\n   third hearings, where he also appeared and had an opportunity to be heard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In short, given that Defendant appeared for his initial removal hearing on October 19, 2000, along with two subsequent hearings, any statutory defect in the initial NTA was cured.

One cannot draw a hint from this regulation that the lack of a time and date on the initial notice is jurisdictional or fatally defective to subject matter jurisdiction or that actual or subsequent notice cannot cure information the initial NTA lacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Obviously, a complete lack of notice, as occurred in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , would trigger due process concerns. Due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard. Porras-Avila was afforded both.

Second, he argues that if the immigration court that ordered his removal did not have jurisdiction, then his\n   deportations were void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   and cannot be the basis for prosecution for illegal entry.

App'x [253] at 254 [ (5th Cir. 2014) ]. Because the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Castelan-Jaimes\n   </em>\n   had not challenged the BIA's non-authorized issuance of his removal order on direct appeal [as opposed to an order of an Immigration Judge], both the district court and the Fifth Circuit held that the defendant had not satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 1326(d) and his\n   indictment should not be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, prior to\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the immigration judge certainly had an \"arguable basis\" for believing she had jurisdiction over Defendant's removal proceedings, and there was no \"clear usurpation of power\" in issuing the underlying Removal Order.\n   <em>\n    Thus, the legislative history and plain language of \u00a7 1326 and relevant Fifth Circuit demonstrate that Defendant is not automatically permitted to collaterally attack his Removal Order for want of jurisdiction.

Tex. 2018) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This Court agrees. In the instant case Defendant cannot prevail on any of the prongs of \u00a7 1326(d), despite the requirement that he must prevail on all three. The Defendant's sole argument in the instant case is that the immigration judge did not have jurisdiction because of the lack of specificity in the initial NTA. Defendant was subsequently given adequate notice. He appeared and participated. He also had more than adequate opportunities for judicial reviews which he rejected. He both knowingly waived his appellate rights and did not pursue either administrative or judicial remedies. He even admitted the allegations supporting his removal. Consequently, there was nothing fundamentally unfair about Porras-Avila's deportations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This Court denies the Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 11) the indictment. Neither the legislation passed by Congress nor the dictates of the Supreme Court suggest that the Immigration Judge in question lacked jurisdiction. The Defendant had actual notice, appeared and participated in his hearing, and admitted his removability. At most,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   suggests that the removals in some circumstances might be voidable if the NTA lacked times and locations and if, as in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the immigrant did not get notice and could not appear. These defenses might be the basis of a conclusion that the removals were voidable, but they do not render the proceedings in question here void. This Court holds that the lack of specificity in the NTA in question does not render the proceedings to be void\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   due to lack of jurisdiction. Even if the lack of a time and date rendered the notice deficient, such that it was open to challenge, these deficiencies were cured by actual notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This Court further holds that Porras-Avila cannot collaterally attack his removal as he has not met the requirements of \u00a7 1326(d). He has not even tried to show that he exhausted his administrative remedies or that he was deprived of his judicial appellate rights. Aside from his theoretical jurisdiction argument, the Defendant has not tried to demonstrate that any aspect of the removal proceedings or the subsequent entry of the removal order was fundamentally\n   unfair. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss the indictment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    Appendix A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Cases Supporting the Dismissal of the Indictment\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.
