Fallon, U.S. District Court Judge\n     Before the Court are two motions to dismiss without prejudice filed by Plaintiffs\n     Herman LeBlanc, R. Doc. 569, and Donnie Beasley, R. Doc. 572. The motions are opposed. R. Doc. 579. Plaintiffs have filed a reply. R. Doc. 590. Having heard oral argument on the motions on April 3, 2019, R. Doc. 594, considered the applicable law, and the arguments of the parties, the Court is now ready to rule.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-25\">\n     <strong>\n      I. BACKGROUND\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-26\">\n     Plaintiffs in the instant\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     action were allegedly exposed to naturally occurring radioactive material (\"NORM\") associated with the cleaning of used oilfield pipe at pipe yards in Harvey, Louisiana, including the \"Grefer Tract,\" nearby tracts of land, and tracts of land in other locations in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma. These Plaintiffs are individuals residing in several states who either worked at, or lived near, these facilities. The\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs, a number of whom allege to have contracted cancer from NORM, seek damages for personal injury, medical monitoring, property damage, and punitive damages.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-27\">\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     has a lengthy procedural history. In 2002, over 600 Plaintiffs filed a single petition (the \"\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     petition\") seeking damages in Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana. Since 2002, the state court proceedings have disposed of various Plaintiffs' claims through \"trial flights,\" settlements, or other dismissals, such that just over 500 Plaintiffs now remain. The state court has systemically grouped up to twelve Plaintiffs' like-claims together for trial flights. According to Plaintiffs, none of the completed trial flights have had preclusive effect on subsequent trial flights.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-28\">\n     One of the Plaintiffs included in the\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     petition was Cornelius Bottley, who died from esophageal cancer in 2012. On July 16, 2014, three members of his surviving family filed a separate\n     <em>\n      Bottley\n     </em>\n     action, also in Civil District Court in Orleans Parish. On July 31, 2014, with an upcoming trial flight, these\n     <em>\n      Bottley\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs moved the state court to transfer and consolidate their case with the\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     state action. Based on this motion for consolidation,\n     <em>\n      Bottley\n     </em>\n     Defendant Exxon Mobil Oil removed both\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Bottley\n     </em>\n     to this Court under the Class Action Fairness Act (\"CAFA\"). Plaintiffs moved to remand the cases to state court. This Court, however, denied remand on October 23, 2014, and consolidated\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     and\n     <em>\n      Bottley.\n     </em>\n     R. Docs. 45, 46. The Court explained that Plaintiffs' motion to consolidate in state court constituted a \"proposal for joint trial,\" particularly where over 500 plaintiffs remained at the time the motion to consolidate was filed. Thus, CAFA bestowed federal \"mass action\" jurisdiction. Plaintiffs appealed this decision, and in June 2018, the Fifth Circuit upheld this Court's denial of the motion to remand. R. Doc. 383. Subsequently, on January 31, 2019, Shell moved for summary judgment; however, after finding there were still significant issues of material fact regarding Shell's contribution to Plaintiffs' injuries, the Court denied Shell's motion. R. Doc. 566.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-29\">\n     The instant motions relate to two\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     Plaintiffs-Donnie Beasley and Herman LeBlanc. These Plaintiffs' claims have been pending in this action since 2005. R. Doc. 569-1 at 1; R. Doc. 572-3 at 1. On December 19, 2016, Beasley was diagnosed with a bone tumor on his spine, which was subsequently determined to be multiple myeloma. R. Doc. 572-3 at 2. On July 30, 2018, LeBlanc was diagnosed with bladder cancer. R. Doc. 569-1 at 2. Rather than amending their claims in the instant matter to include additional defendants, Beasley and LeBlanc filed separate suits in\n     Louisiana State Court.\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n     R. Doc. 572-3 at 1. Of the nine defendants in the state court action, seven are also defendants before this Court in\n     <em>\n      Lester.\n     </em>\n     <footnotemark>\n      2\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-30\">\n     <strong>\n      II. PENDING MOTION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-31\">\n     Both Beasley and LeBlanc filed motions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) seeking dismissal of their claims before this Court without prejudice. R. Doc. 569-1 at 1; R Doc. 572-3 at 1. In their motions, Plaintiffs assert they filed their claims in state court to avoid naming additional defendants in the\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     mass action. R. Doc. 569-1 at 1; R Doc. 572-3 at 1. Next, Plaintiffs contend Defendants will not suffer any legal prejudice if the claims currently before this Court are dismissed.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     Finally, Plaintiffs argue the state forum offers them an opportunity to have their cases tried more quickly in light of the recent developments in their cancers, which they contend could become more severe \"quickly[,] without warning.\" R. Doc. 569-1 at 5; R Doc. 572-3 at 5.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-32\">\n     In opposition, Defendants argue they will suffer legal prejudice should the Court dismiss Plaintiffs and their claims without prejudice. R. Doc. 579 at 4. In support of their argument, Defendants point to two factors the Fifth Circuit has identified as constituting legal prejudice that Defendants contend are present in this case. R. Doc. 579 at 4. First, Defendants argue Plaintiffs' motions to dismiss are a way to escape an adverse ruling from this Court and circumvent to an expected adverse result in state court. R. Doc. 579 at 4-5. Specifically, Defendants submit Plaintiffs merely seek to avoid this Court's denial of the motion to remand\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     , which has been affirmed by the Fifth Circuit. R. Doc. 579 at 4; R. Doc. 383. With respect to their pending claims in state court, Defendants argue Plaintiffs' motions for voluntary dismissal are a means to circumvent a potentially adverse ruling in the state court proceeding-namely, a stay of their state court cases under the exception of\n     <em>\n      lis pendens.\n     </em>\n     R. Doc. 579 at 6. Second, Defendants contend the far stage at which this litigation has reached cautions against dismissal. Defendants assert they have expended substantial amounts of time, money, and effort litigating this case over sixteen years, five of which have been before this Court following removal. R. Doc. 579 at 7. Defendants also argue judicial efficacy supports denial of Plaintiffs' motions. R. Doc. 579 at 8.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-33\">\n     In their reply, Plaintiffs contend Defendants' claim that they will be prejudiced by a dismissal without prejudice is \"legally insignificant.\" R. Doc. 590 at 1. Because granting the motion would not prejudice Defendants as to \"some legal interest, some legal claim, some legal argument,\" such as \"the loss of an affirmative defense ... [or a] statute of limitations [defense],\" Plaintiffs argue Defendants will not suffer any legal prejudice.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 1-2. Plaintiffs further contend that the discovery undergone so far in the\n     <em>\n      Lester\n     </em>\n     action would be applicable to the case whether Plaintiffs' claims proceed in this Court or in state court.\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 2. Thus, Plaintiffs argue, \"There will be no additional expense, work or other prejudice if LeBlanc and Beasley are permitted to proceed in state court.\"\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at 3.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-34\">\n     <strong>\n      III. LEGAL STANDARD\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) provides that, in certain circumstances, an action may be voluntarily dismissed without prejudice \"at the plaintiff's request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 41(a)(2). In general, motions for voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2) should be freely granted \"unless the defendant will suffer some plain legal prejudice other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit.\"\n     <em>\n      Manshack v. Sw. Elec.

The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that a dismissal without prejudice would have legally prejudiced the defendant, as the statute of limitations had not expired in Texas or Mississippi, where the plaintiff intended to refile.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1816515\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/874/984/#p987\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1816515\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/874/984/#p987\">\n      at 987\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .

There, the defendant argued the plaintiff sought dismissal solely to avoid the district court's adverse choice-of-law ruling. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal on appeal, distinguishing its holding in\n     <em>\n      Phillips\n     </em>\n     . As the Fifth Circuit explained, regardless of the venue, the defendant would be \"governed by exactly the same choice of law principles in Texas federal or state court,\" and therefore, unlike the defendant in\n     <em>\n      Phillips\n     </em>\n     , the defendant in\n     <em>\n      Manshack\n     </em>\n     would \"not be stripped of an absolute defense.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531694\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/915/172/#p174\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531694\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/915/172/#p174\">\n      at 175\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-42\">\n     In this case, the adverse ruling Defendants point to is this Court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion to remand. The Court notes at the outset that forum shopping is an insufficient basis upon which to establish legal prejudice.\n     <em>\n      Brown v. Schlumberger Tech.

The issue before this Court is more akin to the issue presented in\n     <em>\n      Manshack\n     </em>\n     than the issue before the Fifth Circuit in\n     <em>\n      Phillips\n     </em>\n     . As was the case in\n     <em>\n      Manshack\n     </em>\n     , here Plaintiffs' claims will be governed by the same law whether they proceed in state court or in this court.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Klaxon Co. v.

Moreover, even assuming Plaintiffs are attempting to avoid this Court's denial of their motion to remand, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of the plaintiffs' motion to dismiss without prejudice in\n     <em>\n      Manshack\n     </em>\n     , despite the district court's having previously denied the plaintiffs' motion to remand. Thus, the Court will not deny Plaintiffs' motion on this basis.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-43\">\n     With respect to Defendants' losing the availability of their\n     <em>\n      lis pendens\n     </em>\n     exception in state court, this defense is not absolute, such as an exception based on the statute of limitations; rather, the exception of\n     <em>\n      lis pendens\n     </em>\n     simply forces the case to proceed in the court in which the case was first filed. Again, the same law would apply to Plaintiffs' claims regardless of whether the case proceeds in state or federal court. Because granting Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss would not \"allow [P]laintiff[s] to select a different body of law unfavorable to [D]efendant[s'] position,\" the Court will not deny Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss on this basis.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Manshack\n     </em>\n     , 915 F.2d at 175.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-44\">\n     <strong>\n      b. Timing, Cost, and Other Considerations\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-45\">\n     Finally, Defendants argue they will suffer legal prejudice from the dismissal of these two Plaintiffs, as (1) this case has been pending before this Court since August 2014, (2) the parties have undergone extensive motions practice, and (3) allowing both this CAFA mass action and the\n     two prospective individual actions to proceed simultaneously will force Defendants to litigate substantially similar claims in multiple venues.

Moreover, unlike the posture of the case in\n     <em>\n      Stephens\n     </em>\n     , which had only been pending for a short time, this case has been pending before this Court since August 2014.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     R.

While the Court does not find Plaintiffs filed their motion to dismiss to avoid these rulings, the Court does find the parties have invested substantial time and effort in litigating this case and therefore will suffer legal prejudice should the Court grant Plaintiffs' motions to dismiss.
