Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is Jeffrey Azzato and St. Marys Insurance Agency's (\"St. Marys\") Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 91). The Motion has been fully briefed (ECF Nos. 93, 94, 97, 98, 101, 102, 103) and is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After numerous back surgeries and a difficult recovery, Plaintiff Ronald P. Boyles, Jr. contacted Mr. Azzato, the president of Mr. Boyles's employer, St. Marys. Mr. Boyles told Mr. Azzato that he was considering applying for disability benefits. Mr. Azzato instead offered to pay Mr. Boyles's full salary while he recovered and Mr. Boyles thus did not pursue disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Months later, St. Marys changed disability insurers. Because of his continued receipt of his full salary and the change in disability policies, when Mr. Boyles ultimately stopped working due to his health problems, both the old and new disability insurers denied his claim for disability benefits. Mr. Boyles filed the present suit against the insurers, St. Marys, and Mr. Azzato pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for the denial of disability benefits and for St. Marys and Mr. Azzato's alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   St. Marys and Mr. Azzato (collectively, \"Defendants\") now seek summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claims and a\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   claim against St. Marys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Defendants' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as Mr. Boyles's claims arise under federal law.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Boyles filed his First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 26) against American Heritage Life Insurance Company (\"Allstate\"), Mr. Azzato, St. Marys, and Unum Life Insurance Group (\"Unum\") on November 24, 2015. Mr. Boyles brought twelve counts, many of which were resolved by this Court's Opinions and Orders on Defendants' Motions to Dismiss and Allstate and Unum's Motions for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 81, 82.) After these two Opinions, only Mr. Azzato and\n   St. Marys remain as Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 82 at 16.) Only three counts remain: (1) Count VIII: ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) - Breach of Fiduciary Duty against Mr. Azzato, (2) Count XI:\n   <em>\n    Respondeat Superior\n   </em>\n   against St. Marys, and (3) Count XII: ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) - Breach of Fiduciary Duty against St. Marys. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 81, 82;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 93 at 10; ECF No. 97 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 4, 2019, Mr. Azzato and St. Marys filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 91), accompanied by their Brief in Support (ECF No. 93), Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 94), and an Appendix containing numerous Exhibits (ECF No. 91-3). Mr. Boyles filed his Memorandum in Opposition (ECF No. 97) and Exhibits in Support thereof (ECF No. 98) on February 15, 2019. Mr. Azzato and St. Marys then filed their Reply Brief (ECF No. 101), Supplemental Concise Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 102), and Appendix with Exhibits (ECF No. 103) on March 4, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   St. Marys is an independent insurance agency with its principal office in St. Marys,\n   Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 97 at 1.) Mr. Azzato is the president and co-owner of St. Marys. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 97 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October 2006, St. Marys acquired Boyles Insurance Agency. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 3.) Mr. Boyles, who was an employee of Boyles Insurance Agency, became an employee of St. Marys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; ECF No. 97 at 2.) He worked primarily out of St. Marys's Boyles Insurance Agency office in State College, Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 97 at 2.) Mr. Boyles's last day of work for St. Marys for which he was paid full salary was November 22, 2013, although he continued to receive paid vacation benefits through December 31, 2013. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 9; ECF No. 97 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Boyles's job duties with St. Marys consisted of selling insurance, soliciting clients and following up on leads, maintaining and servicing his existing book of business, writing new policies or obtaining new coverage for existing clients, handling claims by clients, spending \"face time\" with clients at least once per year or on some other regular basis, fielding calls, e-mails, and text messages around the clock, and traveling to meet and/or solicit clients and to attend seminars. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 10.) His schedule was more flexible than other employees in St. Marys's State College office and he was able to conduct business remotely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. St. Marys's Disability Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   St. Marys sponsored an employee benefits plan for its employees, including Mr. Boyles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27; ECF No. 97 at 2.) This plan included group short-term (\"STD\") and long-term (\"LTD\") disability insurance. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 27; ECF No. 97 at 2.) St. Marys was not the plan administrator for the STD or LTD policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 191.) Instead, Allstate and Unum, who insured the plans, were the plan administrators with the discretion to determine eligibility for benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 82 at 5.) Thus, with respect to STD and LTD benefits under both the Allstate and Unum policies, neither St. Marys nor Mr. Azzato had the discretion to (1) decide whether a group member was paid disability benefits; (2) determine whether an employee was eligible for benefits; (3) determine the level or amount of benefits an employee would or could receive under the policies; (4) determine whether an applicant/employee met the definition of \"disability\" under the policies; (5) pay benefits if granted; and (6) determine the length of time an individual would receive STD or LTD benefits. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Allstate Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Allstate insured St. Marys's disability plan from January 1, 2010 through July 31, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; ECF No. 97 at 2.) The Allstate plan provided that full-time, active employees working 30 or more hours per week were eligible for coverage. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 30.) To receive STD benefits, an employee had to be continuously disabled for the elimination period of 30 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34; ECF No. 97 at 2-3.) The monthly benefit for a qualifying employee was 60% of monthly earnings up to a maximum benefit of $ 2,500 for no more than six\n   months. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 34; ECF No. 97 at 2-3.) To receive LTD benefits, the employee had to be continuously disabled for the elimination period of 180 days. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 135; ECF No. 97 at 3.) The monthly benefit was 60% of monthly earnings up to a maximum benefit of $ 6,000 per month payable to age 65. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 135; ECF No. 97 at 3.) If the employee continued to receive more than 80% of his monthly earnings, regardless of whether he was totally or partially disabled or working full- or part-time, he did not satisfy the definition of \"disability\" and no benefits were payable. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38; ECF No. 97 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Switch from Allstate to Unum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   St. Marys had the authority to cancel the Allstate policy (ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 31, 123, 139), which it did effective July 31, 2013 when it switched group disability coverage to a policy issued by Unum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 32, 122; ECF No. 97 at 2, 4.) St. Marys originally sought a quote from Unum for STD and LTD policies in mid-June 2013. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 40, 128; ECF No. 97 at 4.) Around that time, St. Marys had established a business relationship with Unum and had begun to write for Unum. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 31.) To further its relationship with Unum, St. Marys switched its disability coverage to Unum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 129-30.) During this switch, Mr. Azzato did not contemplate that Mr. Boyles may file for disability at some point. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Before the change from Allstate to Unum took effect, a St. Marys employee told Mr. Boyles that St. Marys \"currently did just switch to Unum,\" although Mr. Boyles thought the change would not occur until the policy renewal date and there is a dispute as to whether Mr. Boyles knew the employee was referring to St. Marys's disability policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-48.) Mr. Boyles\n   did not ask Mr. Azzato any questions regarding the switch from Allstate to Unum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 147, 149, 155.) Further, Mr. Boyles did not request information from Mr. Azzato or St. Marys regarding St. Marys's disability coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 150-53.) And Mr. Azzato never failed or refused to provide information in response to a request from Mr. Boyles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Unum Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under the Unum policy, full-time employees in active employment with St. Marys had STD and LTD coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44; ECF No. 97 at 3.) In order to be considered in active employment, employees had to be working at least 37.5 hours per week. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 45; ECF No. 97 at 3.) STD benefits under the Unum policy were 60% of weekly earnings to a maximum benefit of $ 625 per week for a maximum of 26 weeks. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 47; ECF No. 97 at 3.) LTD benefits were 60% of monthly earnings to a maximum of $ 6,000 per month. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 47; ECF No. 97 at 3.) The Unum policy differed from the Allstate policy because Unum's LTD policy provided a monthly benefit payable for five years whereas Allstate provided a maximum of $ 6,000 a month payable to age 65. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 135.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mr. Boyles's Back Problems and Surgeries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mr. Boyles had a history of back problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50; ECF No. 97 at 3.) From late 2011 through September 2012, Mr. Boyles had four surgical procedures related to the implant of a spinal stimulator. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 51; ECF No. 97 at 3.) Each of the first three surgeries interfered with Mr. Boyles's ability to work to some degree, although he was able to continue providing service to his clients and responding to emails while he recovered. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 53.) During his recovery from these surgeries, he continued to work and St. Marys continued to pay his full salary and commissions, even when he worked a reduced schedule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In September 2012, Mr. Boyles had his fourth surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58; ECF No. 97 at 3.) Prior to this surgery, Mr. Azzato and Mr. Boyles had a discussion to the effect that Mr. Boyles did not anticipate being off work too long. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 60; ECF No. 97 at 3.) Mr. Azzato indicated that St. Marys would continue to pay Mr. Boyles his full salary during his recovery. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 60; ECF No. 97 at 3.) At that time, Mr. Boyles did not mention a disability claim. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After the fourth surgery, Mr. Boyles told Mr. Azzato that his recovery was not going as well as hoped and that he might be off work four to six weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65; ECF No. 97 at 3.) Mr. Azzato told Mr. Boyles that St. Marys would continue to pay his full salary. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 65; ECF No. 97 at 4.) Again, Mr. Boyles did not mention a disability claim during this conversation. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 66.) Both Mr. Azzato and Mr. Boyles expected Mr. Boyles to eventually recover and come back to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Boyles's first inclination to apply for disability benefits was in December 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Mr. Boyles obtained an Allstate disability claim form and submitted the portion of the form for which he was responsible to Allstate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.) However, Mr. Boyles did not follow through with the rest of the Allstate claim form\n   following a conversation with Mr. Azzato.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 83; ECF No. 97 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Boyles recounted his conversation with Mr. Azzato as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q: Now, at some point after the St. Luke's surgery, did you begin to start thinking, \"Maybe I should go on disability\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q: Alright. Tell me when that occurred, why you were thinking that, who you discussed it with, tell me about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A: Well, it just got to point where just, you know, at what point do you try to keep working, you know. You know, I have had surgery after surgery, you know, it is interfering with my work now, I am on a bunch of medications trying to survive, literally. I gave up. I wanted to keep working forever, you know, like anybody, but it just comes a point where you realize that it's a losing battle. It's just not worth it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   I knew I had the disability insurance, everybody is telling me to stop, so I said, \"Okay. I'm going to stop.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   That was my first inclination of it, and it was December of 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q: Before Christmas of 2012?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q: And before-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A: Yes, it was in-year, in December of 2012, and I discussed it with [Mr. Azzato], and that's where it came that he would just keep paying me my full salary and, you know, I am going to get better, you know, he kind of cheered me up a little bit with it all. I was really pissed off and depressed and everything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q: You believed you were going to get better?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A: I wanted to, yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q: You believed you would?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A: At that point, it was-yeah, it was rough.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q: And [Mr. Azzato] was encouraging you, you thought-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A: He encouraged me to keep going, he said, \"You can keep going, you are going to get better, I believe you are going to get better,\" you know, so I went along with it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 76;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 97 at 4.) As a result of this conversation, Mr. Boyles decided he would continue to work and did not follow through with his disability claim, as St. Marys would continue to pay him his full salary. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 77; ECF No. 97 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   During this conversation, there was no discussion about the length of time St. Marys would continue to pay Mr. Boyles's full salary while he was recovering. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 78.) Furthermore, Mr. Boyles did not request and Mr. Azzato did not offer his opinion or recommendation as to whether Mr. Boyles should or should not pursue a disability claim with Allstate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Mr. Boyles also did not request and Mr. Azzato did not provide an explanation of Mr. Boyles's eligibility for STD or LTD benefits under the Allstate policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) In fact, at no time between Mr. Boyles's September 2012 surgery and the termination of the Allstate policy on July 31, 2013 did Mr. Boyles ask Mr. Azzato to explain his eligibility for coverage under St. Marys's STD or LTD policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) Mr. Azzato did not offer this information because, based on his past experience that Mr. Boyles returned to work within days or weeks of his surgeries, Mr. Azzato had not considered the possibility that Mr. Boyles would not recover. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) Mr. Boyles did not have another conversation\n   with Mr. Azzato concerning disability until October 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   From a financial perspective, Mr. Boyles admits that he was better off receiving his full salary of $ 9,166.66 per month than receiving the maximum monthly STD benefit of $ 2,500.00 under the Allstate group policy and that he was grateful to Mr. Azzato for continuing to pay his fully salary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86, 91-94.) Moreover, at the time he chose to continue receiving his full salary, Mr. Boyles did not believe that Mr. Azzato had any motive for offering to pay Mr. Boyles's full salary other than hoping Mr. Boyles would get better and continue to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Mr. Boyles's Workplace Accident and Workers' Compensation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In early January 2013, Mr. Boyles was working limited hours in the office while still considering a disability claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99; ECF No. 97 at 4.) On January 10, 2013, while working at his office, Mr. Boyles fell down stairs and sustained injuries. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 100.) He then submitted a medical-only workers' compensation claim and St. Marys continued to pay his full salary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103.) After a few days off, Mr. Boyles returned to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) He underwent shoulder surgery and physical therapy related to his fall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-09.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mr. Boyles knew that the Allstate group disability policy excluded coverage for disability related to workplace injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) He also knew from his experience working in the insurance industry that his fall at work and the injuries he sustained would impact his ability to receive disability benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Mr. Boyles thus planned to wait to file a disability claim until his workers' compensation claim was closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-21.) While his workers' compensation claim was pending, the Allstate policy terminated and the Unum policy became effective. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) Mr. Boyles never asked Mr. Azzato any questions about a potential switch in insurers or his eligibility for coverage under St. Marys's disability policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146-53.) Mr. Azzato had no reason to believe that Mr. Boyles continued to give any consideration to filing a claim for disability benefits, as Mr. Boyles never mentioned it or inquired after the December 2012 conversation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154; ECF No. 97 at 4.) Mr. Azzato believed Mr. Boyles was satisfied with his continued receipt of his salary and that he was working as much as he could. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 154; ECF No. 97 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Mr. Boyles's Work Activity from January 10, 2013 to November 22, 2013\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After his fall at work on January 10, 2013, Mr. Boyles returned to work within a few days, working to the same extent as he had been working after his fourth surgery in September 2012. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 160.) Between January 2013 and his last day of work in November 2013, Mr. Boyles was actively working and performing the material duties of his job, including writing new business, soliciting new business, communicating with clients and St. Marys employees, and meeting with clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 161-63, 165-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Then, in early- to mid-October 2013, Mr. Azzato informed Mr. Boyles that Mr. Boyles would have to decide whether he was going to continue to work full-time and receive his full salary or not. (ECF No. 102 \u00b6 194.) Mr. Azzato explained that St. Marys had been paying Mr. Boyles his full salary since the September 2012 surgery and that \"after 13 months [he] didn't think that [he] was getting [his] money's worth as far as paying [Mr. Boyles] the full time salary that [Mr. Boyles] was receiving.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195.) Mr. Azzato further explained that Mr. Boyles was not producing at a level needed to continue receiving\n   his full salary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 197, 198; ECF No. 97 at 4.) Mr. Azzato had also learned that others in the State College office were increasingly performing functions that Mr. Boyles normally would do. (ECF No. 102 \u00b6 197.) Mr. Boyles's last day working for St. Marys for which he was paid full salary was November 22, 2013. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 9; ECF No. 97 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Mr. Boyles's Disability Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mr. Boyles filed an initial disability claim with Allstate on December 19, 2013. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 168.) Allstate denied the claim, asserting that Mr. Boyles's condition resulted from the January 10, 2013 workplace accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) Mr. Boyles thereafter filed three appeals with Allstate, all of which were denied because at all times prior to the cancellation of the Allstate policy, Mr. Boyles continued to receive his full salary and thus did not meet the definition of \"disability\" under the policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169, 174-76, 178; ECF No. 97 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Mr. Boyles then submitted a disability claim to Unum in July 2014. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 180; ECF No. 97 at 5.) Unum ultimately denied the claim because Mr. Boyles was not in \"active employment\" on August 1, 2013, when the Unum policy went into effect. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 187; ECF No. 97 at 5.) Unum based this decision in part on Mr. Boyles's admission that after May 2013, he had not worked the requisite number of hours prior to the inception of coverage. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 187.) Mr. Boyles appealed, and Unum upheld its decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 188, 190; ECF No. 97 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Alternatively, Mr. Boyles argues that Defendants were acting as fiduciaries when Mr. Azzato gave Mr. Boyles the option of receiving his full salary while he recovered instead of filing for disability and when Mr. Azzato failed to tell Mr. Boyles about the change in disability plans from Allstate to Unum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants argue that Mr. Azzato was dealing with a routine personnel issue as opposed to the discretionary administration of a disability benefits plan when he spoke to Mr. Boyles in December 2012 about receiving his fully salary.

(ECF No. 94 \u00b6 48.) Further, Mr. Boyles has not pointed to facts that suggest such discretion.

Mr. Boyles's attempt to identify fiduciary obligations based solely on Mr. Azzato's\n   <em>\n    silence\n   </em>\n   about the August 1, 2013 switch of disability insurers therefore cannot be grounded in the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Varity\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Mr. Boyles makes no other arguments and cites to no case law supporting his position that Mr. Azzato and St. Marys had fiduciary obligations under ERISA with respect to their failure to tell Mr. Boyles about the switch in disability insurers.

It is undisputed that Defendants were not plan administrators and had no discretionary authority with respect to the management and administration of the disability plans. Furthermore, Mr. Azzato's business decision to pay Mr. Boyles his full salary while he recovered did not implicate fiduciary obligations, in spite of Mr. Boyles's mention of disability benefits. Finally, Mr. Azzato-as an individual and on behalf of St. Marys-did not implicate any fiduciary obligations by failing to notify Mr. Boyles of the change in disability insurers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Because there is no genuine dispute of material fact and Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law with regard to an essential element of Mr. Boyles's breach of fiduciary claims, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on these claims.

Mr. Boyles also states that any reasonable person in his position would have accepted the offer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) However, the fact that the offer was persuasive and purportedly caused an injury to Mr. Boyles does not suggest that the statement was a misrepresentation or that it was substantially likely to mislead an employee into making a harmful benefits decision. Instead, Mr. Boyles's injury-denial of benefits under both the Allstate and Unum disability policies-goes to the detrimental reliance element of his breach of fiduciary duty claims, not to whether Mr. Azzato's full-salary offer was a material misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Mr. Boyles also claims that Mr. Azzato breached fiduciary duties when he, knowing that Mr. Boyles had been considering filing for disability, failed to inform Mr. Boyles that St. Marys's disability insurer\n   would be changing effective August 1, 2013.

(ECF No. 93 at 21-22.) Defendants also argue that Mr. Boyles cannot establish that he would have been eligible for disability benefits had he applied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   However, there is at least some evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could find injury due to Mr. Azzato's actions. For example, a factfinder could conclude that Mr. Boyles had filled out his portion of the disability paperwork and did not complete the rest of the disability benefits application because he decided to continue working and receiving his full salary. (ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 83.) Construing the record in Mr. Boyles's favor, a reasonable factfinder could infer that Mr. Boyles would have applied for disability benefits in December 2012 but for Mr. Azzato's offer. Moreover, although there is significant evidence that Mr. Boyles declined to apply for disability in part due to his open workers' compensation claim (ECF No. 93 at 21-22), a factfinder could still find that Mr. Boyles would have completed his disability application prior to the January 2013 fall and workers' compensation issue. A factfinder could also determine that Mr. Boyles would have been eligible for disability under the Allstate policy had he applied, because there is at least some evidence that following his 2012 surgery, Mr. Boyles was working fewer hours, other St. Marys employees were performing tasks he had previously performed, and his work performance was generally impacted by his health problems. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 91-4 at 46; ECF No. 91-5 at 20-21; ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 53-55, 70-71, ECF No. 102 \u00b6\u00b6 197-98.) Thus, a factfinder could find that Mr. Boyles would have applied for\n   and received disability benefits in December 2012 but for Mr. Azzato's full-salary offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   A factfinder could also find at least some of this injury to be foreseeable based on the fact that Mr. Azzato knew of Mr. Boyles's continuing health problems and his past mention of disability. Mr. Boyles admitted the following: (1) after his first three surgeries, Mr. Boyles continued to work during his recovery (ECF No. 94 \u00b6\u00b6 53, 55); (2) before his fourth surgery, Mr. Boyles told Mr. Azzato that he did not anticipate being off work long and Mr. Boyles intended to return to work after the surgery just like he had returned to work after the previous surgeries (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60, 62); (3) after the fourth surgery, both Mr. Azzato and Mr. Boyles expected Mr. Boyles to eventually recover and come back to work (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-70); (4) at the time of Mr. Azzato's full-salary offer in December 2012, Mr. Azzato had not considered the possibility that Mr. Boyles would not recover, based on his past experience that Mr. Boyles returned to work within days or weeks of his surgeries (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82); (5) after Mr. Boyles's workplace accident, Mr. Azzato had no reason to believe that Mr. Boyles continued to give any consideration to filing a claim for disability benefits, as Mr. Boyles never mentioned it or inquired after the December 2012 conversation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154; ECF No. 97 at 4); and (6) Mr. Azzato believed Mr. Boyles was satisfied with his continued receipt of his salary and that he was working as much as he could (ECF No. 94 \u00b6 154; ECF No. 97 at 4). However, Mr. Boyles points to the fact that Mr. Azzato knew about his health problems and knew he had previously mentioned disability. Thus, at this stage, a reasonable factfinder could find that the denial of Mr. Boyles's disability claims was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the full-salary offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In sum, although the Court finds that genuine disputes preclude a determination on the element of detrimental reliance, the Court still concludes that summary judgment is appropriate based on the first three elements of the breach of fiduciary duty claims.

As stated in\n    <em>\n     Varity\n    </em>\n    , \"While it may be true that amending or terminating a plan ... is beyond the power of a plan administrator (or trustee)-and, therefore, cannot be an act of plan 'management' or 'administration,' it does not follow that making statements about the likely future of the plan is also beyond the scope of plan administration.\"\n    <em>\n     Varity\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324851\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/489/\">\n     516 U.S. at 505\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324851\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/489/\">\n     116 S.Ct. 1065\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, the Court refuses to conclude that Defendants were not fiduciaries just because the change of disability insurers itself did not implicate fiduciary obligations. However, the Court agrees that to the extent Mr. Boyles is arguing that the change in disability insurers implicated fiduciary duties, such an argument is meritless.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    And to the extent Angie Krise's email to Mr. Boyles could be a communication about the future of disability benefits that could be attributed to St. Marys, Mr. Boyles does not raise this argument and the Court will thus not consider it.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    The Court also disagrees that St. Marys's status as the plan sponsor implicates fiduciary obligations. \"[T]he plan sponsor, as long as it is not acting as an administrator,\" does not owe a fiduciary duty to plan participants.\n    <em>\n     Malia\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10512030\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/828/#p833\">\n     23 F.3d at 833\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Payonk\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527344\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/883/221/#p225\">\n     883 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    231 );\n    <em>\n     In re Fruehauf Trailer Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11248109\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/250/168/#p205\">\n     250 B.R. 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 205 (D.

Moreover, Mr. Boyles does not make this argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Furthermore, Mr. Boyles does not argue that Mr. Azzato made an actionable material omission by failing to tell Mr. Boyles during the December 2012 conversation that Mr. Boyles's receipt of his full salary would affect his eligibility for disability benefits under the Allstate policy. Thus, the Court will not consider this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
