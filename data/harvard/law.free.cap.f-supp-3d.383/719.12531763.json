This case raises that question. To decide whether ipDatatel, LLC infringed Alarm.com Incorporated's patents for home-security technology, the court must determine if the technology was patentable in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   ipDatatel denies infringement, arguing that the asserted claims cannot be patented under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and moves to dismiss Alarm.com's second amended complaint on that basis. Alarm.com responded, ipDatatel replied, the parties submitted supplemental briefing, and the court heard arguments of counsel. Based on the second amended complaint; the motion, response, reply, and supplemental briefing; the record; counsels' arguments; and the applicable law, the court denies the motion to dismiss. (Docket Entry No. 118). The parties must jointly submit a proposed amended scheduling and docket control order by\n   <strong>\n    June 28, 2019\n   </strong>\n   , setting out reasonable, efficient, fair, and cost-effective steps for discovery, dispositive motions, and trial, with deadlines for each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The reasons for this ruling are explained in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Alarm.com was incorporated in Delaware in 2000 and introduced its first wireless home-security system in 2003. (Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 15). Alarm.com's technology integrates a home-alarm system with different \"smart\" devices, connecting such devices as a tablet computer or a smartphone, into the system, controlled by an application, or \"app,\" that uses an online platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Alarm.com operates in North and South America and Australia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). Its wholly owned subsidiary and coplaintiff ICN Acquisition, LLC owns many of the patents-in-suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ipDatatel was incorporated in Texas in 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). It too manufactures home-security systems and operates data centers for smart-device applications, offering systems with \"interactive security capabilities\" similar to Alarm.com's home-security systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20). ipDatatel markets its products throughout the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The complaint alleges that the companies compete in the \"home security or home automation market,\" and that the \"patents-in-suit... give Alarm.com a competitive edge.\" (Docket Entry No. 102 at 9:14-15). Alarm.com alleges that ipDatatel infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,113,090 ; 7,633,385 ; 7,956,736 ; 8,478,871 ; and 9,141,276. (Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The '090 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The '090 patent, \"System and Method for Connecting Security Systems to a Wireless Device,\" issued in September 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). Before this patent, home-security systems typically consisted of a security panel, sensors, and a keypad inside a home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). The keypad controlled the system through a central monitor which, when armed, would detect \"state changes\" from the sensors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). The '090 patent inventors recognized that this system did not relay \"normal\" activity, for example, the opening or closing of a door or window. This capability could provide homeowners useful information when the system was not armed, turning a home-security system into a kind of ever-alert \"nanny cam.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). The patented technology allows both an unarmed and armed system to transmit these and similar events to a database through a modem. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). A homeowner could monitor not only break-ins, but also such events as when adolescent children returned from a night out, or when a housekeeper arrived or left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second amended complaint alleges that by transmitting both \"alarm\" events and \"normal\" activity, the '090 patent \"extract[s] useful information\" from \"conventional security panels and sensors,\" improving \"the operation of those security sensors and panels in an unconventional manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). According to the second amended complaint, the prior art \"neither taught using normal activity nor expressed any appreciation for the substantial advantages associated with utilizing this data in combination with alarm events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30). The second amended complaint alleges that the '090 patent addresses \"the problems associated with processing and retaining substantial volumes of activity associated with both normal activity and alarm events,\" because the new system \"effectively process[es]\" the data \"without being overwhelmed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33). The ability to process that information, according to Alarm.com, was \"not well-understood, routine, or conventional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The '090 patent also allows users to create notification preferences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34). Older systems called the homeowner's landline telephone and, if no one answered, alerted the local police, resulting \"in a high occurrence of false alarms\" that \"deplete[d] police resources and undermine[d] the credibility\" of home-security systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-38; '090 Patent at 1:39-41). The '090 patent allows homeowners to choose the types of events they want to be notified about, and how and whether to respond-through text message, email, or phone call-before the system contacts law enforcement. (Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 41-43). The second amended complaint alleges that this notification system was \"not well-understood, routine, or conventional in light of the prior art systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42, 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The '385 and '736 Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These patents, both entitled \"Method and System for Communicating With and Controlling an Alarm System From a Remote Server,\" issued in December 2009 and June 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48). The '736 patent, a continuation of the '385 patent, shares its specification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48). Both \"provide an upgrade unit that allows a user to keep an existing legacy alarm system rather than replacing that system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before these patents, homeowners had to remove and replace home-security systems to modify or upgrade them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50). A legacy alarm system usually had a controller connected to sensors throughout the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52). Homeowners controlled the system using a keypad connected to the alarm controller through a \"keypad bus.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-54). This system communicated with the external monitoring service-a security company-through a public telephone line. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55, 61). The second amended complaint refers to the telephone line as a \"single point of failure\" that, if cut, could \"prevent[ ] notification of authorities in the event of a break-in.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62). The second amended complaint alleges that legacy systems could send information out to the external monitoring service but could not be remotely controlled or upgraded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-64). Newer systems that provide two-way communication between the system and a central monitoring service required removing and replacing the entire existing system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The '385 and '736 patents address those shortcomings by allowing homeowners to upgrade legacy systems by \"coupling\" a new communications unit with the existing keypad bus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69). The communications unit transmits and receives information through the existing security panel, using the keypad bus in an \"unconventional\n   way to achieve unexpected and useful results.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The communications unit also connects with a remote server, allowing homeowners to control the system from outside the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72). According to Alarm.com's second amended complaint, remote access and control of the system were \"not well-understood, routine, or conventional.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The '871 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The \"Gateway Registry Methods and Systems\" patent issued in July 2013 and assigns unique serial numbers to \"gateways,\" devices that connect two networks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 75, 78). This allows streamlined identification by \"gateway registries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80). The second amended complaint alleges that this identification method was unconventional and reduces gateway registries' computing load. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The '276 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The \"Integrated Interface for a Mobile Device\" patent issued in September 2015 and relates to improving how homeowners remotely control their home-security system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83, 84). Before the patent, homeowners could control their security system with only \"a dedicated device designed specifically, and exclusively, for the...system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84). The '276 patent claims software that allows homeowners to control and monitor their system through a smart-device application that synchronizes the smart device to the system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86). The second amended complaint alleges that \"the '276 patent improved the preexisting home security technology...to permit a mobile device running an app[lication] to perform the same functions previously accomplished through a dedicated device.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87). According to the second amended complaint, having different companies monitor the security system and supply the control device were not well-understood, routine, or conventional, and neither was the software enabling the synchronization between the homeowner's smart device and their security system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This case was transferred from the Eastern District of Texas with ipDatatel's motion to dismiss pending. (Docket Entry Nos. 48, 67). This court denied the motion without prejudice and ruled first on the parties' claim-construction disputes. (Docket Entry No. 91). The parties presented oral argument on their proposed constructions, the court issued its claim-construction Memorandum and Opinion, and ipDatatel reurged the motion to dismiss. (Docket Entry Nos. 117, 118, 122). The court ordered the parties to explain the relationship between the claim construction and ipDatatel's motion. (Docket Entry Nos. 126, 127, 132, 140, 143).

As in\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   , the specifications and the second amended complaint describe the prior-art problems and how the invention solved them by improving conventional technology through unconventional means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The '385 patent specification states that before the patent issued, a homeowner who wanted to upgrade an existing system had to replace the old system with a new one. ( '385 Patent at 2:4-14; Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 50). The upgrade solved two significant drawbacks: (1) one-way communication from the system to a central monitoring service; and (2) communication over hardwire telecommunications lines that could be cut, severing the link between the home and the central monitoring service. ( '385 Patent at 1:53-67; Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 55-56, 61-63). The '385 and '736 patents addressed these drawbacks in a cost-effective manner by providing an upgrade that allows for two-way communication with, and remote access to, the existing alarm system. ( '385 Patent at 2:15-20; Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 69, 71). The upgrade includes a \"communication unit\" \"coupled\" to the existing system's keypad bus, which \"allows the alarm processor and keypad processor to communicate using...a serial digital protocol transmitted and received by the processors.\" (Docket\n   Entry No. 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 59, 69). The communications unit enhances the existing system by \"transmit[ting] and receiv[ing] information from the security panel as if it were a keypad.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69). This unit \"communicates with a remote server...to allow remote access and control of the legacy alarm unit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   According to the second amended complaint, the patents disclosed both hardware and software innovations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69-72; Docket Entry No. 102 at 68:22-24). The second amended complaint alleges that the invention's software improves the operation of legacy systems by enabling two-way communication and remote access. (Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6\u00b6 69-72). The second amended complaint also alleges that both functions exceeded the design of the existing keypad bus, making the upgrade capable of unconventional use that enhanced prior-art system capabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 69, 72). At oral argument, even though Alarm.com conceded that some of the patents-in-suit used generic components, it maintained that the communications unit claimed in the '385 and '736 patents was new hardware.

The competing characterizations of the communications unit and software create disputed factual issues that preclude an eligibility determination based on clear and convincing evidence at this stage, on this record. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 48 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   ipDatatel argues that claim 1 does not include a legacy system and, as a result, the allegations about unconventional use are irrelevant to patent eligibility. (Docket Entry No. 48 at 15). The claim discloses a \"system comprising: a communications unit, coupled to a keypad bus of an alarm system controller unit.\" ( '385 Patent at 12:30-32). The specification makes clear that the claim is directed to an existing alarm system. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '385 Patent at 1:8-11 (\"The present invention relates to...coupling a legacy alarm system to a server coupled to an external network via a plurality of monitored communications modes.\") ). ipDatatel concedes this point in arguing that \"Alarm.com does not assert that the 'legacy' controller unit [is] anything but conventional.\" (Docket Entry No. 56 at 8; Docket Entry No. 48 at 15-16 (\"The specification also establishes that the 'alarm system controller,' which includes the 'keypad bus,' is conventional.\") ). Claim 1 captures both the legacy alarm system and the arguably inventive concept alleged in the second amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the second amended complaint alleges that the communications unit and the ordered combination of claim 1's elements were not conventional and specifies how the upgraded unit improved the existing alarm system function, disputed factual issues as to inventiveness remain.\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1125\">\n    882 F.3d at 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   ipDatatel's arguments about the other claims in the '385 and '736 patents hinge on whether claim 1 is patent-ineligible as a matter of law.

According to the specification, before the '276 patent, the \"field of home and small business security [was] dominated by technology suppliers who buil[t] 'closed' security systems, where the individual components (sensors, security panels, keypads) operate[d] solely within the confines of a single vendor solution.\" ( '276 Patent at 1:40-45). Homeowners could control and monitor prior-art systems using only \"device[s] designed specifically, and exclusively, for the...system.\" (Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 84). These dedicated devices had several disadvantages: (1) they ignored a growing \"need for a heterogeneous, cross-vendor solution\" driven by the proliferation of \"smart\" technology; (2) they were inferior to, for example, smartphones, because home-security companies lacked expertise in creating web-based solutions and consumer-friendly interfaces; and (3) they were difficult to install and integrate into existing systems. ( '276 Patent at 2:24-47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The second amended complaint alleges that the '276 patent offered a solution to these problems: software and a smart-technology application enabling homeowners to monitor and control security systems with their smart devices. (Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 86). The '276 patent allows homeowners to synchronize their smart devices with their security system.

According to the second amended complaint, the '276 patent was the first invention to allow smart-device control over a home-security system, marking \"a significant departure from conventional\" systems. (Docket Entry No. 46 at \u00b6 84). The second amended complaint specifically alleges that this smart-device control improved existing technology by offering\n   homeowners enhanced functionality and flexibility to control and monitor their systems using a familiar device but from remote locations.
