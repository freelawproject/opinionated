Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs John Weathers, Richard DiDio, and David Taylor (together, \"Taxpayer Plaintiffs\") as well as Plaintiff 21st Century Partnership for STEM Education (\"21PSTEM\") allege that the request-for-proposal (\"RFP\") process of Defendants School District of Philadelphia and the School Reform Commission\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (together, the \"School District\" or \"Defendants\") violates state and federal procurement regulations. Plaintiff 21PSTEM also alleges that Defendants' refusal to provide it with a debriefing after it filed a bid protest violated its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and comparable sections of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Second Amended Complaint (ECF 6-1, \"SAC\") alleges four Counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    Count I\n   </strong>\n   : 21PSTEM seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants from continuing to violate Pennsylvania common law, binding School Reform Commission policies, the School District's Procurement Manual, the School District's RFPs, and grant regulations when procuring professional services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Count II\n   </strong>\n   : Taxpayer Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants from continuing to violate Pennsylvania common law, binding School Reform Commission policies, the School District's Procurement Manual, the School District's RFPs, and grant regulations when procuring professional services. Count II is pleaded in the alternative to Count I if the Court determines that 21PSTEM lacks standing to bring Count I.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Count III\n   </strong>\n   : 21PSTEM alleges that Defendants' refusal to provide 21PSTEM with a requested debriefing after it filed a bid protest amounts to unlawful retaliation in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory or nominal damages, and costs and expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   4.\n   <strong>\n    Count IV\n   </strong>\n   : 21PSTEM alleges that Defendants' refusal to provide 21PSTEM with a requested debriefing violates Article I, Sections 20 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Presently before this Court is Defendant School District's Motion to Dismiss all Counts of the Second Amended Complaint under\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). For the reasons discussed below, the Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true, the factual background is as follows. Taxpayer Plaintiffs are residents of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who own property situated within the School District for which they have paid real estate taxes to the District and the City of Philadelphia. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.) They also pay taxes to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which provides funding support to the School District and the School Reform Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Weathers and Mr. Taylor are employed by Plaintiff 21PSTEM: Dr. Weathers as a Senior Researcher and Mr. Taylor as a Senior Web Developer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.) Plaintiff 21PSTEM is a non-profit organization that offers consultative services to improve the performance of teachers, school principals, and other supervisors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) On several occasions, 21PSTEM has responded to RFPs for professional services issued by the School District, including RFPs covering services that would be funded at least in part by federal grants, and intends to do so in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) Defendant School District is a public school district and political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is governed by Defendant School Reform Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the School District's procurement practices for professional services are governed by (1) \"judicially enforceable standards for procurement that have been developed in Pennsylvania case law\"; (2) policies enacted by the School District's Board of Education or its predecessor, the School Reform Commission; (3) the School District's Procurement Manual; (4) the School District's RFPs; and (5) federal procurement regulations, when a procurement is funded at least in part by federal money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pennsylvania's Public School Code imposes competitive bidding requirements for construction contracts but does not \"directly impose\" such requirements for professional services contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) However, the School Code authorizes the School District to \"adopt reasonable regulations for its government and control\" and \"such reasonable rules and regulations as it may deem necessary and proper, regarding the management of its school affairs,\" which includes rules and regulations pertaining to procurement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15) (citing 24 P.S. \u00a7 5-510.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to its authority under the School Code, the School Reform Commission adopted School District Policy No. 610. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17.) Policy No. 610 provides that the School Reform Commission \"shall obtain competitive bids and price quotations for products and services where such bids or quotations are required by law or may result in monetary savings to the school district.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Policy No. 610 also requires the School District's Office of Procurement Services to \"maintain a Policies and Procedures Manual to identify the district's process for obtaining competitive bids and price quotations as required by applicable law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) The School Reform Commission adopted the December 2017 amendments to Policy No. 610. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the delegation of authority provided in Policy No. 610, the Office of Procurement Services maintains a Policies and Procedures Manual (\"Procurement Manual\"), which Plaintiffs allege has the force of law because it is maintained pursuant to Policy No. 610, a \"validly enacted School District regulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) However, in the School District's day-to-day operations, it takes the position that the Procurement Manual \"does not have the force of law[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Procurement Manual states that the purpose of a competitive procurement process \"is to ensure that bid solicitations are awarded on the basis of a competitive process designed to select qualified vendors to provide goods and services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3.) Pursuant to the Procurement Manual, the RFP process is \"generally used to select a vendor for a professional or consulting service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) When the School District procures such services through an RFP, the Procurement Manual states that the RFP process described in the Manual \"\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MUST\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   be followed\" and that \"[c]ompliance with this process and file management are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CRITICAL\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   to defend an evaluation decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Procurement Manual also provides that \"[t]here must be a common standard throughout the competitive RFP process,\" which requires \"an understanding on the part of all competitors of the basis upon which the award of contract will be made.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The Procurement Manual explains that this \"common standard\" on which bids and proposals are based is central to competitive procurement, and that the purpose of bidding requirements is to invite competition and secure the best work at the lowest price practicable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Similarly, \"[a]ll factors or criteria that will be used to evaluate proposals must be clearly set forth in the RFP,\" and \"[t]he RFP shall clearly define all evaluation factors or criteria in order of importance, including price.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) The Procurement Manual requires that the School District's Evaluation Committee conduct the RFP evaluation process in a \"fair and objective manner,\" which means that all proposals must be evaluated \"in accordance with the specific criteria identified in the RFP.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) The Evaluation Committee may not consider factors or criteria that are not specified in the RFPs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a procurement by the School District is paid for at least in part by federal grant money, School Reform Commission Policy No. 1000 directs and requires the School District to comport with \"federal Uniform Grant Guidance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4.) Consistent with Policy No. 1000, School District Policy No. GP1600 requires that, when procuring goods or services with federal grants, the School District must comply with its Procurement Manual as well as federal grant regulations, if the grant regulations are more restrictive than the Procurement Manual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5.) The federal grant regulations require\n   the School District to use \"its own documented procurement procedures\" outlined in the Procurement Manual and mandates that RFPs identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20200.318\">\n    2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200.320(d)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 9, 2017, the School District, through its Office of Procurement Services, issued RFP-567, which solicited proposals for a professional services contract involving job training and professional development support for first-and second-year principals. (SAC \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20200.318\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7.) Federal funds would be used to pay for a portion of the costs of the new principal coaching requested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) RFP-567 listed a non-exhaustive list of evaluation criteria, including \"Project Cost,\" but did not provide any information about the relative weight attributed to each criterion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.) In the RFP, the School District reserved the right to \"supplement, amend or otherwise modify this RFP at any time prior to the selection of a respondent\" and to \"reject any or all proposals or any part of any proposal submitted in response to this RFP, and to waive any defect or technicality[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 at 9.) In an Addendum to RFP-567, the School District stated that RFP-567 was a \"proposal[ ] based on the District seeking the most competitive pricing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-56;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20200.318\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When the School District evaluated responses to RFP-567, it made pricing the least important factor in its evaluation matrix, and it applied the pricing factor in a way that did not actually seek competitive pricing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.) The winning respondent submitted a proposal at the maximum allowable budget of $ 4 million, but it received the same or higher pricing scores as respondents who submitted proposals for less than $ 3 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) The evaluation matrix completed by the District did not have eight scoring sections corresponding to the evaluation criteria listed in the RFP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pursuant to the Procurement Manual, an unsuccessful bidder \"shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection and award of the contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) These debriefings \"shall include\" the provision of \"Evaluation Information,\" which refers to copies of the evaluator's scoresheets and the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the winning bidder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.) The School District's actual practice is to refuse to provide a debriefing to any RFP respondent that files a bid protest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After 21PSTEM was not awarded a contract for RFP-567, 21PSTEM requested a debriefing and filed a bid protest. (SAC \u00b6 92.) 21PSTEM also requested Evaluation Information pursuant to the Commonwealth Procurement Code and the Commonwealth Procurement Handbook, including copies of its evaluation score sheets, the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the winning contractor, the overall ranking of vendors, and a summary of the rationale for the award. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9.) The School District rejected 21PSTEM's request for documents, contending that Pennsylvania's Right-to-Know Law does not require it to provide disappointed bidders with the Evaluation Information that the Procurement Manual states shall be provided in a debriefing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20200.318\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9.) The School District refused to provide a debriefing to 21PSTEM while its bid protest with respect to RFP-567 was pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71, 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 30, 2018, Taxpayer Plaintiff's filed the Original Complaint against Defendants School District, School Reform Commission, and The New Teacher Project, which was awarded the services contract,\n   in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (ECF 1). The Original Complaint alleged that Defendants School District and School Reform Commission unlawfully conducted the RFP process and sought a preliminary injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the contract awarded to the New Teacher Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-43.) Taxpayer Plaintiffs withdrew their request for preliminary injunction with respect to the specific contract, and Defendants School District and School Reform Commission filed preliminary objections to the Original Complaint on July 17, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF 7 at 2; ECF 10 at 2; ECF 1 at 3, \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 28, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint, which added 21PSTEM as a Plaintiff and voluntarily dismissed The New Teacher Project as a Defendant. (ECF l Ex. A.) On September 14, 2018, Defendants filed a Notice of Removal in this Court, alleging federal question jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ECF 1). Defendants contend in the Notice of Removal that this Court has jurisdiction because the First Amended Complaint added allegations that Defendants' practices in the procurement of professional services violate federal procurement regulations and that Defendants violated 21PSTEM's First Amendment rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) On September 21, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim, alleging that Count I should be dismissed because Taxpayer Plaintiffs failed to challenge the award of a specific contract, and 21PSTEM, a disappointed bidder, has no right to challenge the School District's procurement practices under Pennsylvania law (ECF 4, \"MTD FAC\"). Defendants argued that Count II should be dismissed as speculative (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave to Amend their Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) on October 3, 2018, attaching the Second Amended Complaint. (ECF 6-1). On October 5, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Sever and Remand (ECF 7). The Motion alleged that the procurement claim-Count I of the First Amended Complaint-should be severed and remanded because the principal relief Plaintiffs sought was an injunction requiring the School District to follow state law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) This Court issued an Order on October 10, 2018, stating that Plaintiffs' obligation to respond to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, and Defendants' obligation to respond to Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend, were stayed pending a ruling on the Motion to Sever and Remand (ECF 8). Defendants filed a Response to the Motion to Sever and Remand on October 25, 2018 (ECF 10), and Plaintiffs filed a Reply on November 1, 2018 (ECF 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following a December 19, 2018 hearing on the Motion to Sever and Remand, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint as moot (ECF 13). The same Order stated that the Court was inclined to confine its consideration of the issue of remand to the First Amended Complaint, but that the Court was inclined to permit Plaintiffs to amend the First Amended Complaint and make the Proposed Second Amended Complaint the operative complaint for the Court's consideration of the issue of standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.) The Court also ordered Defendants to file a renewed Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint by January 15, 2019, Plaintiffs to file a Response by January 29, 2019, and Defendants to file a Reply by February 12, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) On March 19, the Court denied the Motion to Sever and\n   Remand (ECF 23, 24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the Court's December 19, 2018 Order, Defendant School District filed a renewed Motion to Dismiss (ECF 17, \"MTD SAC\"), Plaintiffs filed a Response in opposition (ECF 19, \"Resp.\"), and Defendant School District filed a Reply (ECF 21, \"Rep.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(MTD SAC at 4.) The School District also argues that the laws Plaintiffs cite do not support their claims. (MTD FAC at 6-7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the School District argues that the Pennsylvania Public School Code does not govern\n   the School District's contracting practices for professional services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The School District argues that Counts III and IV must be dismissed because the claims are speculative, and because the School District's failure to provide 21PSTEM with a requested debriefing while its bid protest was pending would not deter persons of ordinary firmness from protesting a bid award, as required to support a retaliation claim. (MTD SAC at 4, 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the Response, Plaintiffs contend that Count I should not be dismissed because 21PSTEM may seek prospective relief barring unlawful practices in future procurements. (Resp. at 8.) Plaintiffs argue that Count II, an alternative claim to Count I, should not be dismissed because Taxpayer Plaintiffs may seek prospective relief if 21PSTEM cannot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17.) Regarding the remaining Counts, Plaintiffs contend that the School District waived any arguments with respects to Counts III and IV because the District does not make any arguments regarding Count IV, nor does the District \"even address any of the new allegations\" relevant to Count III. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) If the Court addresses the merits of Count III, Plaintiffs contend that Count III should not be dismissed because 21PSTEM has adequately alleged that denying debriefings would change the behavior of people or ordinary firmness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Further, Plaintiffs argue that because the SAC added a request for compensatory relief to Count III, it can no longer be deemed speculative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) Plaintiffs make no arguments regarding why Count IV should not be dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The School District reiterates in the Reply that neither 21PSTEM, an unsuccessful bidder, nor Taxpayer Plaintiffs have standing under state law to challenge the contracting policies or practices of the School District, and so Counts I and II should be dismissed. (Rep. at 2.) The School District adds that Plaintiffs' reliance on the Commonwealth Procurement Code is misplaced because this Code only applies to state agencies, not local school districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The School District also notes that Plaintiffs fail to cite any authority for the proposition that a school district's regulations, even those that are formally adopted by its governing body, are judicially enforceable in an action brought by taxpayers or an unsuccessful bidder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Regarding Count III, the School District argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the School District's allegedly retaliatory conduct of denying 21PSTEM a debriefing was sufficiently severe to deter a plaintiff of ordinary firmness from exercising its rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The School District disputes that it waived any arguments with respect to Count IV, arguing that its arguments regarding dismissal of Count III also apply to Count IV.

As noted above, Plaintiffs do not distinguish between Article III standing and non-jurisdictional \"standing\" under state law. However, Plaintiffs contend that if the Court dismisses Count I on the grounds that 21PSTEM does not have a right to the legal remedy it seeks, the Court must assess whether Taxpayer Plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring Count II. (Resp. at 12.) The School District, on the other hand, contends that if the Court concludes that 21PSTEM has Article III standing to bring Count I, the Court need not address whether Taxpayer Plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring Count II.

As the parties recognize that Count II of the SAC encompasses Count I\n   of the FAC, the Court need not repeat that analysis here. The factual allegations in the FAC that conferred Article III standing upon Taxpayer Plaintiffs have remained in the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 66 (alleging that the School District's procurement process \"has cost and will continue to cost taxpayers millions of dollars more per year than is necessary\"); SAC \u00b6 65 (same).) Accordingly, the Court concludes that Taxpayer Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to establish Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The School District argues that Count II must be dismissed because Taxpayer Plaintiffs must contest the award of a specific contract, rather than the School District's procurement practices in general, to state a claim under state law. (MTD SAC at 8-9.) In particular, Defendants emphasize that Taxpayer Plaintiffs fail to challenge the award RFP-567, which is not referenced in Count II of the SAC. (MTD FAC at 6) (citing\n   <em>\n    Shaeffer v.

The School District further argues that Pennsylvania law only permits a taxpayer to bring an action challenging \"the statutory and constitutional validity of [public officials'] acts.\" (MTD SAC at 6) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Palisades Park, LLC v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2471785\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/585/196/\">\n    585 Pa. 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2471785,8997954\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/888/655/\">\n    888 A.2d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661-62 (2005) ); (MTD SAC at 8-9) (citing\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Palisades Park, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2471785,8997954\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/888/655/\">\n    888 A.2d at 661-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The School District contends that the Public School Code's competitive bidding requirements do not apply to procurement of professional services, such as 21PSTEM's principal coaching, and that neither the Procurement Manual nor the RFP process the School District outlined have the effect of law. (MTD FAC at 7.) As a result, the School District argues that Count II must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the outset, the Court disagrees that Taxpayer Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege any violations of state law. As noted above, the School District Code does not impose competitive bidding requirements on the procurement of professional services. However, once the School District decides to procure services through an RFP process, it is obligated to adhere to the terms of that RFP throughout the procurement process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lasday v. Allegheny Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1778826\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/499/434/\">\n    499 Pa. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1778826\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/499/434/\">\n    453 A.2d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 954 (1982). Further, while the School Reform Commission did not formally adopt the Procurement Manual, it did adopt Policy No. 610, which requires the Office of Procurement Services to maintain a Procurement Manual. (SAC Ex. 1); (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   MTD FAC at 7) (\"[E]ven if the School District were required by state law to follow its own policies, plaintiffs do not allege that the Procurement Manual was ever adopted by the School Reform Commission[,] ... [and] [o]nly those rules and regulations formally adopted by ... the School Reform Commission ... govern the management of a school district and the conduct of its employees.\"). Viewing the factual allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the SAC alleges sufficient facts for the Court to conclude that the School District's failure to follow the Procurement Manual and/or the RFP process violated Pennsylvania law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, the parties dispute whether Taxpayer Plaintiffs have standing to challenge the School District's procurement practices. To have standing under Pennsylvania law, a taxpayer must have a \"substantial, direct, and immediate interest in the subject of the litigation because ... [t]he prevention of waste of tax revenue [alone] [is] an interest which is too remote, since [the taxpayer] is not directly or specifically affected by the loss.... [That interest] is merely the same interest all citizens\n   have in having others comply with the law or the constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Conti Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022594327\">\n    2003 WL 22594327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (holding that a Pennsylvania and federal taxpayer's interest in preventing the expenditures of an additional $ 1 million of state and federal funds for a construction project was not sufficient to create taxpayer standing). The Court concludes that Taxpayer Plaintiffs' interest in this case is no different from that of all other Pennsylvania and Philadelphia taxpayers in having the School District minimize its expenditures by selecting the lowest bidder. As a result, Taxpayer Plaintiffs lack \"ordinary\" standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Pennsylvania courts \"have developed a restrictive standard [of standing] with narrow exceptions\" for taxpayers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Both parties, however, reference this test in support of their contentions. Assuming for purposes of this Motion that this test applies, Taxpayer Plaintiffs cannot establish that the first, second, and fifth elements are met. With respect to the first element, Taxpayer Plaintiffs argue that the absence of previous or pending challenges to the School District's procurement practices is \"strong evidence that they would continue to go unchallenged.\" (Resp. at 16.) Taxpayer Plaintiffs cite decisions from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in support of this proposition. However, Judge O'Neill, the only judge in this Circuit to address the\n   <em>\n    Biester\n   </em>\n   test, concluded that the absence of other lawsuits challenging a governmental action was not sufficient to establish that the action would go unchallenged.\n   <em>\n    Conti Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022594327\">\n    2003 WL 22594327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Taxpayer Plaintiffs address the second and fifth elements together, arguing that only the bidders and School District officials engaged in the allegedly unlawful practices are affected by the School District's procurement practices. (Resp. at 15.) Taxpayer Plaintiffs argue that because School District officials are not inclined to challenge their own practices, \"if bidders like 21PSTEM cannot seek prospective relief, then there are no persons besides taxpayers who are 'better situated to assert the claim.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) However, Taxpayer Plaintiffs fail to recognize that bidders who are also taxpayers, unlike 21PSTEM, may be able to challenge the School District's procurement practices, as discussed above. Further, as Judge O'Neill noted in\n   <em>\n    Conti Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the \"Commonwealth[ ] or federal government could decide to challenge the [practices]\" of the School District \"based on their direct interests in overseeing the expenditure of [state] tax revenues[ ]\" federal grants on RFPs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022594327\">\n    2003 WL 22594327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ; (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 4-6 (alleging that the\n   Commonwealth provides funding support to the School District and the School Reform Commission);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (alleging that RFPs for professional services may be funded at least in part by federal grants) ).

First and Fourteenth Amendment Retaliation Claims (Count III)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Next, the School District contends that Count III must be dismissed because they are based on speculation, and therefore, 21PSTEM has failed to sufficiently allege Article III standing to seek prospective equitable relief. (MTD SAC at 9.) Alternatively, the School District argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the denial of a requested debriefing was sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising his First Amendment rights, as required to state a retaliation claim in Count III. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court considers whether 21PSTEM has Article III standing before addressing the merits of Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The School District argues that Count III must be dismissed because it is based on speculation about what might happen in the future regarding the award of professional service contracts, any protest it might file, and whether it will obtain a debriefing if it applies for and is denied a contract and then seeks a debriefing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, the School District argues that 21PSTEM lacks Article III standing to seek prospective equitable relief in Count III because 21PSTEM has failed to allege that it \"is likely to suffer future injury from the [School District's] conduct,\" or that \"the threat of injury [is] sufficiently real and immediate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6) (quoting\n   <em>\n    McNair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736606\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/672/213/#p223\">\n    672 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   223 ).

As the School District notes, 21PSTEM has not alleged that it is likely that it will be a losing bidder in the future, nor that if 21PSTEM is a losing bidder, that it will file a bid protest. However, the SAC alleges that 21PSTEM intends to respond to RFPs for professional services issued by the School District \"in the future,\" and that the School District maintains a \"policy of denying debriefings to respondents [sic] who file bid protests.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 96.) In other words, the SAC sufficiently alleges that the School District's violations of state and local law will continue into the future if undeterred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n    528 U.S. at 184-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   in holding that the plaintiff had demonstrated an injury in fact because the alleged unlawful conduct was occurring when the complaint was filed, and it was \"entirely reasonable\" that the plaintiff would suffer harm in the future).

As to the first element, the Court assumes for purposes of the instant Motion that filing a bid protest is a protected activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also do not dispute the existence of the third element-a \"causal link\" between 21PSTEM's bid protest and the School District's refusal to provide 21PSTEM with a debriefing. Accordingly, the Court limits its analysis to the second and \"key\" element, as the parties dispute whether the SAC sufficiently alleges that the School District's denial of 21PSTEM's request for a debriefing would \"deter a person of ordinary firmness\" from filing a bid protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The SAC alleges that the School District will not provide a losing bidder who has filed a bid protest with a debriefing, which includes the provision of \"Evaluation Information\" that explains how the School District evaluated the bidder's RFP response and any weaknesses or gaps in the response. (SAC \u00b6 71.) 21PSTEM further alleges that this information is \"highly valuable\" to any person or business that intends to respond to future RFPs, as access to this information may allow a losing bidder to \"significantly strengthen\" its future RFP responses and \"significantly increase\" its chances of being awarded future contracts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.) According to 21PSTEM, the only way a losing bidder can obtain this information is by requesting a debriefing, and in light of the potential value of this information, 21PSTEM \"would be substantially less likely to file a bid protest in the future\" if the School District may continue punishing bid protestors by denying them access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, as the Court must at this stage, the Court concludes that 21PSTEM adequately pleaded a First Amendment retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Fourteenth Amendment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In Count III, 21PSTEM also alleges that the School District has violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts specific to the Fourteenth Amendment claim. Rather than grant Plaintiff leave to amend, the Court will require Plaintiff to provide full factual information in discovery to support this claim. The Motion to Dismiss Count III will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. State Constitutional Claim (Count IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, 21PSTEM brings a parallel retaliation claim under the Pennsylvania Constitution, alleging that the School District's failure to provide 21PSTEM with a debriefing while its bid protest was pending amounted to unlawful retaliation in violation of Article I, Sections 20 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 97-103.) In contrast to 21PSTEM's First Amendment retaliation claim in Count III, 21PSTEM seeks only declaratory\n   and injunctive relief in Count IV. Defendants contend that their arguments as to why Count III should be dismissed also apply to Count IV. As the Court concludes that 21PSTEM has Article III standing to seek prospective equitable relief in Count III, and Count IV is based on the same factual allegations, the same Article III standing analysis applies to Count IV. Therefore, the Court proceeds to the merits to determine whether Count IV states a claim for which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
