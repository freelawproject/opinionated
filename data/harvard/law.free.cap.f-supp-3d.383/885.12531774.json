For years, Dakota subleased space at the Sedona Airport and ran its tours from that location. In 2014, Dakota became embroiled in litigation concerning its lease with the Sedona Oak-Creek Airport Authority, Inc. (\"SOCAA\"), the non-profit entity that operates the airport on behalf of Yavapai County (\"the County\"). In 2017, the parties entered into settlement agreement to resolve that litigation. Among other things, the settlement agreement terminated Dakota's sublease but required SOCAA to issue a request for proposal (\"RFP\") so that interested parties, including Dakota, could submit new bids to use space at the airport. Dakota submitted a bid in response to the RFP but its bid wasn't accepted. Instead, SOCAA accepted a competing bid from Guidance\n   Air Service, LLC (\"Guidance\"), a rival helicopter tour operator that already leased other space at the airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In their amended complaint, which was filed in August 2018, Dakota and Solid Edge Aviation (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") allege the RFP process was a \"sham\" designed to exclude Dakota from the airport. Among other things, Plaintiffs allege that SOCAA altered the selection criteria at the last moment in an effort to disadvantage them, accepted Guidance's bid even though it was 32% lower than theirs, refused to produce Guidance's full bid during a subsequent bid protest, presented false testimony during a state-court hearing related to the bid protest, conducted a pretextual audit of their taxes, and lodged a false complaint about their operations with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although Plaintiffs have raised troubling allegations about how the RFP process was conducted, this case does not involve a challenge to that process in the traditional sense (ordinarily, bid protests alleging improprieties in RFP processes are governed by state law and brought in state court). Instead, the amended complaint asserts antitrust claims against four different defendants: SOCAA, SOCAA's former director Amanda Shankland (\"Shankland\"), Guidance, and the County (collectively, \"Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs have now voluntarily dismissed their claims against SOCAA, Shankland, and Guidance (Doc. 115), but their claims against the County remain pending. The County has moved for judgment on the pleadings (Doc. 79) and, as discussed below, its motion will be granted for two independent reasons. First, time and again over the last half-century, plaintiffs have attempted to bring antitrust claims against airports and airport operators under the theory that the airport's refusal to provide a lease (or similar concession) amounted to anticompetitive conduct and/or contributed to monopolization. The courts have, almost without exception, rejected such lawsuits because (1) municipal airports generally enjoy immunity from antitrust liability in this context pursuant to the so-called \"state action\" doctrine, which was first established in\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    317 U.S. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    63 S.Ct. 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"304209\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/317/341/\">\n    87 L.Ed. 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943), and (2) run-of-the-mill bid protests can't, in any event, be repackaged as antitrust claims. These principles generally doom Plaintiffs' attempt to transform their dissatisfaction with the RFP process into an antitrust lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, the amended complaint is devoid of any plausible allegation that the County was responsible for transforming the RFP process into a sham. Thus, although the County perhaps could have exercised more care in overseeing how SOCAA was administering the RFP process, Plaintiffs have not articulated facts that would permit the County to be sued under a conspiracy theory. It is a tertiary player in this dispute-Plaintiffs' true dispute lies with SOCAA, and that dispute doesn't sound in antitrust law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In August 2017, Dakota filed its original complaint. (Doc. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July 2018, the Court issued a pair of orders rejecting Dakota's claims against the County and Guidance. (Docs. 68, 69.) First, the Court concluded the County was entitled to judgment on the pleadings because its \"only involvement in this matter is as owner of the Sedona Airport and landlord to SOCAA.... [Dakota] has not demonstrated that Yavapai County meaningfully participated in the RFP process that awarded the sublease to Guidance.... Yavapai County was not involved in SOCAA's decision-making process and\n   was a passive lessor during the RFP process.\" (Doc. 69 at 4-5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, as for Guidance, the Court similarly concluded that although Dakota \"alleges that SOCAA came up with the plan to replace [Dakota] with Guidance ... at no point does [Dakota] allege that Guidance colluded with SOCAA to do so.\" (Doc. 68 at 3-5.) The Court further concluded that Dakota's allegations \"demonstrate that Guidance was not involved in SOCAA's decision-making process and was a passive bidder during the RFP process\" and that Dakota was seeking to improperly \"blame[ ] Guidance for actions that, even if taken as true, could only have only been plausibly committed by SOCAA.\" (Doc. 68 at 3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In August 2018, Dakota, along with new plaintiff Solid Edge, filed an amended complaint alleging violations under sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act against all Defendants. (Doc. 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In September 2018, Defendants filed a trio of dispositive motions: the County filed a renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings (Doc. 79), Guidance filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (Doc. 80), and SOCAA and Shankland filed a separate motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) (Doc. 81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In October 2018, this case was transferred to the undersigned judge. (Doc. 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In November 2019, the three dispositive motions became fully briefed. (Docs. 85, 88, 89, 99, 100, 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 4, 2019, the Court issued an order setting oral argument on the dispositive motions on April 10, 2019. (Doc. 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 9, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a stipulation dismissing their claims against SOCAA, Shankland, and Guidance without prejudice. (Doc. 115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 10, 2019, the Court heard oral argument on the County's motion. During the argument, Plaintiffs asked the Court to defer ruling on the motion because the parties were hoping to finalize a settlement within the next week. The County disagreed and asked the Court to rule on the motion because the potential settlement was still tentative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Factual Allegations In The Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n   <strong>\n    The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dakota operates helicopter and fixed wing air tours out of the Sedona Airport. (Doc. 72 \u00b6 5.) Solid Edge has common ownership with Dakota and serves as Dakota's Part 135 Operating Company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Guidance, like Dakota, operates air tours out of the airport and \"is a direct competitor of ... Dakota.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   SOCAA is a non-profit corporation that \"purports to be an independent airport authority and is empowered to operate, manage and oversee the Sedona Airport pursuant to a long-term written lease agreement with Yavapai.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) SOCAA maintains subleases on buildings, aircraft parking pads, and facilities on the airport premises. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also owns and operates the airport's only fixed base operator, Red Rock Aviation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The airport is operated according to a Master Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Shankland was the General Manager and/or Airport Director of the airport acting on behalf of SOCAA since at least 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The County, which owns the airport, has a long-term contract with SOCAA under which SOCAA must manage the airport\n   for the \"public good\" and in a prudent and businesslike manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    Dakota's Sublease with SOCAA and Litigation Involving the Sublease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs had a sublease with SOCAA that originally ran until August 2014 and was later extended until April 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiffs ran their air tour operations out of the subleased on-airport space. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In November 2014, Plaintiffs and SOCAA became involved in litigation over, among other things, SOCAA's breach of the sublease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On April 27, 2017, the parties settled the litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) The settlement agreement provided that SOCAA would prepare and issue an RFP to sublease on-airport operational space that had been occupied by Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While the lawsuit was pending, there were email communications between SOCAA and certain County officials. On March 14, 2017, SOCAA's President Giorgio Cagliero (\"Cagliero\") sent an email to County Supervisor Randy Garrison (\"Garrison\") in which he suggested a meeting to address SOCAA's \"problem tenant,\" which presumably referred to Dakota. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The email stated there had been \"developments in the litigation that [ ] could be better addressed by a joint Airport Authority/Yavapai County team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The email further suggested that Cagliero, Shankland, and two SOCAA board members meet with Garrison, another individual, and the County Attorney sometime in the following two weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   C.\n   <strong>\n    The \"Sham\" Bidding Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although SOCAA had represented to Plaintiffs that they could have input into drafting the RFP, the day after settlement, SOCAA transmitted an RFP to a County official, Assistant Administrator Jack Fields (\"Fields\"), for review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40.) Fields suggested some general language and SOCAA issued the RFP later that same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The RFP was for a different modular building than had been indicated in the settlement agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) It also lacked information necessary for valid RFPs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) And, during the meeting at which voting on the RFP took place, SOCAA altered the selection criteria in a way that disadvantaged Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Guidance was awarded the RFP (the \"SOCAA-Guidance Sublease\") even though Guidance did not intend to use the subleased space within two months of the RFP's publication, as required by the RFP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Also, Guidance's bid was 32% lower than Plaintiffs' bid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The County and the FAA did not participate in the initial award decision, and no one from either entity was present at the meeting awarding the RFP to Guidance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In approving the SOCAA-Guidance Sublease, the County ignored material terms of the Master Lease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88, 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Within seven minutes after the meeting awarding the RFP to Guidance, SOCAA's counsel sent a letter demanding that Dakota vacate its leased space at the airport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   D.\n   <strong>\n    Subsequent Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   SOCAA told Plaintiffs that the County and the FAA approved the RFP, so Plaintiffs requested the names of the individuals involved in the approval. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) SOCAA claimed it didn't know the names, but Plaintiffs located Fields, who denied any involvement beyond a partial review and suggestion of general language. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   SOCAA has refused to produce Guidance's full bid, in violation of the law,\n   falsely claiming that Guidance and Plaintiffs had agreed to keep this information secret. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs discovered after the bid-selection meeting that even before the RFP had been awarded, SOCAA had discouraged employees from applying to work for Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs submitted a written protest on July 20, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) In her written decision denying this protest, Shankland asserted the airport could not support more than one operator, which directly contradicted the Master Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On July 21, 2017, Plaintiffs sued SOCAA and Shankland in Arizona state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) The court in that case granted a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") prohibiting Dakota's eviction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At a later hearing to determine whether to leave this TRO in place, SOCAA contended that Plaintiffs were not qualified to bid on the sublease because they were not authorized to conduct Part 135 operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.) To support this argument, SOCAA presented an alleged independent consultant to provide expert testimony on compliance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) Neither the expert nor SOCAA revealed that the expert worked for Guidance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   SOCAA has also subsequently engaged in other conduct favoring Guidance over Plaintiffs, including bringing a forcible entry and detainer action to eject Solid Edge from the subleased space, but not bringing a similar action against any related businesses that Guidance uses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) SOCAA also audited Plaintiffs for certain taxes but did not audit Guidance in the same way. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"SOCAA and/or Guidance\" called the FAA hotline to complain that Plaintiffs were not authorized to conduct Part 135 operations, which resulted in an investigation and a decision that the complaints were unsubstantiated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   E.\n   <strong>\n    Effect of the SOCAA-Guidance Sublease\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that the relevant product/service market for antitrust purposes in this case is on-airport air tours originating from and returning to the Sedona Airport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101, 117.) The relevant geographic market is the Sedona area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101, 117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The amended complaint further alleges that significant and high barriers to market entry exist in the form of regulations, licensing, insurance premiums, and high capital investment, which discourage new entry into the market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Shankland has indicated that SOCAA would charge Plaintiffs a fee for every takeoff and landing, which at the moment would require Plaintiffs to pay at least an additional $ 45,000 per month to conduct business as an off-airport air tour provider, which effectively excludes Plaintiffs from conducting air tours from the Sedona airport.

Specifically, they argued that\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   is applicable here because various provisions of Arizona law authorize SOCAA to operate the Sedona Airport. (Doc. 81 at 8-10). In their response, Plaintiffs argued the state-action doctrine is inapplicable because (1) \"the Arizona statutes do not state or imply that SOCAA may engage in anti-competitive conduct in administering the Sedona Airport,\" (2) the state of Arizona doesn't supervise SOCAA's operation of the airport, and (3) state supervision is necessary under\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   because SOCAA itself isn't a municipality. (Doc. 89 at 8-9.) In their reply, SOCAA and Shankland argued that (1) SOCAA qualifies as an instrumentality of the County under Arizona statutory law and caselaw, so state supervision isn't required under\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , and (2) the state statutes authorizing it to run the airport don't need to specifically authorize anticompetitive behavior in order to trigger immunity under\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   .

This is because Plaintiffs are asserting conspiracy claims against the County predicated on an agreement between the County and SOCAA to violate the antitrust laws. Thus, if the SOCAA defendants are entitled to immunity under\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' claims against the County also must fail.\n   <em>\n    Montauk-Caribbean Airways\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548175\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/784/91/\">\n    784 F.2d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (given the conclusion \"that the state action doctrine bar[s] the antitrust claims against the Town of East Hampton, there is no basis for holding that [the competitor airline] conspired with the Town to violate the antitrust laws\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.W.

The Court previously rejected those claims because \"Plaintiff simply does not allege facts sufficient to demonstrate that Yavapai County did anything more than own the Sedona Airport during the RFP process.\" (Doc. 69 at 5.) In its renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings, the County argues the new factual allegations in the amended complaint remain insufficient to show it was part of any illicit agreement. (Doc. 79 at 9-10, 12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their response, Plaintiffs argue their new allegations are sufficient and emphasize the allegations concerning the \"communications between SOCAA's president and County Supervisor Garrison,\" which they contend \"evidence an agreement to oust Dakota and install Guidance.\" (Doc. 85 at 8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court agrees with the County that the amended complaint remains deficient. For example, one of the new factual allegations pertaining to the County is that, on March 14, 2017, SOCAA's president (Cagliero) sent an email to a County representative (Garrison) to suggest a meeting to address SOCAA's \"problem tenant.\" (Doc. 72 \u00b6 32.) The email stated there had been \"developments in the litigation that [ ] could be better addressed by a joint Airport Authority/Yavapai County team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs then allege that \"[i]n furtherance of the 'Airport Authority/Yavapai County team's' goal of dealing with the 'problem tenant,' on March 24, 2017, ten days after Cagliero emailed Garrison, SOCAA attorney Tony Cullum transmitted a letter to Dakota beginning the process of terminating the Dakota Lease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, \"[w]ith SOCAA and Yavapai's plan in place, SOCAA began negotiating a 'settlement' of the Litigation with Dakota.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   But Plaintiffs also acknowledge in the amended complaint that \"despite the purported requirements of the RFP, the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors ... did not participate in the initial award decision. No one from [Yavapai County] was present at the June 26, 2017 meeting, although Yavapai County officials provided input to the RFP process and later approved the sublease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Plaintiffs' main allegation against the County, thus, seems to be that it \"ignored a material term of the Master Lease and approved the Guidance sublease.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Such allegations do not plausibly suggest an illegal agreement or conspiracy between the County and any other defendants. Plaintiffs have pleaded facts showing only that an officer of SOCAA sent an email to a County official suggesting a meeting and that the County later approved the SOCAA-Guidance Sublease. Although Plaintiffs include the phrases \"SOCAA and Yavapai's plan\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34) and \"Airport Authority/Yavapai County team\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 39), they fail to include any concrete factual allegations regarding what this plan was or what this team did. Moreover, it is unremarkable that SOCAA might refer to Dakota as a \"problem tenant\" at the time this email was sent, given that SOCAA and Dakota were embroiled in pending civil litigation at the time. The fact such an email was sent to a County representative (who had a legitimate need to be apprised of the status of ongoing litigation), coupled with a request for a future meeting, does not give rise to a legitimate inference that the purpose of the requested meeting was to hatch a plan to violate the antitrust laws by creating a sham RFP process.\n   <em>\n    Kendall v.

As noted\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , one of Plaintiffs' arguments here is that SOCAA doesn't qualify for immunity because it's a non-governmental entity. That argument obviously wouldn't apply to the County.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The County also seeks judgment on the pleadings because (1) Plaintiffs fail to allege it possessed monopoly power in the relevant market, as required for a section 2 claim and (2) Plaintiffs fail to allege a plausible \"antitrust injury,\" as required for both a section 1 and section 2 claim. (Doc. 79 at 7-13.) Additionally, the County argues that Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is improper because (1) Plaintiffs have not stated a valid claim under the Sherman Act and (2) the amended complaint doesn't identify any ongoing conduct by the County that is causing or threatens to cause future harm. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 13.) The Court declines to reach these arguments because it is ruling in the County's favor on alternative grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
