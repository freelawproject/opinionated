On November 21, 2018, the court certified a statewide class for Plaintiffs' California Invasion of Privacy Act (\"CIPA\") claims. (Doc. No. 141.) On December 5, 2018, Securus filed a Rule 23(f) petition for appeal of the court's class certification order. In the petition, Securus argued that review was warranted because the class certification order presents \"unsettled and fundamental issue[s] of law\" and \"manifest error.\" In its petition for appeal, Securus sought review of three \"fundamental questions\" on the court's class certification order: (1) whether the issue of intent presents a \"common question\" for all class members, (2) whether class litigation is superior to other forms of litigation, and (3) whether the court had the authority to grant Plaintiffs' motion for class certification after it denied Plaintiffs' first motion for class certification. Petition for Rule 23(f) Appeal, Doc. No. 1-2, No. 18-80181. Securus also argued that this court \"committed a manifest and substantial error regarding its jurisdiction\" because Plaintiffs failed to present evidence of improperly recorded calls after 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . On December 5, 2018, Plaintiffs also filed a petition for review of the court's denial of their request to certify a class for Plaintiffs' remaining claims. On February 26, 2019, the Ninth Circuit denied Plaintiffs' petition for an appeal. (Doc. No. 155.) On February 27, 2019, the Ninth Circuit granted Securus' petition for an appeal. (Doc. No. 156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   An appeal from a class certification order does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.

(Doc. No. 160-2, Exh. A at 8-11; Doc. No. 160-3, Exh. B at 6-20.) Plaintiffs argue that the burden of routine discovery does not amount to irreparable harm, Plaintiffs' individual claims must be litigated regardless of the outcome of the appeal, and individual and class discovery may overlap extensively. But the parties dispute whether Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery on the merits of their individual claims. Moreover, the discovery Plaintiffs currently seek is primarily focused on class issues. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 160-2, Exh. A at 8-11; Doc. No. 160-3, Exh. B at 6-20.) Such discovery would likely involve substantial, unrecoverable costs if the Ninth Circuit reverses the court's class certification order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205103157\">\n    2015 WL 5103157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, class notice may unnecessarily damage Securus' reputation, as Securus argues. (Doc. No. 160-1 at 9.) Any such damage would be completely unnecessary, Securus contends, if the class is decertified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that this argument is premature because the parties have not yet requested approval of a class notice. But they do not dispute that the class will need to be notified in a timely manner. \"Aside from the heightened emotion and awareness of the lawsuit that notice would bring, such notice could also cause potential class members to hire attorneys to assist them in making a decision whether or not to opt out of the class; whereas the Ninth Circuit ultimately might rule they should not be included in the class.\"\n   <em>\n    Willcox v.

Cal. Oct. 17, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Without citing any authority, Plaintiffs argue that Securus should have moved for a stay earlier. This argument is unpersuasive as the likelihood of success and potential harm to Securus increased after the Ninth Circuit granted Securus' Rule 23(f) petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Substantial Injury to Other Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they will be irreparably injured if a stay is granted but fail to identify any irreparable harm. First, Plaintiffs argue that a stay will result in undue delay of discovery. Plaintiffs argue that they have not received any discovery since the first phase of discovery ended in September 2017. As time passes, Plaintiffs argue, witnesses' memories fade and employees leave Securus. Plaintiffs will suffer little, if any, harm on this point. Witnesses' memories may fade with time, but Plaintiffs do not identify any key witnesses whose testimony they are concerned about or any other specific evidence that may be less valuable at a later time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that Securus may not supplement its discovery responses. Plaintiffs argue that Securus provided late supplemental responses in the past and recently failed to update its responses when a potential class member reached out. The court sees no connection between Securus' willingness to provide timely supplemental responses and the granting of a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that evidence will likely be destroyed if a stay is granted. Plaintiffs argue that Securus previously destroyed call recordings and may still be destroying evidence under its file deletion protocols. As Securus points out, Judge Dembin previously rejected the argument that Securus' purge of call recordings presents a danger of spoliation. In denying Plaintiffs' motion for a preservation order, Judge Dembin found that the purge occurred years before this case was filed and that he had \"no concern, based upon this record, for the continuing existence and maintenance of the integrity of the evidence in question.\" (Doc. No. 42 at 2-3.) The court agrees with Judge Dembin on this matter as Plaintiffs present no other evidence of spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that third parties may destroy evidence. Plaintiffs represent that some law enforcement agencies have said they will not implement litigation holds or search for responsive documents. In July 2017, Plaintiffs served subpoenas on the San Diego District Attorney's Office (the \"SDDA\"), the Riverside County Sheriff's Office (the \"Riverside Sheriff\"), and the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California (the \"USACAC\"). (Doc. No. 163-1, Teel Decl. \u00b6 4.) The SDDA confirmed that it was conducting a diligent and thorough search for responsive recordings. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11; Doc. No. 163-9, Exh. G.) Plaintiffs do not indicate whether the Riverside Sheriff is complying\n   with the subpoena. The only agency to assert that it will not comply is USACAC. On August 10, 2017, USACAC stated that it could not comply with Plaintiffs' subpoena because Plaintiffs' counsel failed to comply with the applicable\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   regulations, which govern discovery from the Department of Justice, and because the federal government is not a \"person\" within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 and thus cannot be served with a subpoena under that rule. (Doc. No. 163-3, Exh. A at 2-3.) On the current record, Plaintiffs' counsel made no attempt to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or\n   <em>\n    Touhy\n   </em>\n   regulations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 163-4, Exh. B.) Instead, Plaintiffs' counsel sought to meet and confer and proposed that USACAC only search its open, instead of archived, files. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) USACAC declined to place a litigation hold or search for documents. (Doc. No. 163-5, Exh. C at 2.) This exchange occurred over a year and a half ago. On the record before the court, Plaintiffs have taken no other action since that time. Plaintiffs fail to identify any facts suggesting that evidence may be destroyed despite their diligent efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lastly, a stay may benefit class members as it would protect against the possibility of unnecessary disclosure of personal information and avoid any confusion caused by issuing a class notice that may later need to be revised or withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205818300\">\n    2012 WL 5818300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (class members \"face a likelihood of harm should a stay not issue\" because sending class notice risks confusing class members and implicates privacy interests).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, weighing the parties' prospective harm if a stay is granted, the balance tips sharply in Securus' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The public interest weighs in favor of granting a stay. Although the public has an interest in vindicating invasions of privacy, as Plaintiffs argue, the public also has an interest in efficient use of judicial resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at *5.
