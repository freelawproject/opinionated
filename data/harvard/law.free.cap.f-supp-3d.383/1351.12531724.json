MARRA, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   is before the Court upon Plaintiff Mt. Hawley Insurance Company's (\"Mt. Hawley\") Dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 71], and Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Complaint for Declaratory Relief [DE 70]. Mt. Hawley's single-count complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify its policy holders (the owners of a shopping center that lease space to a bar/restaurant called Uncle Mick's) for liability claims brought by a patron of Uncle Mick's. Mt. Hawley moves for summary judgment in its favor finding there is no coverage under the Mt. Hawley policy for the claims asserted in the underlying liability complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Defendants move for partial summary judgment finding that Mt. Hawley has a continuing duty to defend the claims asserted against the policy holders in an underlying liability complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motions are fully briefed\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ripe for review. The Court has carefully considered the entire Court file and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This insurance coverage dispute arises out of an altercation between Leslie J. Frye, II (\"Frye\") and Paul Cleary (\"Cleary\") which occurred on December 14, 2014, in the parking lot for Uncle Mick's Bar and Grill (\"Uncle Mick's\") located in Jupiter, Florida. The altercation ended with Frye being stabbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Frye filed a lawsuit against Mt. Hawley's insureds, Arthur R. Roebuck, III (\"Roebuck\"), Patricia R. Swindle (\"Swindle\"), Riviera Trading and Marketing, Inc. d/b/a Jupiter West Plaza (\"Riviera Trading\"), and Scribe Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Jupiter West Plaza (\"Scribe\") (together, \"Policy Holders\") to recover for the injuries and damages he allegedly sustained as a result of the December 14, 2014 stabbing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon receiving notice of the lawsuit, Mt. Hawley tendered the defense of its Policy Holders to Uncle Mick's primary commercial general liability insurer, Conifer Insurance Company (\"Conifer\"). Conifer did not accept Mt. Hawley's tender. The parties dispute whether Mt. Hawley's insurance policy provides coverage of Frye's lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mt. Hawley has filed a single-count complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Policy Holders for the claims brought by Frye. Mt. Hawley does not argue that the alleged facts do not bring Frye's cause within the coverage of the insurance policy. Rather, Mt. Hawley argues it has no duty to defend claiming the Policy Holders have failed to satisfy a condition precedent to coverage. Specifically, \"[b]y reason of Conifer's refusal to defend and indemnify the Mt. Hawley insureds on Frye's claims, on a primary basis, under a policy with limits equal to or greater than the liability limits of the Mt. Hawley policy, there has been a failure on the part of Defendants to comply with the condition precedent set forth in Paragraph 4 of the Conditions of Coverage endorsement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Policy Holders respond that \"nothing in the 'eight corners' of the Underlying Complaint and the Mt. Hawley Policy ... demonstrate that the allegations in the Underlying Complaint fall exclusively within the Tenants and Contractors Exclusion ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy Holders\n   further assert that if the Court were to take the impermissible step and look at facts beyond the allegations in the Frye Complaint, those facts do not trigger the Tenants and Contractors Endorsement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy Holders move for partial summary judgment finding that Mt. Hawley has a continuing duty to defend them in the Frye matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Undisputed Material Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Mt.

Hawley asserts, \"Florida law sanctions consideration of extrinsic evidence on the issue of Defendants' compliance with the conditions precedent for coverage under the Conditions of Coverage Endorsement because the Frye Amended Complaint omits reference to uncontroverted facts that, if pled, clearly establish there is no coverage under the Mt.

Hawley from defending the Frye Action\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   (a) Frye's injuries arose directly or indirectly from Uncle Mick's occupation, use or maintenance of the leased premises\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (b) Confier, Uncle Mick's primary commercial general liability insurer, does not agree to defend and indemnify Uncle Mick's for bodily injury on a primary basis under a policy with limits equal to or greater than $ 1,000,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mt. Hawley argues that because it is undisputed that Uncle Mick's did not have insurance with the required limits, and Confier has not agreed to defend and indemnify Defendants, summary judgment in its favor is appropriate. However, by its terms, the Tenants and Contractors Endorsement excludes coverage\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   Frye's injuries arose directly or indirectly from Uncle Mick's \"occupation, use or maintenance of\" the leased property. The parties hotly dispute whether Frye's injuries can be reasonably interpreted as arising directly or indirectly from Uncle Mick's occupation, use or maintenance of the leased property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   There is nothing in the Frye Complaint that obviously resolves this question. It alleges Frye was a business invitee lawfully on the premises when he was attacked, assaulted and battered resulting in significant personal injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint, in turn, defines \"premises\" as the Jupiter Plaza as a whole:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Defendants, ARTHUR R. ROEBUCK, III &amp; PATRICIA R. SWINDLE TRS owned, operated, maintained and controlled the premises known as JUPITER WEST PLAZA. Said plaza is located\n   at 6671 W. Indiantown Road, Jupiter, FL 33458 (Hereinafter the \"Premises\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Am. Complaint, \u00b6 5. The Amended Complaint also alleges that all of the named defendants \"leased, operated, possessed, controlled, and/or maintained the premises including the parking lot.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Amended Complaint therefore makes generalized allegations of negligence against all of the Insureds and Uncle Mick's for their individual and collective ownership, operation, maintenance, and control of the Jupiter West Plaza, as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Policy Holders point to the following facts that they claim demonstrate that Frye's injuries did not arise from Uncle Mick's occupation, use or maintenance of the leased property:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \u2022 Prior to the altercation in the parking lot, Frye had never seen or known any of the persons involved in the altercation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \u2022 The assailant, Cleary, was not know to Uncle Mick's prior to the altercation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \u2022 The altercation did not occur in Uncle Mick's, did not start in Uncle Mick's, and did not involve any employees of Uncle Mick's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   \u2022 Frye was attacked in an area not controlled by Uncle Mick's and which Uncle Mick's had no obligation to maintain, light, or provide security.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Thus, the Policy Holders maintain that the incident was motivated by Frye's decision to act as a good Samaritan and not as a consequence of any operation of Uncle Mick's. Therefore, whether Frye's injuries arose directly or indirectly from the operation of Uncle Mick's is disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Mt. Hawley takes a different view. It asserts that by including bodily injury that arises\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   from the tenant's operations\n   <em>\n    of any kind\n   </em>\n   , occupation or use of the leased premises, the Mt. Hawley Policy's Tenants and Contractors Endorsement includes even those claims that may not in a direct, clear or obvious way arise from Uncle Mick's occupation or use of the leased premises. \"If Frye had not been at the bar that night, and if he had not parked his car behind Uncle Mick's in spaces that Defendants permitted their tenant Uncle Mick's patrons to use, this altercation would not have occurred. However, it did and Frye's injuries were a result of it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   It points to the following facts that it claims support its position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \u2022 The events on the night in question all involved persons who were business invitees of Uncle Mick's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \u2022 Frye's sole reason for being there that night was to go to Uncle Mick's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \u2022 The altercation broke out in the parking lot used by Uncle Mick's customers, between two of its patrons who moments earlier had been inside the bar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \u2022 While Cleary and his girlfriend were arguing in the parking lot, Frye exited the bar and yelled something at Cleary. That was when the altercation between Cleary and Frye began, resulting in Frye being stabbed by Cleary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \u2022 Uncle Mick's pays a common area maintenance fee to its landlord to use the parking lot and patrons of Uncle Mick's are authorized to use the parking lot when visiting the bar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   \u2022 Frye had parked his van in the parking lot before entering the bar, and was on his way back to his vehicle when the altercation broke out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   \u2022 The parking lot where the altercation occurred is under video surveillance by Uncle Mick's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   \u2022 The altercation giving rise to Frye's claim occurred while the bar was open for business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Mt. Hawley argues that these facts are enough to conclude that Frye's bodily injury arose, at the very least, indirectly, from Uncle Mick's operation of its business and use of the premises. Mt. Hawley argues that \"the addition of the adverb 'indirectly' after the phrase 'arising out of' broadens the scope of the endorsement's application such that the endorsement applies whenever a bodily injury claim arises in any manner from the tenant's occupation or use of the leased premises, or from such tenant's operations of any kind.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Florida Supreme Court has instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   The term \"arising out of\" is broader in meaning than the term \"caused by\" and means \"originating from,\" \"having its origin in,\" \"growing out of,\" \"flowing from,\" \"incident to\" or 'having a connection with.... [T]his requires more than a mere coincidence between the conduct ... and the injury. It requires some causal connection, or relationship.... But it does not require proximate cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The phrase \"arising out of\" is not ambiguous and should be interpreted broadly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   All that is required is some connection or link between Uncle Mick's and the injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, to be clear, the Policy's Tenants and Contractors Endorsement excluding coverage is applicable to Frye's bodily injury claims if Frye's injuries directly or indirectly originated from, flowed from or is connected to Uncle Mick's occupation, use or maintenance of the leased property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This question brings the Court back full circle. Consideration of extrinsic facts to determine the applicability of the Tenants and Contractors Endorsement is only appropriate in \"exceptional cases\" where the Court may craft an equitable remedy when it is manifestly obvious to all involved that the actual facts place the claims outside the scope of coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it is undisputed\n   that Uncle Mick's primary commercial general liability insurer did not agree to defend and indemnify Uncle Mick's in the Frye action under a policy with limits equal to or greater than the limits of the Mt. Hawley policy, it is\n   <em>\n    not undisputed\n   </em>\n   or obvious that Frye's injuries directly or indirectly originated from, flowed from or is connected to Uncle Mick's occupation, use or maintenance of the leased property - an important qualifier for application of the Tenants and Contractors Endorsement. Therefore, this is not the type of case where it is \"manifestly obvious to all involved that the actual facts placed the claims outside the scope of coverage,\" and therefore this Court may not consider extrinsic facts outside the Underlying Complaint in determining Mt. Hawley's duty to defend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Mt. Hawley is not entitled to a declaratory judgment that there is no coverage under the Policy for the claims asserted by Frye in the underlying liability action.
