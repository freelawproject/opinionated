The Court will note some factual disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Charles Todero\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Charles Todero was a longtime resident of Greenwood, Indiana. Dkt. 125-22 at 8-9,\n   19 (T. Todero Dep. at 6-7, 17). In May 2016, he lived with his mother and brother in nearby Trafalgar. Dkt. 125-22 at 8 (T. Todero Dep. at 6). That month, Mr. Todero's father suddenly died; the funeral was on May 27, 2016. Dkt. 125-22 at 23, 27-28 (T. Todero Dep. at 21, 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Late in the morning on May 29, 2016, Mr. Todero stepped onto Madison Avenue in Greenwood, Indiana. Dkt. 112-1 at 2 (MacNaughton Dep. at 12). Looking neither left nor right, he crossed the street, turned around, and walked back into traffic. Dkt. 112-1 at 3 (MacNaughton Dep. at 13-14). Two drivers nearly hit Mr. Todero; they each called 911. Dkt. 112-1 at 4-5 (MacNaughton Dep. at 39, 43); dkt. 112-2 at 2-3 (Poynter Dep. at 12, 16). The dispatcher reported that Mr. Todero was attempting to commit suicide in traffic. Dkt. 112-5 at 4 (Blackwell Dep. at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Todero's encounter with Greenwood police officers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Greenwood Police Department Officer Brian Blackwell responded to the scene and found Mr. Todero sitting on the curb. Dkt. 112-5 at 3-4, 6 (Blackwell Dep. at 18, 29, 38). Officer Blackwell noticed that Mr. Todero held a Bible on his lap. Dkt. 112-5 at 6 (Blackwell Dep. at 41). As Officer Blackwell approached, he asked Mr. Todero what was going on, but got no response. Dkt. 112-5 at 7 (Blackwell Dep. at 42). Unsure if Mr. Todero was mentally ill, intoxicated, or impaired, Officer Blackwell walked to about five feet from Mr. Todero and again asked \"what's going on\"; Mr. Todero replied by talking about \"Jesus Christ the Prophet.\" Dkt. 112-5 at 7 (Blackwell Dep. at 42-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Todero then stood up and walked onto the road. Dkt. 112-5 at 7-8 (Blackwell Dep. at 44-46). He initially stayed close to the curb as Officer Blackwell kept talking to him. Dkt. 112-5 at 9 (Blackwell Dep. at 50-51). As Mr. Todero kept walking-the parties dispute whether he veered away from the curb-Officer Blackwell pulled out his Taser, put his hand on Mr. Todero's shoulder, and ordered Mr. Todero to stop. Dkt. 112-5 at 9 (Blackwell Dep. at 51-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Mr. Todero took about two more steps, Officer Blackwell warned him that he would be tased, then tased him in the back from two or three feet away. Dkt. 112-5 at 9-10 (Blackwell Dep. at 53-55). Officer Blackwell continued to pull the Taser trigger and, after about the fourth time, placed the Taser on Mr. Todero's calf and deployed it again. Dkt. 112-5 at 11-15 (Blackwell Dep. at 59-75). By that time, Mr. Todero was flat on his face with his hands beneath him. Dkt. 112-5 at 11-15 (Blackwell Dep. at 59-75). Because Mr. Todero's hands were not behind his back, Officer Blackwell kept pulling the Taser trigger. Dkt. 112-5 at 15 (Blackwell Dep. at 74-75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officers Elliott and Laut arrived to find Mr. Todero with his hands underneath him, clutching the Bible. Dkt. 112-10 at 5 (Elliott Dep. at 122-23). To gain control of Mr. Todero's arms, Officer Elliott put her knee on his shoulder and tried to use a pressure point behind his ear. Dkt. 113-17 at 9 (Elliott Dep. at 160-61); dkt. 125-20 at 32-33 (Walters Dep. at 30-31). Officers Elliott and Laut both tried to pull Mr. Todero's arms behind his back. Dkt. 125-18 at 234-38 (Laut Dep.). Eventually, Officer Elliott took the Bible and, with Officer Laut, gained control of Mr. Todero's hands and handcuffed him. Dkt. 112-10 at 7 (Elliott Dep. at 129, 167); dkt. 112-9 at 9 (Laut Dep. at 263).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In total, Officer Blackwell's Taser logged sixteen discharges in four minutes, dkt. 125-15, though the parties dispute whether it worked properly for each discharge. Dkt. 131 at 16-17; dkt. 112-5 at 15\n   (Blackwell Dep. at 75); dkt. 112-8 at 2 (Holtzleiter Dep. at 22-25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officers Elliott and Laut arrived between the sixth and thirteenth discharges. Dkt. 112-5 at 18 (Blackwell Dep. at 86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When firefighters and paramedics arrived, Mr. Todero was lying on the ground. Dkt. 112-11 at 2, 7 (Godfrey Dep. at 25, 52). They lifted him onto a stretcher and put him in an ambulance, where they administered a sedative and took him to the hospital. Dkt. 112-11 at 2 (Godfrey Dep. at 25). Mr. Todero died in the hospital on June 11, 2016. Dkt. 112-12 at 2, 9 (Hartman Dep. at 16, 102-04).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Officer Blackwell's prior training and Taser use\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Blackwell completed a Taser refresher course in 2013 and another Taser training less than two years before his encounter with Mr. Todero, dkt. 113-1 at 4; dkt. 113-16 at 25-26 (Blackwell Dep. at 163-69), and may have been trained with a use-of-force policy that allowed Taser use in cases of \"[v]erbal non-compliance,\" dkt. 125-54 at 84-86 (Ison Dep. at 84-86). Before the encounter with Mr. Todero, Officer Blackwell had filed four use-of-force reports describing prior Taser uses on suspects in varying situations. Dkt. 125-68; dkt. 125-69; dkt. 125-70; dkt. 125-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural history\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Teresa Todero-Mr. Todero's mother and Special Administrator of his estate-brings this action alleging excessive force, failure to intervene, and conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. section 1983, and several Indiana-law claims. Dkt. 25. Officer Blackwell has moved for summary judgment on Ms. Todero's 42 U.S.C. section 1983 and Indiana-law claims. Dkt. 110. The City of Greenwood and Officers Elliott and Laut have moved for summary judgment on Ms. Todero's 42 U.S.C. section 1983,\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability, and Indiana-law claims.

The city's argument on the assault and battery claim hinges on winning its survival claim argument, dkt. 116 at 34, so the City of Greenwood is entitled to summary judgment on neither of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, the city argues that it is immune under Indiana Code section 34-13-3-3(8), which provides some immunity for law-enforcement activities.
