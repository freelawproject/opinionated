SHUBB, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This court must once again dispel the commonly held misconception that all American citizens are afforded the same rights of citizenship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dang\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:01-cv-1514 WBS DAD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202731911\">\n    2004 WL 2731911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 15, 2004). Through the denaturalization process, Congress has created two distinct classes of American citizens. The first class of citizens includes those whose mothers happened to be physically present in the United States, whether legally or illegally, at the moment they were born, and those whose parents were American citizens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   These citizens are forever secure in their citizenship. It can never be taken from them, no matter what they may have done in the past or what they may do in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The second class of citizens, and the focus of this case, consists of those individuals who acquire their citizenship through naturalization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201421\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   To even qualify for naturalization, an individual must meet a long list of criteria. They must wait at least five years after establishing permanent residency, pass a citizenship test, truthfully answer questions posed by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), be a person of good moral character, and swear allegiance to the Constitution. These requirements, unique to those applying for naturalization, demonstrate only the beginning of the substantial burdens this country places on these second-class citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Once a naturalized citizen completes this arduous process, their American citizenship still hangs in the balance, at the mercy of government officials. The government can always initiate proceedings to revoke a naturalized individual's citizenship if it believes that the naturalization was illegally procured or procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation. For instance, USCIS always asks a prospective citizen whether they have \"\n   <strong>\n    EVER\n   </strong>\n   committed ... a crime or offense for which [they] were\n   <strong>\n    NOT\n   </strong>\n   arrested.\" Form N-400, Application for Naturalization 14 (2016), online at https://www.uscis.gov/n-400\n   (last visited April 12, 2019) (emphasis in original). The scope of the question by itself is alarming and sets a trap for the unwary applicant. Given the thousands of possible offenses an individual can commit each day, no applicant can answer this question truthfully without jeopardizing their entire application and risking self-incrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OFFENSE, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining an offense as \"[a] violation of the law; a crime, often a minor one.\"). Nevertheless, a false answer gives the government nearly limitless leverage over the naturalized individual's citizenship. As the aforementioned question is often repeated during an individual's citizenship interview, the government can argue that such false testimony means that the individual never possessed the requisite good moral character for citizenship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(6). Or the government can simply claim that an untruthful answer caused the individual's naturalization to be illegally procured by concealment or willful misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201451\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   And this boundless discretion means that these second-class citizens can never feel entirely secure in their claim to American citizenship. As Chief Justice Roberts aptly observed, nothing stops the government from instituting these proceedings at any time, even some decades after a citizen is naturalized. Tr. of Oral Argument at 27-28,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201495528\">\n    2017 WL 1495528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Maslenjak v.

There is also no assurance that the government will always institute these proceedings fairly, as it may it may harbor any number of ulterior motives. For example, during the McCarthy Era, the government frequently sought to denaturalize citizen-members of the Communist Party in an attempt to suppress their political beliefs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chaunt v.

And once the government starts the denaturalization process, these civil proceedings are replete with procedural shortcomings given the important right at stake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cassandra Robertson &amp; Irina Manta,\n   <em>\n    (Un)Civil Denaturalization\n   </em>\n   , 94 N.Y.U. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2019) (manuscript at 49-54), https://bit.ly/2uMeBow (cataloguing the due process deficiencies of civil denaturalization). Defendants often do not have the right to a court-appointed attorney nor the money to hire one. It is within this unfortunate backdrop that this matter comes before the court as the defendant in this case, Christian Oribello Eguilos, is part of this second class of American citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Christian Eguilos is a native of the Philippines. (Compl. \u00b6 12 (Docket No. 1).) He became a permanent resident of this country on July 28, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In July 2013, defendant filed an application for naturalization with USCIS. (Compl. Ex. D (Docket No. 1-1).) As part of his application, which he signed under the penalty of perjury, defendant represented that he had not committed a crime or offense for which he had not been arrested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later, in October 2013, Isagani Acance, an immigration officer with USCIS, interviewed defendant concerning his eligibility for naturalization. (Compl. \u00b6 18.) During the interview and under oath, defendant again responded that he had not committed a crime or offense for which he had not been arrested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) USCIS subsequently approved defendant's naturalization application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Defendant\n   then signed the provided notice of a naturalization oath ceremony and indicated that he had not committed any crime or offense since his interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29; Compl. Ex. E.) On November 6, 2013, defendant took the oath of allegiance to become a citizen, and USCIS issued him a certificate of naturalization that same day. (Compl. \u00b6 32; Compl. Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fourteen months later, on January 2, 2015, the State of California filed a felony complaint charging defendant with fourteen counts of criminal offenses relating to the sexual abuse of minors. (Compl. Ex. C.) Later that year, pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled nolo contendere before the Los Angeles County Superior Court to four counts of forcible lewd acts upon a child in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 288(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. Ex. B.) The four counts covered conduct between January 2011 and December 2014. The Superior Court accepted defendant's plea, found him guilty on those four counts, sentenced him to forty years in prison, and ordered him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. (Compl. \u00b6 11; Compl. Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 22, 2018, the United States brought this action to revoke and set aside defendant's citizenship and cancel his certificate of naturalization under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201451\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The government's argument that it should be allowed to prove that defendant admits to the crime by getting him to admit to it in subsequent discovery in this case is unavailing.

It cannot rely upon facts that do not exist at the time the complaint is filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, because the government cannot rely upon defendant's conviction based upon his plea of nolo contendere, and acknowledges that it cannot allege that defendant admits to having committed a CIMT, Count One of the Complaint, based\n   upon Section 101(f)(3) of the INA, must be dismissed for that reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Moral Turpitude\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a separate and alternative ground for dismissal of Count One, as counterintuitive as it may seem to the layperson, the court must conclude that a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20288\">\n    Cal.

First, the panel concluded that the statute \"lacks the corrupt scienter requirement that is the touchstone of moral turpitude\" because the statute requires only sexual intent without a defense for good-faith reasonable mistake of age.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 473 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

The panel found that Section 288(c)(1) was not like other sex-related crimes involving moral turpitude.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Given these conclusions, the Ninth Circuit held that Section 288(c)(1) is not categorically a CIMT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 474.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because Section 288(b)(1) also borrows many of its elements from Section 288(a), the\n   <em>\n    Menendez\n   </em>\n   court's observations about its actus reus and mens rea requirements apply with equal force here. There are, however, two relevant differences between Section 288(b)(1) and Section 288(c)(1). First, Section 288(b)(1) slightly modifies the actus reus requirement because it adds the element that the defendant commits the proscribed act \"by use of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person.\" Second, Section 288(b)(1) covers minor-victims under the age of 14 years while Section 288(c)(1) covers only 14 or 15 year old minor-victims.

The government's complaint describes the circumstances surrounding defendant's naturalization interview. During his conversation with the USCIS officer, defendant represented that he had not committed a crime or offense for which he had not been arrested, and he never disclosed his sexual abuse of a minor. (Compl. \u00b6 20-25.) While the complaint merely asserts that defendant provided this allegedly false testimony to obtain an immigration benefit, a factfinder may infer such a subjective intent \"where a true answer might have jeopardized a naturalization application.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Usude v.

Cal. Jan. 23, 2018) (collecting cases). Here, accepting\n   all allegations as true, a true answer could have jeopardized defendant's naturalization application. Defendant's naturalization interview occurred almost immediately prior to USCIS' approval of his application. Admitting that he had sexually abused a child at such a late point in the process may have precluded a finding of good moral character and thus jeopardized his entire application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20316.10\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 316.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, although there may have been other reasons for defendant's failure to disclose his prior conduct, at least on the basis of the record before the court on this motion, a factfinder could conclude that defendant provided false testimony in order to prevent further inquiry into an alleged offense that no immigration official was aware of at the time and that defendant therefore possessed the requisite subjective intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant also urges the court to dismiss Count Three because it too relies on the inadmissible nolo contendere plea and resulting conviction.

First, the\n   government alleges that defendant misrepresented and concealed his sexual abuse of a child. (Compl. \u00b6 76.) Second, the government avers that that defendant did so voluntarily and deliberately when he stated that he had not committed any crime for which he had not been arrested, despite knowing that such a representation was false. (Compl. \u00b6 76.) Third, Exhibit A to the government's complaint, the affidavit of good cause submitted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Ky Bach, states that the criminal conduct was material because it would have had the natural tendency to influence USCIS in its decision whether to approve defendant's application. (Compl. Ex. A at 9.) Fourth, and finally, that same affidavit also asserts that concealing and misrepresenting the underlying criminal conduct affected the final naturalization decision as USCIS would not have approved defendant's application otherwise.

While the government's allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, defendant will not be precluded from presenting evidence on summary judgment or at trial, particularly on the issue of willfulness. Whether the broad scope of the questions asked to defendant during the naturalization process would have reasonably called for a confession to the crimes of which defendant was subsequently convicted, and motivation for his failure to reveal such conduct are certainly proper subjects for later inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that defendant's Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 20) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED IN PART.
