(\"NRDC\") brings this action against the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   The NRDC's amended complaint asserts three causes of action: The first alleges that the EPA violated FOIA by failing to respond to the NRDC's FOIA request seeking (1) records about the EPA's website-retention policies and (2) records instructing EPA staff to remove specific material from the EPA website. The second and third causes of action, in contrast, challenge the EPA's policy or practice of threatening to treat a FOIA request as \"voluntarily withdrawn\" if the EPA concludes that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought and the requester does not respond to an email from the EPA within ten days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11 at 1-2 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4-5). The second cause of action raises that challenge under FOIA itself, and the third raises the challenge under the APA. The EPA has now released records responsive to the FOIA request to the NRDC's satisfaction, Dkt. 28 at 2, leaving only the second and third causes of action for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are currently before the Court. Dkt. 15; Dkt. 20. For the reasons explained below, the Court first concludes that the NRDC has Article III standing to bring its policy or practice claim. Neither party, however, has addressed whether the NRDC's alleged injury is sufficient to sustain this Court's statutory jurisdiction under FOIA to grant injunctive relief and, if so, whether the alleged injury is sufficient to support entry of the injunction that the NRDC seeks. The Court will, accordingly, deny the EPA's motion for summary judgment with respect to the NRDC's Article III standing, and will deny both the EPA's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and the NRDC's cross-motion for summary judgment on the merits without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The NRDC alleges that, shortly after President Trump took office, numerous\n   agencies-including the EPA-\"began purging information about important public health and environmental issues from their websites.\" Dkt. 11 at 1 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2). To obtain information about this activity, the NRDC submitted a FOIA request to the EPA seeking:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. All records setting forth general policy or guidance for EPA staff to apply when determining whether to remove information, documents, or webpages from an EPA website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. All records from January 20, 2017 through the present instructing EPA staff within the Office of Public Affairs to remove specific information, documents, or webpages from any EPA website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dkt. 20-4 at 18 (\"Website Request\"). The EPA did not respond to the request for nearly three months. Dkt. 11 at 2 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Finally, on June 14, 2017, the EPA sent the NRDC an email stating that the request was \"not a proper FOIA request\" because it did not \"reasonably describe the records sought as required by both the FOIA statute and the [EPA's] regulations.\" Dkt. 20-4 at 31. The email further explained that, \"[i]n order for [the EPA] to process your request, you should 'include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter,\" and that, \"[i]f known, you should include any file designations or descriptions for the records that you want.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The email then observed that, \"following the 2017 Presidential inauguration, the agency received numerous FOIA requests regarding historic versions of the EPA website\" and that, \"[t]o respond to these requests for information, [the] EPA ha[d] reposted a snapshot of the EPA website as it existed on January 19, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the passage at the core of the present dispute, the EPA added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The information provided in the January 19, 2017 Web Snapshot may provide the information you seek. If it does not, please reply back to me within 10 days of the date of this correspondence so that we may assist in clarifying [the Website Request] as a proper request.\n   <em>\n    If we do not hear back from you by that date, we will consider your request voluntarily withdrawn.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nine days later, the NRDC replied to the EPA's June 14, 2017 email, making three points. First, it disagreed with the EPA's conclusion that the Website Request failed reasonably to describe the records sought and was thus \" 'not a proper FOIA request.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting EPA June 14, 2017 email). The NRDC observed that FOIA does not require \"that a requester identify the date, title, author, recipient, and subject matter of records requested\" and that when, as here, the FOIA requester lacks that information, \"it is incumbent upon the agency to determine who within the agency might possess the necessary information to design and to conduct a reasonable search.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 162 (1974)). Second, the NRDC explained that the EPA's January 19, 2017 snapshot of its website was not responsive to the NRDC's FOIA request, which sought guidelines and instructions regarding the removal of material posted on the EPA's website.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the NRDC declined \"to 'voluntarily withdraw' its request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The NRDC asserted that \"there is no basis under FOIA for [the] EPA to deem a request 'voluntarily withdrawn' based on non-response to an [email], particularly on an arbitrarily short ten-calendar-day deadline,\" nor can an agency \"use FOIA's 'reasonably describes' requirement 'to obstruct public access to agency records.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-854, at 162).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The NRDC filed the present suit three days later, on June 26, 2017, seeking to compel the EPA to disclose all nonexempt responsive records. Dkt. 1 at 5 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-27). It amended its complaint on August 9, 2017, adding challenges under FOIA and the APA to the EPA's policy or practice of threatening to deem FOIA requests \"voluntarily withdrawn\" based on a requester's failure to respond to an email within ten days. Dkt. 11 at 10-11 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-51). Meanwhile, also on August 9, 2017, the EPA sent the NDRC another email, updating it on the EPA's \"search for records responsive to its FOIA request.\" Dkt. 20-4 at 38. With respect to the NRDC's request for \"records setting general policy or guidance for EPA staff to apply when determining whether to remove information, documents, or webpages from an EPA website,\" the EPA directed the NRDC to three online links to the relevant policies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, with respect to the NRDC's request for \"records from January 20, 2017 through the present instructing EPA staff within the Office of Public Affairs to remove specific information, documents, or webpages from any EPA website,\" the EPA \"interpreted th[e] request\" to seek \"any email or other written instruction or communication instructing relevant individuals within the Office of Environmental Information or the Office of Public Affairs to remove\" the information at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The email further indicated that the agency had identified \"10 management level individuals\" who might have responsive records, along with relevant search terms, the number of items retrieved, and one possible way to narrow the request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 4, the NRDC and the EPA filed a joint stipulation setting a schedule for the EPA to produce nonexempt records responsive to the Website Request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14 (Joint Stip. &amp; Prop. Order), which this Court subsequently approved,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17. The parties then notified the Court on May 23, 2018 that the EPA had released records responsive to the Website Request and that the NRDC did \"not intend to challenge the adequacy of [the] EPA's disclosures.\" Dkt. 28 at 1. As a result, \"[t]he parties ... agree[d] that further proceedings on the merits of Count [One] are unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20500\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The NRDC, however, continues to challenge the EPA's policy or practice of threatening to deem FOIA requests as \"voluntarily withdrawn\" if (1) the agency concludes on an initial review that the request does not \"reasonably describe\" the records sought and so notifies the requester, and (2) the requester fails to contact the EPA within ten days regarding the asserted deficiency in the request. According to the NRDC, \"[c]ounting the Website Request, [the] EPA has levied this threat against at least six NRDC FOIA requests since April 2016,\" and \"[n]umerous other individuals and groups have received nearly identical respond-or-else ultimatums from various EPA officials during that time.\" Dkt. 20-1 at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20-2 at 4-8 (Pl.'s Statement Undisputed Material Facts (\"PSUMF\") \u00b6\u00b6 15-31); Dkt. 20-4 (Knicley Decl. Exs. F, I-W). The NRDC seeks a declaration that the EPA's practice of threatening to treat a FOIA request as \"voluntarily withdrawn\" unless the requester contacts the agency within ten days violates FOIA, and it seeks an injunction barring the EPA from continuing to engage in that practice. The EPA, for its part, does not dispute that it engages in this practice but contends that the NRDC lacks standing to challenge it and that, even if the NRDC has Article III standing, the practice constitutes a lawful exercise of the EPA's discretion to implement FOIA in a reasonable manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The EPA's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment and the\n   NRDC's cross-motion for summary judgment are currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The EPA seeks summary judgment on the ground that the NRDC lacks standing to bring its policy or practice claims and, alternatively, if the Court concludes that the NRDC has standing, it moves to dismiss Counts Two and Three for failure to state a claim. The NRDC disagrees with both arguments and cross-moves for summary judgment on its FOIA challenge to the EPA's practice of sending FOIA requesters emails threatening to treat their requests as \"voluntarily withdrawn\" if the requester does not respond to the EPA within ten days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A motion for summary judgment assesses whether the moving party is entitled to prevail in light of the undisputed facts. The moving party is entitled to summary judgment under Rule 56 if she can \"show[ ] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [that she] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The party seeking summary judgment \"bears the initial responsibility\" of \"identifying those portions\" of the record that \"demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

As explained below, the Court concludes that the NRDC has identified an injury-in-fact that it is likely to suffer in the future in the absence of relief, although that injury is, even by the NRDC's own measure, a \"modest\" one. Dkt. 20-1 at 21. The parties, however, fail to address whether that injury-or any other injury that the NRDC is likely to suffer absent judicial relief-is sufficient to sustain this Court's\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction under FOIA to grant injunctive relief and whether it is sufficient to support issuance of the injunction that the NRDC seeks. The Court will, accordingly, deny the EPA's motion for summary judgment with respect to the NRDC's Article III standing, and will deny both the EPA's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and the NRDC's cross-motion for summary judgment on the merits without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In challenging the NRDC's standing, the EPA focuses on the first element: injury-in-fact. That focus makes sense. As both parties recognize, if the injury that the NRDC asserts constitutes an injury-in-fact, there is little doubt that it is caused by the challenged practice and that an injunction barring the EPA from continuing that practice would redress the harm. The dispositive question, accordingly, is whether compelling the NRDC to respond to a request for clarification within ten days, on pain of \"voluntary withdrawal\" of its FOIA request and the attendant uncertainty that comes with that, is sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To establish that it has suffered an injury-in-fact, the NRDC must identify \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).

Supp. 2d 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280 (D.D.C. 2012). That holding gives effect to the introductory clause of \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), which triggers the 20-day period \"upon a request for records made under paragraph ... (3) of ... subsection [552(a) ]\" of FOIA, which in turn requires a request that \"reasonably describes\" the records sought. But, if construed in this\n   manner, it is unclear what work the tolling provision would perform; because \u00a7 552(a)(3) not only requires that the request \"reasonably describe\" the records sought, but also requires compliance \"with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed\" in seeking agency records, it is difficult to imagine what request for additional \"information\" might trigger the tolling provision if the clock does not even begin to run until the requester has fully complied with \u00a7 552(a)(3). For purposes of resolving the EPA's challenge to the NRDC's Article III standing, however, the Court need not decide whether a FOIA request that fails to reasonably describe the records sought merely permits tolling while the ambiguity is resolved or does not even trigger the 20-day clock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In light of this statutory framework, the parties agree that agencies like the EPA are entitled to obtain clarification of requests that do not \"reasonably describe\" the records sought and that the 20-day clock does not run while the agency does so. As a result, the delay stemming from any such request for clarification is not the focus of the NRDC's argument. Rather, according to the NRDC, it meets the test for injury-in-fact because the EPA's \"voluntary withdrawal\" practice presents the organization with a \"Hobson's choice,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286049\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/898/233/#p280\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 20: On the one hand, if it \"does not respond\" to the EPA within ten days, \"it will not get the records it has requested and\" will need \"to resubmit its request or seek to challenge the 'voluntary withdrawal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. On the other hand, if it acts promptly \"to protect its FOIA request,\" it will be required to \"divert time and resources to respond to [the] EPA within the agency's extrastatutory ten-day deadline.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. In support of this theory of standing, the NRDC's Chief Counsel attests that \"the burden of responding to [the] EPA's request for clarification may be modest in terms of staff hours spent, [but] it is not immaterial.\" Dkt. 20-3 at 3 (Bernard Decl. \u00b6 10). \"The responsible NRDC staff member must first evaluate [the] EPA's often-conclusory claim that clarification is necessary,\" and, \"[i]f she concludes that the request needs or could benefit from clarification, she must then determine how to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"[A]ll of this,\" moreover, \"must be completed within the short time frame [the] EPA provides, on pain of a 'voluntary'-but not truly voluntary-withdrawal of the request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the NRDC's Chief Counsel, \"[t]he lack of clarity as to what it means for a request to be 'voluntarily withdrawn' \" means that the NRDC will \"almost always\" take this second route and will comply with the EPA's deadline rather than risk \"voluntary withdrawal.\" Dkt. 20-3 at 3-4 (Bernard Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Importantly, the NRDC does not argue that the EPA's requests for clarification unlawfully delay the agency's issuance of determination letters or the release of responsive records. To be sure, the NRDC posits-with some basis-that the EPA's determination that the Website Request did not reasonably describe the records sought was wrong, and, indeed, it contends that the EPA's invocation of the reasonably-describes requirement is \"baseless\" in \"many, if not most, cases.\" Dkt. 20-1 at 23 n.7. But it also acknowledges that it has not pressed that issue here and that whether the EPA is engaged in a practice of abusing \"the 'reasonably describes' standard is an issue for another case.\" Dkt. 27 at 8 n.4. Similarly, although the\n   NRDC might plausibly contend that, by waiting almost two months before even seeking clarification regarding the Website Request, the EPA ran afoul of FOIA's 20-day clock; tolling, if applicable, requires a \"request ... for information,\" which in this case did not come until after 20 days had passed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(a)(ii)(I). Again, however, that is not the practice that the NRDC challenges in this action and is not the injury that it invokes in support of its claim of standing. Finally, as noted above, the NRDC does not contend that it has suffered or will continue to suffer an \"injury from the fact that [the] EPA-as required under FOIA in appropriate circumstances ...-reaches out for clarification.\" Dkt. 27 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Rather, the injury that the NRDC invokes is the EPA's \"mandate for urgency,\" Dkt. 20-3 at 4 (Bernard Decl. \u00b6 11), imposed by its \"chosen administrative process, which demands a response within ten days on threat of 'voluntary withdrawal,' \" Dkt. 27 at 9. According to the NRDC, \"even if [the] EPA threatened to deny a request-rather than deem it 'voluntarily withdrawn'-a ten calendar-day deadline for clarification would still violate FOIA.\" Dkt. 20-1 at 30. And the combination of that threat, along with the \"lack of clarity as to what rights [the] NRDC would have if [the] EPA ultimately deemed an NRDC FOIA request 'voluntarily withdrawn' \" instead of denying it, has forced, and will continued to force, the \"NRDC to divert time and resources to respond to [the] EPA emails within the [unreasonably short] time allotted.\" Dkt. 20-2 at 9 (PSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 39-40). In other words, the NRDC contends that the EPA's threat to treat a FOIA request as \"voluntarily withdrawn\" if the NRDC does not rapidly reply to the EPA's inquiry affects how the NRDC allocates its time and resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The EPA responds that \"[t]he only 'pressure' applied to [the NRDC]\" by the challenged practice is \"to make a simple telephone call\" or otherwise to contact the EPA \"and [to] have [an exchange] about its request.\" Dkt. 25 at 2-3. Although the NRDC has the right to file FOIA requests as \"it sees fit,\" the EPA continues, \"it should then expect, in accordance with the [a]gency's regulations, that the [a]gency will contact [the NRDC] to request further clarification, and that [the NRDC] may need to devote some amount of time and resources to assisting the [a]gency in locating the records [the NRDC] seeks,\" presumably on whatever schedule the agency dictates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Without questioning the plaintiff's Article III standing, the Court of Appeals held that \" \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) does not authorize district courts to order publication of such documents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049963,3695069\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1191/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court explained its decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   While it might seem strange for Congress to command agencies to \"currently publish\" or \"promptly publish\" documents, without in the same statute providing courts with power to order publication, we think that is exactly what Congress intended. Section 552(a)(4)(B) authorizes district courts to order the \"production\" of agency documents, not \"publication.\" The question, then, is whether Congress intended \"production\" to include \"publication.\" The dictionary does not resolve the matter ... We think it significant, however, that \u00a7 554(a)(4)(A) is aimed at relieving the injury suffered by the individual complainant, not by the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049963,3695069\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1191/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9049963,3695069\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1191/\">\n    at 1202-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts and question presented in\n   <em>\n    Kennecott Utah Copper Corp\n   </em>\n   . are, of course, entirely different from those at issue here. But the decision does demonstrate that the words of \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A) matter, and that the district courts do not have equitable power to enjoin any violation of FOIA without regard for any statutory grant of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, the NRDC fails to distinguish the injury required to support Article III standing from the type of injury required to support a policy or practice injunction. Even accepting the NRDC's contention that the inherent powers of a court of equity are not moored by \u00a7 552(a)(4)(A) or by a need to remedy an agency's failure promptly to release nonexempt agency records, equity itself requires far more than Article III standing to support an injunctive decree. \"According to well-established principles of equity, a\n   plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must satisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such relief.\"\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.

Those factors include proof that the plaintiff will suffer an irreparable injury, that it lacks an adequate remedy at law, that the balance of hardships tip in favor of injunctive relief, and \"that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276206\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/388/#p391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Irreparable injury, in turn, requires more than the \"identifiable trifle\" sufficient to sustain Article III standing.

It may decide to rely instead on its APA claim and its request for declaratory relief, neither of which it has pressed to date. But until the parties have had the opportunity to address these questions-including the questions whether the Court has statutory jurisdiction to entertain the NRDC's policy or practice claim and whether injunctive or similar relief is appropriate in these circumstances-the Court cannot resolve this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 15, is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED,\n   </strong>\n   and Defendant's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 15, and Plaintiff's cross-motion for summary judgment, Dkt. 20, are hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Moreover, because the EPA does not dispute that the filing of a FOIA request triggers the 20-day clock unless tolled pursuant to \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A), the Court need not reach this issue for the purposes of resolving the EPA's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    This showing is sufficient to establish standing to challenge the 10-day requirement. It is less clear that it would be sufficient to establish standing to bring a stand-alone challenge to the EPA's practice of deeming certain FOIA requests as \"voluntarily withdrawn.\" The NRDC's asserted injury is, at least on the present record, based almost entirely on the EPA's timeline, as opposed to the actual consequences of failing to meet that timeline.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 20-3 at 3 (Bernard Decl. \u00b6 9). In other words, the only concrete injury that the NRDC proffers is the reallocation of resources caused by the timeline. It does not, for example, contend that the EPA has ever had reason to deem one of the NRDC's FOIA requests as \"voluntarily withdrawn\" or that the NRDC intends to risk \"voluntary withdrawal\" by not responding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Although the NRDC cites district court cases in support of its contention that the Court may exercise jurisdiction over claims seeking to \" 'remedy[ ] procedural violations' connected to an agency's processing of FOIA requests,\" Dkt. 20-1 at 36 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Sec.
