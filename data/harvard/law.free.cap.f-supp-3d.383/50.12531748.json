FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Thomas Franchini (\"Franchini\") is a board-certified podiatrist living in East Greenwhich, Rhode Island, who has been practicing medicine for twenty-seven years. This case arises from four news articles discussing Franchini's work as a podiatrist with the Department of Veterans Affairs at the VA Maine Healthcare System at Togus, in Augusta, Maine (\"VA Togus\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Franchini worked at VA Togus between 2004 and 2010. Franchini began his career as a surgical podiatrist with the United States Navy in 1992.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   From 2002 to 2003, Franchini worked as a clinical professor at the Fletcher Allen Medical Center in Burlington, Vermont. Franchini conducted or participated in approximately 4,900 surgeries prior to 2004 \"without any tort claim or claim of sub-standard care or performance against him.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After joining the medical staff at VA Togus, Franchini performed approximately 580 surgeries as part of that employment. Simultaneous to his association with VA Togus, Franchini worked at Maine Medical Center and Mercy Hospital in Portland, Maine. For these latter two employers, Franchini performed approximately ninety-five surgeries \"without any tort claim or claim of sub-standard care or performance against him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Around April 2010, VA Togus reviewed Franchini's note-taking and preparation of medical records, criticized him for \"the brevity of his procedure notes,\" and asked him to cease performing surgeries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Franchini later resigned from VA Togus on November 8, 2010. At that time, the only investigation pending against Franchini was related to his notes. Then, between 2010 and 2011, VA Togus \"raised issues\" with twenty-five procedures Franchini performed or participated in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) However, a group of independent podiatrists reviewed these procedures and found them to be appropriate. Since 2012, VA Togus and its representatives have accused Franchini of numerous instances of sub-standard performance from his time there. Franchini, an experienced physician, claims that all such allegations are \"false\" and \"baseless.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beginning in October 2017, a number of media outlets and journalists published articles discussing the VA's allegations about Franchini \"without conducting appropriate inquiry or investigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) First, on October 1, 2017, MTM Acquisition, Inc. and Edward Murphy (together, \"MTM Defendants\") published an article in the\n   <em>\n    Portland Press Herald\n   </em>\n   entitled \"Maine Veterans\n   Given Substandard Care are Told It's Too Late to Sue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) The article begins by discussing a number of lawsuits against the VA in which veterans describe alleged ailments they have suffered from since being treated by Franchini. (MTM Defendants' Ex. A (ECF No. 18-1), PageID # 149-150.) It then notes that \"Franchini is still a licensed podiatrist, even though he resigned from the VA after the agency told him to step down or he would be fired in early 2010, according to ... a spokesman for the VA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID # 151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 11, 2017, Gannett Company, Inc. and Donovan Slack (together, \"Gannett Defendants\") published an article in\n   <em>\n    USAToday\n   </em>\n   entitled \"VA Conceals Shoddy Care and Health Workers' Mistakes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) In that article, Slack wrote that \"[i]n 88 cases, the VA concluded that Franchini made mistakes that harmed veterans\" and that \"[a]gency leaders didn't fire Franchini or report him ... they let him quietly resign.\" (Gannett Defendants' Ex. A (ECF No. 24-1), PageID # 177.) Slack also wrote that \"Franchini had resigned while under investigation ... and VA officials had been examining hundreds of his former patients' cases\" as well as that \"the VA placed Franchini on leave after finding problems with a small sample of his cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID # 178.) Then, on October 27, 2017, Bangor Publishing Company, Inc. and Meg Haskell (together, \"Bangor Defendants\") published an article entitled \"Vet Harmed at Togus.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 32.) Therein, according to the Amended Complaint, Haskell wrote that the VA \"forced\" Franchini out, \"88 vets ... suffered under the care of ... Franchini,\" Franchini had \"botched\" certain procedures performed on Jim Barrows, and that Franchini had subsequently \"realized\" that he made an error/errors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lastly, on December 22, 2017, Investor's Business Daily, Inc. (\"IBD\") and Sally Pipes published an article entitled \"VA Negligence is Killing Veterans\" in the\n   <em>\n    Investor's Business Daily.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) In the article, Pipes wrote that \"Franchini botched 88 procedures\" and \"severed a patient's tendon during one surgery and failed to successfully fuse one woman's ankle in another.\" (IBD's Ex. 2 (ECF No. 17-2), PageID # 122). She continued that \"Franchini wasn't fired for any of these errors. Instead, the VA allowed him to resign and return to private practice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his Amended Complaint, Franchini alleges that all the just-quoted statements \"expressly and implicitly misstated the content\" of the \"reportage\" upon which they were purportedly based, and that they are all false. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 40, 46, 52.) He claims both presumed damages and actual damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   All Defendants join in raising multiple arguments for the dismissal of Plaintiff's defamation claims (Counts I, II, III, and IV) and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims (Count VI). The Gannett Defendants have also raised arguments for dismissal of Plaintiff's negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation claims (Count V). Lastly, IBD moves to dismiss pursuant to Maine's Anti-SLAPP statute, 14 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 556. The Court addresses each of these bases for dismissal in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defamation (Counts I-IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In Maine, the basic elements of a defamation claim are: \"(a) a false and defamatory statement concerning another; (b) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (c) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher; and (d) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence\n   of special harm caused by the publication.\"\n   <em>\n    Cole v. Chandler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11513369\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/752/1189/#p1193\">\n    752 A.2d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1193 (Me. 2000). Defendants' arguments for dismissal of Plaintiff's defamation claims fall into three basic categories: (1) Plaintiff is constitutionally required to plausibly allege actual malice but has failed to do so; (2) Plaintiff fails to isolate actionable statements by Defendants because the statements he claims to be defamatory are either substantially true or opinions; (3) various privileges protect Defendants' publications. The Court considers each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Actual malice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Due to the inherent free speech implications of defamation actions, the federal constitution imposes various \"requirements ... independent of those established by the state's own law.\"\n   <em>\n    Veilleux v. Nat'l Broadcasting Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453218\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/92/#p108\">\n    206 F.3d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108 (1st Cir. 2000). For example, where a court determines that the plaintiff is a public official or public figure, or that the speech at issue addresses a matter of public concern, the constitutional actual malice standard comes into play.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish actual malice, the plaintiff must show that the speaker made the allegedly defamatory statement \"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\"\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p280\">\n    376 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p280\">\n    84 S.Ct. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p280\">\n    11 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964). Defendants first assert that the actual malice standard applies here because Plaintiff is a public official or limited public figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In general, public officials are those individuals who hold the kind of public office \"with 'substantial responsibility for or control over the conduct of governmental affairs.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mandel v.

In determining public official status, courts take into account: \"(i) the extent to which the inherent attributes of a position define it as one of influence over issues of public importance; (ii) the position's special access to the media as a means of self-help; and (iii) the risk of diminished privacy assumed upon taking the position.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167317\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/75/#p85\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167317\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/75/#p85\">\n    at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (Count VI) (\"NIED\")\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges negligent infliction of emotional distress against all Defendants. There appear to be two factual predicates underlying these claims: (1) the defamatory articles caused Plaintiff emotional distress; and (2) the Gannett Defendants' misrepresentation caused Plaintiff emotional distress. As Defendants point out, the facts as pleaded do not support separate claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Under Maine law, emotional distress claims cannot be premised solely on allegedly defamatory statements.\n   <em>\n    Veilleux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453218\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/92/#p108\">\n    206 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   129 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rippett v.

Thus, to the extent Plaintiff bases his NIED claims on statements in Defendants' various articles, such claims are subsumed into his defamation claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7346588\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/82/#p87\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The only possible exception to this conclusion is Plaintiff's NIED claim premised on the Gannett Defendants' misrepresentation. However, this claim fails as a matter of law for two separate reasons. First, to allow emotional distress recovery based on misrepresentation would render meaningless Maine's rule that misrepresentation torts only permit the recovery of pecuniary damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7346588\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/82/#p87\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7346588\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/82/#p87\">\n    at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Maine only permits recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress where the defendant has a \"special duty of care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7346588\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/82/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The First Circuit, interpreting Maine law, has explicitly held that journalists do not owe their subjects a special duty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7346588\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/82/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7346588\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/672/82/#p87\">\n    at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Negligent and Fraudulent Misrepresentation (Count V)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As noted above, in Count V, Plaintiff asserts claims of negligent and fraudulent representation against the Gannett Defendants only. Specifically, he alleges that he agreed to be interviewed for the Gannett Defendants' article on the condition that they would not identify the location\n   of his then-current employment in their publication. He also alleges that: the Gannett Defendants represented their agreement to this condition before and during the interview; that he relied on these representations; that the representations were false; and that the article ultimately included the location of his employment. Construing the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court also reads it as alleging that Plaintiff's employer later terminated him, thereby causing him pecuniary harm, because the article disclosed the location of that employment. The Gannett Defendants contend that these claims should be dismissed because Plaintiff has not adequately pleaded proximate causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To plead claims for negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must present facts demonstrating, among other things, that the defendant made a \"false representation of present fact,\" and that the Plaintiff incurred pecuniary harm because of justifiable reliance on that false representation.\n   <em>\n    Packgen v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gannett Defendants' Mot., PageID # 173.) Rather, citing\n   <em>\n    Veilleux v.

In\n   <em>\n    Veilleux\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit explained that, in Maine, \"the proper measure of damages for a misrepresentation claim is plaintiff's lost bargain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453218\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/92/#p108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, that means Plaintiff must establish that his pecuniary loss was caused by the difference between the represented publication (no employment location) and the actual publication (with employment location).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453218\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/92/#p108\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court reads Plaintiff's Amended Complaint as pleading this type of pecuniary loss.

In\n   <em>\n    Gaudette v.

The Law Court then concluded that where \"the newspaper was documenting current events\" and did not express its own views as to how the government should address those events, it was not engaging in petitioning activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the instant case, the Court reaches the same conclusion as to IBD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The article at issue here is essentially a news report recounting recent failings at the VA and does not articulate any of IBD's views. Thus, the Court does not interpret the article as IBD petitioning on its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   behalf.

With respect to the MTM Defendants, the Amended Complaint asserts, \"[t]he article stated that Franchini had performed in a substandard or negligent fashion with respect to certain procedure(s) performed or participated in respecting April Wood, Kenneth Myrick, Timothy Mansir, and Mark Prescott and others and/or that the VA had so determined.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 39. This assertion does not adequately identify specific statements in the article that Plaintiff believes convey this message. The Court does not foreclose the possibility that Plaintiff might later be allowed to amend his operative complaint to identify the specific statements he is referring to. At this point, however, Count II survives only as to Plaintiff's allegation that the MTM Defendants defamed him related to the statement that he was told to \"step down or he would be fired\" in 2010.

Absent the context of the Bangor Defendants' article, the Court cannot discern whether this statement implies that the VA acted based on perceived misconduct. Similar statements from the other articles, indicating that the VA took disciplinary actions against Plaintiff, all imply that the VA acted in part because Plaintiff provided sub-standard care.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    This category includes the statements that: \"the agency told him to step down or he would be fired,\" in the MTM Defendants' article; \"[a]gency leaders didn't fire Franchini or report him ... they let him quietly resign,\" \"Franchini had resigned while under investigation ... and VA officials had been examining hundreds of his former patients' cases,\" and \"the VA placed Franchini on leave after finding problems with a small sample of his cases\" in the Gannett Defendants' article; and \"Franchini wasn't fired for any of these errors.

Even assuming some of the allegedly defamatory statements bear resemblance to statements made as part of other judicial proceedings before this District, as Defendants argue, the Court cannot infer that any of the articles were based on those statements at this Rule 12 stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    To the extent Plaintiff seeks punitive damages on this claim, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has not pleaded facts demonstrating that the Gannett Defendants acted with common-law \"malice.\"\n    <em>\n     Tuttle v.

To the extent this Order dismisses Plaintiff's claims for presumed damages under Counts I-IV, his claims for punitive damages against the Gannett Defendants, and Count VI, the Court concludes any amendment would be futile.
