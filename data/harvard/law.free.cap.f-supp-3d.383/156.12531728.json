HELLERSTEIN, U.S.D.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This action by ten plaintiffs-Zoe Brock, Caitlin Dulany, Louisette Geiss, Larissa Gomes, Katherine Kendall, Nannette Klatt, Melissa Sagemiller, Sarah Ann Thomas, Melissa Thompson, and Jane Doe-individually and on behalf of a class, against Harvey Weinstein (\"H. Weinstein\"), his former companies, and certain officers and directors of those companies, charges that H. Weinstein sexually harassed\n   and assaulted them between 1993 and 2011, and that the other defendants knew of, facilitated, and covered up his misconduct. Defendants move to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") contains eighteen counts, including four federal claims for violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (\"TVPA\") (Counts I and II) and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\") (Counts V and VI), and fourteen state claims for negligent supervision and retention (Counts III and IV), battery (Counts VII and VIII), assault (Counts IX and X), false imprisonment (Counts XI and XII), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Counts XIII and XIV), negligent infliction of emotional distress (Counts XV and XVI), and ratification (Counts XVII and XVIII). The state law claims fall into two categories: (i) allegations against Miramax Film NY LLC (\"Miramax\"); The Walt Disney Company, Disney Enterprises, Inc., Buena Vista International, Inc. (together, \"Disney\"); and certain officers of these companies (together with Miramax and Disney, the \"Miramax Defendants\") for conduct occurring before September 30, 2005; and (ii) allegations against The Weinstein Company Holdings, LLC (\"TWC\") and certain officers and directors of TWC (together with TWC, the \"TWC Defendants\") for conduct occurring after September 30, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (ECF Nos. 199, 239, 241, 246, and 254). For the reasons discussed below, H. Weinstein's motion to dismiss the TVPA claim against him (Count I) is denied. All other claims (Counts II-XVIII) are dismissed against all defendants, including H. Weinstein: the TVPA participation claims (Count II) fail to allege receipt of a benefit from participation in sex trafficking, the RICO claims (Counts V and VI) fail to allege injury to business or property caused by a RICO violation, and the state law claims (Counts III, IV, VII-XVIII) are untimely under the applicable statutes of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Weinstein and his brother, Robert Weinstein (\"R. Weinstein\"), co-founded Miramax in the late 1970s. FAC \u00b6 60. Miramax grew from a small film-distribution company to become, by 1989, \"the most successful independent [film] studio in America.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60. In 1993, the Weinstein brothers sold Miramax to Disney for $ 80 million and retained their leadership of Miramax following the acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. Miramax released its first blockbuster film,\n   <em>\n    Pulp Fiction\n   </em>\n   , in 1994.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. Many of the company's subsequent films achieved great commercial and critical success.

Their new company, TWC, had its own run of major film and television successes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC, Ex. A. In the wake of the revelations concerning H. Weinstein's alleged misconduct, TWC filed for bankruptcy. FAC \u00b6 758.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   H. Weinstein's success put him among the most powerful and influential executives in the entertainment industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. That power and influence included the \"ability to make or break ... careers,\" which he allegedly used to abuse and silence numerous young women who sought his help in advancing their careers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Weinstein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. In the wake of the article's publication, four TWC board members resigned and the board voted to terminate H. Weinstein's services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 433-437. Subsequent reporting, most notably in\n   <em>\n    The New York Times\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    The New Yorker\n   </em>\n   , described a pattern of sexual assaults and cover-ups by H.

Plaintiffs' Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that H. Weinstein's \"predatory and sexually harassing behavior toward women,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84, followed a consistent pattern: H. Weinstein set up meetings with women under the guise of assisting them with their careers, isolated them after they had arrived for the meetings, and assaulted, battered, or attempted to assault them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89-91. H. Weinstein allegedly threatened and/or caused harm to the careers of women who refused his advances, including by having them \"blacklisted.\" The FAC further alleges that certain employees of Miramax, Disney, and TWC had knowledge of and, in some cases, facilitated or covered up Weinstein's misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Six plaintiffs-Katherine Kendall, Nannette Klatt, Caitlin Dulany, Zoe Brock, Larissa Gomes, and Melissa Sagemiller (together, the \"Miramax Subclass\")-allege that H.

Nannette Klatt\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 1993 or 1994, Klatt had an interview for an audition on the first floor of a building also occupied by Miramax. FAC \u00b6 93. H. Weinstein walked past the room where Klatt was interviewing and asked her interviewer to step outside.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94. The interviewer returned and told Klatt that H. Weinstein wanted to meet with her in his office about a role in a film he was working on.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95. At their meeting that night, H. Weinstein had Klatt read from a script, told her she would get the part, and told her he might have other projects for her as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97. At the end of the meeting, Weinstein asked to see Klatt's breasts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. When Klatt refused, H. Weinstein became enraged, told her she would \"never work again,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99, and \"corralled her\" into a dark stairwell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100. Klatt alleges that she suffered emotional and physical distress, and lost the part H. Weinstein had offered, other opportunities at Miramax and TWC, and other professional opportunities as a result of the incident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Katherine Kendall\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In 1993, Kendall met H. Weinstein about parts in two Miramax movies, which H. Weinstein told her she would get.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103. After the meeting, H. Weinstein invited\n   Kendall to a movie screening and told her he would introduce her to other people there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104. Instead, H. Weinstein took Kendall to a public movie theater, \"bullied\" Kendall into coming up to his apartment after the movie, trapped her, and attempted to assault her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 107-113. H. Weinstein called Kendall several times after the assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114. Kendall was traumatized by the assault and had to \"remove herself completely from the entertainment industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 115. In the summer of 2017, Kendall was contacted by agents of H. Weinstein as part of an attempt to surveil her and other \"targets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 116-124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Caitlin Dulany\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In 1996, approximately two months after Dulany rejected an attempt by H. Weinstein to seduce her in her apartment, H. Weinstein invited Dulany to the premier of a Miramax film, followed by a benefit dinner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135. After the dinner, H. Weinstein's assistant told Dulany there was a car outside waiting to take her to the after-party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 136. Instead, Dulany ended up alone with H. Weinstein in his hotel room, where he imprisoned and sexually assaulted her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 138-139. Dulany alleges that she experienced personal and professional problems as a result of the assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 146-150.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Zoe Brock\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In 1998, H. Weinstein, accompanied by Rick Schwartz of Miramax, sat next to Brock at a group dinner at which Fabrizio Lombardo, another Miramax employee, was also present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 153. After the dinner, H. Weinstein, Schwartz, and Lombardo separated Brock from her agent and friends, and took her to Weinstein's hotel room for a drink.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 155. Shortly thereafter, Schwartz and Lombardo left the hotel room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   H. Weinstein attempted to assault Brock, who locked herself in the bathroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 157-158. After H. Weinstein stopped threatening her, Brock left the bathroom and took a car back to the area where the dinner had taken place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 159. On the way, H. Weinstein told Brock he wanted to help her with her career.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The next day, at a private film screening, H. Weinstein entered the theater and sat directly behind Brock with his hand on her chair for the entire movie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 163. Brock alleges that she suffered emotional and physical distress as a result of the incident, and never received any work or professional support from H. Weinstein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Melissa Sagemiller\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In the summer of 2000, Sagemiller was acting in a Miramax film.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 165. During production, one of H. Weinstein's assistants, who Sagemiller believes was Barbara Schneeweiss, told her to go to H. Weinstein's hotel room for a \"very important\" meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 167. When she arrived, H. Weinstein demanded a massage and a kiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 170. After Weinstein threatened her career, Sagemiller ultimately submitted to a forcible kiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 172. The following day, H. Weinstein had Sagemiller's luggage transferred to his private plane without her consent, forcing her to travel with him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 175. Sagemiller alleges that she suffered emotional and physical distress as a result of the assault and believes she was denied several acting roles because she refused H. Weinstein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 177-179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Larissa Gomes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In 2000, when Gomes was in Ontario, Canada to act and dance in a Miramax movie, H. Weinstein told her he was impressed by her and wanted to meet with her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 180. At a meeting in H. Weinstein's hotel room with Gomes, the film's music director, and a Miramax executive, H. Weinstein expressed interest in having Gomes appear in future Miramax films to\n   be shot in Canada.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 185. At a subsequent meeting in his hotel room, H. Weinstein told Gomes she would be \"perfect\" for two upcoming Miramax productions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188. Shortly thereafter, H. Weinstein demanded a massage and, when Gomes refused, H. Weinstein sexually assaulted her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 194-198. The assault allegedly \"damaged Gomes physically and emotionally, and it damaged her career.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 202.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

Louisette Geiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At the 2008 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, H. Weinstein asked Geiss about her career and proposed to meet her in the lobby of a hotel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 244. When the lobby bar closed, H. Weinstein invited her to his office inside the hotel, promising that he would not touch her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 244-245. Once inside, H. Weinstein told her he would \"greenlight\" her script if she watched him masturbate, and assaulted her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 247-249. In addition to suffering emotional and physical distress, Geiss lost a \"three-film deal and other opportunities at TWC\" as a result of her refusal to work with and perform sexual acts for H. Weinstein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 251. Barbara Schneeweiss contacted her in 2017 \"so that she would not speak to the press.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Weinstein assaulted Thomas at his Connecticut home while she was interviewing for a position as a nanny.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 261. As a result of the incident, Thomas suffered emotional distress, \"manifest[ing] into physical symptoms,\" and was blacklisted from acting roles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 264-265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Weinstein at TWC's office in New York City to pitch an enterprise video platform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 268. H. Weinstein began touching her inappropriately during the meeting, and ultimately pinned her against a refrigerator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 273-277. Later that day, H. Weinstein took Thompson into a hotel room and raped her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 284-294. In October 2017, Thompson allegedly was targeted by agents working for H. Weinstein's legal team, who sought and obtained information from her about her claims against H. Weinstein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 302-312.

Fear of Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Much of the affirmative conduct relied on by plaintiffs goes to the second potential ground for invoking equitable estoppel-fear of retaliation. The parties not having briefed the issue, I do not express a view as to whether, when duress tolling does not apply, extreme acts of intimidation by a perpetrator or supervisor of sexual assault can estop that defendant from asserting a statute of limitations defense. Even if the doctrine of equitable estoppel extends to such circumstances, the doctrine's other requirements do not fall away: there must be threats\n   or intimidation against each plaintiff by each defendant that plaintiff seeks to estop, the conduct must occur within the limitations period, and the plaintiff must bring suit within a reasonable period of time after the conduct ceases. Here, no plaintiff's allegations come close to meeting those requirements as to any defendant. Some allegations describe intimidation in the immediate aftermath of an assault.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 163 (alleging that, in 1998, Weinstein sat behind Brock at a movie theater the night after he assaulted her and held her chair in an attempt to intimidate her). Other allegations describe intimidation long after the limitations period had run.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FAC \u00b6 411 (alleging that, in 2017, Lombardo sent threatening text messages to an unidentified victim whom Weinstein had assaulted in the late 1990s). None, however, describe a pattern of continual and egregious acts of intimidation sufficient to toll the statute of limitation for years or, in some cases, decades. In the absence of such a pattern, fear of retaliation does not toll the statutes of limitations for the duration of a famous defendant's power and influence, even for the most despicable wrongs. Plaintiffs' equitable estoppel arguments therefore fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Duress and Continuing Wrongs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that the statutes of limitations are tolled by duress only as to their RICO and infliction of emotional distress claims. FAC \u00b6 693. The RICO claims having been dismissed, the only remaining question is whether duress tolling saves plaintiffs' negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In this context, the doctrine of duress and the doctrine of continuing wrongs are interconnected. Duress must be \"part of the cause of action alleged,\" and therefore \"the duress that forms the cause of action is then considered a continuing wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Donahue v. Pendleton Woolen Mills, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855130\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/633/1423/#p1444\">\n    633 F.
