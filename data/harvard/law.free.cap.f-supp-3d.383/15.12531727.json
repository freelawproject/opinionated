Goldstein survived and brought suit for assault and battery and, along with his relatives, emotional distress.

The R &amp; R begins by recounting the medical and testimonial evidence of the injuries Shalom suffered and the difficulties he continues to endure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bombing injured his ear drums and right eye and left him with several lacerations and severe pain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His injuries required \"multiple visits to doctors and hospitals to treat the injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To this day, Shalom continues to struggle with hearing difficulties, although the record does not reveal their extent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, although the record does not contain medical documentation of emotional or psychological injury, Shalom and several of his family members testified that he has suffered a long-term emotional injury that has affected his ability to function in everyday life.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, Shalom sometimes \"is unaware of his surroundings and his wife has to 'bring him back,' \" his sleep continues to be negatively affected, and he regularly consults with a rabbi regarding his ongoing emotional struggles.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.%20Supp.%203d%201\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recounting deposition testimony).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In light of this evidence and a review of damages awards in similar cases, the R &amp; R recommends an award of $ 4.25 million, slightly lower than the $ 5 million baseline.

The special master made particular reference to this Court's awards in\n   <em>\n    Cohen II\n   </em>\n   , for injuries incurred in the very same bus bombing. There, to take one example, the Court awarded the $ 5 million baseline figure to Ora Cohen, who suffered a broken nose, a neck injury, and eardrum damage, slightly more severe injuries than what Shalom suffered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263662\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/19/#p24\">\n    268 F. Supp. 3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The special master also explained that her recommendation is consonant with a general trend in FSIA cases involving insignificant short-term physical injuries and ongoing emotional trauma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 18 (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wamai v.

That is primarily because, in the Court's view, the gap between Shalom's injuries and Ora Cohen's-suffered in the same bus bombing-is wider than the R &amp; R concluded. In addition to the fact that Ms. Cohen suffered slightly more severe physical injuries than Shalom, her five children were also injured in the attack.\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

Supp. 3d at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These harrowing circumstances rendered Cohen's emotional injury \"unique\" and helped explain why she was entitled to a baseline award despite\n   suffering physical injuries \"not as severe as that of other FSIA plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263662\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/19/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The record does not reflect that Shalom experienced the same level of psychological trauma. It is also significant that Cohen, unlike Shalom, was actually diagnosed with both post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in the year following the bombing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263662\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/19/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In light of these distinctions, the Court finds that Shalom's injuries are closer in kind to those suffered by others in the Cohen family-like Orly and Daniel, who suffered from shrapnel wounds and ongoing hearing loss, in addition to emotional distress-and to some plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Wamai\n   </em>\n   -who suffered broken bones, head trauma, hearing/vision impairment and emotional distress-than to those endured by Ora Cohen.

Although the Court accepts the special master's conclusion that the Goldstein family is particularly tight-knit and that their testimony amply establishes their right to relief, it nevertheless concludes the reduction in Shalom's pain-and-suffering damages logically compels a proportionate reduction in the siblings' solatium awards-by one-half, to $ 625,000 each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The one sibling for whom the R &amp; R recommends a downward variance presents an interesting question. Y.G. was born two days\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the bombing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The bulk of authority in FSIA cases adopts the view that children born after a terrorist incident are not entitled to solatium damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 20 (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wamai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4132839\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/60/84/#p92\">\n    60 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the court granted that while it is fair to assume that an attack on a victim is also an attack on the victims' families, it is less obvious that such an attack is \"directed at unborn family members.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311523\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/7/#p15\">\n    882 F.

Plus,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   reasoned, a rule permitting recovery for after-born plaintiffs would mean the class of eligible claimants is \"potentially unlimited\" and the window for recovery \"could remain open for decades after a terrorist attack.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311523\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/7/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Still, while the Court agrees that \"some lines must be drawn,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311523\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/7/#p15\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311523\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/7/#p15\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   it agrees with\n   the R &amp; R that special circumstances here justify an award of solatium damages to Y.G. For one thing, Y.G. was born just two days after the bus bombing. As the special master notes, \"[t]here is little difference between a child born two days after the attack and a child who was only month old at the time of the attack.\" R &amp; R at 20-21. \"In both situations, the child's feelings of loss of society and comfort stem from the family dynamic and the condition of the victim and his or her relationship with the child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311523\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/7/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311523\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/7/#p15\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, there is evidence that Y.G. was born prematurely\n   <em>\n    as a result\n   </em>\n   of his mother's emotional shock and distress after she learned that her son Shalom was on the bus that had been bombed. As the R &amp; R reasons, \"a premature birth in itself is an event that creates fear and anxiety\" and therefore \"[i]t is reasonable to conclude that this child's life experience was and is affected not only by the experience of his brother that occurred before his birth but also by the circumstances of his birth.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311523\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/882/7/#p15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That fact alone makes this an exceptional case justifying a solatium award to Y.G., despite the prevailing approach in this district to deny such awards for after-born plaintiffs. The special master nevertheless accounted for Y.G.'s after-born status, by reducing her recommend award by one-half. The Court adopts that same approach, but will halve that amount once more in light of Shalom's reduced pain-and-suffering award. The Court will therefore award $ 312,500, or half of the amount the other siblings are to receive, to Y.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   That leaves only the parents. As an initial matter, both parents established their entitlement to solatium damages through extensive testimony about how devastating the attack was on them specifically and the family generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6 (summarizing Rabbi Simcha Goldstein and Sarah Goldstein's testimony). The R &amp; R thus recommended beginning both parents at the $ 2.5 million baseline. However, the special master reasoned that Sarah's \"well-advanced pregnancy at the time of the bombing and the fact that she gave premature birth to her youngest child [Y.G.] within two days of the bombing\" makes this a rather extraordinary case that justifies a $ 500,000 upward variance from the $ 2.5 million solatium-award baseline for parents of victims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. The Court concurs with the special master that Sarah is entitled to an upward adjustment for this reason-although it will again halve the special master's recommendation, consistent with its 50 percent reduction of her son's award. Accordingly, the Court will award $ 1.25 million to Rabbi Simcha Goldstein and $ 1.5 million to Sarah Goldstein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    3. Prejudgment Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs also demand prejudgment interest, and the R &amp; R reaches only an equivocal conclusion on the subject. R &amp; R at 22 (\"In general, it seems that the reasoning of cases that have declined prejudgment interest is reasonable.\"). \"The decision to award prejudgment interest, as well as how to compute that interest, rests within the discretion of the court, subject to equitable considerations.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahirya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829474\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/775/48/#p86\">\n    775 F.

In\n   <em>\n    Cohen II\n   </em>\n   , the Court reasoned that, because nonpecuniary damages, which include pain and suffering and solatium damages, are \"designed to be fully compensatory,\" they are \"complete and prejudgment interest is not necessary to make the plaintiffs whole.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263662\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/19/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thuneibat v.

Supp. 3d at 63-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it continues to believe that prejudgment interest is not appropriate for nonpecuniary damages already designed to provide complete compensation. That is especially true here, because the special master calculated what she believed an appropriate award would be while knowing this Court's reluctance to tack on prejudgment interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 22. The Court also finds inapplicable here a premise that\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   and other decisions have used to justify a contrary result.\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   noted that \"[a]wards for pain and suffering and solatium are calculated without reference to the time elapsed since the attacks,\" which means such awards are \"best viewed as fixed at the time of the loss\" and that prejudgment interest should therefore be awarded \"to account for the time that they have not had access to that full amount.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526648\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/324/54/#p61\">\n    324 F. Supp. 3d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, the special master quite clearly took into account the long-lasting, ongoing nature of the victims' injuries in determining an appropriate compensatory award. After finding that each of the plaintiffs \"continues to suffer fear and anxiety\" and \"suffers from ongoing and significant emotional injuries,\" the special master explained that \"[i]n determining an appropriate award, it is necessary to consider the nature and duration of the injury\" and its \"long-terms effects (emotionally and physically).\" R &amp; R at 12. Thus, whatever the usual rule is for calculating pain and suffering damages, it is evident the special master here accounted for the passage of time-and the persistence of the plaintiffs' trauma-in determining an appropriate compensatory award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The R &amp; R did not make a recommendation on a punitive damages award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 26.
