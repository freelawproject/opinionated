Plaintiffs allege that the Pennsylvania statutory scheme permitting\n   this inequity (\"Act 44/89\"), first enacted in 2007, violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and their constitutional right to travel. Specifically, Plaintiffs complain that in violation of the Constitution, Act 44/89 authorizes and directs the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (\"PTC\") to collect user fees with no regard to Turnpike operating costs and to redistribute those funds to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\"PennDOT\") for projects across the Commonwealth that are of no benefit to the paying Turnpike motorist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are: Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association, Inc. (\"OOIDA\"), National Motorists Association (\"NMA\"), Marion L. Spray (\"Spray\"), B.L. Reever Transportation, LLC (\"B.L. Reever\"), Flat Rock Transportation, LLC (\"Flat Rock\"), Milligan Trucking, Inc. (\"Milligan Trucking\"), Frank Scavo (\"Scavo\"), and Laurence G. Tarr (\"Tarr\"), consisting of organizations, businesses, and individuals who are required to pay and have paid tolls to the PTC for their use of the Turnpike (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-18.) Defendants are the PTC, William K. Lieberman, Vice Chair of the PTC, Barry T. Drew, Secretary Treasurer of the PTC, Pasquale T. Deon, Sr., Commissioner of the PTC, John N. Wozniak, Commissioner of the PTC, Mark P. Compton, Chief Executive Officer of the PTC, Craig R. Shuey, Chief Operating Officer of the PTC (collectively, the \"PTC Defendants\"), Tom Wolf, Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Leslie S. Richards, Chair of the PTC and Secretary of PennDOT (collectively, the \"Commonwealth Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are four motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint filed by the PTC Defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Commonwealth Defendants, individual defendant Shuey, and individual defendant Lieberman. (Doc. Nos. 49, 50, 52, and 53.) Also before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the issue of liability. (Doc. No. 84.) The motions have been fully briefed and are ripe for disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the PTC and Commonwealth Defendants' motions to dismiss will be granted, the motions filed by individual defendants Shuey and Lieberman will be denied as moot, and Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Act 44/89\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Turnpike is a toll road operated by the PTC, running for 359 miles across the Commonwealth, beginning at the Ohio state line in Lawrence County and ending\n   at the New Jersey border at the Delaware River Bridge in Bucks County. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 41.) Including the Northeastern Extension and Western Extension, the Turnpike covers 552 miles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of \"excessive\" tolls charged to named Plaintiffs and members of a putative class of motor carriers, drivers, and motorists by the PTC for travel on the Turnpike. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 1.) The PTC is \"an instrumentality of the Commonwealth.\" 36 P.S. \u00a7 652d ; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 32. Pennsylvania law authorizes the PTC to fix and adjust tolls to generate funds for services and facilities provided by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (a) Establishment and changes in toll amounts. --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Tolls shall be fixed and adjusted as to provide funds at least sufficient with other Revenues of the Pennsylvania Turnpike System, if any, to pay all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) Amounts due to the department under 75 Pa. C.S. Ch. 89 (relating to Pennsylvania Turnpike) and pursuant to the lease agreement under 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8915.3 (relating to lease of Interstate 80; related agreements).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (5) Any other amounts payable to the Commonwealth or to the department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   74 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8116(a) ; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 40. Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the PTC obtains almost the entirety of its operating revenue from tolls. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 86.) Plaintiffs allege that prior to the enactment of Act 44, the PTC raised tolls on the Turnpike only five times in the 64-year history of the Turnpike. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Plaintiffs allege that in fiscal year ending May 31, 2015, 192 million vehicles traveled on the Turnpike, consisting of approximately 166 million Class 1 Passenger vehicles and 26 million Class 2-9 commercial vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Plaintiffs' complaint estimates that trucks provide for about half of the annual toll revenues generated by the Turnpike, producing $ 443 million in toll revenues for PTC in the 2016 fiscal year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2007, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted a statute known as Act 44, amending portions of the Pennsylvania Public Transportation Law (Title 74) and the Vehicle Code (Title 75).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of July 18, 2007, P.L. 169, No. 44; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 44. Pursuant to the statute, the PTC and PennDOT entered into a Lease and Funding Agreement (\"LAFA\"), for a term of fifty years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8915.3(1) ; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 45. Act 44, as originally enacted, required the PTC to make a \"[s]cheduled annual commission contribution\" to PennDOT in the following amounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    TABLE 1\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-25\"><strong>Amount</strong> <strong>Fiscal Year</strong> $750,000,000 2007-2008 $850,000,000 2008-2009 $900,000,000 2009-2010 Annual Increases of 2.5% 2010-End</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 8901 ; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 52. As alleged in Plaintiffs' complaint, on December 4, 2008, the PTC issued a press release regarding an imminent 25 percent toll increase:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In December 2008, PTC's CEO announced: \"The mission of [the Turnpike] has changed.... For the first time, toll income isn't only going back into our toll roads, but helping to fund infrastructure improvements in every corner of Pennsylvania .... Toll increase proceeds are mainly earmarked for non-Turnpike projects, so the funds generated by this [2009 toll] increase will largely be used by PennDOT to help finance off-Turnpike road and bridge projects and the state's 74 mass-transit operations.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 72.) In a December 30, 2008 press release by the PTC, the PTC's CEO stated that \"[i]n fact, more than 90 percent of the toll-increase proceeds will benefit non-Turnpike road and bridge projects and transit operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2013, the General Assembly again amended the Public Transportation Law and Vehicle Code through legislation known as Act 89.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of Nov. 25, 2013, P.L. 974, No. 89; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 46. Act 89 amended the PTC's annual payment obligations to PennDOT. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 53.) Pursuant to Act 89, the PTC and PennDOT amended the LAFA in 2014, entering into an Amended Funding Agreement scheduled to terminate in October of 2057. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The statutory scheme established by Act 44/89 provides for annual payments made by the PTC to PennDOT that currently total $ 450 million annually through fiscal year 2022 and reduce to $ 50 million annually through 2057.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   75 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8901 ; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 51-54. Under Act 44/89, the PTC's annual payments to PennDOT through fiscal year 2057 will total $ 9.65 billion. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 55.) The PTC obtains the funds necessary to make the annual Act 44/89 payments from Turnpike tolls and from bonds it issues, the interest and principal of which are paid from tolls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-61.) Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the PTC's Act 44/89 payments to PennDOT, interest, and bond expenses are classified by the PTC as \"non-operating expenses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) As alleged by Plaintiffs, the largest portion of PTC's revenues derive from tolls, which are pledged to secure the PTC's outstanding Senior Revenue Bonds, also known as Turnpike Revenue Bonds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that, according to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Auditor General's 2016 Performance Audit of PTC (\"2016 Performance Audit\"), beginning in 2015, the PTC's Act 44/89 payments have been solely dedicated to \"non-highway purposes,\" including transit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) The PTC Act 44 Financial Plan Fiscal Year 2018 (\"Act 44 Plan FY2018\"), dated June 1, 2017, describes the change in funding obligations imposed by Act 89 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Act 89 substantially altered the Commission's funding obligations to PennDOT. While the Commission's aggregate payment obligation remains at $ 450 million annually, beginning July 1, 2014, none of the payments are dedicated to highways and bridges. Instead, all $ 450 million is allocated to support transit capital, operating, multi-modal and other non-highway programs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 70) (quoting Act 44 Plan FY2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pursuant to Act 44/89, PennDOT deposits the annual payments from the PTC into the Public Transportation Trust Fund (\"PTTF\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   74 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1506(b)(1). Monies from that fund are then distributed among four programs: the \"operating program,\" the \"asset improvement program,\" the Multimodal Transportation Fund\n   (\"MTF\"), and \"programs of statewide significance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   74 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1506(e)(1)-(3), (6) ; Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 71. The statute directs that of the $ 450 million transferred to the PTTF, $ 30 million must be deposited in the MTF. 74 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1506(b)(1), (e)(6). The statute further provides that 95% of the funds transferred to the PTTF annually from PennDOT, after the transfer of $ 30 million to the MTF, are utilized in connection with the \"asset improvement program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1514, 1506(e)(2). Funds expended in connection with the \"asset improvement program\" are used for \"improvement, replacement or expansion of capital projects\" related to public transportation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1514(a)(1). The relevant statute provides that southeastern Pennsylvania's public transportation agency, (\"SEPTA\"), and the Port Authority of Allegheny County receive the majority of such funds, with other mass transit agencies in the Commonwealth receiving the remaining funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1514(e.1). The statute provides that as to the \"asset improvement program,\" \"[e]ligible applicants ... may apply for financial assistance for improvement, replacement or expansion of capital projects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1514. Such applicants may include \"[a] local transportation organization,\" Commonwealth agencies and instrumentalities, and any \"person responsible for coordinating community transportation program services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1514(a). A \"capital project\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A system or component of a system for the provision of public passenger transportation. The term includes vehicles; infrastructure power; passenger amenities; storage and maintenance buildings; parking facilities; the land on which any capital project is situated and the land needed to support it, whether owned in whole or in part; overhaul of vehicles; debt service; and the cost of issuance of bonds, notes and other evidences of indebtedness which a local transportation organization or transportation company is permitted to issue under any law of this Commonwealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1503. A significantly smaller amount of the funds transferred from the PTC to PennDOT and deposited in the PTTF is dedicated to the \"operating program\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"programs of statewide significance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1513, 1516, 1506(e)(1), (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The $ 30 million deposited in the MTF finances transportation improvement programs including those related to bicycle and pedestrian safety, aviation, rail freight, passenger rail, and ports and waterways.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2104(a). \"Eligible program[s]\" under the MTF include: \"(1) A project which coordinates local land use with transportation assets to enhance existing communities[,] (2) A project related to streetscape, lighting, sidewalk enhancement and pedestrian safety[,] (3) A project improving connectivity or utilization of existing transportation assets[, and] (4) A project related to transit-oriented development[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that some of the projects approved under these statutory provisions (and funded with Act 44/89 toll revenues) include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   a.

Commonwealth Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In arguing that Plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim that Act 44/89 violates the dormant Commerce Clause, the Commonwealth Defendants maintain that: (1) Congress has specifically authorized state transportation authorities to use toll revenues for any purpose for which federal transportation funds may be used; and (2) even in the absence of specific congressional authorization, Act 44/89 does not impose a burden on interstate commerce that is \"clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits\" such that Act 44/89 violates the dormant Commerce Clause. (Doc. No. 51 at 17-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In arguing that Congress has specifically authorized the state statutory scheme such that Act 44/89 is invulnerable to constitutional attack on dormant Commerce Clause grounds, the Commonwealth Defendants point to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (\"ISTEA\"), federal legislation that permits public transportation authorities to use toll revenues from toll facilities initially for debt service on bonds and for operation and maintenance of the toll facilities, and secondarily (to the extent additional funds are available) for \"any other purpose for which Federal funds may be obligated by a State\" under Title 23 of the U.S. Code.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Commonwealth Defendants maintain that the projects that Plaintiffs assert should not be funded with Turnpike toll revenues (as described in paragraph 84 of their complaint) are all projects that fit within the broad authorization of ISTEA, as amended by the FAST Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.) The Commonwealth Defendants admit that two projects cited by Plaintiffs - airport terminal improvements and construction of a train track in an industrial park - may not be covered by Section 133(b), but maintain, however, that Plaintiffs allege only that these projects can receive funds from the MTF (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 79), not that the projects were paid for with funds transferred from the PTC and PennDOT, as the MTF receives, in addition to the $ 30 million from the PTC transfer to PennDOT, funds from vehicle and driver fees (Doc. No. 51 at 22) (citing 74 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1904(b)(3)); 2018-19 GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE BUDGET at H49 (Feb. 6, 2018) (indicating that $ 74-$ 80 million is deposited in the MTF annually from driver and vehicle fees).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, the Commonwealth Defendants argue that, as to Plaintiffs' apparent challenge to the use of Act 44/89 funds to pay for programs of statewide significance such as intercity passenger rail and bus services (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 83), even if such programs are not authorized to receive funds under Title 23, the programs receive the majority of their funding from sales tax funds, as opposed to Act 44/89 transfer payments (Doc. No. 51 at 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, the\n   Commonwealth Defendants maintain that given the multiple sources of funding for the projects mentioned by Plaintiffs, even if Section 133(b) does not authorize any of those projects, Plaintiffs have not and cannot plead that Act 44/89 toll revenues are utilized for such programs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In further support of their position, the Commonwealth Defendants point to a relatively recent opinion from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. New York State Thruway Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516427\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/238/\">\n    886 F.3d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2018) (hereafter \"\n   <em>\n    ATA II\n   </em>\n   \"), which held that ISTEA foreclosed a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to the use of toll revenues for transportation purposes unrelated to the tolling facilities that generated those revenues on the ground that Congress expressly authorized that use in ISTEA. (Doc. No. 51 at 23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Commonwealth Defendants further argue that, even if the Court should find that Congress did not expressly authorize the challenged use of Turnpike toll revenues, removing them from potential dormant Commerce Clause attack, Plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause claim still fails because Act 44/89 does not impose \"discriminatory burdens on interstate commerce.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.)

The Commonwealth Defendants maintain that, when analyzed under the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   test, the facts alleged in Plaintiffs' complaint do not support a reasonable inference that the usage of Turnpike tolls for other Commonwealth transportation projects burdens interstate commerce. (Doc. No. 51 at 26.) The Commonwealth Defendants argue that in crafting the allegations of their complaint and their dormant Commerce Clause challenge, Plaintiffs impermissibly rely on Supreme Court jurisprudence relating to user fees, as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Northwest Airlines v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) In\n   <em>\n    Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated that a \"levy is reasonable ... if it (1) is based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities, (2) is not excessive in relation to the benefits conferred, and (3) does not discriminate against interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230988\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/355/\">\n    510 U.S. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230988\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/355/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Auth.

Accordingly, the Commonwealth Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' focus on the cost of Turnpike tolls as compared to the cost of operating and maintaining the Turnpike is impermissibly narrow, maintaining that \"the fact that plaintiffs (or other putative class members) might not use other state transportation facilities funded with Turnpike toll revenues does not render the tolls they pay unconstitutionally excessive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.)

PTC Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The PTC Defendants similarly argue that Plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim for a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause because Plaintiffs rely on the\n   <em>\n    Evansville / Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   test, as opposed to the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   test, which the PTC Defendants maintain is the correct test for evaluating whether the allegations of Plaintiffs' complaint state a claim for violation of the dormant Commerce Clause. (Doc. No. 56 at 13-22.) Second, the PTC Defendants maintain that, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs' complaint states a claim for violation of the dormant Commerce Clause, because Congress has specifically authorized the PTC to collect toll revenues in excess of those needed to operate the Turnpike, the PTC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause claim.

The PTC Defendants argue that the\n   <em>\n    Evansville / Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   test is inapplicable to this case, as\n   <em>\n    Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   is a case primarily concerning statutory interpretation, or whether certain user fees are prohibited by a particular statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) Moreover, the PTC Defendants point out that at the conclusion of the Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   , the Court addressed whether the fees at issue also violated the dormant Commerce Clause, and concluded that they did not because express congressional authorization insulated the particular state statute from dormant Commerce Clause attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) The PTC Defendants note that at the same time, the Supreme Court concluded that, even if its determination as to congressional authorization was incorrect, any dormant Commerce Clause challenge to the user fees at issue failed based on the test first articulated in\n   <em>\n    Evansville-Vanderburgh\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)

No. 55 \u00b6 24.) Thus, the PTC Defendants maintain that based on ISTEA \u00a7 1012(a) and the FHWA Agreement negotiated pursuant to it, Congress has expressly authorized the PTC to utilize toll revenues on (1) debt service and (2) for \"any purpose for which [f]ederal funds may be obligated by a State under Title 23, United States Code.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc.

No. 56 at 26.) The PTC Defendants explain that the PTC makes its annual $ 450 million payment to PennDOT by \"(1) transferring $ 50 million in funds from operating revenues and (2) incurring 30-year subordinated debt to fund the remaining $ 400 million due.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.)\n   </em>\n   (citing Doc.

(Doc. No. 56 at 27.) Pointing to record evidence, the PTC Defendants maintain that \"[a]ll but $ 50 million\n   in annual Act 44/89-related toll revenue expenditures are for service on the [PTC]'s subordinated debt obligations,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27) (citing Doc.

As to the remaining $ 50 million transferred annually from the PTC to PennDOT, the PTC Defendants maintain that Section 1012(a) of ISTEA, as well as the FHWA Agreement, permit the PTC to utilize toll revenues for \"any purpose for which [f]ederal funds may be obligated by a State under Title 23, United States Code,\" providing that the \"State certifies annually that the tolled facility is being adequately maintained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27) (quoting ISTEA \u00a7 1012(a)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The PTC Defendants point to record evidence that they maintain supports their position that the PTC has made the necessary certifications of adequate maintenance to the FHWA for the period ending May 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28) (citing Doc. No. 55 \u00b6 27). The PTC Defendants admit that the certifications have not been made on a yearly basis due to the limited capacity of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Bureau of Audits, but argue that nothing in ISTEA or the FHWA Agreement sets a date by which audits must be performed, and moreover, the Secretary of Transportation, the individual \"charged with enforcement of 'the limitations on the use of revenues described in' Section 129(a),\" has not found the PTC in non-compliance with those limitations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28) (citing Doc. No. 55 \u00b6 30). Therefore, the PTC Defendants maintain that they are \"entitled 'to allocate excess toll revenues ... for any project eligible to receive federal assistance under Title 23.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28) (quoting\n   <em>\n    ATA II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516427\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/238/\">\n    886 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   246 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Accordingly, the PTC Defendants maintain that the issue of express congressional authorization turns on whether the funds transferred from the PTC to PennDOT pursuant to Act 44/89 are \"expended on a 'project eligible to receive federal assistance under Title 23.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29) (citing\n   <em>\n    ATA II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516427\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/238/\">\n    886 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   246 ). The PTC Defendants argue that all but one of the expenditures of toll revenues identified by Plaintiffs in their complaint are facially authorized under Title 23, with the possible exception of the Erie International Airport terminal building, for which the PTC Defendants maintain that authorization is unclear \"because of Plaintiffs' vague description in the [c]omplaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 &amp; n.6.) As to that project, the PTC Defendants point to record evidence seeking to demonstrate that the project constituted only $ 700,000 in expenditures, an amount which they argue, even if not congressionally authorized, is\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    minimis\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29) (citing Doc. No. 55 \u00b6 33). For all of these reasons, the PTC Defendants maintain that, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs' complaint states a dormant Commerce Clause claim, congressional authorization bars Plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause challenge to Act 44/89.

(Doc. No. 70 at 24-35.) Second, Plaintiffs argue that through ISTEA, Congress has not authorized states to impose turnpike tolls free of limitations imposed by the dormant Commerce Clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-53.) In addition, Plaintiffs maintain that even if\n   Congress did authorize states to utilize excess toll revenues on unrelated transportation projects, Defendants have not complied with the limitation placed on the exercise of that authority by failing to certify annually that the Turnpike is adequately maintained.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26.) Under the\n   <em>\n    Evansville / Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   test, tolls are reasonable if they \"(1) [are] based on some fair approximation of use of the facilities, (2) [are] not excessive in relation to the benefits conferred, and (3) [do] not discriminate against interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230988\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/355/\">\n    510 U.S. at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230988\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/355/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Evansville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723491\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/707/#p716\">\n    405 U.S. at 716-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723491\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/707/#p716\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Plaintiffs discuss the origins of ISTEA and specifically, Section 1012(a)(1), maintaining that the provision \"authorized the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to make federal funds available for certain limited types of state-tolled facilities,\" while Section 1012(a)(3) \"established conditions that States were required to satisfy in order to qualify for federal funds.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs maintain that while Section 1012(a)(1) \"continues to limit the use of revenue\" on the part of States, it did not and does not \"authorize[ ] States to operate their tolling facilities in a manner that violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that the Defendants' reliance on the Second Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    ATA II\n   </em>\n   as authority for the proposition that Section 1012(a) of ISTEA expressly authorized Act 44/89's toll structure is inapposite because that case\n   analyzed and relied on a separate section of ISTEA - Section 1012(e), not Section 1012(a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs maintain that Section 1012(e), originally enacted as a Note to Section 129 but never codified, was specific to New York State in authorizing tolls from the New York Thruway to be utilized to support the New York Canal System, which was \"functionally unrelated to the Thruway.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue that\n   <em>\n    ATA II\n   </em>\n   \"says nothing about whether Congress authorized - in the entirely independent Section 1012(a) - any State or local entity in the country to remedy its local budget shortfalls through unlimited, unconstitutionally-excessive tolls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In further disputing Defendants' argument that Section 1012(a) constitutes express congressional authorization insulating the Act 44/89 toll structure from dormant Commerce Clause attack, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants \"place undue emphasis on their twenty-year-old agreement with the [FHWA].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51.) Plaintiffs maintain that the FHWA Agreement \"goes no further\" than Section 129(a)(3) in its purpose to \"govern[ ] the use of federal funds received by PTC and PennDOT,\" and because the FHWA \"cannot authorize a violation of the Commerce Clause,\" it \"provides [no] independent justification for [Defendants'] actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Finally, in disputing Defendants' argument that Congress expressly authorized States to expend toll revenues in the manner contemplated by Act 44/89, Plaintiffs argue that even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Congress did so authorize States in Section 129(a), Defendants have failed to comply with the statutory limitations placed on the exercise of that authority. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) Specifically, Plaintiffs point to Section 129(a)(3)(A)(v) and argue that a State can use toll revenues for \"projects for which federal funds may otherwise be obligated\" only \"if the public authority certifies annually that the tolled facility is being adequately maintained.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20129\">\n    23 U.S.C. \u00a7 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(A)(v) ). Plaintiffs maintain that in its alternative motion for summary judgment, the PTC Defendants fail to point to sufficient evidence of record \"supporting its contention that it has made\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   certifications as required under subparagraph (A)(v) of Section 129(a)(3).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-57.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs maintain that even assuming that Section 129 permits Defendants to expend toll revenues in the manner contemplated by Act 44/89's toll structure, the PTC Defendants have failed to meet their burden to produce admissible evidentiary materials demonstrating their entitlement to summary judgment on this ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As it relates to their constitutional challenge to Act 44/89's tolling structure Plaintiffs argue in sum that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   there is a huge difference between \"excess toll revenues\" that could have been the subject of Section 1012(a)(3) and \"excessive tolls\" collected to fund a wide array of state-wide projects that are authorized, administered, and controlled by PennDOT, not PTC. Even if Congress had opened the door for States to use toll revenues left over after the repayment of debt borrowed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of Turnpike (Senior Revenue Bonds), there is no support for the proposition that Congress ever envisioned that any State would fabricate a statutory scheme that requires a turnpike authority to raise toll rates with no limit to their amount or the time period they could be imposed to support the transfer of billions of dollars to State transportation departments (here PennDOT) to support projects\n   with no functional relation to the tolled facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-62.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court has carefully considered the detailed and well-documented allegations of Plaintiffs' complaint, as well as the extensive briefing and legal arguments of the parties. As outlined fully above, the factual predicates for Plaintiffs' claim are for the most part undisputed, as the PTC tolls and expenditures are a matter of public record, as are the statutory origins of the PTC's scheme for collecting toll revenues and transferring funds to PennDOT. What is in dispute is how five decades of slowly evolving federal law related to the dormant Commerce Clause informs this Court's analysis of whether Plaintiffs' challenge to excessive tolls represents a constitutional injury that this Court is empowered to rectify, or a matter for legislative overhaul.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Court notes that the parties maintain wholly different legal analyses of Plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause claim. It is no wonder. Even the legitimacy and parameters of the dormant Commerce Clause are the subject of continuous vigorous debate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The application of the case law implementing the doctrine is no more conclusive. As explained previously, Plaintiffs urge this Court to invoke the analysis articulated by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Evansville / Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 70 at 27) (maintaining that \"\n   <em>\n    Evansville\n   </em>\n   stands as the appropriate test for analyzing excessive user fees and tolls\"), while Defendants maintain that the standard set forth in the earlier\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   decision is the appropriate standard to apply to Plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause claim (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 76 at 17) (maintaining that in the Third Circuit, \"\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   governs challenges to the constitutionality of highway toll programs\"). Consequently, the parties in this case have characterized these tests as separate, competing standards within the world of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, rather than two analytical frameworks that may complement, rather than replace, one another. No definitive controlling precedent supports either side. The Third Circuit has never specifically evaluated\n   <em>\n    Evansville\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   as competing tests in any Commerce Clause challenge to highway tolls, nor has the United States Supreme Court. For the reasons that follow, upon review of all persuasive and controlling law, this Court finds that the relevant authority renders\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   the appropriate test for examining Plaintiffs' dormant Commerce Clause challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Only two relevant cases in the Third Circuit address the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Evansville\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   to a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to a highway toll,\n   <em>\n    Wallach v.

First, in\n   <em>\n    Wallach\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit considered a challenge to a 50% toll increase on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bridges and tunnels. The New Jersey citizen plaintiffs brought a dormant Commerce Clause challenge asserting that \"no toll increase was necessary to finance the maintenance or costs of the Port Authority's bridges and tunnels.\"\n   <em>\n    Wallach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545406\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/930/1070/\">\n    930 F.2d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

App'x 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2010), the Third Circuit, in a non-precedential opinion, affirmed the dismissal of a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to a discount toll program that offered toll discounts to subscribers of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (\"MTA\")'s electronic toll program, but not to users of competing systems in other states. The court first concluded that the program did not discriminate against interstate commerce on its face or in effect in that: it was available on equal terms to\n   motorists regardless of residence; it incorporated no distinctions based on residence; and participation in the program was open to everyone, and that when a toll program does not discriminate against interstate commerce on its face or in effect,\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   articulates the appropriate standard for assessing any \"undue burden\" on interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882357\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/395/878/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882357\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/395/878/\">\n    at 882-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because this reference to\n   <em>\n    Evansville\n   </em>\n   was not necessary to the court's reasoning, and, therefore, constitutes dicta, this Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Yerger\n   </em>\n   provides no additional clarity regarding the potential interplay between the\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Evansville\n   </em>\n   tests with regard to the dormant Commerce Clause challenge presently before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In addition, it is noteworthy that Plaintiffs generally rely on case law from the First and Second Circuits to support their argument as to the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Evansville\n   </em>\n   to their dormant Commerce Clause challenge.

Commonwealth Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   At the outset, the Commonwealth Defendants highlight that, of the three recognized components of a constitutional right to travel, only the \"right of a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State\" could \"possibly be implicated\" by the allegations in Plaintiffs' complaint. (Doc. No. 51 at 31.) Therefore, the Commonwealth Defendants characterize Plaintiffs' claim as asserting that \"Act 44/89, by allegedly requiring Turnpike tolls above the level necessary to fund Turnpike operations, actually deters interstate travel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.) The Commonwealth Defendants argue that paragraph 128 of Plaintiffs' complaint asserts only a conclusory allegation to this effect without any factual support, and maintain that \"the Supreme Court has rejected the notion that a state-imposed fee on the use of interstate travel facilities\n   impermissibly burdens the constitutional right to travel,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Evansville-Vanderburgh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723491\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/707/#p716\">\n    405 U.S. at 711-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723491\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/707/#p716\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) Finally, the Commonwealth Defendants maintain that even assuming that \"the level of Turnpike tolls did somehow deter travelers from using\n   <em>\n    the Turnpike\n   </em>\n   , this would not mean that the tolls (or Act 44/89) actually deter\n   <em>\n    interstate travel\n   </em>\n   in or through Pennsylvania,\" because the \"right to interstate travel does not mean a traveler has a constitutional right to the most convenient form of travel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (citing\n   <em>\n    Town of Southold v. Town of E. Hampton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778559\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/477/38/#p54\">\n    477 F.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 (2d Cir. 2007) (stating that \"travelers do not have a constitutional right to the most convenient form of travel\" (internal quotation marks omitted))). The Commonwealth Defendants argue that in light of the availability of \"alternative toll-free routes\" acknowledged by Plaintiffs in their complaint (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 99), the allegations of Plaintiffs' complaint fail to support a reasonable inference that Act 44/89 violates the constitutional right to travel (Doc. No. 51 at 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    b. PTC Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The PTC Defendants similarly argue that a \"non-discriminatory burden like a highway toll does not deter interstate travel in a constitutional sense,\" pointing out that Plaintiffs' complaint indicates that alternative toll-free highways exist. (Doc. No. 56 at 33) (citing Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 99). Along those lines, the PTC Defendants maintain that while drivers might prefer to use the \"convenient and more direct Turnpike,\" the imposition of \" 'burdens on a single mode of transportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel.' \" (Doc. No. 56 at 33) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11614355\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/176/1202/#p1205\">\n    176 F.3d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1205 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that \"[b]urdens placed on travel generally, such as gasoline taxes, or minor burdens impacting interstate travel, such as toll roads, do not constitute a violation of\" the right to travel)). The PTC Defendants argue that \"[a]t most, Plaintiffs have alleged a burden on traveling their chosen route through Pennsylvania, not on their right to travel generally.\" (Doc. No. 76 at 24.) Accordingly, the PTC Defendants maintain that the allegations of Plaintiffs' complaint fail to support a reasonable inference that the toll structure imposed by Act 44/89 violates the constitutional right to travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In opposition to the arguments of the Commonwealth and PTC Defendants as to any alleged violation of the constitutional right to travel resulting from Turnpike toll structure established by Act 44/89, the Plaintiffs rely largely on\n   <em>\n    Crandall v. Nevada\n   </em>\n   , 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3453960\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/73/35/\">\n    18 L.Ed. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1867), in which the Supreme Court invalidated a Nevada statute levying a \"tax of one dollar upon every person leaving the State by any railroad, stage coach, or other vehicle engaged or employed in the business of transporting passengers for hire.\"\n   <em>\n    Crandall\n   </em>\n   , 73 U.S. at 36. Plaintiffs argue that here, as in\n   <em>\n    Crandall\n   </em>\n   , the relevant issue is whether the toll levied is in any way comparable to the benefit provided, and that if it is not, \"the constitutional violation is self-evident.\" (Doc. No. 70 at 38-39.) Plaintiffs maintain that the\n   <em>\n    Evansville / Northwest Airlines\n   </em>\n   test is the relevant standard for determining \"[i]f fees or tolls charged for use of a state-provided facility are reasonable and not excessive in comparison to the benefits provided to the payers for use of the facility\" - or in other words, if they do not \"offend the Constitution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Upon careful consideration of the arguments of the parties, the relevant authorities, and the allegations of Plaintiffs' complaint, this Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that the allegations set forth in their complaint support a reasonable\n   inference that the provisions of Act 44/89 constitute a violation of the constitutional right to travel. As all parties appear to agree, the only component of the constitutional right to travel recognized by the Supreme Court ostensibly implicated by Plaintiffs' allegations is the \"right of a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saenz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133435\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/489/#p498\">\n    526 U.S. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133435\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/489/#p498\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, as all parties similarly appear to agree, because Plaintiffs' complaint makes no allegations that impeding travel is the primary objective of Act 44/89, or that Act 44/89 utilizes a classification that penalizes travel, Plaintiffs' claim is properly viewed as alleging that Act 44/89 actually deters travel. However, as Defendants note, Plaintiffs' complaint does not allege that any traveler has been deterred from traveling through Pennsylvania by Turnpike tolls, but instead points to comments by the Pennsylvania Auditor General to the effect that travelers may seek alternative, toll-free routes through the Commonwealth to avoid the payment of Turnpike tolls. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 99.) Assuming the truth of those allegations, the Court concludes that they do not amount to facts supporting a reasonable inference that the constitutional right to travel has been burdened by the toll structure imposed by Act 44/89; rather, they support a reasonable inference that the right to travel a particular route through Pennsylvania (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Turnpike) may at some point be deterred by the cost of Turnpike tolls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Southold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778559\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/477/38/#p54\">\n    477 F.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a burden on the most convenient form of travel is not a burden on the constitutional right to travel);\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11614355\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/176/1202/#p1205\">\n    176 F.3d at 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"burdens on a single mode of transportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Court is also unpersuaded by Plaintiffs' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Crandall v. Nevada\n   </em>\n   to support their right to travel claim because in that case, as noted above, the Supreme Court struck down a statute that levied a fee on every person leaving the state by way of a common carrier and articulated its concern that, if the levy were permitted, \"[s]tates covering the only practicable routes of travel from the east to the west, or from the north to the south, may totally prevent or seriously burden all transportation of passengers from one part of the country to the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Crandall\n   </em>\n   , 73 U.S. at 46. In contrast, Plaintiffs' complaint does not allege that the Turnpike is \"the only practicable route[ ] of travel\" through Pennsylvania. Moreover, based on subsequent case law, the Court finds that a narrow construction of\n   <em>\n    Crandall\n   </em>\n   is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lutz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528184\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/255/\">\n    899 F.2d at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that\n   <em>\n    Crandall\n   </em>\n   simply \"recognized a right to travel insofar as travel is necessary for the transaction of business between the national government and its citizenry,\" and that the Supreme Court has declined to extend \"\n   <em>\n    Crandall\n   </em>\n   into a generalized right of free movement throughout the United States\"). The Court finds that the allegations in Plaintiffs' complaint fail to support a reasonable inference that the constitutional right to travel is burdened by the toll structure of Act 44/89.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant the Commonwealth\n   and PTC Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' constitutional right to travel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Court has carefully reviewed Plaintiffs' complaint and the legal authority submitted in support of the complaint. Plaintiffs' complaint credibly alleges that Pennsylvania's policy decisions related to transportation have resulted in a statutory scheme that disproportionately burdens Turnpike travelers with the costs of a state-wide transportation system that is of no direct benefit to them. Evaluating Plaintiffs' well-articulated complaint applying established Supreme Court and Third Circuit precedent that limits the breadth of the constitutional claims asserted here, this Court is constrained to find that Plaintiffs' factual allegations do not support a claim for violations of the dormant Commerce Clause or the constitutional right to travel. Accordingly, for all of the reasons stated herein, the Court will grant the PTC Defendants' and Commonwealth Defendants' motions to dismiss. In light of the Court's determination that Plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted for violations of the dormant Commerce Clause or constitutional right to travel, the Court need not address the various immunity issues raised by individual defendants Shuey's and Lieberman's motions to dismiss, and, therefore, those motions will be denied as moot. Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment will also be denied. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The PTC Defendants' motion is styled as a \"Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim or, in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment.\" (Doc.

Here, Plaintiffs test Defendants' blanket claim of congressional authorization, questioning whether Defendants have complied with the limitations placed on the exercise of that alleged authority, along with the source of congressional authorization itself. However, as noted above, the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a dormant Commerce Clause claim under\n    <em>\n     Pike\n    </em>\n    renders the Court's resolution of this substantial question unnecessary at this time.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    Assuming Plaintiffs' complaint alleged a burden that implicated the constitutional right to travel, the Court is similarly unpersuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that\n    <em>\n     Evansville /Northwest Airlines\n    </em>\n    provides the appropriate test for evaluating any such burden.
