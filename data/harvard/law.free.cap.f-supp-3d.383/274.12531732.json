Mar. 8, 2019). Non-party Dr. Louis Sanfilippo, the sole member of LCS Group LLC, invented U.S. Patent 8,318,813 (\"'813 Patent\"), which relates to methods for the treatment of Binge Eating Disorder with the drug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Vyvanse ).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201234848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The '813 Patent was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") in November 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201234848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   LCS owned the '813 Patent from issuance to 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201234848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This dispute arises out of Shire's initiation of an\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review\n   (\"IPR\") proceeding before the USPTO, challenging and ultimately cancelling all claims of the '813 Patent on June 4, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.

(Compl., ECF No. 1.) On June 26, 2018, Lobbin filed a First Amended Complaint, adding as defendants law firms Haug Partners and Baker Hostetler LLP (LCS's prior law firm that had withdrawn during the course of the IPR proceeding), and asserting a civil RICO claim. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 26, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint. (Not. of Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 38.) On September 7, 2018, Defendants filed a motion, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c), seeking sanctions against LCS, Lobbin and Foundation. (Not. of Motion for Sanctions, ECF No. 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By Order dated March 8, 2019, District Judge Analisa Torres dismissed all claims against the Defendants with prejudice and granted Defendants' motion for sanctions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LCS Grp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201234848\">\n    2019 WL 1234848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18.

In their motion, Defendants are seeking $ 250,000 in legal fees, but are not seeking any other expenses. (Defs.' Mem., ECF No. 81, at 6.) Among the papers submitted by Defendants were billing invoices for Haug Partners that contained certain redactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fleming Decl., Ex. 1, ECF No. 82-1.) Defendants' non-dispositive motion for attorneys' fees was referred to me on April 11, 2019.

Lobbin\n   argues that $ 15,000 would be an appropriate sanctions award. (Opp. at 3.) Lobbin's opposition papers included redacted copies of certain of his federal tax returns. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp., Ex. A, ECF No. 85-2.) Although Foundation itself did not file an opposition, Lobbin's opposition papers included a Declaration in opposition from Gregg D. Zucker of Foundation, arguing that Foundation should not be responsible for any of Defendants' attorneys' fees. (Zucker Decl., ECF No. 85-5.) In a letter dated April 19, 2019, Lobbin requested oral argument (4/19/19 Ltr., ECF No. 86), which I granted and scheduled to take place on May 28, 2019. (4/22/19 Endorsement, ECF No. 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By Order dated May 21, 2019, I directed Lobbin to certify that he had advised LCS of the May 28 oral argument date and of LCS's right to appear at the argument in person or by telephone. (5/21/19 Order, ECF No. 88.) Such certification was provided by Lobbin by Declaration dated May 23, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In my May 21 Order, I also directed Defendants to supply to the Court for its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review copies of its billing invoices that were not redacted.

Finally, in my May 21 Order, I directed Lobbin to supply to the Court copies of his tax returns that were not redacted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5/21/19 Order.) Such unredacted tax returns timely were supplied to the Court, and shall be filed with the Clerk of Court under seal.

In order to determine reasonable attorneys' fees in this case, the Court first will consider the lodestar approach to establish a \"presumptively reasonable fee\" by calculating the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel on the litigation and multiplying that number of hours by reasonable hourly rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millea v.

For hours billed in June and July 2018, a discount of 17.5% was applied to Haug Partners' hourly rates; for hours billed in August and September 2018, a discount of 20% was applied; and for hours billed in October 2018, a discount of 22.5% was applied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 6; Fleming Decl., Ex. 1.) The Court, in its discretion, shall apply a 22.5% discount to Haug Partners' hourly rates across the board.

Fleming of $ 868.00 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 77.5% of $ 1,120.00 per hour standard hourly rate), and an hourly rate for associate Jonathan Herstoff of $ 449.50 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 77.5% of $ 580.00 per hour\n   standard hourly rate).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.'

Indeed, what one party finds to be thorough in the defense of a lawsuit may seem to the other party to be excessive. In the present case, the unredacted invoices supplied to the Court by Haug Partners reflect that ten timekeepers billed hours to this case during the period June to October 2018 and that discounted fees well in excess of the $ 250,000 they are now seeking were billed during that period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   To their credit, Defendants only are seeking to recover $ 250,000 from LCS, Lobbin and Foundation as sanctions, for hours billed by partner Porter Fleming and associates Jonathan Herstoff and Jason Kanter. (Defs.' Mem. at 6.) Specifically, Defendants are seeking to recover 151.6 hours for Fleming, 302.6 hours for Herstoff and 84.5 hours for Kanter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although having more than one associate work on the motion to dismiss and the motion for sanctions may have brought value to the client, the Court finds that it is not reasonable to pass along to LCS, Lobbin and Foundation the cost of having more than one associate work on the motion to dismiss and motion for sanctions. Based upon the Court's review of the time entries, much of the work done by the two associates overlapped. Thus, the Court, in its discretion, only will credit the hours of partner Fleming and associate Herstoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A close examination of the time entries by Fleming and Herstoff for which Defendants seek reimbursement, as well as the relevant motion papers that were filed, reveals these attorneys billed hours that are in excess of what the Court finds to be objectively reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the three-month period from late June until late September 2018, there are 27 entries by Herstoff alone that are in excess of eight hours per day. The moving memorandum filed on behalf of Defendants regarding the motion to dismiss consisted of 30 pages (ECF No. 39) and the reply memorandum consisted of 15 pages. (ECF No. 43.) The moving memorandum filed on behalf of the Defendants on the motion for sanctions consisted of 18 pages (ECF No. 48) and the reply memorandum consisted of 14 pages. (ECF No. 58.) Although the legal arguments regarding the RICO claims were somewhat complex, the other legal arguments were not. Moreover, although the attorneys needed to review relevant procedural histories from two prior litigations, the motions were made on the pleadings and there was not an extensive factual record that needed to be reviewed and digested. Thus, the Court finds that a reduction in the number of hours billed by Fleming and Herstoff is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A court may apply an across-the-board reduction to effectuate the reasonable imposition of fees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marisol A. ex rel.
