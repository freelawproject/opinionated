After hearing from the parties on cross-motions for summary judgment, United States Magistrate Judge Patricia Sullivan issued her Findings and Recommendation (\"F&amp;R\"). Judge Sullivan concluded that the EPA's decision not to initiate a Special Review was not subject to judicial review and dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction. After\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the Court rejects the F&amp;R and concludes that the Court does have jurisdiction over Plaintiff's case.

Before a pesticide can be properly registered with the EPA, the Administrator must determine that the pesticide does \"not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 136(a)(c)(5)(D). FIFRA defines an \"unreasonable adverse effect on the environment\" as one that poses \"any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 136(bb).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a pesticide is registered with the EPA, FIFRA provides certain review procedures for the EPA to continually reevaluate a pesticide's risks and benefits. If the EPA finds that a registered pesticide, \"when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, generally causes unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,\" the EPA may institute proceedings either to \"cancel its registration or change its classification,\" or to \"determine whether or not its registration should be cancelled or its classification changed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136d(b)(1)-(2).

PZP is a naturally-occurring animal glycoprotein harvested from the ovaries of pigs. EPA000044. The pesticide ZonaStat-H is made up of PZP and two adjuvants\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which, when combined and injected into mares, blocks the attachment of sperm to egg, thereby preventing fertilization.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20154.7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; EPA000038. ZonaStat-H is used to manage wild horse and burro populations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2009, The Humane Society of the United States (\"HSUS\") submitted an application to register ZonaStat-H under FIFRA for the specific use of limiting populations of wild and feral horses and burros. HSUS submitted information in support of its application for registration, including published journal articles and peer-reviewed studies on the use of PZP. EPA granted HSUS's waiver of the requirements to submit subchronic, developmental, reproductive, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and immunotoxicity studies based on \"the lack of toxicity to the target animal; history of safe use of the vaccine; the mode of action and fate of the product's metabolites; the limited opportunity of exposure to non-target animals, applicators, and the public; and the lack of immunotoxicity as shown in the published literature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20154.7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The EPA also granted HSUS exemptions from all testing requirements ordinarily required for terrestrial, non-food pesticide application. EPA000107; EPA000037. On January 30, 2012, the EPA issued\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%2086833\">\n    Registration No. 86833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1 for ZonaStat-H to HSUS pursuant to section 3(c)(5) or FIFRA. EPA000021.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 19, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a Petition to the EPA requesting that the agency conduct a Special Review to consider new scientific evidence demonstrating the need to cancel the registration of the pesticide ZonaStat-H for population control of wild horses and burros. EPA000001-20. The Petition also requested that the EPA \"[i]ssue an order suspending Registration [of ZonaStat-H] pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136d(c)(1) during the Special Review\" and \"[h]old a hearing pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136d(b)(2) to determine if [the registration for ZonaStat-H] should be canceled or reclassified.\" EPA000003. Plaintiff contends that its Petition presents new evidence demonstrating that the use of ZonaStat-H to control wild horse and burro populations causes significant harm to nontarget organisms, including foals and untreated members of the herd, and that these risks are not outweighed by the benefits of the pesticide. Plaintiff also submitted evidence consisting of new scientific studies published after HSUS submitted its registration application in 2009 and after the EPA approved the registration in 2012. Plaintiff argues that this new evidence demonstrates that ZonaStat-H poses unreasonable adverse effects on the target animals, nontarget animals, and the interrelationships amongst the target and nontarget animals, and that these effects cannot be offset by the benefits of the pesticide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 15, 2016, the EPA issued a letter denying Plaintiff's Petition for Special Review. First, the EPA stated that \"[t]he criterial for initiating Special Review are set out in 40 C.F.R. [\u00a7] 154.7.\" EPA000033. The EPA then proceeded to analyze each of Plaintiff's contentions about the harms of ZonaStat-H and PZP under the criteria outlined in the regulation.

No party disputes that there is anything non-final about the EPA's decision not to initiate a Special Review. The parties disagree, however, on whether a denial of a petition for Special Review is a reviewable action rather than one confined exclusively to agency discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") provides that agency action is not subject to judicial review when the \"agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Section 706(2)(A) of the APA, however, instructs courts to review agency action to determine if the agency action was \"arbitrary, capricious,\" or otherwise constituted an \"abuse of discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). There is some tension between these two statutory admonitions, and courts have thus construed \u00a7 701(a)(2) to block reviewability only when the agency enjoys some sort of special discretion. 33 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT &amp; ARTHUR R. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 8325.

Choosing the first option implicitly rejects the second and vice versa. Thus, a decision to not initiate a Special Review must involve an analysis of the factors to be considered in deciding whether to initiate a Special Review and a determination that those factors are not met.

Similarly, when the EPA published the final regulations in the federal register, it noted that the criteria listed in \u00a7 154.7 were instrumental to \"the determination of whether\n   <em>\n    or not\n   </em>\n   a pesticide poses an unreasonable risk.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049004\">\n    50 Fed.
