INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1999, Defendant Henry Solomon submitted an incomplete form to the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") on behalf of his then-client, Plaintiff the Atlanta Channel, Inc. (\"ACI\"). The incomplete form resulted in ACI being denied a valuable license for one of its TV channels, a decision that was upheld on review and on reconsideration by the FCC over a decade later. ACI filed suit against Solomon for legal malpractice in 2015. In 2017, ACI added to its complaint malpractice claims against Defendants Melodie Virtue and her law firm Garvey, Schubert &amp; Barer. P.C. (together, the \"Garvey Defendants\"), who took over the FCC licensing dispute from Solomon when he retired in 2010 and who ACI alleges failed to disclose that Solomon's retirement could start the limitations clock on any malpractice claims against him. In their answer to ACI's complaint, the Garvey Defendants brought a crossclaim against Solomon for equitable indemnification or contribution. Solomon now moves to dismiss that crossclaim, arguing that it is barred under D.C. law. The Court grants the motion to dismiss the crossclaim for contribution but denies the motion as to indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court assumes familiarity with its prior opinions and confines its discussion to the facts most relevant to the present motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ACI is a broadcast television company that operates the low power television station WTHC-LD in Atlanta. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 69. Following the passage of the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999, Pub. L.

Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-23. ACI sought the services of Solomon, an attorney\n   specializing in FCC law and procedure,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5, to submit a statement of eligibility for a Class A license for WTHC-LD with the FCC,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Solomon filed the statement of eligibility on December 29, 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27. However, the statement was defective and the FCC denied ACI the license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 33. Through Solomon, ACI applied for review of the denial on December 29, 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. The FCC affirmed its denial of the license in 2012, and denied reconsideration of that decision in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2000, Solomon joined the law firm of Garvey Schubert Barer, P.C. Garvey Defs.' Answer 2, ECF No. 99. Melodie Virtue, a lawyer at the firm, worked with Solomon on ACI matters while he was employed at Garvey Schubert Barer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. After Solomon left the firm in 2010, Virtue took over the ACI licensing matter, reviewing the pending FCC application for review starting in early 2012 and representing ACI in its petition for reconsideration after the FCC's affirmance of the denial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. ACI contends that Virtue failed to make a number of required disclosures to ACI upon assuming responsibility for the FCC proceedings relating to the license, including warning ACI about Solomon's malpractice and the resulting conflict of interests between Solomon and the Garvey Defendants, and advising ACI to retain independent counsel. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-61. According to ACI, Virtue's work on the FCC proceedings \"lulled [it] into inaction in filing its malpractice claim against ... Solomon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ACI initially filed suit on October 26, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.

Oct. 14, 2016), ACI filed its Second Amended Complaint on June 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. Count one of the Second Amended Complaint is a legal malpractice claim against Solomon for $ 25,000,000, which ACI alleges is the loss in value to WTHC-LD resulting from the denial of the Class A license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73-75.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the alternative, counts three and four are legal malpractice claims for the same amount against Virtue and, under\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , Garvey Schubert Barer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80-87. In these two claims, which are conditioned on ACI's malpractice claim against Solomon being barred by the statute of limitations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83, ACI alleges that Virtue's failure to make the required disclosures \"adversely affected ACI's malpractice claims against ...

Answer 1. In the Crossclaim, the Garvey Defendants allege that they are entitled to \"equitable indemnification, restitution, reimbursement and/or contribution in whole or in part\" from Solomon because he would be unjustly enriched if the Garvey Defendants were the only ones to pay for damages substantially resulting from his malpractice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.

Opp'n 4-10. The Court addresses each claim in turn. The Court grants the motion to dismiss the crossclaim for contribution because-assuming the Garvey Defendants are liable on counts three and four of ACI's second amended complaint-Solomon and the Garvey Defendants were not joint tortfeasors. However, because the validity of the Garvey Defendants' equitable indemnification claim does not depend on whether they were actively negligent, the Court denies the motion to dismiss as to that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, Solomon moves to dismiss the Garvey Defendants' contribution crossclaim because he and the Garvey Defendants were not joint tortfeasors. Solomon asserts that, assuming both parties were negligent, his alleged negligence occurred thirteen years before the Garvey Defendants' and was an independent act resulting in a separate injury to ACI. Solomon Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 4-6, ECF No. 102-1. In response, the Garvey Defendants contend that, should they be found liable for malpractice in failing to make the required disclosures to ACI, they and Solomon would in fact be joint tortfeasors because the Garvey Defendants' malpractice would stem from Solomon's and ACI seeks the same judgment for the same amount of damages against the Garvey Defendants as it does against Solomon.
