GRAHAM, United States District Judge\n   This once-complicated tort action now presents one main question: do the provisions of the Ohio Product Liability Act which impose liability on the \"manufacturer\" of a \"product\" apply to a foreign sovereign who manufactured ammunition for military use in 1982? The court finds that the ammunition falls outside the definition of a \"product\" under the OPLA because it was not manufactured for introduction into trade or commerce and was not intended for sale. Thus, the motion for summary judgment of defendant Direcci\u00f3n General de Fabricaciones Militares (\"DGFM\") is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This case involves the sort of fact pattern one might expect to find in a law school exam. Plaintiff Troy Rote was invited to a party being held in Sunbury, Ohio on a 14-acre piece of property owned by of defendants Gary and Judith Buyer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   G. Buyer Dep. at 24. The party, convened on September 10, 2011 to celebrate Mr. Buyer's birthday, featured college football watching, rifle shooting and beer drinking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rote Dep. at 47, 50. At Mr. Buyer's request, defendant Edward Grimm came to the party with a .50 caliber, bolt-action rifle he owned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grimm Dep. at 93. Grimm had constructed the firearm by removing the lower receiver from a semi-automatic rifle, which was manufactured by defendant Bushmaster Firearms and sold by defendant Vance Outdoor, and assembling it to an upper receiver manufactured by defendant Zel Custom and sold by Vance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 69-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Grimm also brought to the party ammunition he purchased online from defendant Ammoman.com.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 81-82. The rounds of ammunition came in a plain brown box with no markings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 152-1 at PAGEID 1467. Each round had a headstamp of \"02 FLB 82.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . It is undisputed that the headstamp belongs to DGFM, an instrumentality of the Republic of Argentina operating under the supervision of its Ministry of Defense. The headstamp signifies that the rounds were manufactured by DGFM in February 1982 at a government munitions factory in the city of Fray Luis Beltr\u00e1n, Argentina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arpin Decl. at \u00b6 7. The ammunition was manufactured for military use, but DGFM is aware of two instances in which ammunition of the type that allegedly injured Rote passed out of the control of the Argentine military: (1) when Argentina lost the Falkland Islands War in June 1982 and possibly abandoned some amount of military equipment there and (2) when a cabal of Argentine government officials unlawfully sold armaments and ammunition in the early 1990s to the Croatian military during its war of independence against Yugoslavia. More on this later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several people at the party shot the rifle. Rote initially declined an opportunity to shoot it, but he agreed to give it a try at the urging of Buyer and Grimm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rote Dep. at 70, 187-88. Rote placed a round in the chamber, and attempted to push the bolt forward. He felt some resistance as he did so, and Grimm advised him to force the bolt shut.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 62, 82. When Rote exerted more force, the round detonated out-of-battery and injured his hand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 84, 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff filed this suit in state court and asserted various state law claims, including negligence, premises liability and violations of the OPLA. DGFM removed the action to federal court, invoking the removal\n   provision for actions against foreign states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). DGFM then moved to dismiss the claims against it on the basis of foreign sovereign immunity. The court denied the motion and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that DGFM was not entitled to sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rote v. Zel Custom Mfg., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176211\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/383/\">\n    816 F.3d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After engaging in extensive discovery, including much expert discovery, the parties have reported that all claims have been settled, except plaintiff's claims against DGFM and Ammoman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 258.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the Third Amended Complaint, plaintiff asserts that DGFM violated the OPLA by: (1) failing to provide adequate warnings about its ammunition, (2) producing the ammunition out of compliance with manufacturer's representations and (3) defectively designing and manufacturing the ammunition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2307.71 -.77. Plaintiff asserts that Ammoman is liable as a supplier of the allegedly defective ammunition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2307.78. Additionally, plaintiff's spouse asserts a claim for loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This matter is before the court on DGFM's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff does not contest DGFM's motion as it concerns his second and third OPLA claims - those for noncompliance with manufacturer's representations and for defective design and manufacture - and the court will grant the motion as to those claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As plaintiff puts it, the crux his claim against DGFM is for failure to provide adequate warnings about the ammunition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 200 at PAGEID 4100. According to plaintiff, DGFM should have placed its ammunition in packaging denoting it as \"military surplus\" or \"only appropriate for use in a machine gun.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176211\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/383/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176211\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/383/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Evidentiary Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In support of its motion for summary judgment, DGFM has submitted two pieces of evidence to which plaintiff objects. One is a declaration and the other is a foreign judgment. Under Rule 56(c)(2), a party \"may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dr. Arpin's Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant has submitted the declaration of Dr. Robert Arpin, the Director of Coordination in Argentina's General Directorate of Military Factories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 198-5 at PAGEID 4095. Dr. Arpin has held his current position since 1996. He states that he has access to the books and records of DGFM and has reviewed those records as they relate to ammunition manufactured at the factory in Fray Luis Beltr\u00e1n.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arpin Decl. at \u00b6 3. The headstamp marking of \"02 FLB 82\" means that DGFM manufactured the ammunition in February 1982 at the Fray Luis Beltr\u00e1n factory.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 7. DGFM manufactured 12.7 x 99 millimeter ammunition (also known as .50 caliber) until the mid-1980s.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 4. The records show that DGFM provided this ammunition solely to the Argentine military. There is no record of sales or deliveries to any person, company or any other entity.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 5. Dr. Arpin goes on to state that Argentina and the United Kingdom engaged in a military conflict in the Falkland Islands from April to June of 1982. He states that it is possible that Argentine military forces in the conflict abandoned any unused 12.7 x 99 mm cartridges when they withdrew from the Falkland Islands.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the declaration on the grounds that Dr. Arpin lacks personal knowledge of the matters set forth in his declaration. A declaration must be made on personal knowledge and set out facts which would be admissible in evidence. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Plaintiff contends that Dr. Arpin could not have personal knowledge of information predating his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court finds that plaintiff's objection must be denied. As a general matter, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not require that the testimony of a custodian or other qualified witness regarding business records to be based on personal involvement in, or personal knowledge of, the preparation of the records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090021\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/928/#p935\">\n    345 F.3d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935 (6th Cir. 2003) (discussing Fed.

Plaintiff has raised no objections to Dr. Arpin's qualifications to review the records, only his personal knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, those statements of Dr. Arpin which are based his review of the records (paragraphs 4 to 7 of the Declaration) do not appear to be contested by plaintiff. Plaintiff does not dispute that DGFM manufactured the ammunition at issue, that it did so in February 1982 in Fray Luis Beltr\u00e1n, that the ammunition was manufactured for military use or that it was not sold or delivered by DGFM to anyone other than the Argentine military. Indeed, plaintiff's theory of the case assumes the first of these facts to be true and is not reliant on the others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 205 at PAGEID 4250-52 (plaintiff's brief in which he argues that DGFM manufactured the ammunition and that DGFM's intent for using the ammunition is irrelevant to his OPLA claim); Doc. 193 at PAGEID 2683 (deposition of plaintiff's expert witness stating his opinion that the ammunition was made for military use).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff does, however, contest Dr. Arpin's statement concerning the Falkland Islands War (paragraph 8 of the Declaration). His statement is not based on his review of the records but on known historical facts of which the court may take judicial notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 201(b)(2);\n   <em>\n    Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm'n of Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547912\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/292/#p301\">\n    301 U.S. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547912\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/292/#p301\">\n    57 S.Ct. 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547912\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/292/#p301\">\n    81 L.Ed. 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1937). Plaintiff does not dispute that the War took place, that the United Kingdom prevailed or that armaments and ammunition sometimes get abandoned in the theater of conflict. Rather, plaintiff urges the court to reject any suggestion that the particular round of ammunition which injured Rote was in fact abandoned by Argentine forces and taken into the United Kingdom's possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff is correct that it would be pure speculation to say that Rote was injured by a round which had been left in the Falkland Islands. But defendant has not introduced Dr. Arpin's declaration for that purpose. Instead, abandonment of ammunition after the Falkland Islands War serves as one example of when ammunition of the type at issue possibly passed out of the control of the defendant foreign sovereign. This example will be discussed below in relation to the statutory prerequisites for applying the OPLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Foreign Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The foreign judgment contains adjudicated facts which provide a second example of when ammunition of the type that allegedly injured Rote passed out of the control of the foreign sovereign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 198-3 at PAGEID 3854. Defendant has submitted a copy of the original foreign judgment in Spanish, as well as an English translation. The foreign judgment is 227 pages long, but here are the basics. The foreign judgment was issued on March 5, 2013 by the Argentine Federal Chamber of Criminal Cassation. The judgment largely upholds the criminal convictions of numerous government officials for smuggling warfare material, including immense amounts of armaments and ammunition, in the 1990s to Croatia (which was under a United Nations arms embargo) and Ecuador. Among the materials smuggled were 12.7 x 99 millimeter cartridges manufactured\n   by DGFM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547912\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/292/#p301\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"547912\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/301/292/#p301\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at PAGEID 3993-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the admissibility of the foreign judgment on the grounds that it has not been authenticated. Plaintiff believes that defendant has improperly attempted to authenticate the judgment through defendant's Spanish-to-English language translator. Plaintiff argues that the translator is not qualified to translate the documents because she has no legal training and no personal knowledge of the foreign judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's argument stems from a misunderstanding of the evidentiary rules. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(10), authentication may be accomplished by compliance with the Rules of Evidence or with other applicable statutes or rules. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(2)(A), a foreign official record may be authenticated by several methods. One method is where the document is evidenced by \"an official publication of the record,\" in which case it is self-authenticating. Fed. R. Civ.

The court agrees. Defendant has submitted evidence which may provide a likely explanation for how the ammunition went from Argentina to Ohio.

The Ohio Product Liability Act Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff's claim under the OPLA is for inadequate warning or instruction.

DGFM contends that there is no evidence to support an inference that it intended the ammunition to be placed into trade or commerce or to be sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff responds that DGFM's intention for the use of the ammunition is irrelevant. In support, he cites the Sixth Circuit's decision in this lawsuit that DGFM is not entitled to foreign sovereign immunity.

The provision of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act at issue dealt with the \"commercial activity\" exception to immunity.

The evidence establishes without genuine dispute that the foreign sovereign manufactured the ammunition exclusively for its own internal, military use. There is no evidence that DGFM manufactured the ammunition for the purpose of bringing it into an exchange of goods or commodities or with the intention of selling it for consideration. The court finds as a matter of law that the OPLA's definition of a product is not satisfied in this situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jessop v.

Consider, for instance, the inadequate warning provision under which plaintiff seeks to hold DGFM liable. O.R.C. \u00a7 2307.76. It is premised on an \"at the time of marketing\" and \"post-marketing\" dichotomy. Or consider the statute of repose. O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.10(C)(1). The triggering event is delivery to the \"first purchaser.\" These statutory reference points do not apply here because DGFM never marketed the ammunition nor delivered it to a purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   DGFM has identified two occasions in which 12.7 x 99 mm ammunition potentially passed out of the control of the Argentine military. The first was by abandonment when Argentina lost the Falkland Islands War in 1982. The second was by smuggling when a cabal of government officials sold warfare material in the 1990s to Croatia and Ecuador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The OPLA's definition of a product is not satisfied by either situation. In no sense can wartime abandonment of ammunition in a theater of conflict count as an action done with the purpose of introducing the ammunition into trade or commerce. And the movement or exchange of the ammunition to Croatia and Ecuador was accomplished without the authorization of the foreign sovereign. That is, it was not the purpose or intent of Argentina to supply the ammunition to Croatia and Ecuador. As the foreign judgment establishes, the movement of the ammunition was an act of smuggling which occurred contrary to the laws of Argentina and for which the individuals responsible incurred criminal sanctions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff emphasizes that it is common knowledge that military goods eventually find their way into the marketplace.

The document is more of a notice than a motion. Plaintiff concedes that \"there is no evidence that Ammoman is liable for its\n   own negligence.\" Doc. 200 at PAGEID 4102. Plaintiff characterizes his claim as being wholly dependent upon him showing that Ammoman supplied a product for which DGFM is liable under the OPLA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20661\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20661\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To prevail on this claim, [plaintiff] must show that DGFM is liable under [the OPLA] and that one of the eight conditions under which Ammoman can be held liable under Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2307.78(B) applies.\"). Thus, plaintiff advises the court that he will seek to hold Ammoman liable only if he \"obtain[s] a judgment against DGFM and DGFM is unable to satisfy the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20661\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20661\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Now that the court has granted summary judgment to DGFM on all claims, it would appear that plaintiff does not have a claim to pursue against Ammoman. Plaintiff is therefore instructed to file a statement within ten days of the date of this order indicating whether he intends to pursue a supplier liability claim against Ammoman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, DGFM's motion for summary judgment (doc. 197) is GRANTED. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against Ammoman (doc. 200) is DENIED. The Clerk of Court shall terminate DGFM's motions to strike the jury demand (doc. 231) and to excuse DGFM from sending a client representative to attend the final pretrial conference (doc. 238) as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff shall notify the court within ten days of the date of this order whether he intends to pursue a supplier liability claim against Ammoman.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The complaint alleged that the defective design and manufacture was due to a \"protruding primer.\" Discovery established that the ammunition did not have a protruding primer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Defendant Zel filed a separate opposition brief to DGFM's motion for summary judgment. Zel contends that the ammunition which injured Rote was defective because the shoulder and neck measurements varied from design specifications. Plaintiff, however, has not adopted this theory of recovery and the court dismisses plaintiff's claim for defective design and manufacture.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    According to plaintiff, Ammoman has produced minimal discovery. Doc. 205 at PAGEID 4249. PW Arm's representative made statements during his deposition suggesting that other importers and dealers like PW Arm's exist and that Ammoman could have purchased ammunition from any of them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Phineas Dep. at 22, 23, 27, 28, 43, 45, 80.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    One might argue, though plaintiff does not, that the foreign sovereign should be responsible for the conduct of its own officials, even if unauthorized.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.03 (Apparent Authority). Their conduct arguably satisfies the OPLA in that they appear to have acted with the purpose of supplying the ammunition for introduction into trade or commerce and that they did in fact sell the ammunition to Croatia and Ecuador.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Such a theory would nonetheless fail. The doctrine of apparent authority does not apply to sovereigns, save for exceptions that do not apply here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.03, cmt. g (discussing governmental actors). Moreover, even if the unlawful actions of the government officials caused the OPLA's definition of a \"product\" to be satisfied, the statute of repose would present an insurmountable obstacle for plaintiff. The statute provides that no cause of action shall accrue against the manufacturer of a product \"later than ten years from the date that the product was delivered to its first purchaser.\" O.R.C. \u00a7 2305.10(C)(1). The first purchaser under this theory would be military groups in Croatia or Ecuador, and their purchases took place in the first half of the 1990s, more than ten years before plaintiff's injury in 2011.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
