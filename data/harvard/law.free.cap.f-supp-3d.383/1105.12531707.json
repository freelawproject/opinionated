Plaintiff alleges that Guardian negligently allowed its tenants to smoke on its property, which resulted in a fire damaging Plaintiff's property. Plaintiff also alleges housing discrimination under the federal Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\") and its state counterpart. Defendants move for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   United States Magistrate Judge Youlee Yim You issued a Findings and Recommendation in this case on December 12, 2018. ECF 41. Judge You had previously issued a findings and recommendation recommending that summary judgment be granted against Plaintiff's discrimination claim and denied on Plaintiff's negligence claim. ECF 32. Judge You withdrew her findings and recommendation and construed Defendant's objections as a motion for reconsideration. ECF 35, 37. On reconsideration, Judge You recommended that Defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted on all claims and that the case be dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiff filed objections, ECF 43, to which Defendants responded. ECF 45. For the reasons discussed below, after a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the Court agrees with the recommendation to grant summary judgment on all claims, but does not adopt the reasoning related to Plaintiff's housing discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, the Court adopts in part the Findings and Recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiff argues that the FHA protects victims of domestic violence, noting that Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") enforces such discriminatory conduct as a violation of the FHA. Plaintiff also cites to a 2011 HUD memorandum and a consent decree, approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, in which HUD had issued a charge for discrimination against domestic violence victims. Defendants respond that Plaintiff's objections are untimely, that the fair housing laws do not include victims of domestic violence as a protected class, and that, even if they did Plaintiff has not shown a genuine issue for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Judge You, however, withdrew her first Findings and Recommendation. Judge You issued a second Findings and Recommendation, with a new deadline for objections. Plaintiff filed her objections before this second deadline. Accordingly, they are timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Victims of Domestic Violence Under the FHA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The FHA does not expressly include domestic violence victims or survivors as protected classes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (making unlawful discriminatory practices based on \"race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin\").

Morris Cty. Hous. Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205962478\">\n    2018 WL 5962478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D.N.J. Nov. 13, 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Barnett v. Pickering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20144359\">\n    2010 WL 144359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. N.H. Jan. 8, 2010). The mere fact that being a victim of domestic violence is not specifically protected under the FHA, however, is not dispositive. As the authorities discussed above have noted, being a victim of domestic violence, under certain circumstances, can give rise to a claim of sex or gender discrimination under the FHA. Thus, summary judgment against Plaintiff's housing discrimination claims is not warranted simply because those claims are based on her status as a domestic violence victim. The relevant inquiry is whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether she has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claim for gender or sex discrimination under the FHA as a result of her status as a domestic violence victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis of Plaintiff's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that she was discriminated against because Defendant Herb, manager of Mountain Knolls (the apartment complex in which Plaintiff resided), wanted Plaintiff to vacate her apartment after an August 2015 domestic violence incident between Plaintiff and her ex-boyfriend that ended in the ex-boyfriend's arrest\n   (the \"Incident\"). Defendants do not dispute that, after the Incident, Herb communicated to Plaintiff that other tenants in the apartment complex felt the arrest of Plaintiff's ex-boyfriend posed a safety risk to the community. It is also undisputed that Herb emailed Plaintiff-who left to stay with her mother after the incident-to express concerns that Plaintiff's apartment had been abandoned. Plaintiff offers no evidence, however, that Herb took any steps to evict Plaintiff or otherwise pressure her to leave her apartment. Although Plaintiff subjectively believes Herb's actions were an attempt to force Plaintiff to vacate her apartment because of the Incident, neither of Herb's actions give rise to the inference that Herb unlawfully discriminated against Plaintiff because she was a victim of domestic violence or because of her gender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff further claims that she was discriminated against in the terms and conditions of her rent because Defendants never repaired the damage to Plaintiff's carpet and closet doors caused during the Incident. Plaintiff, however, offers no evidence that Defendants made repairs of similar damage for any other tenants within a similar time frame. It may well be that a reasonable landlord would repair carpet and closet doors within six months (the damage occurred in August 2015 and the fire occurred in February 2016, so the window of time for the repairs was six months). For a claim of disparate treatment, however, Plaintiff must provide some evidence that she was treated differently than other tenants. Plaintiff offers no evidence relating to repairs of any other tenant. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not shown that she was treated differently in the terms and conditions of her unit because of her sex or gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff claims that she was discriminated against when Defendants did not provide her a replacement unit or storage after her unit was damaged by a fire caused by neighboring tenant. Although other tenants were provided with alternative units after the fire, it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not ask whether other units were available or apply to another property owned by Guardian. Instead, Plaintiff chose to use her renter's insurance policy to rent a hotel room. Nor has Plaintiff shown that Defendants\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   offered units to other tenants but did not make the same offer to her. Additionally, Defendants did not tell Plaintiff that she could not apply to another Guardian-owned property. Because Plaintiff has not shown that she requested and was denied a rental relationship, or was otherwise treated in differently than other tenants, she has not shown discriminatory treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiff's status as victim of domestic violence might constitute gender or sex discrimination under the FHA, she has not shown a genuine issue of material fact that she was discriminated against because of her status as a victim of domestic violence or because of her sex or gender. Even when considering the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the evidence does not support an FHA discrimination claim. Accordingly, summary judgment on this claim is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTS\n   </strong>\n   in part Judge You's Findings and Recommendation (ECF 41), as set forth herein.
