Taylor asserts that Patrol Officer Ryan Moore violated her civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act during a traffic stop in Falmouth, Massachusetts. She alleges that Moore used excessive force when, after stopping her for suspected drunk driving, he grabbed her arm, pulled her out of the car, put her on the ground, placed his knee on her back, and tased her. She also asserts a claim against the Town of Falmouth for its failure to discipline, train, or supervise its officers. Defendants move for summary judgment, arguing that Moore is protected by qualified immunity and that Taylor presents no evidence to support an allegation that the Town was deliberately indifferent to the rights of its citizens. After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties heavily dispute the facts concerning the night in question, but at this stage of the litigation, the Court reviews the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n   <em>\n    Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R.

Taylor met a friend for dinner at Bobby Byrne's Restaurant and Pub in Mashpee on Cape Cod. She had a beer and ordered dinner. Afterwards, Taylor drove to two other bars. Taylor does not remember the name of the second bar, or how long she stayed there. She does remember driving to the third location, the A\u00f1ejo Mexican Bistro &amp; Tequila Bar in Falmouth, Massachusetts. At A\u00f1ejo, Taylor had a margarita. When Taylor left A\u00f1ejo to drive home, bar employees took down her license plate number and called\n   the police to report suspected drunk driving. Falmouth patrol officers were subsequently dispatched to find her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Taylor was driving herself home along Route 28 in Falmouth when she observed two bicyclists on her right and had to \"swerve\" to go around them. Almost immediately afterwards, Taylor saw blue police lights go on behind her. Docket No. 58-1 at 53:12-18. She pulled over, turned her car off, and produced her license and registration when the officer approached her driver-side window. Patrol Officer Ryan Moore of the Falmouth Police Department asked Taylor if she knew why he had pulled her over, and she said she did not. She lied and said that she was coming from work. After further conversation, Taylor eventually admitted that she had been at A\u00f1ejo. Taylor knew she was in trouble at the time because she had consumed too much alcohol to drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Moore asked Taylor to \"step out of the car,\" at which point Taylor said that she \"would like to wait for backup.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n    at 56:4-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moore then went back to his cruiser. When Moore returned to Taylor's car, he again requested that she step out of the vehicle and asked Taylor to perform a field sobriety test. At this point Moore's demeanor was \"forceful\" but he was not \"yelling.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n    at 57:3-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taylor stated again that she \"would wait for backup\" before getting out of the car.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n    at 56:4-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Docket No. 64-1 at 68:22. Moore continued to tell Taylor that she needed to take a field sobriety test, or she would be arrested based on his observations. Taylor continued to refuse to get out of the car without back-up present. Moore went back to the rear of the vehicle and called dispatch to send another police unit. Moore returned to Taylor's driver-side window and again asked her to get out of the car. And again, Taylor refused. She does not know exactly how many times Moore told her to get out the car during their conversation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Use of Force\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Without warning, Moore proceeded to reach in through Taylor's open driver-side window, open the car door, grab Taylor's arm, and pull her out of the car. Once Taylor was out of the car, Moore dragged Taylor to the rear of the vehicle, away from the road. Taylor was not resisting at this point and her feet barely hit the ground. Moore then put Taylor on the ground, face first. Taylor describes being \"slammed\" into the ground causing her eye to hit a rock. Docket No. 34 \u00b6 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With Taylor prone on the ground, Moore pressed his knee into her back, a position he characterizes as a \"full body mount.\" Docket No. 34 \u00b6 19; Docket No. 64 \u00b6 101. Moore attempted to get control of Taylor's hands in order to handcuff her. Taylor was screaming for help at this point. Moore ordered her to stop resisting and put her hands behind her back for cuffing. Whenever she attempted to lift her head off the ground, Moore pushed it back down. Taylor pleaded for Moore to release her, stating that she would do whatever he wanted her to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With his knee still on top of Taylor's back, Moore unholstered his taser and threatened to deploy it. Taylor asserts that the \"full body mount\" position made it impossible for her to comply with Moore's orders. The only thing she could move was her head and hear hands were beside her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moore told Taylor that if she \"didn't shut up he was going to taze [her].\" Docket No. 58-1 at 75:22-24; Docket No. 64-1 at 81:8-11. Taylor tried to look back at Moore, but he proceeded to lift her shirt and place the taser's electrodes directly on her back. Moore then deployed his taser in \"drive-stun\" mode. The parties dispute how many times Moore tased Taylor, with Taylor asserting that she was tased at least two times. Taylor screamed out in pain and then went motionless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Moore stayed with his knee on Taylor's back, using his body weight to control her until a second officer arrived. At the time of the incident, Taylor was five feet, five inches tall and weighed 125 pounds. Officer Walker arrived at the scene, and the two officers placed Taylor in handcuffs. The officers lifted Taylor off the ground and placed her in the back of a police cruiser, with one officer having to fold her legs into the car in order to close the door because she was unable to do so at that point due to the taser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The officers transported Taylor back to the police station where she was booked and charged with several offenses. Sergeant Cummings made notes regarding Taylor's injuries. Photographs of her injuries were also taken, which show cuts, scratches, and abrasions on Taylor's arms, shoulders, and right hand. Photos also appear to show four marks on Taylor's back. Taylor refused to take a breathalyzer test and was ultimately released to her mother and sister at 2:00 AM on September 10, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Aftermath\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later on September 10, Taylor appeared in court and then went to Falmouth Hospital for emergency medical care. Taylor was diagnosed with facial trauma, with additional diagnoses of concussion and headache. Since the incident, Taylor has experienced frequent migraines, headaches, nausea, sound and light sensitivity. In November of 2016, Dr. Deborah Tepper diagnosed Taylor with chronic post-traumatic headaches, which started immediately after her concussion. In March of 2018, Taylor sought evaluation for what she described as near daily headaches and was diagnosed by Dr. John Pettinato with chronic migraines. With respect to the charges against her, Taylor eventually admitted to facts sufficient to make out the charge of driving under the influence, which was continued without a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Experts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Medical Expert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Gary Stanton conducted a physical examination of Taylor on December 13, 2018 and reviewed her prior medical records, including notes from Drs. Tepper and Pettinato. After his physical examination of the Plaintiff, Dr. Stanton diagnosed her with postconcussion syndrome, migraines, cough /sneeze-induced headaches, and Chiari I malformation. As to the causal relationship for Taylor's headaches, Dr. Station opined: \"In my opinion, the incident of 9/09/2014 was causally related to Ms. Taylor's ongoing complaints of posttraumatic headaches, which in her case is a symptom of a postconcussion syndrome.\" Docket No. 75-5 at 7. He went on to state that Taylor's \"postconcussion syndrome [was] unlikely to substantially change in the next year,\" and that while she complained of \"mild memory difficulties,\" it \"does not interfere with activities of daily living.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Use of Force Expert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   David W. O'Laughlin, Taylor's use-of-force consultant, has more than 43 years of experience in law enforcement, is a certified master instructor in the use of force,\n   and holds more than 30 additional federal, state, and industry certifications in law enforcement force-related disciplines. After reviewing Falmouth Police Department policies, and reports from the night of the incident, O'Laughlin stated that \"[i]n [his] many years as a defensive tactics instructor[,] [he had] not heard of [a full body mount] and [does] not recognize it as one being taught by the Massachusetts Police Training Committee.\" Docket No. 64-3 at 4. He opined that \"Moore had no legitimate reason to remove [Taylor] from the vehicle, as the vehicle was pulled to the side of the road, was not running and was not creating a hazard.... [H]er forceful removal from her vehicle was both unreasonable and unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p52\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As to the tasing, O'Laughlin stated Moore's use of an electronic control device was \"both extreme and unnecessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. However, he conceded that she was only tased once.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He explained that \"[p]art of defensive tactics training incorporates the practice of de-escalation, using time and distance and the avoidance of physical force.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Officer Moore,\" O'Laughlin observed, \"had called for back-up assistance and yet decided not to wait for that assistance, but instead became involved in actions using a significant amount of force on an unarmed female who at best was offering passive resistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He continued that tasing \"is usually reserved for use on a person who has committed a crime of violence and is presenting a danger or high risk of harm to the officer,\" and that \"committing traffic violations, and being suspected of driving under the influence does not rise to ... a level of danger to the officer that would result in the use of such a high level of force.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, O'Laughlin concluded that Moore did not act in accordance with the Falmouth police Department's policy on electronic control devices because \"[i]t is the policy of [the FPD] to use only that level of force reasonable to control or otherwise subdue violent or potentially violent individuals,\" and \"Taylor could not have posed a threat to Officer Moore or any others, as she was down, on the ground, in a so-called 'full body mount' at the point of being tasered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Taser Expert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants initially submitted an affidavit from Bryan Chiles, the product compliance manager and former validation test manager of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (formerly TASER International, Inc.), and then submitted a second affidavit after the motion hearing. Chiles is currently responsible for coordinating the testing and certification of Axon's products, and for conducting forensic investigations of Axon's Conducted Energy Weapons (CEW) products. The TASER X2 CEW has two cartridge bays which allow two taser cartridges to be installed at the same time. In his second affidavit, Chiles explained that each cartridge has two electrodes, so that when both cartridges are installed in the taser, the taser has four total electrodes - two in the first cartridge bay and two in the second cartridge bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There are two main ways to use a CEW - deploy a cartridge, in which probes are fired at the subject, or drive-stun application, in which the CEW is applied directly to the skin of the subject without deploying the probes. Cartridge deployment is designed to cause neuromuscular incapacitation, where as drive-stun application only affects the sensory nerves of a subject and does not cause a subject to lose voluntary muscle movement. When the front of the X2 CEW is pressed against a subject's skin for a drive-stun application, \"four burn marks in the pattern of the four X2 CEW cartridge electrodes may be visible on the skin from a\n   single application.\" Docket No. 78-4 \u00b6 15, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Chiles assertion that the X2 has four electrodes contradicts the testimony of Detective Christopher Bartolomei, submitted by Defendants prior to the motion hearing. Bartolomei, the certified TASER and defensive tactics instructor for the Falmouth Police Department, stated that the \"Arc discharge also allows for an officer to use the X2 in the 'drive-stun' (touch/contact) mode in which electrical impulses are transmitted to an individual superficially through\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   fixed electrodes on the front of the Taser.\" Docket No. 58-6 \u00b6 13, at 2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Turning to the taser log submitted by Defendants, Chiles explains that the X2 CEW automatically records the date, time, and details of each event in its event log (also known as a download report or TASER report). The X2 CEW records \"every time the weapon is armed, the trigger is pulled, either ARC switch is pressed to activate the high voltage, the menu is accessed, the time is changed, the safety switch is placed in the safe position,\" etc. Docket No. 58-6 \u00b6 13, at 9. A duration listed in the event log is rounded up to the nearest second, so a duration of 1 second can be anything from less than 0.05 seconds to 1.49 seconds. An \"arc\" event in the log means one of the X2 CEW's arc switches was pressed for more than 0.25 seconds in which high voltage was activated for both cartridge bays, but neither cartridge was deployed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29, at 12. Chiles's analysis of Moore's X2 CEW event log reveals that the arc button activating high voltage was pressed twice during the night, once at 10:54:25 p.m. at the beginning of Moore's shift and again at 11:35:04 p.m. for a recorded duration of one second each. Chiles concludes that \"[i]n total, from September 9, 2014 11:00 p.m. to September 10, 2014, 12:00 a.m., this CEW activated to deliver electricity in 'drive stun' (arc) mode for a duration of one (1) second.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34, at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

To this point, Moore's actions were not objectively unreasonable in light of the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Taylor also alleges Moore used excessive force in taking her to the ground, placing her in a \"full body mount,\" and tasing her. The\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors cut both ways. With respect to the first factor - the severity of the crime - drunk driving is a serious offense, but once Moore pulled Taylor out of the car, she was no longer able to drive away while intoxicated. Moreover, it is not a violent crime like an assault or robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

This factor weighs slightly in Defendants' favor. As to the second\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor - whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others - Taylor was not an immediate threat to other motorists, bicyclists, or Moore once she was out of the car. There is no evidence that Taylor was threatening Moore once she was out of the car, and a \"jury could supportably find that, at the time of the tasing, [Taylor] had been subdued [via a \"full body mount\"] to a point at which she no longer posed a threat.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520245\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/1/#p8\">\n    917 F.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This factor weighs in favor of Taylor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With respect to the third\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor - whether she was actually resisting arrest - the parties heavily dispute whether Taylor actually resisted arrest while on the ground. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Taylor, a reasonable jury could find she was not resisting when Moore dragged her to the rear of the vehicle and slammed her to the ground before Moore tased her. Instead, in her version, Taylor was not physically able to comply with any order to put her hands behind her back because of the way in which Moore was kneeling on her back in a \"full body mount.\" Taylor pleaded with Moore that she would do anything he wanted at that point, and yet when Taylor looked back at Moore, he proceeded to deploy a pain compliance tool in \"drive-stun\" mode. Crediting her account, the Court concludes this\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in Taylor's favor. Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors point in conflicting directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The parties dispute whether Moore tased Taylor once or twice. In her deposition, Taylor testified that she remembered being tased \"[a]t least twice.\" Docket No. 64-1 at 83:16-17. She has also provided a photo distinctly showing four prong marks on her upper right back. The record has been confusing on this point. Initially, Defendants put forward evidence that the device only had two electrodes. After the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Defendants submit that the taser Moore used on the night of the incident contained four flat electrodes, not two like some common taser models. Defendants also submit a taser log, downloaded from the internal computer of the taser Moore used, indicating that the taser \"arc[ed]\" - or was only deployed - once during Moore's encounter with Taylor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 78-2 at 3. And Plaintiff's expert seems to concede that the log shows Taylor was only tased once. Defendants argue that based on the record, the court must find that Taylor was only tased once.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

While the calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments, Moore's use of his taser in this case was not done in a split-second but was a deliberate choice, as evidenced by his threatening her to be quiet and lifting her shirt to apply the taser electrodes. Additionally, Plaintiff's expert opines that Moore's use of the taser under these circumstances was \"both extreme and unnecessary\" because Moore \"had called for back-up assistance and yet decided not to wait for that assistance, but instead became involved in actions using a significant amount of force on an unarmed female who at best was offering passive resistance.\" Docket No. 64-3 at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Clearly Established\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Having sufficiently shown a constitutional violation, Taylor must next show that the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of the violation.

Defendants assert that even on the ground, Taylor was resisting arrest and refused to put her flailing hands behind her back, while Taylor states that she could not comply because she was unable to move while prone, on the street, with Moore's knee pinned on her back in a full body mount. Moreover, she claims Moore used excessive force when he \"slammed\" her body to the ground and then repeatedly pushed her head into the ground, causing a concussion, even after she agreed to do whatever Moore wanted. These are exactly the kind of fact disputes meant for trial. Additionally, the record indicates that Moore simply told Taylor to \"shut up\" or be tased, but tasing someone for \"insolence\" qualifies as a clearly established constitutional violation under\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , while tasing someone for failing to comply with a direct order to put her hands behind her back shields Moore from liability under\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, it was clearly established in 2010 that \"slamming\" a slightly built, non-violent drunk driver into the ground when she was not given an opportunity to submit is a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raiche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3790598\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/623/30/#p35\">\n    623 F.3d at 36-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding defendant police officer used excessive force when he tackled a stationary individual who was pulled over for a minor infraction and posed no threat to officer safety).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because of the unresolved factual disputes regarding Moore's use of force, the claim of qualified immunity is denied without prejudice to its being reasserted at trial after resolution of factual questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Prior to the September 2014 incident, Moore received use of force training in 2013. In the spring of 2014, a citizen complaint was reported against Moore for discourtesy and racial bias. An internal affairs investigation exonerated Moore on the racial bias claim but sustained the claim for discourtesy and Moore was provided with verbal counseling. Between January 2010 and March 2018, Moore did not receive a citizen complaint against him alleging excessive force. Over this same time period, there were nine complaints made to the Falmouth Police Department regarding excessive force, assault and battery, or use or force. Each was investigated by internal affairs, which sustained one of the complaints resulting in verbal counseling.

For eight years, between January 2010 and March 2018, Moore did not receive one citizen complaint alleging excessive force. And over that same time period, there were only nine complaints made to the Falmouth Police Department regarding excessive force, assault and battery, or use of force. Each was investigated with one being sustained, and the Court cannot, from these complaints alone, draw an inference that Falmouth was indifferent to the behavior of its officers. Taylor provides a compilation of citizen complaints between 2011 and 2014, and while it shows that some officers have been accused of harassment quite frequently, it also shows Falmouth's internal affairs officers actually sustained a fair number of claims against officers in 2013 and 2014 leading up to the incident, resulting in various disciplinary actions. Additionally, when complaints were lodged against Moore in the spring of 2014, internal affairs sustained one claim of discourtesy and provided verbal counseling. On these facts, Taylor has not shown that Falmouth was deliberately indifferent to its officers' behavior with respect to use of force.
