GILLIAM, JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. and Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc. (collectively, \"Brookdale\") filed a motion to stay proceedings pending its appeal of the Court's order denying Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. Dkt. No. 94. Brookdale also filed a motion requesting the Court to certify for interlocutory appeal the question of whether Brookdale facilities are public accommodations under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). Dkt. No. 99. The Court finds that this matter is appropriate for disposition without oral argument and the matter is deemed submitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civil L.R. 7-1(b). For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to stay\n   proceedings and motion to certify for interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint against Brookdale for violations of the ADA, the Unruh Civil Rights Act (\"Unruh Act\"), the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business and Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 7200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and California Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7 15610, based on the conditions of Brookdale's assisted living facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. No. 52 (\"SAC\"). In November 2018, Brookdale filed three motions: (1) motion to compel Plaintiffs Helen Carlson and Lawrence Quinlan to arbitrate, Dkt. No. 59; (2) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' SAC, Dkt. No. 60; and (3) motion to strike the class allegations of Plaintiffs' SAC, Dkt. No. 61. The Court denied Brookdale's motion to compel arbitration and motion to strike, and granted in part and denied in part Brookdale's motion to dismiss. Dkt. No. 85 (\"January 25 Order\"). Brookdale appealed the Court's order denying the motion to compel arbitration, Dkt. No. 93, and filed the present motion to stay proceedings related to Plaintiffs Carlson and Quinlan pending appeal, Dkt. No. 94. Brookdale also filed a motion to certify for interlocutory appeal the Court's finding that Brookdale facilities are public accommodations under the ADA. Dkt. No. 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO STAY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Court's Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Brookdale moved to compel Plaintiff Helen Carlson to arbitrate based on a 2011 Agreement, which Plaintiffs argued was later superseded by a December 2017 Agreement. Dkt. No. 59. In 2011, Ms. Carlson entered into a standardized residency agreement and arbitration addendum before moving into a Brookdale facility. SAC \u00b6 115. Ms. Carlson entered into a new residency agreement in December 2017, under which she opted out of the arbitration provision. Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at 9-12. The Court found that the December 2017 Agreement controlled and the arbitration opt-out applied to all claims arising from her stay at the Brookdale facility. January 25 Order at 6-7. Further, based on the plain language of the arbitration provision, the Court held that the opt-out retroactively applied to the claims asserted in this lawsuit, notwithstanding that the lawsuit was filed before the December 2017 Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"The 2017 arbitration provision applies to 'claims ... whether existing or arising in the future.' \") (quoting Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at 10). Therefore, by the plain language of the December 2017 Agreement, Ms. Carlson was not compelled to arbitrate her claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As to Plaintiff Lawrence Quinlan, the Court found that there was no agency relationship between him and his son, Phillip Quinlan, at the time Phillip Quinlan signed a 2015 residency agreement containing an arbitration opt-out clause. January 25 Order at 7-9. Mr. Quinlan did not grant his son power of attorney until January 2016. Dkt. No. 31-4, Ex. A. Brookdale offered no evidence that Mr. Quinlan, either by his conduct or inaction, caused Brookdale to believe that Phillip Quinlan was acting as his agent when Phillip Quinlan executed the residency agreement. January 25 Order at 8. The Court also rejected Brookdale's equitable estoppel argument, as none of Plaintiffs' claims relies on the residency agreements as valid and enforceable contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on these findings, the Court denied Brookdale's motion to compel Plaintiffs Carlson and Quinlan to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has held that a district court's order denying a motion to compel arbitration does not automatically result in a mandatory stay of proceedings pending appeal of that order.\n   <em>\n    Britton v.

Instead, the district court has discretion to decide whether to stay proceedings pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540532\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/1405/#p1412\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The party requesting the stay bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify exercise of that discretion.\n   <em>\n    Nken v.

To determine whether the moving party has met its burden, the Supreme Court articulated the following four-factor test: \"(1) whether the [movant] has made a strong showing that [the movant] is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the [movant] will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n    at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Courts in the Ninth Circuit weigh these factors with a \"general balancing\" or \"sliding scale\" approach, under which \"a stronger showing of one element may offset a weaker showing of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Leiva-Perez v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203423\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/962/#p964\">\n    640 F.3d 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (9th Cir. 2011). As to the first factor, if a movant is unable to show a \"strong likelihood of success,\" then the movant must at least demonstrate that the appeal presents a \"substantial case on the merits,\" or that there are \"serious legal questions\" raised.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203423\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/962/#p964\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203423\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/962/#p964\">\n    at 965-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, under this lower threshold, the movant must then demonstrate that the balance of hardships under the second and third factor tips sharply in the movant's favor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203423\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/962/#p964\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203423\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/962/#p964\">\n    at 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

No. 94 at 5. For Ms. Carlson, Brookdale proffers that there is a substantial issue as to whether the opt-out provision in the December 2017 \"subject-matter-specific agreement\" can supersede an earlier, \"broader agreement to arbitrate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203423\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/962/#p964\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The substantial issue as to Mr. Quinlan, according to Brookdale, is whether an \"implied agent may bind a principal as to arbitration\" in light of \"Congress's preference for arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Ninth Circuit has not clearly defined the phrase \"substantial case on the merits,\" but courts in this district have interpreted the phrase to mean a case that: (1) \"raises genuine matters of first impression within the Ninth Circuit\"; (2) may \"implicate a constitutional question\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   or (3) \"otherwise address[es] a pressing legal issue which urges that the Ninth Circuit hear the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20123610\">\n    2013 WL 123610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (citing cases in this district granting stays because there was a substantial question as to whether state precedent is preempted by the FAA);\n   <em>\n    Blair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202234049\">\n    2018 WL 2234049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (finding substantial question as to whether a California Supreme Court case is preempted by the FAA);\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207273911\">\n    2014 WL 7273911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding substantial question in case where contracts were poorly-constructed and contained ambiguous and inconsistent provisions);\n   <em>\n    Zaborowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201832638\">\n    2013 WL 1832638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (finding substantial question as to the applicability of a Supreme Court case to California law governing arbitration agreements). The Court will follow the same approach, as it is consistent with public policy recognizing that while a stay is an \"intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review,\" there may be instances when enforcement of a determination should be stayed to allow the reviewing court ample time to consider the merits and prevent \"irreparable injury to the parties or to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n    556 U.S. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653916\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/418/#p433\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Scripps-Howard Radio v.

Any other approach would allow a party to indefinitely stall trial \"simply by bringing a frivolous motion to compel arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Britton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540532\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/916/1405/#p1412\">\n    916 F.2d at 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court does not find that Brookdale's arguments constitute substantial questions that raise genuine matters of first impression with the Ninth Circuit, implicate a constitutional question, or otherwise address a pressing legal issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20123610\">\n    2013 WL 123610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Rather, the Court resolved Brookdale's arguments through application of well-settled contract and agency principles. With respect to Ms. Carlson, Brookdale asserts that the Court was incorrect as a matter of contract interpretation when it read the opt-out in the December 2017 Agreement to apply to \"[a]ny and all claims arising out of, or in any way relating to, this Agreement or your stay at the Community.\" Dkt. No. 94 at 6 (quoting January 25 Order at 6). But that is\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   what the arbitration provision said, in unambiguous, plain language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. [ ] Any and all claims or controversies arising out of, or in any way relating to, this Agreement or your stay at the Community, excluding any action for eviction, and including disputes regarding interpretation of this Agreement, whether arising out of State or Federal law, whether existing or arising in the future, whether for statutory, compensatory or punitive damages and whether sounding in breach of contract, tort or breach of statutory duties, irrespective of the basis for the duty or the legal theories upon which the claim is asserted, shall be submitted to binding arbitration, as provided below, and shall not be filed in a court of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dkt. No. 38-1, Ex. D at 10. The appeal thus poses no serious legal issues of contract interpretation, and Brookdale's position is contrary to the plain language of the provision itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20123610\">\n    2013 WL 123610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"Notwithstanding the FAA's strong preference for arbitration where contracts raise doubts, the Court held that 'here there is no doubt.' The Court relied only on the four corners of the contract, and did not rest on or implicate any constitutional issue\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Brookdale's second purportedly substantial question is whether an implied agent\n   may bind a principal to arbitration. Dkt. No. 94 at 6. But Brookdale's reading of the January 25 Order is misplaced. The Court did not address whether an implied agent may bind a principal to arbitration, because it held that Phillip Quinlan, Mr. Quinlan's son, was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an agent under principles of \"apparent authority.\" January 25 Order at 8. As Brookdale correctly notes, it \"is black letter law that agency may generally be implied,\" but the Court held that Brookdale offered no evidence that Mr. Quinlan, either by conduct or inaction, \"caused Brookdale to believe Phillip Quinlan was acting as his agent when he executed the 2015 residency agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Brookdale seems to suggest that Congress's \"preference for arbitration\" compels the Court to disregard well-established agency principles and presume an implied agency relationship within the arbitration context, even when there simply is no evidence of such a relationship. Dkt. No. 94 at 7. But the Court is doubtful that the law requires that result, and Brookdale's cases do not stand for such a position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kindred Nursing Ctrs.

Dkt. No. 94 at 9-10. However, litigation will move forward regardless of the outcome of Brookdale's appeal, as the appeal only concerns two Plaintiffs.
