It is the \"n-word\"- a word that, for reasons so obvious the Court need not even mention them-seems to bring division, anger and offense wherever it rears its head. And so it is in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Danyelle Bennett filed this action against her now-former employer, Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee, alleging violation of her rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, article I section 19 of the Tennessee Constitution, and the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pending before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 37), supported by an accompanying brief (Doc. No. 38) to which Defendant filed a response (Doc. No. 51), to which Plaintiff in turn replied (Doc. No. 61). Also before the Court is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 33), supported by an accompanying brief (Doc. No. 34), to which Plaintiff filed a response (Doc. No. 54), to which Defendant replied (Doc. No. 62). For the below-stated reasons, Plaintiff's motion will be denied, and Defendant's motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff worked for fifteen years as a dispatcher at the Department of Emergency Communications Center (\"the Department\") of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee. (Doc. No. 52 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). The Department requires its employees to wear uniforms. However, each year the Department holds \"Super Hero/Villain Day,\" in which employees may choose to forgo their usual uniforms and instead wear apparel of their choice that depicts a hero or villain (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). On April 13, 2016, the Department held its annual \"Super Hero/Villain Day.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Plaintiff wore a red sweatshirt bearing the name of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump over the slogan \"Make American Great Again!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). The following is a depiction of the sweatshirt:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Shortly after the morning roll call, Plaintiff's supervisor, Judy Langston, asked Plaintiff to come to Ms. Langston's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Ms. Langston informed Plaintiff that a co-worker had complained about Plaintiff's sweatshirt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Langston asked Plaintiff to remove the sweatshirt and advised Plaintiff that the sweatshirt was in violation of the Department's dress code policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). About an hour later, Plaintiff's manager, Lisa Baker, and Assistant Director Angie Milliken informed Plaintiff she could resume wearing the sweatshirt if she desired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Plaintiff put the sweatshirt back on. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That afternoon, Ms. Langston again asked Plaintiff to come to her office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). When Plaintiff arrived, Ms. Langston was accompanied by Ms. Baker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Ms. Baker informed Plaintiff that a Service Employees International Union attorney called the Department to report that the union received complaints regarding Plaintiff's sweatshirt and that the attorney believed the sweatshirt was offensive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Baker and Ms. Langston asked Plaintiff to remove the sweatshirt for a second time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As Plaintiff left the Department premises that afternoon, she noticed a group of co-workers gathered outside the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). She believed that they were laughing at her in a mocking manner because she was asked to remove the sweatshirt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The next day, Plaintiff reported this behavior to Ms. Milliken, who informed Plaintiff that she would investigate the event and ensure any such behavior would not reoccur. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Facebook Post\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nearly six months later, on November 9, 2016, the morning after the 2016 Presidential Election, Plaintiff posted an image of an electoral college map that revealed Donald Trump as the winner of the election. (Doc. No. 32-1 at 81 (Dep. Ex. 1) ). A Facebook user, identified as Mohamed Aboulmaouabhib, commented on Plaintiff's post of the electoral college map:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-17\">Mohamed Aboulmaouahib Redneck states voter for Trump, niggaz and latinos states votre for hillary</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82). Plaintiff responded:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-19\">Danyelle Elaine Bennett Thank god we have more America loving rednecks. Red spread across all America. Even niggaz and latinos voted for trump too!</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff's response prompted Shanette Summers, a co-worker of Plaintiff, to comment, \"Was the niggaz statement a\n   joke? I don't offense easily, I'm just really shocked to see that from you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83). Plaintiff defended her comment and replied that her post was in response to Mr. Aboulmaouabhib's \"ignorant message\" and she was \"only racists against ignorance and rudeness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Later Derica Lowe, another co-worker commented, \"I'm offended and this will be reported. As well as deleted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's public Facebook page identified her as an employee of the Department. (Doc. No. 55 at \u00b6 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff's Facebook post triggered five co-workers to issue complaints to either their respective supervisors, their respective managers, or the human resources department about the content of Plaintiff's Facebook post. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Holly Whitworth and NorKeisha Moore approached a supervisor, Lynette Dawkins, and complained of Plaintiff's post. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8). Alisa Franklin, Sally Lyons, and Lakeda Logan also issued complaints regarding Plaintiff's post. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ms. Franklin stated that she did not want to work with someone \"that has those derogatory type feelings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). Ms. Franklin also felt \"tension\" in the workplace due to Plaintiff's Facebook post. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 9, 2016, the same day the post was made, Bruce Sanschargrin, the human resources and training manager for Defendant, called Plaintiff, who was off duty that day, to discuss the post. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Plaintiff returned Mr. Sanschargrin's phone call at 4:55 p.m. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Sanschargrin advised Plaintiff of a complaint made against her regarding her Facebook post and asked her to remove it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). Plaintiff informed Mr. Sanschargrin that she had already done so and had \"unfriended\" most Department employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). Mr. Sanschargrin directed that they discuss the matter further in the morning with Director Donegan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, Director Donegan received an email from the Office of Neighborhoods, a division of the Mayor's office, informing her of a complaint the office received concerning Plaintiff's Facebook post. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). The citizen complainant indicated that based on the content of Plaintiff's post, the complainant feared a person of color may not receive adequate assistance when calling 911. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the morning of November 10, 2016, at a meeting to discuss her Facebook post, Director Donegan and Mr. Sanschargrin expressed their concerns about the impact Plaintiff's Facebook post could have on the office and community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Plaintiff indicated she did not feel the post was offensive and was merely mocking the person who posted before her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18). Director Donegan informed Plaintiff that she was disappointed in her and decided to place Plaintiff on administrative leave with pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following the meeting with Plaintiff, Director Donegan addressed the Department employees at roll-call that morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). She advised the employees that she was aware of the Facebook post, reminded them to be mindful of what they put on Facebook, and ensured them that the post did not represent the views of the agency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Director Donegan also instructed the shift supervisors to discuss the post at\n   their respective roll-calls and ensure employees that the post would be \"handled appropriately.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). When discussing the post during roll-call, one employee, Ms. Franklin, walked out of the room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). Ms. Franklin left the room because she believed it \"sounded like excuses were being made for a derogatory comment on Facebook.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   An investigation ensued, and when it was complete, Mr. Sanschargrin provided Plaintiff with an investigative summary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). Mr. Sanschargrin then drafted and gave to Plaintiff a letter placing her on a three-day administrative leave beginning on November 10, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24). Plaintiff did not return to work after her administrative leave was over because she took unrelated FMLA leave for a previously scheduled surgery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). On December 26, 2016, the Department sent to Plaintiff a charge letter that charged her with violating Civil Service Rules Section 6.7 32 based on an alleged \"failure of good behavior which reflects discredit upon himself, the Department and/or the Metropolitan Government\" and Civil Service Rules Section 6.7 33 based on alleged \"[c]onduct unbecoming of an employee of the Metropolitan Government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). She was also charged with violating the Information Security Policy, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In general, employees who participate in social media and social networking are free to publish their own personal information without censorship by the Metropolitan Government. Employees who choose to identify themselves as the Metropolitan Government employees through social media must state in clear terms that their expressed views are theirs alone and do not reflect the views of the Metropolitan Government. Except as authorized, employees are prohibited from representing the Metropolitan government through their personal use of social media.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Just as employees' behavior outside of work could constitute a failure of good behavior which reflects discredit upon themselves, the Department and/or the Metropolitan Government, their contribution to social media and social networking can do the same. In situations where an employee's social media contribution causes an issue which is substantially related to an important government interest, or which has the effect of creating a disruption in the workplace (e.g., such as where the usage is tied to threatening, discriminatory, harassing, or retaliatory behavior directed at the Metropolitan Government or an employee of the Metropolitan Government), disciplinary action up to and including termination may be merited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 10, 2017, Plaintiff, represented by an attorney, participated in a disciplinary hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). After deliberations, Director Donegan announced that all charges were sustained and that Plaintiff's punishment would be termination of employment. (Doc. No. 32-4 at 33 (Tr. 33:8-24) ). According to Director Donegan, her decision was based on her belief that Plaintiff's post detracted from the community's confidence in and respect for the Department and hindered the effectiveness of the organization as a whole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (Tr. 32:1-33:7) ). Director Donegan also explained to Plaintiff her right to appeal the decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (Tr. 34:1-6) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff appealed the decision to an administrative law judge, who upheld her termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89, 91). She then appealed to the Civil Services Commission, which also upheld her termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92). On March 22, 2017, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit alleging violation of her rights under the First Amendment to the United\n   States Constitution, article I section 19 of the Tennessee Constitution, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Doc. No. 1). On September 6, 2018, Defendant filed its motion for summary judgment as to all claims except for Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim involving the Trump sweatshirt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 33). On September 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed her motion for partial summary judgment as to the First Amendment claim involving the Trump sweatshirt. (Doc. No. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Although Plaintiff avers in her affidavit that she removed the sweatshirt under threat of discipline, in her deposition testimony she directly contradicted this statement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 32-1 at 151:16-152:23).

The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that viewing the facts most favorable to Defendant, a reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff has not suffered an adverse action. Thus, there is a genuine issue of fact as to an element of Plaintiff's retaliation\n   claim, and therefore Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.

In\n   <em>\n    Downing\n   </em>\n   , a public school teacher brought a First Amendment retaliation claim against the school board after she was asked to either take off or cover up her shirt that displayed the words \"Jesus 2000.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476095\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/162/19/#p29\">\n    162 F. Supp. 2d at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that although the plaintiff felt \"disciplined\" by the defendant's reaction to her shirt, there was \"no evidence to suggest an adverse employment action as that concept is defined by the law-such as an express or constructive discharge or demotion; a failure to promote; a reprimand or warning; a reference in a personnel file, or the like.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476095\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/162/19/#p29\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476095\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/162/19/#p29\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that a First Amendment retaliation claim \"requires either a contemporaneous or subsequent adverse impact\" from the exercise of a constitutional right, and this was instead \"a single incident for which [the plaintiff] suffered no later discipline.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476095\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/162/19/#p29\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In order words, the defendant's mere act of putting a stop to the plaintiff's exercise of First Amendment rights-allegedly accomplished here by forcing Plaintiff to remove the sweatshirt-cannot qualify as the necessary act of retaliation by the defendant. Put simply,\n   <em>\n    halting\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff's exercise of First Amendment rights is one thing;\n   <em>\n    retaliating\n   </em>\n   against the plaintiff based on the exercise of First Amendment rights is another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Likewise, here, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Defendant, Plaintiff was simply asked to remove the sweatshirt and was never disciplined in any way for wearing the sweatshirt. Therefore, the Court views Defendant's request that she remove the sweatshirt as the type of \"inconsequential\" conduct that the Sixth Circuit has instructed does not amount to an adverse action for purposes of a First Amendment retaliation claim. Here, the factfinder could conclude that Plaintiff was merely stopped in-and not retaliated against based on-her exercise of First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Facebook Post\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, the Court addresses Defendant's claim in its motion for partial summary judgment that based on facts not genuinely in dispute, as a matter of law Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff for the content of her Facebook post does not violate the First Amendment. In Defendant's motion, it argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim because she has not proffered evidence to prove that (1) her Facebook post is constitutionally protected speech; and (2) that her speech was the motivating factor in Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, the Court will define the boundaries of Plaintiff's speech that is at issue. Defendant goes to great lengths to convince the Court that the basis for Plaintiff's termination was only\n   Plaintiff's use of the word \"niggaz,\" and not the post as a whole that indicated Plaintiff's support for Donald Trump. However, when analyzing whether Plaintiff's post deserves First Amendment protection, the Court must view the post in its entirety. \"A public employer may not divorce a statement made by an employee from its context[.] ... Such a tactic could [result in] a statement which, out of context, may not warrant the same level of First Amendment protection it merited when originally made.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rankin v. McPherson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    483 U.S. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    97 L.Ed.2d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). For example, in this case, if the Court were to analyze only Plaintiff's use of the word \"niggaz\" in a vacuum without considering the speech surrounding the word (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , speech regarding the presidential election), Plaintiff's speech would likely deserve far less protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Devlin v. Kalm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079309\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/630/534/\">\n    630 F. App'x 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2015) (explaining that the plaintiff's use of the word \"deadbeat\" was \"part and parcel of his critique of his public employer\" and the court saw \"no reason to analyze this single word separately from the entirety of [the plaintiff's] statement\"). Accordingly, as instructed to do so by the Supreme Court, the Court will consider Plaintiff's post \"in context\" and view Plaintiff's post in its entirety when analyzing her First Amendment retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    Rankin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    483 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   386 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant's claim that Plaintiff was terminated based solely on the fact that she used the word \"niggaz,\" entirely irrespective of the context, is simply not plausible. At the very least, it is a claim the Court need not accept as established beyond dispute for purposes of summary judgment. Suppose, for example, that one of Defendant's employees had responded to the post of the self-identified Mohamed Aboulmaouabhib by posting, \"These niggaz are actually African-Americans, a diverse community of extraordinary folks who have contributed immeasurably to all aspects of the American civilization for 400 years.\" Or by posting, \"These niggaz are not some outside group of recent interlopers seeking to upend the American way of life. Rather, they are African-Americans, who are in fact synonymous with the American way of life-citizens whose ancestors first arrived on these shores in 1619 and, ever since, have played an irreplaceable role in building the infrastructure, economy, military, and cultural traditions and institutions of the United States.\" The Court cannot imagine that Defendant would terminate any employee making such post merely because, in making very positive (and justified) points about African-Americans, they happened to use a very negative slur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Termination would be even less fathomable-if such were possible-had the hypothetical poster placed quotation marks around the offensive word or proceeded it with the term \"so-called.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But the Court need not rely on mere speculation that Defendant would not terminate employees merely because they used the offensive word, irrespective of content. Rather, this reality is reflected in the record this case. Specifically, as noted above, in response to Plaintiff's post a particular co-employee of Plaintiff used the same word. It appears that, to say the least, Defendant did not view the co-employee as a violator subject to discipline; rather, Defendant viewed her as essentially a victim of offense, rightfully objecting of Plaintiff's post. Defendant plainly appears to recognize that it is one thing to use the word in the specific context-for the specific purpose-of decrying the use of the word, and it may be a very different thing to use the word in some other context, for some other purpose. From this, the Court can only conclude that the mere use of the word, by itself, was not in Defendant's eyes grounds for termination. Rather, context matters to Defendant-and rightfully so. For this reason, and based on the case law cited above, the Court will consider Plaintiff's Facebook post in its entirety and in context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Department's Interest in Promoting Efficiency\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, the Court considers Defendant's efficiency interests. At the outset, the Court emphasizes there is strong deference given to public employers where \"close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p142\">\n    461 U.S. at 151-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p142\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (in such situations, \"a wide degree of deference\n   to the employer's judgment is appropriate.\"). The government \"must have wide discretion and control over the management of its personnel and internal affairs,\" including \"the prerogative to remove employees whose conduct hinders efficient operation,\" because \"[p]rolonged retention of a disruptive or otherwise unsatisfactory employee can adversely affect discipline and morale in the work place, foster disharmony, and ultimately impair the efficiency of an office or agency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p142\">\n    at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298262\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/138/#p142\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). These interests have particular resonance in the context of public safety departments, where loyalty, discipline, and workplace harmony are especially important.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v. City of Trenton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524926\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/867/318/#p322\">\n    867 F.2d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322-23 (6th Cir. 1989). Defendant argues that as a public agency that provides emergency services, the Department must be given wide discretion to manage its internal affairs. But in all of the cases Defendant cites that discuss the importance of a public safety department's ability to control its employees' speech, the public-safety agency at issue was a police department or fire department. The Court finds that the Department's need to control its dispatchers is not as substantial as the need of a police department or fire department to control its personnel. As even young children well know, many employees of fire and police departments (typically but not always uniformed) regularly make vital decisions out in the streets and buildings of our community-decisions which all-too-regularly have life-and-death consequences for those employees and their on-the-job partners. Moreover, such employees well know that on any given day, they may need to rely on each other to quite literally and physically save the lives of each other or other member of the community. In addition, such employees typically work in a regimented command structure involving formal ranks, such as \"captain.\" In this context, the need for loyalty, discipline, and workplace harmony-among such employees but also other employees with less harrowing duties but the same overall mission-is greatly heightened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   No such heightened need has been shown for the Department. Undeniably, the Department performs vital work that can involve teamwork and the saving of lives telephonically, and thus discipline and espirit de corps certainly matter to some extent. But elements such as command structure, and potential reliance on a work partner to save one's life, are simply missing from the Department's equation. Thus, the Court notes that Defendant's need to have strong control over its internal affairs is somewhat less than the need of a police department or fire department to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court now turns to the extent of disruption that occurred. Evidence in the record reveals that Plaintiff's post somewhat \"interfere[d] with the regular operation of the [the Department],\"\n   <em>\n    Rankin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    483 U.S. at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , although the extent of this disruption is contested by the parties. Although Plaintiff's post was made while she was not on duty, the post was made on a public social-networking website that Plaintiff's co-workers and the public were able to view.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the Department received complaints from five separate employees regarding Plaintiff's Facebook post. However, none of these individuals complained that they were unable to perform their job as a consequence of the post. Further, viewing the facts in a\n   manner most favorable to Plaintiff, any time the employees spent issuing complaints and discussing the matter at roll-call was minimal. Defendant's assertion that further disruption occurred (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Defendant had to set up a special diversity training due to Plaintiff's post) has been placed in genuine dispute by Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 55 at \u00b6 40). Thus, construing the facts in favor of Plaintiff, the actual disruption was relatively minimal. The Court emphasizes that upon motion for summary judgment, the Court must avoid credibility determinations and must draw reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant and resolve all reasonable doubts in that party's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hostettler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517668\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/844/#p852\">\n    895 F.3d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, at the summary judgment stage, the extent of workplace disruption, although existent, does not weigh heavily in Defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, the Court will examine the likelihood that Plaintiff's post could damage the integrity of the Department, which is a relevant consideration.\n   <em>\n    Rankin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    483 U.S. at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28112\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/378/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suggesting that speech \"discredit[ing]\" a public employer would tend to justify remedial measures). Here, Plaintiff's public Facebook page identified her as an employee of the Department at the time she made a post that contained a racial slur. Plaintiff's \"choice to place [the post] on a social media platform risked sharing [it] with a much broader audience.\"\n   <em>\n    Duke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089856\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/1291/#p1293\">\n    997 F.Supp.2d at 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, Plaintiff in her role as a dispatcher was not in law enforcement or a position of governmental authority; thus, these same considerations are not implicated as strongly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Additionally, a member of the public saw Plaintiff's post online and complained to the mayor's office. This supports Defendant's belief that Plaintiff's post created a threat to the Department's reputation that could lessen the public's trust in the agency. Yet, viewing the facts most favorably to Plaintiff, the anonymous complaint was made by a sibling of one of the employees that complained, and not by a truly concerned anonymous citizen. (Doc. No. 56 at \u00b6 9). This diminishes the weight of this factor in Defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The prospect of disharmony among co-workers does weigh in favor of Defendant. Plaintiff argues that Defendant's concerns of disharmony in the workplace are merely speculative. In support, Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Whitney v. City of Milan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871029\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/292/\">\n    677 F.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2012) for the proposition that \" 'speculative concerns of workplace disharmony are insufficient to overcome [an employee's] interest in speaking as a private citizen on a matter of public concern.' \" (Doc. No. 54 at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Whitney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871029\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/292/\">\n    677 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   298 ) ). However,\n   <em>\n    Whitney\n   </em>\n   is completely inapposite here, as it involved a prior restraint claim.\n   <em>\n    Whitney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871029\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/292/\">\n    677 F.3d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The threat of workplace disharmony was \"speculative\" in that case because the speech had not yet occurred; thus, the plaintiff could only surmise as to what workplace disharmony would occur as a result of the challenged gag order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871029\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/292/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871029\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/292/\">\n    at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, here, there was completed speech (Plaintiff's post) as well as direct evidence that it caused workplace disharmony. Therefore, the issue here is whether disharmony actually occurred (in the past), as opposed to whether it is appropriate to \"speculate\" as possible disharmony (in the future). And the case Plaintiff cites to support her argument that disharmony did not occur,\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v. Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n    344 F.3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2003), is distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rodgers\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that it was justified in terminating a public employee who circulated a memorandum criticizing the defendant's policy decision because the memorandum was shared with other employees and \"interfered with\n   working relationships.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n    at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit explained that there was no evidence that the plaintiff's memorandum \"negatively impacted ... the operations of [the defendant]\" and although it was possible the memorandum may have created disharmony, the court had \"never held that the relatively minor associated risk of disharmony ... would ordinarily overcome an interest\" in an employee's First Amendment right to free speech.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n    at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the court found it relevant that the plaintiff's speech was not \"particularly inflammatory,\" did not contain \"abusive language,\" and did not contain any \"exceptionally insulting aspect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"781033\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/344/587/#p595\">\n    at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, there is direct evidence that Plaintiff's post created disharmony among employees as revealed by the five employees that complained to supervisors and management about Plaintiff's post. In addition, one employee stated to a manager that she did not believe she could continue to work with Plaintiff after reading her \"derogatory\" post. Further, the court in\n   <em>\n    Rodgers\n   </em>\n   emphasized that the memo was not \"particularly inflammatory[,]\" while here, it is obvious to the Court how Plaintiff's post (with its use of such an inflammatory word) could upset co-workers, and the evidence in the record supports that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Thus the evidence in the record, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, supports that Defendant had valid, reasonable concerns of workplace disharmony among co-workers. Accordingly, this concern weighs in Defendant's favor. However, although the Court does give Defendant's position some weight for the threat of disharmony among co-workers and the minimal disruption that occurred, the Court is mindful to not give these factors too much weight, because they resulted directly from Plaintiff's protected speech. The Sixth Circuit has issued words of caution for such situations when the disruption or disharmony results directly from the protected speech:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   [The] detrimental impact on the work environment results directly from [the plaintiff's] intended speech and his religious beliefs. It would contravene the intent of the First Amendment to permit the [defendant] effectively to terminate [the plaintiff] for his speech and religious beliefs in this way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Scarbrough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5663159\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/250/#p255\">\n    470 F.3d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court believes that\n   <em>\n    Scarbrough\n   </em>\n   teaches that disruption and disharmony, though part of\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   balancing, can go only so far towards curtailing First Amendment rights, because the crux of free-speech rights is that generally they can be exercised even if (and perhaps especially when) they cause disruption and disharmony. To be sure, because free-speech rights are limited somewhat in the public-employment context, disruption and disharmony can count in Pickering balancing for\n   <em>\n    something-\n   </em>\n   but not nearly for everything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In conclusion, both parties have legitimate interests on their respective sides of the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   scale. However, given Plaintiff's significant interest in speaking on a matter of core public concern -which did not relate to her job duties-and the relatively slim evidence of workplace disruption resulting therefrom, the Court concludes Defendant's interest in workplace efficiency is less robust than Plaintiff's interest in commenting on a presidential election. Further, Accordingly, when viewing the facts most favorable to Plaintiff, the\n   <em>\n    Pickering\n   </em>\n   balance tilts clearly (if only moderately) in Plaintiff's favor, thus, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim involving the Facebook post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Substantial/Motivating Factor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Next, the Court considers whether Defendant's decision to terminate Plaintiff\n   was \"motivated in substantial part by a desire to punish an individual for exercise of a constitutional right,\"\n   <em>\n    Thaddeus-X v. Blatter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720089\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/378/#p386\">\n    175 F.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (6th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In its motion, Defendant expends much time arguing that Plaintiff's termination was due to her use of a racial slur and lack of accountability,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   her political views. (Doc. No. 33). Thus, in Defendant's view, since Plaintiff's racial slur was the motivating factor for her termination and not her support of President Trump, Plaintiff cannot prove that her exercise of free speech was the motivating factor of her termination.

The Court's point is merely that Plaintiff was terminated based on her message as a whole. That is not to say the Court believes that she would not have been terminated based on a very similar message that was pro-Clinton. The Court herein will focus on the substance of the message without regard to the particular candidate supported in the message. Relatedly, to state what should be obvious, this case is not about whether Americans should or should not have supported Donald Trump's presidential candidacy; it is about whether Plaintiff's legal rights have been violated in the manner she alleges.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Plaintiff argues that her post as a whole was not intended to be racist and her intent was to mock the ignorance of the person who posted before her. (Doc. No. 54 at 6). This view is supported somewhat by the fact that she used the n-word only after it was first used by the prior poster, and the fact that the post-rather than specifically complaining about the persons referred to by the n-word-suggests praise of the voting choices of (at least some of) as them and of their inclusion in a political movement of which Plaintiff approves But Plaintiff must see how her use of a racial slur word, even under these allegedly mitigating circumstances, on its face could be viewed as conveying a racist message and offend some of her co-workers-especially co-workers who (unlike Defendant) are not inclined to care about context when hearing the word. This is the reality of the particular word used-for very good reason, it has a unique and seemingly unrivaled ability to offend. Thus, even viewing the facts most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court realizes this word could seriously offend Plaintiff's co-workers and the public even if Plaintiff did not intend for her post to be racist.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Duke\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089856\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/997/1291/#p1293\">\n     997 F.Supp.2d at 1302\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Plaintiff's intent may not have been to convey an offensive message, but his chosen manner of speech left ample room for interpretation.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    \"A social media platform amplifies the distribution of the speaker's message-which favors the employee's free speech interests-\n    <em>\n     but also increases the potential, in some cases exponentially, for departmental disruption, thereby favoring the employer's interest in efficiency.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Liverman v.
