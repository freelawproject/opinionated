Supp. 3d 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Ala. Feb. 11, 2019) (Thompson, J.). More recently, in the wake of 15 inmate suicides in a 15-month period, the plaintiffs asked for immediate suicide-prevention relief. For reasons that follow, the court concludes that these suicides, as well as\n   other evidence in the record, show that ADOC continues to fail to provide adequate suicide-prevention measures and, thus, subjects inmates to a substantial risk of serious harm, including self-harm, continued pain and suffering, and suicide. The risk of suicide is so severe and imminent that the court must redress it immediately. Therefore, the court will grant the plaintiffs' motion for immediate relief by making permanent most provisions of an interim suicide-prevention agreement that the parties reached early in this litigation; by adopting, in large measure, the recommendations proposed by experts for both parties; and by requiring court monitoring that is limited to the immediate relief ordered here. By agreement of the parties, the issue of non-immediate suicide-prevention relief will be resolved by the court later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs in this class-action lawsuit include a group of seriously mentally ill state prisoners and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program (ADAP), which represents mentally ill prisoners in Alabama. During the liability trial, and in response to the suicide of class member Jamie Wallace just days after he testified, the parties agreed to a series of interim suicide-prevention measures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Agreement (doc. no. 1106-1). The court reduced this 'interim agreement' to an order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Relief Order (doc. nos. 1106, 1106-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2017, the court issued a liability opinion in which it found that ADOC's mental-health care for prisoners in its custody was, \"[s]imply put, ... horrendously inadequate\" and violated the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F. Supp. 3d at 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court more specifically found that \"ADOC's inadequate crisis care and long-term suicide-prevention measures have created a substantial risk of serious harm, including self-harm, suicide, and continued pain and suffering.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    at 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"serious\" suicide-prevention deficiencies identified by the court included ADOC's failure to provide crisis care to those who need it; placement of prisoners in crisis in dangerous and harmful settings, including unsafe crisis cells; inadequate treatment for prisoners in crisis care; inadequate monitoring of suicidal prisoners; inappropriate release of prisoners from suicide watch; and inadequate follow-up care for prisoners released from suicide watch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    at 1218-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the court found that these risks are particularly heightened for prisoners with serious mental illnesses. \"Serious mental illness\" (SMI) is a term of art used in the field of psychiatry which refers to \"a subset of particularly disabling conditions ... defined by the diagnosis, duration, and severity of the symptoms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    at 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Certain conditions are always considered SMIs, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1186 n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over a period of months, the court adopted several 'remedial orders' regarding mental-health care that touched on suicide prevention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To fashion a comprehensive suicide-prevention remedy, the parties agreed to, and the court accepted, a process whereby Drs. Mary Perrien and Kathryn Burns, the defendants' and plaintiffs' correctional mental-health experts, respectively, would \"assess ADOC facilities and operations related to suicide prevention\n   and provide a report with recommendations to resolve the constitutional violation determined by the Court in the Liability Opinion and Order.\" Joint Notice (doc. no. 2014) at 1; Order (doc. no. 2020) (adopting the parties' plan for assessing suicide-prevention measures).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 18, 2019, before the parties' experts completed their report, and in response to a series of suicides, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion regarding the placement of high-risk prisoners in segregation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Preliminary Injunction (doc. no. 2276) at 1. The court construed it as seeking permanent, albeit immediate, relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (doc. no. 2345).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 8, the experts filed (1) a report with recommendations for relief, (2) a report identifying a subsection of those recommendations to be implemented immediately in light of the recent suicide crisis plaguing ADOC, and (3) case summaries of many of the recent suicides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Expert Report and Recommendations, Immediate Relief Recommendations, Joint Expert Case Summaries (doc. nos. 2416-1, 2416-4, 2416-2). Their reports were the product of an extensive and thorough study, in which they reviewed thousands of documents from ADOC, toured multiple facilities, and interviewed both prisoners and staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March and April, the court held a trial to determine whether immediate and non-immediate suicide-prevention relief is needed and, if so, what it should be. The parties and the court decided during the hearing that the portion of the hearing on non-immediate suicide-prevention relief would be continued to a future date. This opinion addresses only immediate relief in response to the ongoing substantial and pervasive inadequacies in ADOC's suicide-prevention efforts, exemplified by the 15 suicides that have occurred since December 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As immediate relief, the plaintiffs first request that the court enter an order making permanent most of the provisions of the interim agreement. The agreement addressed licensing of mental-health professionals; suicide-watch procedures, including inmates' placement on and discharge from suicide watch, follow-up appointments upon discharge, and documentation requirements; and suicide risk assessments, including a monthly evaluation of assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiffs also request that the court adopt as an order the experts' second report. This report identifies a subsection of their recommendations that should be implemented on an immediate and permanent basis. These 'immediate relief recommendations' address suicide-watch follow-ups, referrals to higher levels of care, preventing discharge from suicide watch to segregation, training for staff, security checks in segregation, confidentiality, and immediate life-saving intervention. In addition, the plaintiffs seek interim monitoring of the immediate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs also argue that the defendants are placing mentally ill prisoners in units that, while not labelled as segregation or restrictive housing, impose equally severe restrictions on out-of-cell time, and the same accompanying risk of serious harm, particularly suicide. Therefore, they contend, the court's relief should extend to these \"segregation like\" settings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court heard substantial evidence suggesting that prisoners in certain units receive very little out-of-cell time. However, the court needs more time to consider the evidence, and may decide to solicit additional input from the parties before deciding this critical issue. Therefore, the court's findings remain open as to this discrete issue, and the court will take it up after this opinion is issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. RECENT SUICIDES\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Fifteen men in ADOC custody have committed suicide since December 30, 2017, an average of almost one suicide per month. An examination of their cases illustrates severe and systemic inadequacies in ADOC's suicide-prevention efforts. Many of the inadequacies, detailed in the 15 cases below, are instances of ADOC's pervasive and substantial noncompliance with the interim agreement and other remedial measures that they agreed to implement; that is, they are examples of what ADOC recognized are \"systemic failures to comply with court orders.\" Pls. Ex. 2710 at ADOC0475738.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other inadequacies, while not necessarily constituting noncompliance with specific remedial orders to date, show ADOC's failure to live up to its obligations under the Eighth Amendment. In sum, both types of deficiencies summarized in the 15 cases below demonstrate that immediate relief is necessary to address the substantial risk of serious harm to which prisoners remain exposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Rashaud Morrissette\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 8, 2019, Rashaud Morrissette hanged himself with a belt in the shower of a segregation unit at Fountain prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 2, 2019, Trial Tr.

Trial Tr. at 169, 186. (MHO is a short-term placement that does not have the same level of protections as suicide watch.) ADOC's suicide-prevention failures in his case include (1) not placing him in suicide watch despite his being suicidal, and (2) placing him in segregation despite his having a SMI, and without adequately assessing his suicide risk or referring him for the emergency mental-health care he needed. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 On February 11, 2019, Holmes was improperly placed in MHO, rather than\n   suicide watch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.

As acknowledged by Deborah Crook, ADOC's Director of Mental Health Services, Holmes met the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC)'s definition of nonacutely suicidal, and therefore, under the interim agreement, should have been placed on at least nonacute suicide watch (rather than MHO), at which point a suicide risk assessment would have been required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 2, 2019, Trial Tr.

Furthermore, the parties' experts, Drs.

(2) Have you ever intentionally hurt yourself or attempted suicide? (3) Have you had any serious problems with a significant other, family member or friend recently?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Ex. 3613 at SPA_13571. As noted by the parties' experts, despite these responses, Holmes \"was not diverted from segregation placement and an 'urgent' rather than 'emergent' referral to mental health was made.\" Joint Expert Case Summaries (doc. no. 2416-2) at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Later that night, he was discovered hanging from an overhead light fixture in his segregation cell.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Drs. Burns and Perrien concluded that his case \"illustrates the problems with use of MHO rather than approved suicide watch levels, poor documentation of rationale for release from watch, failure to generate an emergency referral to mental health in response to a positive pre-placement screen and releasing SMI inmates from watch directly into segregation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Daniel Gentry\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Daniel Gentry hanged himself at the Donaldson prison Residential Treatment\n   Unit (RTU) on February 6, 2019. ADOC's suicide-prevention failings include not placing him on suicide watch despite his making clear that he wanted to die, not conducting a suicide risk assessment when indicated, and inadequate review of his suicide. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 A few weeks before his death, on January 24, 2019, a mental-health progress note reported that Gentry had asked a correctional officer to kill him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.

In response, he was placed in MHO that day.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As plaintiffs' expert Dr. Burns testified, the MHO placement was inappropriate, because \"with someone who's actively voicing the wish that someone kill him, you would expect to start a suicide watch, either acute or nonacute, but not just mental health observation status.\" Burns Apr. 9. 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Five days into his MHO placement, Gentry continued to report \"auditory hallucinations and a desire for someone to kill him.\" Pls.

Here, and in the other cases detailed in this section in which Drs.

To obtain a permanent injunction, plaintiffs must show: (1) actual success on the merits; (2) that irreparable injury will be suffered without an injunction; (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to public interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klay v.

Success on the Merits: Eighth Amendment Violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The plaintiffs satisfy the first requirement for a permanent injunction because they have succeeded on the merits of their claim. To prevail on an Eighth Amendment challenge, plaintiffs must show that: (1) objectively, prisoners had serious medical needs and either had already been harmed or were subject to a substantial risk of serious harm; and (2) subjectively, the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to that harm or risk of harm; that is, they knew and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F.

ADOC's suicide prevention was found to be deficient in multiple ways.

Oct. 29, 2018) (Thompson, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Now, in addition to the liability findings, the court further finds that the substantial and pervasive deficiencies identified in the 15 recent suicides demonstrate that ADOC's suicide-prevention efforts remain inadequate and continue to contribute to the ongoing Eighth Amendment violation originally found in the liability opinion. ADOC still has serious deficiencies in the identification of prisoners at risk of suicide, as well as in their treatment, monitoring, and follow-up care. The deficiencies include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   \u2022 Failing to place suicidal prisoners on suicide watch;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   \u2022 Failing to conduct suicide risk assessments;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   \u2022 Failing to appropriately monitor prisoners on suicide watch;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   \u2022 Failing to put prisoners on the mental-health caseload when appropriate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \u2022 Inadequate treatment planning; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   \u2022 Inadequate follow-up treatment after release from suicide watch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   ADOC's segregation practices also continue to suffer from the serious flaws the court found in the 2017 liability opinion, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \u2022 Inadequate screening of prisoners for suicidality and SMIs prior to placing them in segregation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   \u2022 Placing prisoners with SMIs in segregation absent extenuating circumstances;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   \u2022 Failing to conduct 30-minute security checks in segregation, and failing to make sure the checks are staggered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Given these serious inadequacies in segregation practices, it is unsurprising that, similar to the liability opinion's finding in June 2017 that the \"majority\" of suicides occurred in segregation,\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F. Supp. 3d at 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ADOC recognized nearly two years later, in March 2019, that the \"majority of inmates who committed suicide within ADOC have been men who were alone in a restrictive housing cell,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   after being released from suicide watch.\" Pls. Ex. 2706 (Mar. 21, 2019, Daniels's memorandum announcing directive).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   These continuing deficiencies are compounded by ADOC's repeated failure to initiate immediate life-saving measures. Although not identified in the liability opinion, this problem clearly exacerbates ADOC's inadequate suicide-prevention efforts, and illustrates that prisoners remain at substantial risk of serious harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Critically, mental-health and correctional understaffing remains a driving force behind the suicide-prevention deficiencies putting prisons at risk. As of December 2018, ADOC reported that 62 % of correctional officer positions were vacant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   March 2019 Quarterly Staffing Report (doc no. 2386-1) at 3, and as of September 2018, 23.6 % of the mental-health positions were vacant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   December 2018 Quarterly Staffing Report (doc. no. 2378-1) at 9. Commissioner Dunn admitted that ADOC is currently \"struggling\" to comply with court orders because of inadequate staffing levels, Dunn Apr. 1, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 145, and affirmed that understaffing remains one of the problems driving the spike in suicides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 154-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In addition to showing that prisoners remain at a substantial risk of serious harm, the 15 suicides also demonstrate that ADOC continues to act with deliberate indifference. As found in the liability opinion, \"the state of the mental-health care system is itself evidence of ADOC's disregard of harm and risk of harm: in spite of ... notice of the actual harm and substantial risks of serious harm posed by the identified inadequacies in mental-health care, those inadequacies have persisted for years and years.\"\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F. Supp. 3d at 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Almost two years since the court wrote those words, the inadequacies continue to persist, as evidenced by the problems pervading the recent suicides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Furthermore, many of the inadequacies in the 15 suicides constitute noncompliance with the interim agreement and other remedial orders that ADOC agreed to implement. ADOC's continued inability to carry out the terms of the interim agreement and other remedial measures thus far illustrates \"a striking indifference by ADOC to a substantial risk of serious harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    at 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, ADOC's inadequate internal review of the 15 suicides shows ongoing deliberate indifference, just like the court originally found deliberate indifference in part because ADOC had \"done vanishingly little to exercise oversight of the provision\" of mental-health care.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ADOC's ongoing broader failures to self-monitor are also extensively detailed in the monitoring section below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   ADOC has recently adopted some promising measures to improve suicide prevention, such as the March 21, 2019, announcement by ADOC Deputy Commissioner Charles Daniels of a directive generally prohibiting the release of inmates from suicide watch directly to segregation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Ex. 2706. However, as elaborated below, the measures are insufficient to address the scope of a problem that is many years in the making, and, as they were implemented quite recently, it remains to be seen whether they will even be effectively implemented. In any case, several of the key measures came only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the spike in suicides had taken more than a dozen lives, and\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the plaintiffs brought attention the problem by requesting emergency relief. Put differently, the measures have been too little, too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   To conclude, while the liability findings by themselves would justify the relief ordered here, the court's additional factual findings concerning inadequate suicide prevention in the 15 recent suicides underscores that the constitutional violation remains ongoing and requires immediate relief. Accordingly, the plaintiffs satisfy the first requirement for a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   With this in mind, the court will now briefly discuss why the plaintiffs satisfy the remaining requirements for a permanent injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   ii. Remaining Permanent Injunction Requirements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The plaintiffs meet the remaining three requirements for a permanent injunction. As to the second requirement, the immediate and substantial risk of suicide, as reflected in the recent wave of suicides, satisfies the irreparable harm inquiry. As to the third, the threatened injury absent an injunction--a higher risk of suicides and suffering--outweighs any harm the injunction would cause, particularly because, as discussed below, the defendants agree with or claim to be already enacting most of the measures the plaintiffs seek. Finally, an injunction is not adverse to the public interest, for \"the public interest is served when constitutional rights are protected.\"\n   <em>\n    Democratic Exec. Comm. of Fla. v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520021\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/1312/#p1327\">\n    915 F.3d 1312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1327 (11th Cir. 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   B. The Defendants' Arguments Against Relief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   i. The Defendants' Notice Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The defendants contend that any relief based on provisions of the interim agreement would exceed the scope of the evidentiary hearing on this matter, because they did not have the opportunity to present evidence on the interim agreement at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Proposed Opinion and Order (doc. no. 2499) at 13-17. The court rejects this argument. The defendants had adequate notice as to the scope of the requested immediate relief: In the plaintiffs' pretrial brief, the interim agreement was among the provisions that they requested be immediately implemented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Pretrial Brief (doc. no. 2435) at 15 (requesting entry of an order for the relief provided in the Interim Order as \"immediate permanent relief\"). The defendants also had an opportunity to cross Dr. Burns on the interim agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Nevertheless, the court recognizes that the defendants likely were confused as to this issue. During the discussion about restricting the trial to immediate relief, it was not specifically mentioned that the interim agreement was encompassed in the immediate relief the court would be considering, and defense counsel seemed to be focused on the supplemental recommendations. Furthermore, the defendants' lead attorney was out sick at the time of the discussion, and his associate may not have realized that the immediate relief requested by the plaintiffs encompassed the interim agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Because there is an urgent need for immediate relief, and because the defendants previously agreed to the terms of the interim agreement, the court will issue an order for relief today that includes many of the agreement's provisions. However, if the defendants disagree with the parts of the order addressing the interim agreement and would like another opportunity to present evidence about it, the court will consider their evidence and modify or vacate the relevant portions of this opinion and order if appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   ii. The Defendants' Arguments on Mootness and Ongoing and Continuous Violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The defendants argue that steps they have taken since the start of the litigation to improve suicide prevention render unnecessary many, if not all, aspects of the relief the plaintiffs request. They frame this argument in several ways.

A claim may become moot through voluntary cessation only if there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.

In these cases, the defendants argued that injunctive relief was unnecessary because they had taken steps to address the challenged condition or practice by the time of trial.

Applying that heavy burden in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court held that, \"[a]lthough DOC's recent reforms may represent affirmative responses to recognized deficiencies in its ability to address the needs of its growing mentally ill inmate population, the defendants have not established that they have eradicated the effects of the constitutional violations found by the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1321 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Applying these precepts, the court holds that the plaintiffs' claims for relief are not moot. As elaborated below, unlike in the cases cited by the defendants, it is not clear here that the challenged practices have ceased; in other words, the defendants have not satisfied their \"heavy burden\" of establishing that the steps they\n   have taken have \"completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707035\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1288/\">\n    614 F.3d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    LaMarca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519457\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/1526/\">\n    995 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1542 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cty. of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187104\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/625/#p631\">\n    440 U.S. at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187104\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/625/#p631\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the practices have not ceased, the defendants are not entitled to a rebuttable presumption that those practices will not recur. However, even if the court were to conclude that the unconstitutional conditions had ceased, and the rebuttable presumption therefore applied, the court would still find that it is reasonably likely that those conditions will recur. The voluminous evidence of ADOC's repeated failures to comply with its own policies and the court's orders, and of ADOC's lack of substantial progress in addressing its severe understaffing problem--which lies at the root of its inadequate suicide-prevention measures--overcomes the \"rebuttable presumption that the objectionable behavior will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Troiano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190434\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/1276/#p1283\">\n    382 F.3d at 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Throughout this case and in the suicide-prevention trial, the court has seen time and again compelling evidence of ADOC's inability to ensure that its ground-level staff comply with directives from the top, not to mention with the orders of this court. In the suicide-prevention trial, the court saw ample evidence that the noncompliance continues, as demonstrated by the circumstances surrounding the recent suicides. The history of this case is replete with evidence of directives given and corrective action plans created that have been doomed to irrelevance because of a lack of follow-through to ensure the directives were obeyed and the plans put into action. The heart of the matter is understaffing--the overriding problem that makes all of ADOC's other problems so difficult to solve. Without sufficient staff, ADOC will continue to have great difficulty both with carrying out all of the changes it needs to make, and with adequately supervising its staff's compliance with its directives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The court now turns to the defendants' specific mootness and\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   -based challenges to Drs. Burns and Perrien's immediate relief recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Defendants' Efforts to Eliminate Improper Use of Mental-Health Observation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The defendants argue that it is unnecessary for the court to include in its remedial order the experts' recommendation that mental-health observation (MHO) not be used as a part of suicide prevention, because there is no ongoing and continuous violation of federal law to address, and because ADOC and Wexford voluntarily ceased the practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Proposed Opinion and Order (doc. no. 2499) at 18-21. They argue that ADOC policy does not authorize the use of MHO for suicidal prisoners and that the policy is being revised to make this clearer; that they have expressed concern about the issue with their vendor and the vendor has taken action; and that some data indicates that the use of MHO for suicide watch is declining.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190434\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/1276/#p1283\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They also point to testimony they contend shows that the use of MHO for suicide watch has ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   ADOC's actions, while commendable, are insufficient to show that the use of MHO for suicidal inmates has been completely and irrevocably eradicated. Furthermore, the court finds that, even if the use of MHO for suicidal inmates has abated to some extent, there is still a significant threat--and it is reasonably likely--that the dangerous practice will continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   First, the testimony as to whether MHO has stopped being used for suicidal prisoners is far from conclusive. On February 15, 2019, Crook wrote a letter to Wexford, ADOC's vendor, notifying it of the improper use of MHO, among other \"systemic failures to comply with court orders.\" Pls. Ex. 2710 at ADOC0475738. Crook testified\n   that, since sending the letter, she has not received any reports suggesting that MHO is being used for suicidal inmates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 4, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2487) at 34. However, it is not clear that she would receive such reports if this were happening. Crook also testified to seeing an increase in the number of people in acute suicide watch and a decrease in those in MHO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33. She concluded from those numbers \"that MHO is being utilized\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   as a first placement for crisis cell.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (emphasis added). Notably, she stopped short of saying the practice had ended. The defendants also point to ADOC Psychiatry Director Kern's belief that MHO is no longer being used for suicide watch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kern Mar. 29, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2483) at 112. But the court does not credit this testimony because the only basis he provided for it was his and his colleagues' verbal communications with Wexford personnel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 112-16. Kern admitted that, in spite of the seriousness of the matter, he had not verified his belief by looking at the appropriate logs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 113. Although Wexford's Program Director for Mental Health Barbara Coe testified that her company would not put suicidal prisoners on MHO,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Coe Apr. 4, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 199, the court cannot rely on her promise, particularly when Wexford was not supposed to be using MHO in that way in the first place,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaMarca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519457\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/995/1526/\">\n    995 F.2d at 1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[D]efendants must offer more than their mere profession that the conduct has ceased and will not be revived.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The defendants argue that Wexford has implemented a formal corrective action plan regarding the misuse of MHO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Proposed Opinion and Order (doc. no. 2499) at 19. Yet, the corrective action plan the defendants submitted as evidence does not even mention MHO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Ex. 3657 at ADOC0475742-46 (Wexford Suicide Prevention Corrective Action Plan, Initiated January 17, 2019). Crook testified that to fix the MHO problem identified in her letter, Wexford has \"given an absolute directive to [its] staff that people will no longer be on MHO if they are declaring suicidality.\" Crook, Apr. 3, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2486) at 51. But she also testified that she had not seen a copy of Wexford's directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 52. More generally, Crook admitted that she has insufficient staff to keep up with all of the monitoring of court orders that ADOC needs to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 68-69; Crook Apr. 1, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2485) at 11-12. Thus, the court cannot conclude at this time that she will be able to ensure compliance with the directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Finally, the court rejects the defendants' argument that there is no longer a violation because their policy does not authorize the use of MHO for suicidal prisoners. Crook testified that ADOC's policy prohibiting the use of MHO for suicidal prisoners has been in place since 2005.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 4, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2487) at 32-33. As ADOC's repeated and admitted placement of suicidal prisons on MHO shows, however, the existence of that policy did nothing to stop the practice. While Dr. Kern testified that ADOC is currently updating the policy to make it clearer that MHO should not be used for suicide watch, he said the update was not yet finalized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kern Mar. 29, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2483) at 108-09. Even after the updated policy is finalized, it will provide little assurance that the practice will not recur: Noncompliance with ADOC policy has been a recurring theme for MHO use and other areas throughout this case, as shown in many of the suicides discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that there is a continued significant threat of placement of suicidal inmates in MHO that could be remedied by injunctive relief; that the defendants have not established that they have eradicated the effects of the constitutional\n   violations found by the court; and that to the extent ADOC's recent remedial efforts have eliminated the use of MHO for suicidal prisoners, it is reasonably likely that those conditions will recur. Therefore, the requested relief is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Defendants' Efforts to Eliminate Transfers from Suicide Watch to Segregation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   In a March 21, 2019, memorandum, ADOC Deputy Commissioner of Operations Daniels announced a directive prohibiting the transfer of prisoners from suicide watch to segregation \"unless there is no alternative due to well-documented exceptional circumstances or exigent circumstances arising from an inmate's behavior.\" Pls. Ex. 2706. The memorandum states that, if an inmate cannot be safely discharged to a unit other than segregation, Daniels or his designee must approve the temporary segregation placement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants argue that this directive moots and renders unnecessary the entry of a remedial order enforcing the experts' recommendations regarding prisoners in segregation who have been placed on suicide watch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   While promising, the memorandum announcing the directive is insufficient evidence that ADOC has completely and irrevocably eradicated the practices addressed by the experts' recommendation, or that the practices will not recur.\n   <em>\n    If followed\n   </em>\n   , the directive could largely address the experts' recommendation on this issue. But it is too soon to tell how well it will be followed: Daniels issued the memorandum just a week before the start of the suicide-prevention trial. The defendants will need to present evidence of sustained compliance with the directive over a longer period of time to convince the court that ADOC has successfully ended the practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Moreover, as stated earlier, this case is replete with examples of directives and policies being issued but not followed. So long as the correctional understaffing problem continues, measuring and ensuring compliance with directives will remain difficult for ADOC. In addition, the continuing severe correctional staffing shortage creates pressure to use segregation for potentially violent prisoners. Without adequate correctional staffing, fights and misconduct will continue unabated, and segregation will continue to be the first option for managing such prisoners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vail Dec. 22, 2016, Trial Tr.

The answer here is clearly yes. The parties' experts undertook an extensive and thorough investigation of the state of suicide prevention in ADOC, looking at thousands of documents, touring four facilities, and interviewing prisoners as well as ADOC and Wexford staff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-1) at 4. Based on their study, they concluded that training for nurses assessing prisoners going into segregation is insufficient. Specifically, they found that training \"should provide greater detail about indicators to look for as well as include how to place someone on immediate watch after hours and how to initiate an emergent referral.\" Immediate Relief Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-4) at 3. Nurses should be trained on an \"easy in\" model, meaning that, if a nurse is \"uncertain in any way about a case, the inmate is placed on watch.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The existing remedial order does not address these issues; it simply says that nurses shall be \"trained in the screening process.\" Order and Injunction on Segregation Remedy (doc. no. 1815-1) at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Moreover, Drs. Burns and Perrien's findings about ADOC's deficient preplacement screenings show that, well after the 2017 liability opinion and 2018 segregation remedy order, nurses still are not well-trained enough to adequately screen inmates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2416 1) at 14-15 (finding \"[n]o instances of prisoners being diverted from [segregation] or placed on watch as a result of pre-placement screening ... despite multiple subsequent placements on suicide watch and mental health observation from [segregation]\"). Perhaps most notably, the fact--recognized by ADOC--that the majority of suicides by prisoners in its custody are men released from suicide watch into segregation is compelling circumstantial evidence that nurses need to be better trained in screening inmates before they are placed in segregation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Ex. 2706 (Mar. 21, 2019, Daniels's memorandum announcing directive).

Even if it did, the record has repeatedly shown that ADOC's enactment of a policy often does not translate to ground-level compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that there remains a significant threat of nurses conducting\n   inadequate pre-placement screening of prisoners going into segregation, and that injunctive relief could remedy this threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Security Checks in Segregation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The defendants argue that the court should not enter an order implementing the experts' recommendation that \"30-minute custody rounds in segregation must be enforced consistent with existing policy,\" Immediate Relief Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-4) at 4, because the plaintiffs failed to show an ongoing constitutional violation regarding security checks in segregation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Proposed Order and Opinion (doc. no. 2499) at 40. The court disagrees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   An ongoing and continuous violation exists for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   when there is a threat of future harm from the challenged prison condition that may be remedied by prospective relief.

Ex. 1399, which, they note, the plaintiffs' experts agree is an appropriate policy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Vail Apr. 3, 2019, R.D. Trial. Tr. at 141; Burns Apr. 9, 2019, R.D.

However, as the evidence has shown, like other policies in ADOC, the existence of the 30-minute policy does not mean that it will be followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the whole purpose of the experts' recommendation is that the policy be\n   <em>\n    enforced.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The defendants also cite evidence presented at the suicide-prevention trial that several wardens and their staff have taken steps to ensure that 30-minute checks are regularly conducted in their facilities, and that certain discovered violations have been corrected. This evidence falls short of establishing that ADOC has \"completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violations,\" let alone that there not a serious threat of the problem recurring.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707035\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1288/\">\n    614 F.3d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it is undeniably important that wardens take appropriate disciplinary action when they discover violations, the evidence did not convince the court that ADOC is catching most violations. Instead, the court came away convinced that ADOC's confirmation of compliance remains insufficient. At the suicide-prevention trial, the court heard ample evidence of substantial and pervasive problems in complying with the policy\n   to conduct security checks every 30 minutes. For example, plaintiffs' expert Vail testified that, based on the segregation duty post logs that he has reviewed, ADOC has not demonstrated a consistent and sustained practice of conducting 30-minute security checks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vail Apr. 3, 2019, R.D.

He said that of the six or seven facilities he reviewed, only one \"passed muster.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707035\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1288/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Most troublingly, the logs from Holman prison showed two entire (eight-or 12-hour) shifts in which not a single security check was logged, and other days in which more than two hours passed before a security check was logged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 155.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Finally, given the continuing correctional understaffing, the court finds that inadequate checks are likely to be a recurring problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 195 (testifying that it is her understanding that ADOC is unsure whether it can follow its own segregation-rounds policy in \"particularly understaffed facilities\"). The evidence fell far short of showing that the problem of inadequate security checks had been eradicated, that the problem poses no threat of future harm to the plaintiffs, or that ADOC has developed a functional system for ensuring that such checks occur in all segregation units.

Severe inadequacies in ADOC's suicide-prevention efforts contribute to the ongoing Eighth Amendment violation that the court originally found in the liability opinion, and reaffirms today. The relief ordered is narrowly tailored to address these inadequacies, which relate to, among other\n   areas, identifying inmates at risk of suicide, treating and monitoring them, and providing them follow-up care. Furthermore, as elaborated below, not only do the opinions of both parties' experts support the need for the relief, but the defendants themselves have at least agreed, or not objected, to many of the relief's provisions, and in some instances have themselves suggested the relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Agreement (doc. no. 1106-1); Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Proposed Opinion and Order (doc. no. 2499) at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   i.

In discussing the evidence that supports these findings, the court's analysis will largely focus on a single inquiry: is the provision necessary to correct the constitutional violation established by the plaintiffs? This is for both practical and logical reasons. Logically speaking, if the court determines the relief is necessary to correct the violation found by the court, it follows that the relief is (1) \"narrowly drawn,\" (2) \"extends no further than necessary,\" and (3) \"is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relatedly, and practically speaking, because the three components of the requirement (need, narrowness, intrusiveness) really blend into a single inquiry, evidence showing compliance with one component often also shows compliance with the others. It would make for an excessively redundant and lengthy (more so than it already is) opinion to analyze each component separately and thus frequently repeat the same evidence for why it is satisfied, especially given the redundancy already created by the requirement for provision-by-provision findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   ii. The Interim Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The genesis of the interim agreement traces back to the suicide of Jaime Wallace, a plaintiff class member who had severe mental illnesses, as well as intellectual and physical disabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F.

At the liability trial, he recounted the many times he had tried to kill himself, showed the scars on his arms where he made repeated attempts, and told the court that he had not received enough treatment for his illnesses. Ten days after testifying, he hanged himself in prison and died. Wallace's suicide prompted the court to halt proceedings and allow the parties to mediate immediate, interim measures to prevent future suicides. The parties reached\n   the interim agreement, which the court adopted as an interim order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Interim Agreement and Order (doc. nos. 1106, 1106-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   For the following reasons the court now finds that the vast majority of the terms of the interim agreement--as modified by Drs. Burns and Perrien's recommendations--are narrowly drawn, extend no further than necessary to correct the defendants' constitutional violation, and are the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation. In making this finding, the court gives \"substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The court will next make particularized findings for each provision, but three overarching reasons in support of the PLRA findings bear emphasizing at the outset. First, where, as here, the provisions of relief ordered by a court are adopted from an agreement jointly drafted and reached by the parties, it is compelling evidence that the provisions comply with the needs-narrowness-intrusiveness criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales Feliciano v.

In response, the correctional shift supervisor instructed his subordinate to let him keep banging and yelling until he tired himself out.

For the reasons that follow, the court, having given substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of the State's criminal justice system as a result of the requested relief, finds that the relief based on these recommendations, as described below, is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the defendants' constitutional violation, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct that violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Before turning to the individual recommendations, the court pauses to note several factors that support the determination that the relief complies with the demands of the PLRA. First, the recommendations were drafted jointly by both parties' experts, based upon an extensive, thorough, and lengthy study of the state of suicide prevention in ADOC. At trial, the experts testified that their recommendations, with a few minor exceptions discussed below, are necessary for adequate suicide prevention and are no more intrusive than necessary. Lastly, the defendants for the most part do not take issue with the substance of the recommendations, and often claim to already be implementing them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Annotations to the Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2451);\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Proposed Opinion and Order (doc. no. 2499). These factors strongly support a finding that this relief complies with the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Eliminating the Inappropriate Use of Mental-Health Observation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   In the liability opinion, the court found that ADOC's monitoring of suicidal prisoners is \"woefully inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F. Supp. 3d at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed earlier, this failure has continued, in part because suicidal prisoners have been placed in mental-health observation (MHO) rather than suicide watch. Drs. Burns and Perrien recommend eliminating the use of MHO as a component of suicide prevention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Immediate Relief Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-4) at 2. The doctors concluded that \"[t]he only acceptable watches for people with issues related to suicide and/or self-harm are acute and non-acute watch.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   The court finds that ordering immediate and permanent implementation of a ban on the use of MHO for suicidal inmates constitutes relief that satisfies the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   First, both experts testified that this ban is necessary. As both Drs. Burns and Perrien testified, placement of suicidal inmates on MHO status presents several dangers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D Trial Tr. at 79-87. First, prisoners in MHO are monitored only every 30 minutes, as opposed to every 15 minutes for nonacute suicide watch or constant observation for acute suicide watch. \"[O]nce every half an hour, ... is not adequate to prevent suicides.\" Burns Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 79. Second, prisoners on suicide watch receive a number of critical protections and assessments that those on MHO do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D Trial Tr. at 79-87. For example, prisoners on suicide watch must be assessed for continued suicidality and risk of self-harm before they can be released\n   from suicide watch, whereas prisoners on MHO are not required to have such an assessment before release. Dr. Perrien explained that, in two completed ADOC suicides she examined, the prisoner had been released from MHO within 12 hours or a day before committing suicide, and there was no record that a suicide risk assessment has been done. \"Had they not been placed on MHO status,\" she explained, \"the suicide risk assessment would have been completed prior to them being discharged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that, had they been on suicide watch, they also would have received appropriate assessments during the watch period, been considered for referral to higher levels of care, and received post-watch follow-up treatment);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that prisoners on suicide watch receive a specialized treatment plan to reduce suicide risk).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Furthermore, in the experts' view, the practice of placing suicidal prisoners on MHO was not limited to a few instances. As Dr. Burns testified for herself and Dr. Perrien, \"we were concerned about the numbers of cases we saw in which people who should have been on a more acute level of watch, such as acute suicide watch or nonacute suicide watch, were actually just being maintained on mental health observation status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She also expressed concern that MHO was being used as a proxy for suicide watch\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   of the lesser requirements it imposes on staff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   The defendants argue that the recommended action is not necessary because they have already eliminated the use of MHO for suicidal prisoners. For the same reasons set forth in the earlier section on mootness,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section III(B)(ii)(1), the court rejects this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   The court further finds that the relief at issue is narrowly tailored and no more intrusive than necessary. Both doctors testified that the recommended prohibition could not be any more limited and still be effective to address the identified risks, and that it was the least intrusive option to address the concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D Trial Tr. at 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Suicide Watch Follow-Up Examinations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   As previously discussed, \"[t]he follow-up care provided to many prisoners upon their release from suicide watch at ADOC is woefully inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F.

In their immediate relief recommendations, the experts recommend changes to the number and timing of follow-ups for people released from suicide watch; whereas the interim agreement required three follow-ups, the experts recommend a minimum of four, and they recommend that the series of three examinations restart if the prisoner is transferred before the final examination in the series.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Immediate Relief Recommendations (doc. no 2416-4) at 2; Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D Trial Tr. at 109-110. In their written recommendation, the experts proposed the following schedule for crisis placement follow-up visits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-302\">\n   \"The first three follow-up examinations will occur upon release from watch and upon return to the sending facility or expected housing; these examinations will occur on the three consecutive days upon release. The fourth follow-up examination will occur on the tenth day following release from watch. If the inmate is placed in temporary housing (e.g., housed at Kilby for days one through three post-watch and then moved to the sending facility; moved to SLU [Structured Living Unit] for days one through three post-watch then moved to RHU [Restrictive Housing Unit, or segregation] ), that will be noted as a significant post-watch transition impacting the inmate's post-watch adjustment and risk level, requiring the post-watch follow-up examination schedule to be reset; another round of the four follow-up examinations will take place starting the day following movement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   The court finds that ordering immediate and permanent implementation of a modified version of the experts' recommendation on post-suicide-watch follow-up examinations constitutes relief that satisfies the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Although the recommendation is quite specific, the court concludes that it is necessary based on the testimony of the parties' experts. The doctors based their recommendation on the specific conditions they saw in their examination of ADOC, particularly the frequent transfers between prisons of inmates coming off of suicide watch in ADOC.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The recommendation was designed to address the pattern of \"suicides that occurred shortly after releases from watch, and the need to be sure in a system in which people frequently move that there is adequate follow-up during transitions.\" Burns Apr. 8, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   As Dr. Burns explained, the first three follow-ups need to occur on a daily basis after release from suicide watch due to the elevated risk of suicide during that time period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns Apr. 109, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 10. It is also necessary to reset the clock and provide an inmate with another three consecutive days of evaluations if the inmate is transferred again before the final evaluation: As Dr. Perrien explained, \"the period post watch is a vulnerable time\" and when \"someone is being moved, that increases the stress that an already vulnerable person experiences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   According to Dr. Burns, the prior policy of three follow-ups was insufficient in practice, because prisoners were frequently transferred to one prison for suicide watch, then transferred to another prison before the required follow-ups had been completed; upon arrival at the new facility, the inmate would not be seen by mental health for another three weeks--too long given the vulnerability of the inmate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Burns Apr. 10, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 29 (\"We know more than we did two years ago when the [Interim] [O]rder was initially agreed upon with respect to transition times and how dangerous and vulnerable people are during that time.\"). Dr. Burns credibly testified that the recommended four follow-up evaluations and repeat follow-ups after transitions are necessary to \"to save patient lives.\" Burns Apr. 9, 2019, R.D Trial Tr. at 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Burns Apr. 8, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 140-41 (explaining the recommendation for four follow-ups and that some correctional systems require more follow-ups).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Although the court is convinced of the necessity of the recommended four follow-up examinations to prevent suicide and self-harm, the court concludes that it is not necessary that the fourth evaluation occur 10 days after release from suicide watch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   Both experts agreed that the fourth examination need not occur on the tenth day; all that is needed is to check back in on the prisoner's mental health after the immediate transition period. Accordingly, the court leaves the determination of how many days after release from suicide watch the fourth examination should occur up to ADOC, based on consultation with Dr. Perrien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   With that modification, the court finds that the recommended relief is narrowly tailored and no more intrusive than necessary. As discussed above, the experts tailored their recommendation to the particular practices they found in ADOC. During Drs. Burns and Perrien's joint testimony, Dr. Burns testified that the follow-up requirements could not be any more limited and still effectively address the suicide risk that was identified by the court in the liability opinion, and that the proposal was the least intrusive recommendation that would be appropriate \"[i]n this situation\"; Dr. Perrien did not disagree on either point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 10, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-311\">\n   The defendants argue that this requirement is overly intrusive because it mandates the precise number and timing of follow-up appointments, and they contend it leaves no room for clinical judgment. However, the court finds that a minimum number of follow-up examinations needs to be set based on the testimony of the experts. Dr. Perrien testified that, based on her experience and expertise a correctional psychologist, \"there needs to be a minimum number\" of follow-ups set \"in the ADOC.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, as Dr. Burns testified, ADOC frequently did not comply with the earlier requirement of three follow-ups--thus, the court cannot simply trust that ADOC will provide an adequate number of follow-ups without a court order. As for the clinical judgment issue, both experts rejected the idea that the proposed relief unduly interferes with the providers' clinical judgment; they noted that their proposed policy requires the exercise of clinical judgment in deciding what actions to take based on the examinations. In sum, the recommended relief, as modified, meet the requirements of the PLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Referrals to Higher Level Care\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   In the liability phase, the court observed that suicidal ADOC prisoners were frequently \"kept in crisis cells for much longer than 72 hours,\" and that these very long stays \"illustrate that prisoners are not getting the treatment they need to stabilize and be moved out of crisis cells, or that ADOC and [the private mental-health care provider] are leaving these mentally ill prisoners in extremely isolated environments for longer than appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F. Supp. 3d at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that \"crisis-cell placement is meant to be temporary and should not last longer than 72 hours, because the harsh effects of prolonged isolation in a crisis cell can harm patients' mental health.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If not referred, the clinical rationale should be documented in the medical chart, at minimum, and tracked in the crisis utilization log or similar.

If the inmate is not referred to a higher level of care, the rationale should be documented in the medical chart, at minimum, and tracked\n   in the crisis utilization log. If the inmate remains on watch for 240 hours or longer, referral to a higher level of care shall occur with notification of referral to OHS and vendor regional mental health management. In addition, inmates who are returned to watch status within 30 days of release from a watch and/or who have three watch placements within six months shall be referred to a higher level of care; OHS should be immediately notified of any inmates who meet these criteria but are not referred and provided with the clinical rationale.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   Immediate Relief Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-4) at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   The court finds that ordering immediate and permanent implementation of this recommendation constitutes relief that satisfies the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   As the experts explained, the purpose of the recommendation is to ensure that ADOC and mental-health providers consider providing a higher level of mental health care when placement in suicide watch does not resolve a problem over a lengthy period of time, or when a prisoner repeatedly becomes suicidal over a longer period. The experts' testimony and other evidence in the record establish a clear need for implementation of this recommendation. Both experts identified this recommendation as needing to be addressed urgently to reduce the risk of suicide in ADOC. In their assessment of suicide prevention in ADOC, Drs. Burns and Perrien came across multiple instances in which people remained on suicide watch for longer than 72 hours without any indication that they were considered for a higher level of care; this issue appeared repeatedly amongst inmates who subsequently committed suicide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 139-40, 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   While ADOC already has a policy requiring referral to a higher level of care for prisoners on suicide watch for 72 hours, relief from the court is still necessary. As shown by the experts' findings and other evidence in the record, there is frequent noncompliance with the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Exs. 2371 (Jan. 2019 Bullock Crisis Cell Utilization Log), 2419 (Jan. 2019 St. Clair Crisis Cell Utilization Log) (showing crisis placements longer than 72 hours); Kern Mar. 29, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2483) at 84-85 (testifying about crisis cell utilization log showing placements longer than 72 hours).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   The court further finds that relief proposed is not unnecessarily intrusive. Dr. Burns credibly testified that the recommendation could not be narrower and still be effective in terms of suicide prevention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 146-47. Furthermore, the experts' recommendation appears to be less intrusive than the ADOC's own administrative regulation in most respects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current ADOC regulation states: \"If placement on Suicide Watch does not begin to resolve the inmate crisis within 72 hours, the inmate will be transferred to a SU [stabilization unit].\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Ex. 133 (Admin. Reg. 630) at 4. In other words, the ADOC policy imposes a mandatory referral to a higher level of care at 72 hours unless the prisoner was already assigned to the stabilization unit prior to being placed on suicide watch. In contrast, the experts' recommendation merely requires\n   consideration of referral to a higher level of care, and documentation if the treatment team decides against the referral. The experts' recommendation would not mandate referral to a higher level of care until the inmate has been on suicide watch for a full 10 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   The experts' recommendation would go beyond ADOC's policy in that it would impose a new requirement of a consideration of referral for a prisoner who has been sent to suicide watch three times in the prior six months or returned to suicide watch within 30 days of release. Although the recommendation as written appears to require referral to a higher level of care for such prisoners, the experts both explained in their testimony that the referral should not be mandatory; if the inmate is not referred, the clinicians would merely need to document their reasoning and inform the Office of Health Services. As the recommendation does not require a referral, the court finds that it is narrowly drawn and not more intrusive than necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   At trial, Dr. Burns and Dr. Perrien's testimony differed on one issue: whether, after an inmate has remained on suicide watch for 240 hours, ADOC must refer or merely consider referring the inmate to higher level care. Consistent with the immediate relief recommendations, Dr. Burns testified that there should be a mandatory referral to a higher level of care if an individual remained on suicide watch for 240 hours.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 134. Dr. Perrien testified that she would recommend that at 240 hours, ADOC be required to again consider a referral to a higher level of care; she would not impose a mandatory referral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D.

The defendants argue that the directive therefore renders the relief unnecessary. The court rejects this argument for essentially the same reasons, detailed in Section III(B)(ii)(2), that the court rejected the defendants' mootness contention. These reasons include, among others, that it is far from safe to assume that the directive will be followed, especially given ADOC's continued understaffing and its repeated failures to effectively implement its own policies at the ground level. Moreover, that the defendants agree with the directive's requirements weighs in favor of finding that they meet the needs-narrowness-intrusiveness criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   As for section (2) of the ordered relief, it is critical that, in the limited cases where a prisoner is being considered for discharge from suicide watch to segregation, that prisoner be provided with extra protection, including re-evaluation and placement on the mental-health caseload if necessary. Furthermore, Dr. Burns and Dr. Perrien testified that this relief is necessary to address ADOC's constitutional violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D.

The ordered relief satisfies the PLRA for essentially the same reasons, detailed above in Section III(B)(ii)(3), that the court rejected the defendants' contention that there is no ongoing constitutional violation in this area. These reasons include, among others, that Drs. Burns and Perrien's findings about ADOC's deficient preplacement screenings show that nurses still are not well-trained enough to adequately screen inmates;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2416 1) at 14-15, as well as the fact--recognized by ADOC--that the majority of suicides by prisoners in its custody are men released from suicide watch into segregation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls. Ex. 2706 (Mar. 21, 2019, Daniels's memorandum announcing directive). These suicides in segregation are compelling circumstantial evidence that nurses need to be better trained.

However, at the suicide-prevention trial, they suggested two possible alternatives: (1) placing logbooks at opposite ends of a unit in order to incentivize walking from one end to the other to fill out the log for each security check, or (2) a guard patrol system, whereby officers carry a device that automatically records their presence at each door as they approach it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 194-96. As to the first option, Dr. Perrien admitted: \"[Y]ou could still ... pre[-]enter times and cells.

Nevertheless, at this time, the court will not order the defendants to implement either alternative, because, based on the current record, such a requirement would excessively intrude into the details of prison management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Instead, to ensure ADOC enforces its own policy, the court will order the defendants to adopt the system of supervisory review and confirmation that they proposed in their post-trial brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response (doc. no. 2249) at 45-46. Specifically, the defendants agreed to implement the following plan until the court enters an order concerning global monitoring:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-350\">\n   \"1.

That said, the court has serious concerns it will be insufficient to ensure that overstretched officers do their rounds correctly.

Also troublingly, the proposal does not require review of video evidence where available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   Despite these concerns, the court will defer to the defendants in giving them an opportunity to show that their approach works. In adopting the defendants' proposal, the court relies in good faith on the assumption that ADOC will conduct unannounced rounds on a sufficiently frequent basis to catch noncompliance, and will review logs for irregularities that reveal potential noncompliance, such as 30-minute checks recorded at identical intervals, or time entries added to the same line as another entry, rather than to its own line. The court relies on the wardens and supervisors to address such red flags aggressively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   The court finds that ordering the defendants to immediately implement Drs.

The duty-post log from a segregation unit at Kilby showed security checks at exact intervals, line after line. On one line, where a 4:30 security check had already been filled in, someone added to the same line a different event at 4:19; later, someone recorded an 8:15 event on the same line showing a security check at 8:00. The most likely explanation is that 30-minute security checks on the half-hour were pre-filled, so there was no room to add other events to the log on their own lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Price, Apr. 12, 2019, R.D.

During the liability trial, the court heard extensive evidence tying the inadequate monitoring of prisoners in segregation to ADOC's severe staffing shortage. When correctional officers have too many responsibilities due to understaffing, corners will inevitably be cut. Given that the staffing shortage has not significantly changed since entry of the liability opinion, and indeed may have gotten worse, the court is confident that the examples of inadequate segregation monitoring presented to the court in the remedial trial are only the tip of the iceberg.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D.

As illustrated by the evidence discussed above, ADOC's oversight to date has failed to ensure that officers consistently comply with the department's segregation-rounds policy, and the plaintiffs continue to be exposed to an immense threat of future harm due to inadequate monitoring in segregation. Moreover, that the defendants voluntarily agree to enforce and implement oversight of their own policy is further evidence that ordering them to do so satisfies the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness test.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales Feliciano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9288627\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/300/321/#p334\">\n    300 F.

As discussed above, that the defendants agree with the recommendation supports the finding that it is not intrusive and meets the PLRA test. Furthermore, despite the defendants' agreement with the recommendation, ADOC has repeatedly failed to timely intervene with life-saving measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-374\">\n   D. Monitoring\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-375\">\n   In late 2018, the defendants and the plaintiffs each proposed global monitoring schemes--comprised of both internal and external monitors--to assess ADOC's compliance with the remedial orders in this litigation. Both parties agreed that court monitoring is necessary. The court is considering the parties' proposals and has not yet resolved the issue. In the meantime, the plaintiffs request that the court impose interim monitoring limited to the immediate suicide-prevention relief. For the reasons elaborated below, the court finds that both internal and external monitoring of the immediate relief is urgently needed and will therefore order it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   i. The Need for Court Monitoring\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   There is a dire need for court monitoring of ADOC's compliance with the immediate suicide-prevention relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   First, this need is demonstrated by the finding in the liability opinion that ADOC fails to self-monitor its provision of mental-health care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F. Supp. 3d at 1257-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the court explained, ADOC \"has done vanishingly little to exercise oversight of the provision of care to mentally ill prisoners\".\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Second, the need for monitoring is shown by the fact that, since the liability opinion, ADOC has consistently failed to identify and correct problems with its suicide-prevention system, including its noncompliance with remedial measures that the defendants agreed to implement. As Dr. Burns testified at the monitoring trial in December 2018, the interim agreement \"hasn't been reviewed or acted upon or self-monitored, to my knowledge, in any way in the two years that it's been in place.\" Burns Dec. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2254) at 170.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that none\n   of the documents she had thus far received as part of her and Dr. Perrien's assessment of suicide prevention indicated that ADOC had studied whether it was complying with the interim agreement, and that she was generally not aware of ADOC's having identified any instances of noncompliance with the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 169. As of April 2019, Drs. Burns and Perrien said that they had not yet seen ADOC meaningfully self-monitor its ability to comply with its suicide-prevention policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 214-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   One glaring example of ADOC's failure to self-monitor is its inadequate reviews of prisoners' suicides. In December 2018, Dr. Burns testified that ADOC's reviews of suicides and serious suicide attempts that she had received were not adequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns Dec. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2256) at 102. This made her concerned that \"things that might have been found and corrected still exist and put people at risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Her fears were borne out: Six prisoners killed themselves since she testified; and, as detailed above, their cases were rife with inadequacies in suicide prevention. As of March 2019, three months after her testimony, both she and Dr. Perrien reported that ADOC's reviews of suicides remained deficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-1) at 7, 34-35 (noting, for example, that \"[p]erhaps even more disturbing than [the] delayed response to suicide attempts in progress, was the lack of any documentation that ADOC or the vendor identified this very serious problem or took any steps to address it);\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joint Expert Case Summaries (doc. no. 2416-2) at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-381\">\n   Drs. Burns and Perrien's report also specifically identified problems with internal oversight by Wexford, ADOC's mental-health vendor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-1) at 3. For example, they found that Wexford audited \"the presence or absence of documents rather than any measure of quality, completeness or accuracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this same vein, the court was troubled by the testimony of Barbara Coe, Wexford's Program Director for Mental Health, who admitted that none of the vendor's auditors are clinicians, and who was not entirely sure whether Wexford was auditing compliance with the court's orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coe Apr. 5, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 14-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-382\">\n   Perhaps most notably, the testimony of senior ADOC officials confirmed that ADOC is not adequately monitoring suicide-prevention measures. ADOC Psychiatry Director Kern oversees the clinical aspects of the department's mental-health program, and his duties on the OHS team include providing \"a clinical perspective\" in\n   working to ensure remedial orders are implemented. Kern Mar. 28, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2482) at 10, 25. He testified that, to his knowledge, OHS had \"not specifically audited the suicide prevention process\" since he had become Director of Psychiatry approximately one year ago.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. Dr. Kern is on a task force charged with implementing the remedial orders, but testified that the last time that team met was early in the fall of 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Despite the recent spike in suicides, he said that, overall, in 2019, he had participated in just one formal meeting that was devoted specifically to reviewing suicides and discussing suicide prevention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-383\">\n   ADOC Mental Health Services Director Crook also described deficiencies in internal monitoring of suicide prevention. Quality assurance is a significant aspect of her job. Crook Apr. 1, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2485) at 40. Yet, she testified that, prior to February 2019, she had not done anything to determine whether MHO was being used in place of suicide watch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 4, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2487) at 72. She also testified that OHS staff did not begin monthly reviews of suicide risk assessments until March 2019, even though the interim agreement adopted more than two years earlier required such reviews.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 1, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2485) at 43-44.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crook further testified that she has not done anything to monitor whether mental-health staff is exercising its authority to tell correctional staff to remove someone from segregation, and whether correctional staff is heeding mental-health staff when asked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 3, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2486) at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-384\">\n   Crook candidly admitted she does not have the staff to monitor all areas of the remedial orders entered thus far in this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 1, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2485) at 11-12; Crook Apr. 3, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2486) at 68-69 (\"Our team is not large enough to go to every single facility and look at every single aspect of the remedial orders.\"). As elaborated below, Crook's testimony is consistent with the defendants' proposed global monitoring scheme for all the remedial orders, a separate matter the court is currently considering. Namely, in their global monitoring proposal, the defendants concede that ADOC does not have the internal resources or capacity to effectively monitor, which is why their plan \"necessarily requires the initial assistance of\" an external monitoring team. Defendants' Proposed Monitoring Plan (doc. no. 2115) at 2. Critically, the defendants' global monitoring proposal also explicitly recognizes that external monitoring meets the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement, an admission that further supports finding that external monitoring is necessary for the immediate relief ordered here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Pretrial Monitoring Brief (doc. no. 2145) at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   To her credit, faced with inadequate resources, Crook said she has prioritized monitoring suicide prevention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 3, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2486) at 10. For example, she testified that, in December 2018 and February 2019, OHS conducted audits of, among other areas, suicide watch assessments, suicide watch\n   discharge, and suicide watch monitoring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 4, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2487) at 67-68. Also to her credit, as mentioned above, on February 15, 2019, she sent a letter to Wexford notifying it of \"systemic failures to comply with court orders in\n   <em>\n    Braggs.\n   </em>\n   \" Pls. Ex. 2710 at ADOC0475738. She testified that her letter led Wexford to take action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 4, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2487) at 74. Crucially, however, she also recognized that she sent the letter only after 14 suicides had occurred in 14 months.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   It also bears emphasizing that she sent the letter a month\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the plaintiffs filed their emergency motion seeking immediate relief on suicide prevention, which raises questions about whether ADOC would have acted when it did without pressure from the plaintiffs and the likelihood of immediate court review. In fact, an inference could be drawn that the timing of Crook's letter is additional proof that outside oversight increases the likelihood of swift compliance with court orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   Furthermore, while Crook is to be commended for audits related to suicide prevention, it is deeply troubling that Dr. Kern, who provides a \"clinical perspective\" in monitoring remedial orders, apparently was not even aware that the audits occurred. Kern Mar. 28, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2482) at 25, 44. It is also deeply concerning that, as Crook testified, she does not know the degree to which ADOC is currently following the policies it adopted to implement remedial orders--policies that she agreed are \"necessary\" for suicide prevention. Crook Apr. 4, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2487) at 62-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   In short, the monitoring efforts have been too little, too late.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   Third, the need for monitoring is demonstrated by ADOC's failure to comply with the interim agreement and other remedial measures related to suicide prevention that they also agreed to implement. ADOC's pervasive noncompliance is detailed throughout this opinion, including in the section summarizing recent suicides. Strikingly, ADOC itself has recognized \"systemic failures to comply with court orders in\n   <em>\n    Braggs.\n   </em>\n   \" Pls. Ex. 2710 at ADOC0475738;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Burns Dec. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2256) at 282-84 (explaining how failures in the area of suicide prevention led her to conclude that she had not seen evidence that ADOC was using its best efforts to comply with remedial orders). Noncompliance with remedial requirements supports the need for court monitoring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benjamin v. Fraser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096568\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/35/#p49\">\n    343 F.3d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49 (2d Cir. 2003) (upholding district court's finding that external monitoring satisfied the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement, \"particularly in light of the district court's finding that the City's compliance with its remedial responsibilities has been consistently incomplete and inadequate\"),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caiozzo v.

This makes sense: The more someone fails to do something he agreed to do, the bigger the need to supervise whether he does it in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   It bears highlighting that correctional understaffing significantly contributes to ADOC's noncompliance with remedial measures, and thus the need for monitoring. The liability opinion found that \"persistent and severe\" correctional understaffing was an \"overarching\" issue permeating inadequate mental-health care.\n   <em>\n    Braggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n    257 F.

Trial. Tr. at 113. Because ongoing understaffing continues to contribute to inadequate care and noncompliance with remedial measures, understaffing also shows that monitoring is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Fourth and finally, both Drs. Burns and Perrien testified that it is important for the court to know whether ADOC is implementing the immediate relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns and Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D.

They further propose that the monitor conduct both document review\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   site visits, as well as use any other method of gathering information that the monitor deems necessary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274023\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/257/1171/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the plaintiffs propose that the monitor be Dr. Perrien, who is the defendants' expert consultant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   By contrast, the defendants oppose monitoring for immediate relief, essentially arguing that the court should wait to impose a global monitoring scheme that covers all remedial orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Proposed Opinion and Order (doc. no. 2499) at 48-50. The defendants previously proposed a global monitoring plan, which the court is currently considering alongside the plaintiffs' proposed plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   The court rejects the defendants' arguments. Monitoring of the immediate relief ordered here can no more wait for a global monitoring scheme than the immediate relief can wait for the remaining suicide-prevention relief to be resolved. Both are needed now, as they both go together. For the reasons discussed below, the court will establish an interim external monitor of the immediate relief, whose monitoring activities will consist of both document review\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   site visits. The court will also require ADOC to institute an internal monitoring scheme dedicated to the immediate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   iii. The PLRA and Monitoring\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   The parties disagree about whether court monitoring is \"prospective relief\" and therefore subject to the PLRA's need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). The defendants contend that it is. By contrast, the plaintiffs argue that, to the extent monitoring is limited to informing the court whether the defendants comply with court orders, the requirement does not apply, because such monitoring constitutes a\n   <em>\n    means\n   </em>\n   to relief, as opposed to \"prospective relief\" within the meaning of the PLRA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   The caselaw is unclear as to whether the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement applies to court monitoring. Some district courts have held that monitoring is a means to relief, rather than \"prospective relief,\" and therefore is not subject to the requirement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Carruthers v.

Supp. 2d at 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that monitoring \"cannot be relief\" and to find otherwise \"would conflate relief with the means to guarantee its provision\"). On\n   the other hand, the Second Circuit stated in dictum that it was \"somewhat problematic\" for the district court in the case before it to conclude that monitoring is not relief within the meaning of the PLRA.\n   <em>\n    Fraser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096568\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/35/#p49\">\n    343 F.3d at 48-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rec. S 14611, 14626 (Sen. Dole) (1995)). Additionally, because the monitoring body at issue had \"substantial responsibilities,\" there was \"no easy distinction between relief itself and the monitoring of relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096568\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/35/#p49\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After making these observations, the Second Circuit refrained from resolving whether monitoring constituted prospective relief, because it held that the district court had made the appropriate need-narrowness-intrusiveness findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096568\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/35/#p49\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   Ultimately, this court need not resolve whether monitoring is \"prospective relief\" subject to the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement, because, as elaborated below, the monitoring ordered here satisfies the requirement. So, to the extent monitoring must meet the requirement, it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   iv. Ordered Monitoring Relief\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    External Monitoring\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   The court will establish an\n   <em>\n    external\n   </em>\n   monitor. To the extent that the PLRA applies to court monitoring, external monitoring meets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement. The reasons identified above for why monitoring is necessary also show why\n   <em>\n    external\n   </em>\n   monitoring satisfies the requirement. Those include the liability opinion's finding of ADOC's inadequate oversight of mental-health care, ADOC's failure to internally monitor problems with suicide prevention and compliance with remedial orders, as well as ADOC's systematic noncompliance with agreed-to remedial measures related to suicide prevention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fraser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096568\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/35/#p49\">\n    343 F.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the argument that external, rather than internal, monitoring did not satisfy the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement particularly given that the defendant's \"compliance with its remedial responsibilities has been consistently incomplete and inadequate\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   Furthermore, Dr. Burns testified that external monitoring of the immediate relief is necessary, given that \"suicide is the worst outcome and requires some immediate response and attempts to remedy.\" Burns Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 209. Waiting for ADOC to create its own monitoring plan for immediate relief would simply take too long, she opined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 208.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   Granted, Dr. Perrien did not view external monitoring as necessary, and instead endorsed the idea that ADOC come up with its own plan to monitor the immediate relief, potentially with the help of an outside consultant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Perrien Apr. 9, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 211. Her main reason for preferring internal monitoring, however, is unconvincing. Specifically, Dr. Perrien was concerned with a potential lack of continuity between the interim monitor ordered here, and the global monitoring scheme that the court is considering ordering for all the remedial orders--an issue that the court has yet to resolve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 210; Perrien Apr. 10, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 62. Yet Dr. Perrien's concern with continuity actually weighs in favor of external monitoring. This is because under both the defendants' and the plaintiffs' proposed global monitoring plans,\n   <em>\n    external\n   </em>\n   monitors would begin the monitoring process, which would then gradually transition to an internal team. Indeed, the defendants propose that all quarterly evaluations during the first year of monitoring \"shall be conducted exclusively\" by the external monitoring\n   team, as opposed to the internal team. Defendants' Proposed Monitoring Plan (doc. no. 2115) at 13. Therefore, continuity of monitoring is best assured by having an\n   <em>\n    external\n   </em>\n   interim monitor, just as there would be external monitors when global monitoring begins under both the defendants' and the plaintiffs' plans. Finally, the court sees no reason why the interim monitoring plan could not require, to the extent possible, an easy transition to a global monitoring plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   The defendants have conceded that the external monitoring proposed in their global monitoring plan meets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement, which provides further support for finding that the requirement is met here with respect to external monitoring for immediate relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Pretrial Monitoring Brief (doc. no. 2145) at 36 (\"The ADOC structured the Plan ... so that each requirement meets\" the PLRA standard). In their global monitoring plan, the defendants admit that ADOC does not have the internal resources or capacity to effectively monitor, which is why their plan \"necessarily requires the initial assistance of\" an external monitoring team. Defendants' Proposed Monitoring Plan (doc. no. 2115) at 2. This admission is as much true about the immediate need for interim external monitoring for suicide prevention as it is about global external monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   Finally, the testimony of Crook and Dr. Kern specifically supports the need for external monitoring. Both admitted that OHS does not currently have the capacity to monitor compliance with all the remedial orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crook Apr. 3, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2486) at 68-69; Kern Mar. 29, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2483) at 165. Crucially, Crook said that, given this lack of capacity, the external monitoring that the defendants proposed in their global monitoring plan is the \"direction that we are looking towards.\" Crook Apr. 4, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2487) at 60. Dr. Kern similarly testified that, if there was an external and internal compliance team, as proposed by the defendants for the global scheme, it \"would very much help us\" to ensure compliance with the remedial orders. Kern Mar. 29, 2019, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2483) at 165. That two senior ADOC officials charged with compliance oversight view external monitoring as part of the solution to their lack of monitoring capacity convincingly shows the need for external monitoring here. Placing the responsibility for monitoring additional remedial measures ordered here exclusively on ADOC's shoulders would only exacerbate its lack of capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   In short, external monitoring satisfies the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement because ADOC has proven that it simply is not up to the task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Site Visits and Document Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   The court will order that the external monitor conduct both document review\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   site visits. The defendants shall timely furnish all documents and arrange for all site visits requested by the external monitor in the exercise of his or her professional judgment, unless the defendants file an objection with the court to a particular request based on extraordinary circumstances, such as an extreme security risk. (The objection would likely be handled by one of the two magistrate judges involved in this case--the one handling mediation of outstanding issues or the one helping the court handle disputes.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   To the extent that the PLRA applies to court monitoring, the ordered site visits and document review meet the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement. The reasons identified above for why monitoring is necessary also show why both document review and site visits satisfy the requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   Moreover, both Vail's and Dr. Burns's testimony showed why site visits are essential. Vail testified that, in monitoring, \"there's really no substitute for the ability to be on site.\" Vail Apr. 3, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 176. Interviews with prisoners reveal \"[d]isconnects between what the documentation says and what actually occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And when a monitor is able to interview officers and prison administrators, \"you get a much better picture of what really happens versus what the documentation in the policy says.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Dr. Burns testified that site visits are important because they allow monitors to review many aspects of compliance that pure paperwork does not capture, such as the adequacy of the referral process, whether staff received required training, how mental-health rounds are conducted, whether treatment team meetings are structurally appropriate, and whether observation logs comport with actual practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns Dec. 6, 2018, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2254) at 52-56, 167. Dr. Burns specifically recommended site visits for monitoring of the immediate relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burns Apr. 10, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 61-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   While Dr. Perrien testified that monitoring of the immediate relief could be accomplished exclusively based on document review, without site visits,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Perrien Apr. 10, 2019, R.D. Trial Tr. at 63,\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   this view is undercut by her and Dr. Burns's joint finding that ADOC's production of documents for their suicide-prevention assessment was plagued with problems,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-1) at 2-4. Dr. Burns and Perrien's report is worth quoting at length: \"Documents produced throughout this process were frequently poorly labeled with no accompanying description of why a particular document was provided or to which request it pertained; multiple files were identified only with Bates numbers and may have been inmate records, monthly reports, crisis logs, training materials or any one of several other materials requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Overall, \"production was poorly organized which we believe reflects a similar lack of organization and consistency across institutions that must be corrected to implement a suicide prevention program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The experts' observations are consistent with what this court has observed to be ADOC's repeated inability to timely produce requested documentation throughout the remedial process, which strongly indicates a lack of an organized and well-functioning internal information system.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Order Regarding Document Production (doc. no. 2345) at 2 (noting the defendants' failure to timely produce required information about the reasons prisoners with SMIs are placed in segregation and segregation-like settings, which was \"surprising in light of the importance of the issue\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   In short, if ADOC's document production for the suicide-prevention assessment was so disorganized that the experts found that it \"must be corrected,\" Joint Expert Report and Recommendations (doc. no. 2416-1) at 4, and the court has similarly found serious problems with ADOC's document production, why should the external monitor be forced to exclusively rely on documents?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   Furthermore, the defendants' proposed global monitoring plan provides for initial site visits by the external monitoring team to all facilities not previously visited, and allows the external team to request additional visits based on their professional judgement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Proposed Monitoring Opinion (doc. no. 2295) at 13. The defendants' proposed global monitoring plan also gives the external monitoring\n   team the authority to identify what documents to review,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and places within the external monitoring team's discretion how many documents to review,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. The defendants conceded that both of these aspects of their proposed global monitoring plan meet the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement, which provides further support for finding that the requirement is met here with respect to the interim monitor's activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Pretrial Monitoring Brief (doc. no. 2145) at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   Finally, the court will impose certain limits on the site visits to ensure that the relief is narrowly tailored. The defendants can object to a particular site visit (or document request, for that matter), based on extraordinary circumstances. And site visits will be limited to two days at each facility, which ensures they are not overly intrusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vail Nov. 29, 2018, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2340) at 64 (testifying that a site visit by a monitoring team for a few days would not be unnecessarily disruptive, but that a visit for \"weeks\" might be); Burns Dec. 7, 2018, Trial Tr. (doc. no. 2256) at 242 (testifying that site visits would be disruptive if they lasted 30 days, but not three or four days).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Periodic Reports to the Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   The court will order that the interim external monitor periodically report to the court his or her assessments of ADOC's compliance with the immediate suicide relief. To the extent that the PLRA applies to court monitoring, periodic reporting meets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement. By definition, court monitors must periodically report their findings to the court; without communicating the information they obtain, they are not monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Duration of Interim External Monitor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   The court will order that the interim external monitor serve in his or her capacity of exclusively monitoring the immediate suicide-prevention relief until the monitor or monitors for a future global monitoring scheme are operating. Alternatively, if the court does not order a global monitoring remedy, or if within two years after the entry of this order the global monitoring scheme has not begun implementation, the court will simply rely on the process set forth by the PLRA for determining when to end the monitoring ordered here. This means that, at any point at least two years after the entry of this order, any party or intervenor may move to terminate the monitoring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(i). The court will terminate the monitoring unless it finds, after an evidentiary hearing, that external monitoring remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing constitutional violation, and that the monitoring continues to meet the need-narrowness-intrusiveness test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3626(b)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11179859\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/777/#p785\">\n    231 F.3d at 782-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   To the extent that the PLRA applies to court monitoring, the ordered duration of monitoring here meets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement. The reasons identified above for why monitoring is necessary also show why the duration ordered here satisfies the requirement. Furthermore, the duration provision simply mirrors the processes set forth in the PLRA for determining when to terminate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Internal Monitoring\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   The court will require ADOC to establish a formal internal monitoring scheme focused on the immediate suicide-prevention relief ordered here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   To the extent that the PLRA applies to court monitoring, the requirement to establish internal monitoring meets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement. The reasons identified above for why monitoring is necessary also show why\n   internal monitoring satisfies the requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-424\">\n   Moreover, internal monitoring is a component of the defendants' proposed global monitoring structure. The defendants conceded that the internal monitoring in their global monitoring plan meets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement, which provides further support for finding that the requirement is met here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Pretrial Monitoring Brief (doc. no. 2145) at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-425\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Open Components of Monitoring\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-426\">\n   The monitoring relief described thus far provides a general structure for monitoring of the immediate suicide-prevention measures. Virtually all the details of the internal monitoring must be filled in. Many details also still need to be filled in for\n   <em>\n    external\n   </em>\n   monitoring, including but not limited to the frequency with which the interim monitor will report to the court, what performance measures and audit tools to use, whether the monitor can make unannounced site visits, and the monitor's authority and restrictions relating to communicating with the parties and ADOC staff. Crucially, the question of who will serve as the interim external monitor also is not resolved here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   The court will order that the parties have 14 days from today's date to meet with Magistrate Judge John Ott to attempt to agree upon the remaining details of the external and internal monitoring schemes. If they cannot reach an agreement, then the defendants shall submit a proposal within 21 days from today's date that includes both external and internal monitoring schemes, and the plaintiffs shall have 28 days from today's date to respond. The proposal and response may include candidates to serve as the interim external monitor. The plans for both external and internal monitoring shall be crafted flexibly to allow, as much as possible, the easiest transition to the anticipated global monitoring scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-428\">\n   To the extent that the PLRA applies to this provision, the ordered process for filling in the remaining details of monitoring meets the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement. The reasons identified above for why monitoring is necessary also shows why the remaining details cannot simply be left up to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   Finally, in finding that each of the ordered monitoring provisions satisfies the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirement, the court gave \"substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A). The court finds that there is no such adverse impact; and that in fact, the ordered monitoring provisions, by helping to improve mental-health care for prisoners, will serve only to enhance public safety and the operation of a criminal justice system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   The defendants argue that they cannot prevent all suicides in ADOC. It is true that, as in the free world, not all suicides can be prevented.
