As the Court noted above, the traffic loop is generally in place on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings of Memorial Day Weekend from 10:00 PM to 2:00 AM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There appears to be no disagreement the traffic loop is substantially similar to the traffic loop used over Memorial Day Weekend since 2015.

Because the Court concludes Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate they are entitled to a prohibitory preliminary injunction, it follows Plaintiffs are unable to establish they should be allowed a mandatory one. Thus, it is unnecessary for the Court to determine which type of preliminary injunction Plaintiffs are requesting here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Regarding the need for a hearing, as the Court noted above, \"Rule 65 does not require an evidentiary hearing[,]\" so long as \"the party opposing the preliminary injunction [has] a fair opportunity to oppose the application and to prepare for such opposition.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonald's Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358793\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1301/#p1311\">\n    147 F.3d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).
