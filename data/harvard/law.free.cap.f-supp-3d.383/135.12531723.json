(\"Bloomberg\"). Bloomberg contracted with Optima to produce and distribute Africa-specific business news programming. Optima Sports served as Optima's guarantor. After Bloomberg terminated the contract, Optima and Optima Sports sued. Bloomberg counterclaimed, contending that Optima and Optima Sports breached the contract, that Bloomberg was fraudulently induced to enter the contract, and that Optima used Bloomberg's trademarks without authorization. Optima has moved to dismiss these counterclaims on several grounds. For the reasons explained below, Optima's motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Optima represented to Bloomberg that \"it was financially solvent and fully capable of assuming responsibility for the production, administration, and management necessary to offer live programming meeting Bloomberg brand standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.

The Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2012, the parties signed the Agreement, contracting \"to create original live programming with the editorial, technical and substantive style of BTV\" that would be branded as \"Bloomberg West Africa\" and distributed into certain African markets. Agreement at 1, Under the Agreement, on or before June 30, 2012, Optima would produce \"a live weekday programming window or windows of not more than four (4) hours per day in duration ('the Channel Window')\" that would consist primarily of business news, general news, and current affairs programming for a West African audience. Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 1(a)(i), 1(a)(iv)(a). As to the Channel Window, Optima was responsible for \"all production and administration,\" \"management of al day-to-day operations,\" \"payment of all 'set up' and maintenance costs,\" and \"such other administrative functions as are customary for the operation of a channel or programming similar to the Channel Window.\" Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 1(a)(ii)(b)(i), (ii), (xii), 1(a)(ii)(a). Optima agreed to obtain and maintain, at its own expense \"any and all rights, licenses, approvals, clearances, releases, [and] local[ ] and international authorizations\" necessary to perform its contractual obligations and to operate its business under the Agreement. Agreement \u00b6 12(b)(iv), (1)(a)(ii)(b)(xi); Amendment \u00b6 2. Optima also represented that it would comply with all applicable laws with respect to its rights and obligations under the Agreement. Agreement \u00b6 12(b)(v). Finally, Optima generally represented that it would \"fulfill its obligations to Bloomberg ... [as] set forth in the Agreement.\" Agreement \u00b6 12(b)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Agreement also contained a number of provisions on the use of Bloomberg's marks, names, and other intellectual property, including \" 'Bloomberg,' 'Bloomberg Television,' and 'BTV,' and any variations or derivatives thereof.\" Agreement \u00b6 9; Am. Counter. \u00b6 13. Optima was prohibited from using these marks in any manner that \"would tend to devalue, injure or dilute the goodwill or reputation of Bloomberg, its Affiliated Companies, its licensors or the Bloomberg Marks.\" Agreement 4(b)(ii). The Agreement also required that Optima strictly adhere to the Bloomberg Editorial Code of Ethics, that programming be consistent with Bloomberg's journalistic integrity and standards, and that the programming not be inappropriate or embarrassing to Bloomberg. Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 1(a)(ii)(b)(viii), 1(a)(iii)(b), 2, 2(b), 2(c). Upon termination of the Agreement, Optima's rights to Bloomberg's marks would terminate immediately and Optima was required to immediately cease representing to the public any affiliation with Bloomberg in connection with the Agreement. Agreement \u00b6 8(b)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Optima and Optima Sport's Alleged Failures to Perform\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the Agreement, Optima was to begin producing content by June 2012, but it did not begin doing so until at least November 2013. Am. Counter. \u00b6 21. Bloomberg alleges that Optima never produced\n   a live weekday programming window on a weekly basis with the \"editorial, technical, and substantive style\" of Bloomberg Television.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Agreement \u00b6 1(a)(i); Agreement at 1). This was allegedly attributable in large part to Optima's persistent failure to make payments to its staff, as well as vendors, governments, and other third parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. This led to a host of problems, which Bloomberg details at length: work stoppages and staff departures, loss of access to content, cancellation of programming, threats of lawsuits by unpaid vendors, unpaid taxes, and other delays.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-37. Some of these affected Bloomberg directly, such as Optima's failure to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees Bloomberg had invoiced and the cancellation of an interview that Bloomberg had helped to arrange.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bloomberg also alleges that Optima failed to comply with the Nigerian regulatory process and obtain the requisite approvals for the exchange of large amounts of foreign currency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. This was despite the fact that \"other commercial entities\" in Nigeria were able to perform foreign exchange transactions and convert currency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Optima's inability to convert currency was part of the reason for its failure to pay its staff and vendors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Optima also failed to obtain approvals to shoot in certain public areas but did so anyway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. Finally, Bloomberg received complaints that persons affiliated with Optima were benefiting financially from stories that they produced and Bloomberg was informed by third parties that Optima had \"developed a poor reputation\" and that there were concerns over the quality of Bloomberg TV Africa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bloomberg terminated the Agreement on May 7, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Weeks after this termination, Bloomberg received information from an Optima employee, Richard Harrison, detailing Optima's outstanding debts, allegations of fraud against Optima's CEO, and purported pending government investigations into Optima.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For at least seven months after the termination of the Agreement, Optima continued to use several communication channels that included the Bloomberg name including: www.bloombergtvafrica.com; www.bloomberg-optimamedia.com; the email address for Bloomberg-optimamedia.com; a Facebook page for Bloomberg TV Africa (\"btvafrica\"); a btvafrica YouTube page; and a @bloombergtvafri Twitter feed. Am. Counter. \u00b6 53-54. Bloomberg sent Optima several cease and desist letters regarding Optima's use of the registered marks \"Bloomberg\" and \"BTV.\" Am. Counter. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. Bloomberg also petitioned Youtube and Facebook to take down the allegedly infringing pages. Am. Counter. \u00b6 55. Optima continues to operate a live YouTube page entitled \"BTVA Newsroom,\" a live Facebook account called \"BTVA Newsroom,\" a live Instagram page named \"@btvanewsroom,\" and a live Twitter feed at \"@btvanews.\" Am. Counter. \u00b6 58. Each of these bears \"an orange logo evocative of Bloomberg's brand, and each display[s] on-screen visual elements belonging to Bloomberg.\" Am. Counter. \u00b6 58. Bloomberg alleges that Optima's actions have undermined goodwill towards Bloomberg and its reputation for quality broadcasting, as well as deterred potential Bloomberg licensees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Bloomberg alleges that it relied on these misrepresentations to its detriment. Optima challenges that Bloomberg (1) has not alleged its fraudulent inducement counterclaim with sufficient particularity, (2) that Bloomberg has not sufficiently alleged scienter or reasonable reliance, (3) and that Bloomberg has not alleged actual harm.

Counter. \u00b6\u00b6 70-71, Optima argues that none of Bloomberg's allegations, such as failure to pay staff and vendors, plausibly violate express provisions of the Agreement. Opt. Mot. at 16. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Under the Agreement, Optima was responsible for \"the payment of all 'set-up' and maintenance costs related [to the Channel Window],\" \"all production and administration of the Channel Window,\" \"management of all day-to-day operations of the Channel Window,\" and \"such other administrative functions as are customary for the operation of a channel or programming similar to the Channel Window.\" Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 1(a)(ii), (a)(ii)(b)(i), (ii), and (xii). Bloomberg alleges a long list of ways in which Optima's repeated failures to pay staff and vendors-in a timely manner or otherwise-caused disruptions in the production of programming. Am. Counter. \u00b6\u00b6 22-32, 45. These disruptions include cancellations, work stoppages, and loss of access to valuable content.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=462%20N.E.2d%201176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Bloomberg also alleges that Optima failed to adequately staff its studios or build a studio in accordance with the technical specifications of the Agreement. Am. Counter. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 45-46. Bloomberg argues that these failures undermined the core purpose of the Agreement, which was for Optima to \"create original live programming with the editorial, technical, and substantive style\" of Bloomberg Television. Agreement at 1. Drawing all reasonable inferences in Bloomberg's favor, Bloomberg has plausibly alleged that Optima's failure to fully staff its facilities or build them in accordance with the Agreement's specifications breached Optima's obligation to pay set-up and maintenance costs for the Channel Window. Similarly, Bloomberg's allegations regarding Optima's failures to pay staff and vendors, and the many disruptions that ensued, plausibly allege that Optima breached both the requirement that Optima pay set-up and maintenance costs, as well as assume responsibility for the\n   day-to-day management and administration of the Channel Window in a manner that is customary for such a project. This is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Bloomberg Has Sufficiently Alleged that Optima Breached the Agreement by Failing to Obtain Proper Licenses and Approvals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As to Bloomberg's third set of breach allegations, Am. Counter. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73, Optima argues that the provisions in the Agreement requiring it to obtain the necessary government licenses and approvals do not extend to the process for seeking approval to convert Nigerian currency into foreign currency. The Court again disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Pursuant to the Agreement, Optima was required to \"obtain, and ... maintain, at its own expense, any and all rights, licenses, approvals, clearances, releases, local, and international authorizations necessary to perform its obligations under the Agreement and to operate the business it is conducting in connection with its rights and obligations under the Agreement\" and to \"obtai[n] and maintai[n] all necessary licenses, approvals, and consents from the relevant government authorities.\" Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 12(b)(iv), 1(a)(ii)(b)(xi); Amendment \u00b6 2. Bloomberg alleges that Optima breached the Agreement by failing to comply with the Nigerian regulatory process and obtain Nigerian Central Bank approvals required to convert significant sums of Nigerian currency. This, Bloomberg alleges, was partly to blame for the non-payments and resulting disruptions mentioned above. Optima counters that because companies do not \"obtain and maintain\" the ability to exchange Nigerian currency, the above language in the Agreement does not extend to the process of converting currency. Opt. Mot. at 17. Yet Optima's argument is fundamentally a factual dispute about Bloomberg's characterization of the process for exchanging Nigerian currency, which is unavailing on this motion to dismiss. In addition, Optima does not address Bloomberg's allegations that Optima failed to obtain necessary permits or licenses in creating some of its programming-such as obtaining approval to film in public areas in the Middle East. The Court concludes that Bloomberg's allegations are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Bloomberg Has Sufficiently Alleged that Optima Breached the Provisions of the Agreement Governing the Use of Bloomberg's Marks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Turning to Bloomberg's fourth set of breach allegations, Am. Counter. \u00b6\u00b6 76-77. Bloomberg alleges that Optima breached the Agreement's limitations on the use of Bloomberg's brand, marks, and other intellectual property by: (i) using these marks pre-termination in ways that did not meet Bloomberg brand standards and reflected poorly on Bloomberg and its brand, and (ii) continuing to use the marks post-termination. Optima moves to dismiss on several grounds, none of which are availing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   First, prior to the termination of the Agreement, Optima was prohibited from using the Bloomberg Marks \"in any manner that would tend to devalue, injure or dilute the goodwill or reputation of Bloomberg, its Affiliated Companies, its licensors, or the Bloomberg Marks.\" Agreement \u00b6 4(b)(ii). Bloomberg alleges that while creating content for the project Optima failed to follow government regulations, that Bloomberg received complaints about violations of ethics and editorial standards at Optima, and that Bloomberg was told Optima was developing a bad reputation and there were concerns over the quality of Bloomberg TV Africa's programming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Am. Counter, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43. Optima tries to argue that Bloomberg only alleges that\n   <em>\n    Optima's\n   </em>\n   reputation was damaged. Opt. Mot. Rep. at 6-7. Yet, drawing all reasonable inferences in Bloomberg's favor, Bloomberg has sufficiently pled that Optima's actions-which Optima took while acting as Bloomberg's African licensee and employing Bloomberg's marks-\n   <em>\n    tended\n   </em>\n   to devalue, injure, or dilute the goodwill or reputation of Bloomberg and its marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, upon the termination of the Agreement, Optima's right to use Bloomberg's marks under the Agreement terminated immediately. Agreement \u00b6 8(b)(iv). Bloomberg alleges that despite this, Optima continued to use websites, social media accounts, and an email address, that contained \"bloomberg,\" \"btvafrica,\" and \"BTVA.\" Am. Counter. \u00b6\u00b6 54-58. Optima, relying on a separate section of paragraph 8(b)(iv), counters that only use of the marks in a manner that relates to the \"subject matter\" of the Agreement is prohibited. Opt. Mot. at 18; Opt. Mot. Rep. at 6-7. Yet it is far from clear that the language Optima cites serves to limit the later language in the provision, which states without qualification that Optima's rights to use Bloomberg's marks ends immediately upon termination of the Agreement. And beyond the question of the validity of Optima's reading, the use of terms such as \"bloombergtvafrica\" and \"BTVA\" is clearly related to the subject matter of the Agreement. Finally, Optima's argument that \"BTVA\" did not constitute Bloomberg property under the Agreement is directly contradicted by the Agreement's text. Agreement \u00b6 9(a) (Bloomberg owns the trademarks \"Bloomberg,\" \"Bloomberg Television,\" \"BTV,\" and \"any variations or derivatives thereof\"). Therefore, Bloomberg has sufficiently pled a claim for breach based on Optima's post-termination actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons given above, Bloomberg has sufficiently alleged that Optima breached the Agreement by its use of Bloomberg's marks both pre- and post-termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Bloomberg's Counterclaims Against Optima Sports Are Dismissed in Part\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Turning now to Optima Sports specifically, Optima argues that Bloomberg has failed to identify any express provision of the Agreement relating to Optima Sports that Optima Sports has allegedly breached. The Court agrees with Optima in large part, with the exception of one provision of the Agreement setting out Optima's Sports' responsibilities as Guarantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The majority of Bloomberg's allegations against Optima Sports do not plausibly identify any provisions of the contract that Optima Sports has breached. Bloomberg does not differentiate between Optima and Optima Sports in its breach of contract counterclaims-confusingly using \"Optima\" as shorthand to refer to both. Amend. Count. at 1. And Bloomberg fails to identify how most of its allegations against Optima relate to Optima Sports' duties under the Agreement. As is relevant here, the Agreement only provides one duty to Optima Sports. Namely, if Optima fails to pay the licensing fees due under the Agreement. Optima Sports \"shall ensure that such payments are made good to Bloomberg either by [Optima Sports] or by [Optima] itself.\" Agreement \u00b6 10(d). This obligation of Optima Sport's is \"more particularly described and governed by the Guaranty of even date signed by [Optima Sports] and Bloomberg.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=462%20N.E.2d%201176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither party has provided the Court with a copy of the Guaranty. As Optima points out, Bloomberg's allegations about, for example,\n   staff non-payment or failure to obtain approval for filming are not related to the above language. These allegations cannot support a breach claim against Optima Sports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Bloomberg's response is to advance an unavailable reading of the Agreement. According to Bloomberg, because the first paragraph of the Agreement that states Optima Sports will thereinafter be referred to as \"the 'Guarantor.' \" Optima Sports is liable without limitation or qualification for Optima's performance under the Agreement. This is not a credible reading of the plain language. The substance of this section of the first paragraph of the Agreement is simply to name and identify the parties, not set out their respective responsibilities. Agreement at 1. Moreover, the content of Optima Sports' duties as Guarantor are explicitly spelled out in the Agreement, and the Court will therefore not engraft further, implied responsibilities,\n   <em>\n    Spinelli v.

Indeed, if all of Optima's responsibilities were also Optima Sports', then the provisions laying out Optima Sports' specific responsibility for licensing payments would be superfluous.\n   <em>\n    Galli v.

Therefore, Bloomberg has failed to plausibly allege that Optima Sports breached provisions of the Agreement that do not refer to Optima Sports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   However, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, at this stage Bloomberg has plausibly alleged that Optima Sports breached its expressly-defined duties as Guarantor. Bloomberg alleges that Optima failed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in required payments and fees. Am. Counter. \u00b6 36. As Guarantor, Optima Sports was required to \"ensure that [licensing] payments are made good to Bloomberg either by [Optima Sports] or by [Optima] itself.\" Agreement \u00b6 10(d). Drawing all available inferences in Bloomberg's favor, and without the benefit of the Guaranty between the parties, the Court cannot conclude that, as a matter of law, Bloomberg has failed to state a claim against Optima Sports for failing to fulfill its duties as Guarantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the reasons above, the Court dismisses Bloomberg's counterclaim for breach of contract against Optima Sports, except with respect to unpaid licensing fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Bloomberg Has Sufficiently Plead Damages for Lost Licensing Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, Optima moves the Court to dismiss Bloomberg's request for lost licensing fees for the period after the May 2015 termination of the Agreement. Am. Counter. \u00b6 65. Optima challenges that Bloomberg's choice to terminate the Agreement caused these lost fees, not Optima's alleged breaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Under New York law, \"to recover damages for lost profits, it must be shown that: (1) the damages were caused by the breach; (2) the alleged loss must be capable of proof with reasonable certainty, and (3) the particular damages were within the contemplation of the parties to the contract at the time it was made.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashland Mgmt.

The Court also dismisses Bloomberg's second counterclaim in part, dismissing it as to trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, but not as to its New York common law counterclaim. Finally, the Court dismisses Bloomberg's third counterclaim for fraudulent inducement in its entirety. Bloomberg has already amended its counterclaims once in response to Optima's initial motion, which pressed the same arguments as those Optima raises here. Moreover, Bloomberg has not requested an opportunity to amend nor stated what amendments, if any, it would seek to make.
