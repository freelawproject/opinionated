On November 28, 2017, Minnesota Life removed this action from California Superior Court, County of Kern on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2019, Minnesota Life filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. ECF No. 20. Mrs. Vogt filed an opposition on January 31, 2019. ECF No. 22. Minnesota Life filed a reply on February 7, 2019, ECF No. 23, and Mrs. Vogt filed a sur-reply on February 11, 2019. ECF No. 25. The issue presented on this summary judgment motion is whether Mr. Vogt's death is a covered loss under the terms of the accidental death policy and whether the terms of the insurance policy preclude insurance coverage for Mr. Vogt's death. The Court finds it appropriate to rule on the motion without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 230(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 1, 2016, Minnesota Life issued Policy Number 39512-G-US-286 (\"the\n   Policy\") to Frank Vogt. UMF 1. The Policy provided for a $ 150,000 benefit upon the accidental death of Mr. Vogt and named Mrs. Vogt as the beneficiary. UMF 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Terms of Mr. Vogt's Accidental Death and Dismemberment Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Policy provides an accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefit. Declaration of Kathy Schmidt, ECF No. 20-4 (\"Schmidt Decl.\"), Ex. A. Under the heading \"Exclusions and Covered Losses[,]\" the Policy in pertinent part provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    What is a covered loss?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This certificate provides limited coverage. This means we will provide benefits only when your loss results directly - and independently - from all other causes, from an accidental bodily injury which was unintended, unexpected and unforeseen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The bodily injury must be evidenced by a visible contusion or wound, except in the case of accidental drowning. The bodily injury must by the sole cause of your loss. The injury and loss must occur while your coverage is in force. Your loss must occur within 365 days after the date of the accidental injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    What losses are not covered?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In no event will we pay a benefit where your loss or injury is caused directly or indirectly by, results from, or there is contribution from, any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (4) bodily or mental infirmity, illness or disease;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Schmidt Decl., Ex.

While much of this is not material for the purposes of this motion, the Court will briefly note it here for context. Between 2000 and 2006, Mr. Vogt had knee issues requiring injections. UMF 6. Mr. Vogt broke his hip in 2010, which required Mr. Vogt to use a walker at times thereafter. UMF 7. Between 2012 and 2016, Mr. Vogt had \"some dementia problems and he had some walking problems from his knee,\" as well as pulmonary artery disease. UMF 9-10. In September 2016, Mr. Vogt was having circulatory problems and also fell and broke his hip. UMF 11. In or around September 2016, Mr. Vogt's dementia was getting worse and he experienced night terrors and shaking of his hands. UMF 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In December 2016, Mrs. Vogt and her husband requested that Mr. Vogt enter palliative care, because Mrs. Vogt was having difficulty helping him since Mr. Vogt was weak in his legs and Mrs. Vogt had a shoulder issue which made it difficult for her to lift him off his bed when he was having trouble with his knee. UMF 13; PUF 115-116. However, after a nurse from Kaiser Permanente (\"Kaiser\") evaluated Mr. Vogt, she felt that he needed more help than palliative care would provide and arranged, together with Mr. Vogt's doctor, for Mr. Vogt to receive hospice care. UMF 13; PUF 117. Part of the reason Mr. Vogt was admitted to hospice was because of his terminal diagnosis of Parkinson's disease which was significant enough to cause\n   weakness and multiple falls. UMF 17-18. In mid December 2016, Mr. Vogt began hospice care and at that time he was also experiencing mood swings, decreased appetite, and weight loss. UMF 20. The local fire department had come to Mr. Vogt's home several times because Mr. Vogt had fallen and Plaintiff could not lift her husband when he fell. UMF 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Circumstances of Mr. Vogt's Death\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On January 10, 2017, Mr. Vogt suffered a fall in his bedroom. UMF 24; PSF 118. The fire department was called and he was taken to the hospital where he was treated and diagnosed with a contusion to his hip. UMF 25. Plaintiff disputes that this was the only injury caused by the fall and states that he also hit his head and complained of head pain and headaches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Mrs. Vogt first found her husband on the floor of his bedroom he complained that his hip, ribs, and head hurt. UMF 121. When the fire department arrived and tried to help move him, Mr. Vogt screamed in pain and it was determined that Mr. Vogt needed to be transported to the hospital. PSF 121. The ambulance and emergency room records document Mr. Vogt's complaints of head pain. PSF 124-125. After Mr. Vogt's fall, his functionality noticeably declined and the hospice nurses increased their weekly visits from twice a week to every day as a result of this decline. PSF 133-134. Mr. Vogt was unable to eat food between the time of his fall and his death one week later and he was bedbound following the fall. UMF 135-136. Within a few days of the fall, Mr. Vogt became completely nonverbal and was no longer able to take oral medications. PSF 139. Within five days of the fall, Mr. Vogt was unable to swallow and was restless and only taking water by swab. PSF 141-142. By January 17, 2017, Mr. Vogt was still not eating, was unresponsive, bedbound, and imminently dying. PSF 142-143. The hospice notes indicated that Mr. Vogt had \"significantly declined since his fall on 1-10-17.\" PSF 141. On January 18, 2017, Mr. Vogt died at the age of 80 years old. UMF 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Vogt's original Certificate of Vital Record (\"death certificate\") was completed by Dr. Anthony H. Fung and listed Parkinson's Disease as the \"Cause of Death.\" Schmidt Decl., Ex. C; UMF 27. When a patient who is in hospice dies, the death certificate usually indicates the terminal diagnosis that was the basis for the referral to hospice as the cause of death and Dr. Fung did not know that Mr. Vogt had fallen when he prepared the initial death certificate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Response to UMF 27. Dr. Fung amended Mr. Vogt's death certificate after Mrs. Vogt informed Dr. Fung of Mr. Vogt's January 10 fall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UMF 28. The amended death certificate edits the \"immediate cause\" of death- defined as \"final disease or condition resulting in death\" which was previously listed on Line A of the death certificate as Parkinson's-to indicate \"cardiopulmonary failure\" as the immediate cause of death. Schmidt Decl., Ex. C. The amended certificate also includes additional causes of death. The certificate states \"[s]equentially, list conditions, if any, leading to cause on Line A. Enter UNDERLYING CAUSE (disease or injury that initiated the events resulting in death) LAST.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Listing additional causes on the amended death certificate, Dr. Fung listed \"recurrent falls\" on Line B, and on Line C, he lists Parkinson's disease last.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Minnesota Life's Denial of Mrs. Vogt's Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mrs. Vogt submitted an accidental death claim for Mr. Vogt's death, including a letter explaining the January 10, 2017 fall, a Fall Questionnaire, and certain medical records from his fall.

After receiving some medical records,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minnesota Life reviewed the records and asked for and received guidance from its in-house-medical director, Dr. Maryam Shapland. UMF 32-34. Dr. Shapland opined that the cause of Mr. Vogt's death was \"his advanced PD and AD\" which caused poor balance and weakness, leading to his fall. PSF 171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On July 7, 2017, Minnesota Life denied Mrs. Vogt's accidental death claim, stating that there was not sufficient evidence that Mr. Vogt's death resulted \"directly and independently from all causes, from injuries sustained in a fall on January 10, 2017.\" Schmidt Decl., Ex. B at 14. The denial letter refers to the amended death certificate and medical records that support the cause of death as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in support of its denial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Minnesota Life concluded that \"[t]he claim is not payable as Mr. Vogt's death was caused directly or indirectly by, resulted from, or there was contribution from bodily or mental infirmity, illness or disease, specifically his severe Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.\" Schmidt Decl., Ex. B at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After the commencement of this litigation, Minnesota Life learned during depositions of Minnesota Life witnesses in May 2018 that there were certain hospice records that it had not received. UMF 36. Minnesota Life then reviewed these additional records, including a review by Dr. Shapland, and again determined that there was no evidence to support Plaintiff's claim and denied benefits again in two subsequent letters dated November 15, 2018 and January 9, 2019.

ECF No. 20. Defendant argues that the breach of contract claim fails because Plaintiff cannot demonstrate Minnesota Life denied benefits that were due under the insurance contract and that denial of Plaintiff's claim for accidental death benefits was proper under the terms of the Policy. ECF No. 20 at 2; ECF No. 20-1 at 2. Minnesota Life determined Plaintiff's claim for accidental death benefits was not payable on July 7, 2017 because Mr. Vogt's death was caused by a combination of disease factors and was not due to an accident. ECF No. 20-1 at 5. In this regard, Minnesota Life contends: \"Mr. Vogt's death was a combination of two primary causes: Parkinson's disease, and cardiopulmonary failure. He also experienced recurrent fails caused by his terminal diseases.\" ECF No. 20-1 at 5. Minnesota Life argues that even though Mr. Vogt suffered a fall during the last week of his life, this does mean that the already \"weak, frail, and terminally ill Mr. Vogt ['s]\u2026death was caused by an accident\" and that there is no medical evidence that links Mr. Vogt's January 2017 fall to his death. ECF No. 20-1 at 2. Minnesota Life also contends that the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim fails first because Plaintiff cannot show that benefits were due under the Policy and second, even if Plaintiff could show that benefits were due, she cannot show that withholding of benefits was unreasonable. ECF No. 20 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff in opposition argues that the Policy is not enforceable as written, pointing to California Supreme Court precedent, as well as other California court cases, which have reinterpreted the language in the Policy to be less limited than it is written. ECF No. 22 at 17-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff\n   also has submitted evidence that Plaintiff suffered a head injury when he fell on January 10, 2017 and evidence showing that his physical condition deteriorated drastically following the fall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. As a result, Plaintiff contends Minnesota Life is not entitled to summary judgment because she has presented evidence that Mr. Vogt's accidental fall proximately caused his death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. With respect the breach of the implied covenant claim, Plaintiff submits that Minnesota Life completely ignored overwhelming evidence that Mr. Vogt hit his head during his fall and failed to investigate the possibility that his death was caused by his head injury, instead rushing to judgment by focusing on Mr. Vogt's status as hospice patient. ECF No. 22 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because Plaintiff has presented evidence which creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to what proximately caused Mr. Vogt's death, Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As an initial matter, jurisdiction in this case is based upon diversity, and both parties agree that the interpretation of the subject insurance policy is governed by the law of the State of California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Insurance Co. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7645992\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/107/1344/#p1346\">\n    107 F.3d 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1346 (9th Cir. 1997) (applying California insurance law in diversity case).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In moving for summary judgment, Minnesota Life contends that the express terms of the accidental death and dismemberment Policy are clear and unambiguous in providing that benefits are only provided when the \"loss results directly - and independently - from all other causes, from an accidental bodily injury which was unintended, unexpected, and unforeseen[;]\" \"[t]he bodily injury must be the sole cause of [the insured's] loss[;]\" and the policy specifically excludes coverage where the insured's \"loss or injury is caused directly or indirectly by, results from, or there is a contribution from...bodily or mental infirmity, illness, or disease.\" ECF No. 20-1 at 7. Minnesota Life further points that Mr. Vogt's death certificate indicates that the primary causes of Mr. Vogt's death were Parkinson's disease and cardiopulmonary failure and accordingly not accidental as defined by the Policy. Minnesota Life mentions in passing the amended death certificate also \"mentioned recurrent falls\" as a cause of death, however, it argues Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Mr. Vogt's death resulted directly from an accident and was independent of all other causes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As Plaintiff points out, under California law, the Policy language referring to \"directly and independently\" of all other causes has been interpreted more broadly as permitting recovery if the accident is the \"proximate cause\" or \"initiating cause\" of the loss even if a disease may have contributed to the accident.

Minnesota Life states that Mr. Vogt did not suffer a head injury as a result of the January 10, 2017 fall, only a contusion on his hip. ECF No. 20-1 at 7. However, the medical records submitted by Plaintiff, including the ambulance and emergency room records from January 10,\n   2017 do in fact indicate that Mr. Vogt may have experienced a head injury of some sort as a result of his fall. PSF 124-125. Mr. Vogt complained to his wife that his head hurt when she first found him on the floor after he fell and the ambulance and emergency records also make note of Mr. Vogt's complaints of head pain. PSF 123-125. Additionally, the emergency room physician, Dr. Kumar, testified that as a result of the complained of head pain after the fall, she normally would have ordered a CT scan of his brain but ultimately did not because Mr. Vogt was on hospice and the focus was more appropriately on pain management rather than diagnostics. PSF 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Minnesota Life also argues that \"Plaintiff cannot show\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   causal link between the January 10, 2017 fall caused by his disease and his death.\" ECF No. 20-1 at 7 (emphasis in original). Again, the evidence submitted by Plaintiff contradicts this assertion. Plaintiff submits evidence that Mr. Vogt's functionality decreased noticeably following the fall on January 10, 2017 until the time of his death on January 18, 2017. PSF 127-143. For example, prior to the fall, Mr. Vogt was eating 1-2 meals per day and after the fall he was unable to eat any food. PSF 130, 133. Prior to his fall, Mr. Vogt was able to walk with the aid of walker, sit and watch TV, enjoy the company of the family dogs, and verbally communicate. PSF 128. After the fall, Mr. Vogt was bedridden, was barely verbal within three days of falling, and was no longer able to swallow his oral medication. PSF 131 136, 139. The hospice nurses increased the number of weekly visits to the Vogt's from twice a week to daily following the fall due to the significant decline in Mr. Vogt's functionality. PSF 134. Plaintiff also submitted a declaration of its medical expert, Dr. Martin Pietruszka, who opines that the most probable cause of Mr. Vogt's death involves \"the central nervous system and the occurrence of a subdural hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage, a brain contusion and/or a fluid and electrolyte imbalance resulting from brain injury.\" PSF 145-148.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further opines that to a\n   reasonable degree of medical certainty, it is more probable than not that one or all of these diagnoses reasonably occurred as a consequence of the head trauma Mr. Vogt suffered in the January 10, 2017 fall and that none of Mr. Vogt's prior medical diagnosis were the direct cause of his death. PSF 149, 150. Accordingly, contrary to Defendant's assertion that there is no evidence of either Mr. Vogt's head injury or of a causal link between Mr. Vogt's fall and his death, Plaintiff has presented evidence on both these points. Accordingly, there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial as to whether Mr. Vogt's disease or disease processes proximately caused his death or whether his fall proximately caused his death as defined in\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   and the related line of cases from this case by stating \"none of the decedents in any of these cases were in declining health of the type Mr. Vogt experienced, nor were they on hospice.\" ECF No. 23 at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, both\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Happoldt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    a case cited by Defendant\n   </em>\n   , involved insureds with declining health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20-1 at 8.\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   involved an insured who was suffering from an incurable cancer, spent most of his time in bed, was attended by day and night nurses, and \"for several weeks before his death he was given morphine and other drugs in large quantities to relieve constantly increasing pain.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2189868\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-2d/27/305/\">\n    27 Cal. 2d at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=163%20P.2d%20689\">\n    163 P.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One jury instruction provided: \"[T]he burden is upon plaintiff to prove affirmatively that the accident, if any, is the proximate cause\n   of death, and, therefore, unless you find that the fractured hip which occurred approximately one month before Mr. Happoldt's death was and is in fact the proximate, prime, or moving cause of his death or that it set in progress the chain of events leading directly to his death, your verdict must be in favor of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 401,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20P.2d%2055\">\n    203 P.2d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court found that this adequately instructed jury on the burden of proof and affirmed the verdict for Plaintiff. Accordingly, the fact that Mr. Vogt was suffering from Parkinson's disease or on hospice does not preclude coverage under the Policy under California law despite Defendant's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Additionally, Defendant's argument implies that because Mr. Vogt was likely to die soon anyway, as evidenced by his placement in hospice, the insurance Policy could not provide coverage for him in his fragile and weakened state even if he experienced an accidental fall because his disease caused him to fall.

The Court has already found that Plaintiff has submitted evidence to show that there is genuine dispute of material fact as to whether benefits were due so this argument fails. Second, even if Plaintiff could show that benefits were due, Minnesota Life argues that she cannot show that withholding benefits under the Policy was unreasonable because Minnesota Life reviewed all the available medical evidence and asked for guidance from its in-house medical director, who analyzed the records and found no evidence linking an accidental injury to Mr. Vogt's death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

In opposition, Plaintiff submits that Minnesota Life completely ignored overwhelming evidence that Mr. Vogt hit his head and failed to investigate the possibility that his death was caused by a head injury prior to denying Mrs. Vogt's claim, breaching the covenant of good faith and fair dealing as a result.

And while Ms. Davis was aware of the existence of hospice records and wanted to obtain them before making a determination of coverage, such records were not obtained before the denial letter was sent.

While it might have been reasonable to conclude after investigation, that Mr. Vogt's head pain as a result of his fall did not cause his death, ignoring the medical records' indications of head pain and Mr. Vogt's rapid decline after the fall as shown in the hospice records that were not reviewed prior to denial, without further inquiry, is evidence of unreasonable conduct.

ECF No. 22 at 13;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 7 at 4. Minnesota Life in reply contends that the Scheduling Order's requirement of a meet and confer prior to filing a summary judgment motion somehow did not apply here because the motion was noticed before Judge O'Neill and not before Judge Thurston who issued the scheduling order. ECF No. 23 at 10. This contention is patently ridiculous and disingenuous; the Scheduling Order's requirements apply regardless of who the motion is noticed before. Minnesota Life failed to follow the Order of this Court by failing to meet and confer prior to filing its motion and the Court could strike the instant motion for failure to comply with the Court's Order. Nevertheless, the Court proceeds with the merits of the motion since both parties have fully briefed it. Since the Court is denying Defendant's motion, the Court does not feel it needs to separately deal with the violation of the meet and confer requirements but notes that these requirements are meant to save judicial and party resources and strict compliance is required. In addition, Plaintiff filed a sur-reply to address Defendant's misrepresentation in its attorney's reply brief declaration that stated \"...counsel for Plaintiff could not articulate any prejudice arising from the alleged non-compliance...\" with the Scheduling Order. ECF No. 25 at 3. Plaintiff's sur-reply presents email evidence which indicates that Defendant's counsel's representation in her declaration was false.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3-4. The Court does not take such misrepresentations lightly and Defendant's counsel is cautioned to ensure accuracy in its representations to the Court and advised that any future misrepresentations will be handled with appropriate sanctions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Along with its reply brief, Defendant filed an evidentiary objection to the declaration of Dr. Pietruszka, stating that it objects to the entire declaration because it is \"premature expert opinion for which Minnesota Life has had no opportunity to examine the witness.\" ECF No. 23-2. The \"premature\" nature of the declaration appears to be an issue of Minnesota Life's own creation since it filed its summary judgment motion prior to the close of expert discovery and\n    <em>\n     without meeting and conferring with Plaintiff prior to filing the motion as required\n    </em>\n    by the Court's Scheduling Order.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 7. Expert discovery did not close until February 11, 2019 and Minnesota Life filed its moving papers on January 3, 2019, Plaintiff filed its opposition on January 31, 2019, and Defendant replied on February 11, 2019. Minnesota Life did not request additional time to depose Dr. Pietruszka before filing its reply brief but instead simply objects to consideration of his declaration in its reply filings. The cases cited by Minnesota Life to support of its position are not on point. In\n    <em>\n     Carson Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal Corp.\n    </em>\n    , No. CV 96-3281 MMM (RCX),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022038700\">\n     2003 WL 22038700\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 8, 2003), the Court sustained Defendant's objection to the declaration of a new expert based on the law of the case doctrine and the fact that Plaintiff failed to disclose the expert witnesses in a timely fashion. Minnesota Life makes no contention that Plaintiff did not timely disclose Dr. Pietruszka as an expert. Similarly,\n    <em>\n     Sims v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    , No. C-05-02980 TEH EDL,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203826716\">\n     2006 WL 3826716\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 27, 2006), also involved a situation where Plaintiff did not disclose expert witnesses so Defendant was unable to take the deposition at an earlier date but the parties stipulated to continuing the summary judgment hearing and the Court allowed each party to take additional depositions. The Court rejects Defendant's objection in this regard. Defendant also objects to certain statements in Dr. Pietruszka's declaration, citing to Federal Rules of Evidence 702 and 703 without elaboration. Defendant raised its evidentiary objection to the expert opinion in reply, denying Plaintiff the opportunity to respond. Because Defendant has not explained its specific objections or set forth authority supporting these objections and the Plaintiff's proffer of Dr. Pietruszka as an expert is not obviously defective, the Court declines to resolve the admissibility of the expert opinion on the record before it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cortes-Irizarry v.

The earlier an individual receives hospice care, the more opportunity there is to stabilize one's medical condition and address the needs of the patient.
