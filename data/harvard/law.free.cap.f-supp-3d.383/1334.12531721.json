In the Motion, Plaintiff states it has no duty to defend or indemnify its insured, Ashland 2 Partners, LLC, in Demetra Asberry's underlying tort action because the assault and battery exclusion applies under these facts. The Court, having considered the Motion, Stipulation, complaint in the underlying action, policy at issue, and being fully advised in the premises will grant Plaintiff's Amended Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND AND STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, AIX Specialty Insurance Company (\"AIX\"), insured Defendant Ashland 2 Partners, LLC, (\"Ashland\") under a surplus commercial general liability policy numbered L1J-A582378-02 with effective dates March 13, 2017, through March 13, 2018, (the \"Policy\"). Doc. 46-1. Ashland operated a business called \"The Hall\" at 1330 U.S. Highway 301 N, Palmetto, Florida. Doc. 46 at \u00b6 3. The Policy provided coverage for occurrences at the address that corresponds to The Hall's location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46-1 at 6. AIX is providing Ashland a defense in Asberry's underlying tort action subject to a reservation of rights. Doc. 46 at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff seeks a declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Ashland against Asberry's lawsuit regarding an incident that occurred at The Hall Doc. 1. It requests a determination of no coverage under the Policy based on the \"Assault and Battery and Other Physical Altercation\" exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the underlying litigation, Case No. 2017-CA-3469 pending before the 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial Circuit in and for Manatee County, Florida, Asberry alleges the following. On June 10, 2017, she was an invitee of a nightclub called \"The Hall.\" Doc. 44-2 at \u00b6 7. Ashland's employee/agent/servant, \"John Doe,\" negligently handled her by grabbing her and knocking her to the floor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Asberry sustained personal injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Ashland is vicariously liable for John Doe's negligence and directly liable for its negligent supervision of its employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In her deposition, Asberry stated that while she was on the stage waiting for a music performer to arrive, \"TJ, the bouncer\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   walked around and asked everyone to step back. The crowd stepped back, but he returned and asked them to step back more. She showed him her VIP badge to indicate that she could be on the stage. He told her \"Fuck your badge,\" and \"out of nowhere\" grabbed her by wrapping both arms around her in a \"bear hug.\" They fell off the stage and he landed on top of her. Doc. 44-3 at 36:4-18, 43:5-44:2. The grab and fall resulted in scratches on her side in the rib area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:1-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Asberry contests the application of the \"Assault, Battery, or Other Altercation\" exclusion. She argues that the evidence does not establish that the person who grabbed her intended to cause a fall from the stage; only that he negligently mishandled her. Thus, she argues, the Court cannot find as a matter of law that the exclusion applies under these facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The court concluded that the alleged facts demonstrated both an assault, because an objective reasonable person would be in apprehension of harmful contact, and a battery, because it could conclude from the alleged facts that the perpetrator intended to throw the chair and inflict harmful contact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Ultimately, the deceased's death resulted from a bodily injury arising out of an assault or battery and fit squarely within the exclusion, despite the underlying suit's allegations of negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Burlington\n   </em>\n   , a security guard became involved in an altercation with two individuals on the premises at an apartment complex; the guard ultimately stabbed and punched them. The two individuals sued the landlord and alleged numerous theories sounding in negligence, including negligent hiring and negligent supervision. The landlord's insurer argued that it had no duty to defend under the \"assault, battery, or other physical altercation\" exclusion because the negligence claims arose from what was clearly an assault and battery.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=560%20Fed.%20Appx.%20844\">\n    560 Fed.

Under those allegations, the court held that the assault and battery exclusion clearly applied to bar coverage for these claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6894544\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/151/55/#p56\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Geovera Specialty Ins.

In\n   <em>\n    Sombreros\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff in the underlying suit alleged that she was injured when a gunshot went off and the patrons in The Hall trampled her. There, the court reasoned there were no allegations that the person wielding the gun intended to assault or make contact with anyone when the gun went off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Thus, the court could not hold as a matter of law that the underlying suit fell within the assault and battery exclusion because the facts were not distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Colony Ins.

AIX argues this reasoning does not apply here, because the bouncer clearly intended to make contact with Asberry, which she apparently concedes, when he \"bear hugged\" her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Policy Exclusion Applies and Bars Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, AIX argues this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Founders,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilshire\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Geovera\n   </em>\n   because the bouncer's act of grabbing Asberry without warning creates an inference of intent to make an offensive contact. This inference, it argues, is enough to constitute a battery and trigger the exclusion because Florida law requires no intent to harm, only an intent to make the unwanted contact. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Asberry appears to concede that the grabbing was intentional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47 at 2 (\"the 'bear hug' initiated by the employee of Ashland 2 Partners, LLC., may have been on purpose[.]\"). But she argues that the Court would have to make a factual inference, which is within the jury's province, that the bouncer intended to fall off of the stage with her. She argues that although the underlying complaint alleges that the bouncer negligently handled her and they fell, there is no evidence he intended to fall off the stage and cause her harm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20Fed.%20Appx.%20941\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Asberry also argues there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the bouncer's intention.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Asberry's arguments are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, AIX has met its burden to demonstrate that it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on AIX's duty to defend the underlying suit. Drawing all\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   inferences in Asberry's favor, the Court finds, as a matter of law, that the bouncer intended to make offensive contact with Asberry, thus constituting a battery under Florida law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.
