CBD is short for \"cannabidiol,\" and it is one of the \"unique molecules\" found in the\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant. ECF No. 61-8 at 18. The\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant is better known as the plant from which marijuana is derived. But it is also the\n   species of plant from which industrial hemp is derived. The Eighth Circuit provides a helpful description:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Both industrial hemp and the drug commonly known as marijuana derive from the plant designated\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   L. In general, drug-use cannabis is produced from the flowers and leaves of certain strains of the plant, while industrial-use cannabis is typically produced from the stalks and seeds of other strains of the plant. All cannabis plants contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the substance that gives marijuana its psychoactive properties, but strains of the plant grown for drug use contain a higher THC concentration than those typically grown for industrial use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Monson v. Drug Enforcement Admin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500219\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/952/#p955\">\n    589 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 955 (8th Cir. 2009) (emphasis added). In other words, the distinction is one of degree-while \"the marijuana plant and industrial hemp plant come from the same botanical species,\" the \"hemp plant has been crossbred to have low concentrations of THC.\" Shelly B. DeAdder,\n   <em>\n    The Legal Status of Cannabidiol Oil and the Need for Congressional Action\n   </em>\n   , 9 BIOPLR 68, 72 (2015).

Cindy Orser, Defendants' scientific expert, explains how these products are generally created. There is an initial \"extraction step,\" where hemp is combined with a solvent like ethanol, butane, pressurized CO2, or propane. ECF No. 61-8 at 79-80. This process yields a CBD extract, which is then distilled to remove plant compounds, solvents, THC, and other materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83. The intended end-product is a pure CBD concentrate that can then be infused into a consumable final product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Like other CBD oil products, Dixie X contains CBD that is \"isolate[d] and extract[ed]\" from hemp plants. ECF No. 60-8 at 1 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69-4 at 12-13. The resulting CBD is then \"infuse[d] ... into [a] line of hemp products.\" ECF No. 60-8 at 1. The label on Dixie X indicates that it contains \"[p]ure glycerin, hemp whole plant extract, CBD extract derived from medicinal hemp, [and] cinnamon extract.\" ECF No. 60-15 at 1 (asterisk omitted). Importantly, despite the extraction and distillation process, Dixie X contains a detectible, albeit small, amount of THC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 60-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   All three defendants played a role in the sale of Dixie X. MMI and Dixie LLC entered into a joint venture to produce, distribute, and sell Dixie X.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 69-2 at 1. They formed RDH for that purpose in April 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MMI would hold a 60% ownership stake in RDH, while Dixie LLC would hold a 40% stake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 68-2 at 106. Tripp Keber, who was also Dixie LLC's managing member, would act as the manager of RDH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In practice, it appears that MMI provided financial support\n   for the venture, Dixie LLC manufactured Dixie X, and RDH was responsible for selling the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. There is also a question of fact as to whether Keber acted as a director of MMI, though the exact dates of his tenure are unclear from the record.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 61-11 \u00b6 12,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 68-2 at 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In September 2012, Plaintiffs purchased a 500 mg bottle of Dixie X. They had researched the product from various sources, and they hoped it would relieve the pain and inflammation Douglas was then suffering from as a result of a motor vehicle accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs claimed to have relied on four sources in deciding to purchase Dixie X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs first learned about Dixie X in an issue of \"High Times\" magazine-a periodical dedicated to marijuana culture and news. In an article titled \"High &amp; Healthy\" by Elise McDonough, there was the following writeup:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   CBD for Everyone!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Using a proprietary extraction process and a strain of high-CBD hemp grown in a secret, foreign location, Colorado's Dixie Elixirs and Edibles now offers a new product line called Dixie X, which contains 0% THC and up to 500 mg of CBD. This new CBD-rich medicine will be available in several forms, including a tincture, a topical and in capsules. Promoted as \"a revolution in medical hemp-powered wellness,\" the non-psychoactive products will first roll out in Colorado MMCs (medical marijuana centers), with plans to quickly expand outside the medical marijuana market. \"It has taken a tremendous amount of time, money and effort, but finally patients here in Colorado-and ultimately all individuals who are interested in utilizing CBD for medicinal benefit-will be able to have access to it,\" says Tripp Keber, Dixie's managing director. \"We are importing industrial hemp from outside the US using an FDA import license-it's below federal guidelines for THC, which is 0.3%-and we are taking that hemp and extracting the CBD. We have meticulously reviewed state and federal statutes, and we do not believe that we're operating in conflict with any federal law as it's related to the Dixie X [hemp-derived] products.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ECF No. 61-7 at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After reviewing the article, Plaintiffs decided to conduct further research. They watched two YouTube videos of interviews between podcasters and a person who identifies himself as Tripp Keber (the \"YouTube interviews\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In these videos, Keber stated that Dixie X did not contain THC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs also reviewed an FAQ on the Dixie X website, which provided further information on the product:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Is CBD from hemp legal?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Our revolutionary Hemp oil cannabidiol (CBD) wellness products are legal to consume both here in the U.S. and in many countries abroad. The United\n   States currently considers industrial hemp products to be legal as long as they are derived from industrial hemp and not from any part of the plants categorized ... as marijuana. Dixie x's parent company Medical Marijuana, Inc., is a publicly traded company ... that does not grow, sell or distribute any substances that violate United States Law or the controlled substance act.....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    What is the difference between CBD from hemp and CBD from medical cannabis?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   While the two plants are botanically related, our hemp contains no THC.... Medical cannabis contains THC and may provide relief from various ailments, however, with a psychotropic effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ECF No. 60-8 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Cindy called a \"1-800\" number associated with Dixie X and spoke to a customer service representative. ECF No. 61-6 at 88-89. The representative confirmed that Dixie X contained \"zero percent THC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After reviewing all of this information, Plaintiffs decided to purchase Dixie X. On September 17, 2012, Cindy ordered a 500mg tincture of Dixie X through the Dixie X website and had it delivered to Plaintiffs' home in Lockwood, NY. Shortly thereafter, Douglas consumed the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In October 2012, as part of its normal practice, Douglas's employer, Enterprise Trucking, required that he submit to a random drug test. A few days after the drug test, Enterprise notified Douglas that he had tested positive for THC. At 29 ng/mL, Douglas's sample contained almost double the \"cutoff\" concentration of THC. Enterprise thereafter terminated Douglas's employment. Cindy, who worked with Douglas at Enterprise Trucking, resigned from the company because she believed it would be unsafe to work alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Soon thereafter, Plaintiffs purchased a second bottle of Dixie X to determine whether it had caused the positive test result. They sent the bottle to EMSL Analytical, Inc., for testing. Testing confirmed that Dixie X contained THC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In August 2015, Plaintiffs brought this action, alleging that Dixie X caused Douglas's positive drug test and thereby caused him to lose his employment. Plaintiffs raise nine claims against Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   1. Deceptive business practices and false advertising under New York General Business Law \u00a7\u00a7 349, 350 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   2. Fraudulent inducement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   3.

Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before turning to the motions, the Court discusses a legal issue that is foundational to this litigation: whether, in 2012, Dixie X constituted a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs argue that Dixie X is a controlled substance because it contains THC. Defendants counter that Dixie X is not a controlled substance because it is derived from lawfully imported hemp and contains less than .3% THC. This percentage is allegedly the maximum amount of THC that an imported industrial hemp plant can lawfully contain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court agrees that, in\n   2012, Dixie X constituted a controlled substance under the CSA. But it reaches this conclusion for reasons different than those articulated by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Marijuana is a controlled substance under the CSA, and therefore, as a general matter, it is unlawful to distribute or dispense it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16), 841(a)(1). In 2012, the CSA defined marijuana as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The term \"marihuana\" means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. Such term does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16) (2012). Breaking this definition down, the Court notes that marijuana was broadly defined to include \"all parts\" of the\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant. The industrial hemp plant fell within this definition because it is a variety of the\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Monson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500219\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/952/#p955\">\n    589 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   961-62 ;\n   <em>\n    Hemp Indus.

In 2014, Congress passed the Agricultural Act of 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7 U.S.C. 5940. This legislation legalized industrial hemp cultivation under restricted conditions relating to research. Then, in 2018, as part of a more extensive legalization of industrial hemp production, the CSA was amended to exclude hemp from the definition of marijuana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16)(B)(i). Hemp is defined as the \"Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a [THC] concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   (1). Thus, it appears that the CSA now excludes from the definition of marijuana\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   part, derivative, or extract of the\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant if its THC concentration falls below that threshold level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For purposes of this litigation, however, the question is whether Dixie X constituted a controlled substance in 2012. Based on the plain language of the statute, and taking the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court answers that question in the affirmative. Dixie X is a mixture that contains extract from the\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant. Defendants do not contend that the CBD byproduct from the extraction process can be described as anything other than a \"resin extracted from\" the\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant. 21 U.S.C. 802(16) (2012) (defining marijuana to include \"the resin extracted from any part\" of the\n   <em>\n    Cannabis sativa\n   </em>\n   plant, as well as \"every compound\" or \"mixture\" of the resin). And Dixie X cannot come within any exception because resin extracts are explicitly excluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.; Hemp II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9064013\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/357/1012/#p1018\">\n    357 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1018 n.5. In 2012, the CSA granted no exceptions to hemp derivatives on the basis of low THC concentration.

Furthermore, they did not file their motion until more than two months after the parties filed motions for summary judgment. Plaintiffs do not argue that they acted diligently or that they have otherwise satisfied the \"good cause\" standard; they merely claim that the new Lanham Act claim satisfies the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   pleading standard.

In the Court's view, the only relevant link is that Defendants shipped Dixie X into the state. But at that point, Plaintiffs had already been deceived by, and purchased the product from, the out-of-state Defendants. Application of Sections 349 and 350 would thus be based more on Plaintiffs' residency than on the location of the transaction itself.

This is because Plaintiffs have provided insufficient evidence to establish that, at the time those statements were made, Defendants knew they were false and intended to defraud consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel. O'Donnell v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282534\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/650/#p658\">\n    822 F.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"[A] representation is fraudulent only if made with the contemporaneous intent to defraud-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the statement was knowingly or recklessly false and made with the intent to induce harmful reliance.\"). The difficulty is that Plaintiffs offer little in the way of evidence that illuminates the intent, state of mind, or beliefs of Defendants or their agents when the statements were made. For example, Plaintiffs point to no deposition testimony, company emails or documents, or other evidence that suggests that when the website FAQs were posted, Defendants knew their product was an unlawful controlled substance, was unsafe, and did not provide the purported wellness benefits. Given the absence of evidence related to the beliefs and knowledge of Defendants, their employees, and their agents, Plaintiffs' fraud claim fails as a matter of law as to the above statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The only actionable statement is Defendants' misrepresentation that Dixie X did not contain THC. First, there is evidence that this statement is false-indeed, Defendants' own testing revealed that the product contained detectible amounts of THC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Second, there is evidence that Douglas reasonably relied on the misrepresentation. Plaintiffs carefully researched the product to ensure that it did not contain THC. It is reasonable to conclude that the explicit representations in the FAQs and in the YouTube videos regarding the absence\n   of THC would allay consumers' concerns about ingesting a product associated with marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Third, there is evidence that Douglas lost his job because he consumed Dixie X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Fourth, there is evidence that Defendants made the false statements with the requisite knowledge and intent. In August 2012, Tripp Keber stated in the YouTube videos that Dixie X did not contain THC. But there is evidence that Defendants had been testing Dixie X \"during its development and manufacturing\" and had found the presence of THC. ECF No. 61-1 \u00b6 6 (stating that testing \"showed levels of THC well within legal limits\"); ECF No. 61-13. Given Keber's high position within all three defendant companies, a jury could reasonably infer that he knew the results of such testing. And in light of his varying roles, a jury could attribute Keber's August 2012 statements to all three defendants. Similarly, because RDH represented on its website FAQs and through its customer service that Dixie X did not contain THC, despite having test results showing the presence of THC in its products, a jury could find that RDH knew that such representations were false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, all three defendants had a motive to defraud consumers. A jury could reasonably conclude that, to sell their products, Defendants needed to distinguish Dixie X from its unlawful counterparts; misrepresenting the THC content in the product would go a long way to dispelling consumers' concerns, as it did in Plaintiffs' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs' fraudulent inducement claim is viable, at least in part. The Court also notes three other considerations that further limit Plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   First, Plaintiffs may not proceed with their claim based on the alleged misrepresentations contained in the \"High Times\" article. As Defendants point out, the article is not an advertisement but a writeup about Dixie X by a third party. The only arguable connection between the article's contents and Defendants is that the article quotes Tripp Keber. However, the article would be inadmissible to the extent that Plaintiffs intend to rely on it to prove that Tripp Keber actually made those statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larez v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10523442,10523494\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/946/630/\">\n    946 F.2d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (9th Cir. 1991) (quotations of party opponent which are recited in newspaper article present hearsay problems insofar as they are \"offered for the truth of the matter asserted: that [the party opponent] did in fact make the quoted statement\"). Plaintiffs offer nothing but speculation to argue that Defendants had a role in publishing the article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Second, Cindy's lost wages are not recoverable. A fraudulent inducement claim requires \"a showing of proximate causation,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the injury \"is the natural and probable consequence of the defrauder's misrepresentation or ... the defrauder ought reasonably to have foreseen that the injury was a probable consequence of his fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am.

Supp. 2d 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). Cindy's lost wages were not the direct result of Defendants' alleged fraud; rather, they were derivative of Douglas's injury and too attenuated from Defendants' wrongful conduct to be actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kregos v.

Further, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs did not produce the YouTube videos during discovery. Although these are colorable issues, both sides have failed to sufficiently develop them. The Court would benefit from further briefing on whether the printouts of the website FAQs can be authenticated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Aug. 8, 2017) (same). Likewise, while Defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to disclose the YouTube videos in discovery, they do not cite any specific discovery request that Plaintiffs did not adequately answer or supplement. Consequently, the Court concludes that these issues are better raised in the context of pretrial motions than on summary judgment. To the extent Defendants prevail on their arguments, the Court may revisit whether the fraudulent inducement claim may proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs' fraudulent inducement claim is viable as to Douglas's claim for damages resulting from Defendants' misrepresentation that Dixie X did not contain THC.
