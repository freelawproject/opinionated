INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court are the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, including: (1) Plaintiff Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company's (\"Massachusetts Bay\") motion for summary judgment (Plf. MSJ (Dkt. # 33)), and (2) Defendants John Ural, Mike Czerwinski, Jim Hewitt (collectively, \"Individual Defendants\"), and Walflor Industries, Inc.'s (\"Walflor\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") motion for summary judgment (Def. MSJ (Dkt. # 31)). Massachusetts Bay seeks (1) a declaration that it has no duty to defend Defendants in the lawsuit presently pending in King County Superior Court, entitled\n   <em>\n    Stuc-O-Flex International, Inc. v. Low and Bonar, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-2-30700-9 (\"the Underlying Lawsuit\"), and (2) a ruling that it is entitled to reimbursement of the monies it has already paid to defend Defendants in the Underlying Lawsuit. (Plf. MSJ at 1.) Defendants, on the other hand, seek a declaration that Massachusetts Bay owes them a duty to defend in the Underlying Lawsuit. (Def. MSJ at 1.) If, however, Massachusetts Bay does not owe them a duty to defend, Defendants seek an order that Massachusetts Bay is not entitled to reimbursement of the defense costs it has already incurred in the Underlying Lawsuit, or in the alternative, an order certifying that issue to the Washington Supreme Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court has considered the motions, the parties' submissions in\n   support of and opposition to the motions, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. Being fully advised,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court GRANTS Massachusetts Bay's motion and DENIES Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Underlying Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2013, Stuc-O-Flex and Waterway Rainscreen entered into a Distributorship Agreement, under which Waterway Rainscreen agreed to produce certain products for Stuc-O-Flex's exclusive distribution in the United States and Canada. (Colville Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 1 (\"Underlying Lawsuit Compl.\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. B (\"Distributorship Agreement\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In early 2016, Individual Defendants created Walflor, which acquired all of Waterway Rainscreen's assets and began supplying certain products to Stuc-O-Flex for distribution. (Underlying Lawsuit Compl. \u00b6 23.) According to the Underlying Lawsuit complaint, \"in 2016 and 2017, Stuc-O-Flex ... uncovered evidence that Walflor and [Waterway Rainscreen] sold ... Stuc-O-Flex [t]rade-[n]ame-marked [p]roducts to multiple parties in the United\n   States and Canada for years in violation of the [Distributorship Agreement] and without Stuc-O-Flex's consent, resulting in millions of dollars of lost profit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a result, Stuc-O-Flex sued Defendants, Waterway Rainscreen, and Low and Bonar, Inc. (the current owner of Walflor), alleging breach of the Distributorship Agreement, tortious interference with a business expectancy, trade name infringement, and a violation of Washington's Consumer Protection Act (\"CPA\"), RCW \u00a7 19.86.020\n   <em>\n    , et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Underlying Lawsuit Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-59.) In its claim for tortious interference with a business expectancy, Stuc-O-Flex asserts \"[s]pecifically\" that \"Defendants engaged in the [alleged] ... wrongful conduct by conspiring to wrongfully sell and acquire [Waterway Rainscreen and Walflor] so as to side-step the obligations of the [Distributorship Agreement] and/or without complying with the same in the transitions....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) In its claim for violation of the CPA, Stuc-O-Flex alleges that Defendants' \"unfair business practices include ... the conduct that constitutes a breach of the [Distributorship Agreement]....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Stuc-O-Flex later amended the complaint to replace its cause of action for trade name infringement with a cause of action for trademark violation and to add a cause of action for alter ego or piercing the corporate veil. (Colville Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. 2 (\"Underlying Lawsuit Am. Compl.\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its amended complaint, Stuc-O-Flex alleges in its tortious interference claim that \"Defendants intentionally interfered with ... Stuc-O-Flex's binding [Distributorship Agreement] ... and sought to deny ... Stuc-O-Flex the benefit of its bargain under the [Distributorship Agreement].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.5.) Stuc-Flex also alleges that it \"has been and will continue to be damaged as a result of Defendants' tortious interference with rights and privileges afforded to ... Stuc-O-Flex pursuant to the [Distributorship Agreement], in an amount to be proven at trial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Insurance Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On January 16, 2018, Individual Defendants tendered the Underlying Lawsuit's original complaint to Massachusetts Bay under Walflor's insurance policy. (Colville Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. 3.) Massachusetts Bay initially concluded that the allegations in the complaint did not fall within the policy's coverage for damages for \"bodily injury,\" \"property damage,\" or \"personal or advertising injury,\" and accordingly, denied the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6, Ex. 4.) On April 5, 2018, Individual Defendants responded by asserting that Massachusetts Bay's duty to defend was triggered under the policy's coverage for \"personal and advertising injury.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, Ex. 5.) Following this communication, on April 13, 2018, Massachusetts Bay agreed to defend Defendants under a full reservation of rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8, Ex. 6.) In this reservation of rights letter, Massachusetts Bay specifically informed Defendants that it reserved the right \"to seek reimbursement of any defense costs paid if it is later determined that none of the claims or damages sought are covered under the policies,\" and Massachusetts Bay quoted from the policies' \"\n   <strong>\n    WASHINGTON CHANGES - DEFENSE COSTS\n   </strong>\n   \" endorsement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On October 18, 2018, after Stuc-O-Flex filed an amended complaint in the Underlying Lawsuit, Massachusetts Bay again concluded that the insurance policies did not provide coverage for the losses alleged. (Colville Decl. \u00b6 9, Ex. 7.) Nevertheless, Massachusetts Bay agreed to continue to defend Defendants under a complete reservation of rights and to seek reimbursement\n   of any defense costs it paid if a court later determined that the policies did not cover the alleged losses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Present Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On May 20, 2018, Massachusetts Bay filed the present action for (1) declaratory relief that it has no obligations to Defendants under the policy at issue (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4.1-4.3), and (2) reimbursement of the defense costs it paid in the Underlying Lawsuit (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5.1-5.4). On November 21, 2018, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ; Plf. MSJ.) The court now considers these motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendants argue that the allegations in the Underlying Lawsuit's complaint and amended complaint can be read to allege three separate \"personal and advertising injury\" offenses as those offenses are defined in the policies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 5-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Resp. at 5-12.) Those \"offenses\" include: (1) product disparagement, as defined in Subpart d, (2) the use of another's advertising idea, as defined in Subpart f, and (3) infringing upon another's trade dress or slogan, as defined in Subpart g.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 II.A. Massachusetts Bay argues that\n   these same three policy provisions or \"offenses\" do not require it to provide a defense with respect to the Underlying Lawsuit. (Plf. MSJ at 7-17; Plf. Resp. (Dkt. # 39-1) at 3-14.) The court now considers each such policy provision in turn and whether the complaints in the Underlying Lawsuit can be read to allege \"personal and advertising injury\" offenses as those offenses are defined in the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Product Disparagement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Subpart d of the definition of \"personal and advertising injury\" describes the following offense: \"Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services.\" (11/21/18 Alvord Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 2 at 81-82.) The offense requires both disparagement of a claimant's products and \"publication\" of the disparaging \"material.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants argue that Subpart d requires Massachusetts Bay to provide a defense because the complaints in the Underlying Lawsuit, liberally construed, allege that Walflor publishes in advertisements that it sells \"Waterway Rainscreen\" but instead delivers a lower-quality \"generic black drain mat,\" which harms the reputation of Stuc-O-Flex's products and damages Stuc-O-Flex. (Def. Resp. at 5-6.) Specifically, Defendants assert that the \"Waterway Rainscreen\" invoices that they allegedly send to their customers qualify as a \"publication\" under Subpart d; and when Defendants allegedly deliver a \"generic black drain mat\" instead, they \"disparage\" Stuc-O-Flex's product. (Def. MSJ at 7-8.) Defendants argue that \"Stuc-O-Flex is essentially suing [D]efendants for communicating something like this to customers: 'This low-quality generic black drain mat that we delivered to you is Waterway Rainscreen.' \" (Def. Reply (Dkt. # 41) at 1.) Defendants point to Stuc-O-Flex's allegations in its original complaint that Defendants \"manufactur[ed] lower-quality marked [p]roducts, with poor material, without Stuc-O-Flex's inspection or consent\" and \"this conduct negatively affect[ed] ultimate end-users of the [p]roducts as the [p]roducts are less effective to prevent water accumulation, along with other uses.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Lawsuit Compl. \u00b6 57.) Defendants argue that these allegations in combination with allegations from Stuc-O-Flex's amended complaint indicating that customers who Defendants invoiced for \"Waterway Rainscreen\" actually received generic products instead (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Underlying Lawsuit Am. Compl. \u00b6 6.10), impliedly state a claim for product disparagement within the meaning of Subpart d (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Resp. at 2 (\"The original [c]omplaint informs the [a]mended [c]omplaint's allegations regarding 'generic black drain mat' by alleging that [D]efendants used lower quality materials and that this negatively impacted Stuc-O-Flex's reputation.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Massachusetts Bay contends that Defendants' construction of Stuc-O-Flex's allegations, even liberally construed, stretches the complaints in the Underlying Lawsuit too far. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. at 3-5.) A claim for product disparagement must allege: (1) a false statement; (2) that impugns the quality or integrity of the plaintiff's goods or services; and (3) special damages in the form of lost profits from the loss of specific sales to a specifically identified purchaser that would have occurred but for that purchaser hearing the false statement and declining to engage in that purchase.\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp. v.

As Massachusetts Bay points out, \"[t]his is virtually the opposite of what Stuc-O-Flex is claiming\" in the Underlying Lawsuit. (Plf. Resp. at 4.) Indeed, Stuc-O-Flex asserts that too many people are\n   buying Stuc-O-Flex products from Defendants in violation of the parties' Distributorship Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Underlying Lawsuit Am.

Given the foregoing rules of construction and the common meanings of the terms \"broadcast\" and \"publish,\" the court is unwilling to construe an invoice sent to a single customer as \"a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments\" as required by the policies. (11/21/18 Alvord Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 2 at 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Moreover, for an invoice to be an \"advertisement,\" it must be sent \"for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines an \"invoice\" as \"an itemized list of goods usu[ally] specifying the price and the terms of sale: Bill.\" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 659 (11th ed. 2004). Thus, an invoice, by definition, is sent to a customer to secure payment for goods supplied; it is not sent \"for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters\" as required under the policies to constitute an \"advertisement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/21/18 Alvord Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 2 at 80.)

Massachusetts Bay argues that the complaints do not allege either trade dress or slogan infringement, and therefore, there is no coverage under Subpart g. (Plf. MSJ at 13-17; Plf. Resp. at 10-14.) The court need not decide if the complaints in the Underlying Lawsuit allege either trade dress or slogan infringement because, as discussed above, neither complaint makes any reference to any of this activity occurring in one of Walflor's advertisements.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.C.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As discussed above, the advertisement upon which Defendants rely, on its face, is Trade Trowel's and not Walflor's advertisement, and Defendants submit no extrinsic evidence tying the advertisement to Walflor.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also supra\n   </em>\n   n.12.

As discussed below, the court finds sufficient guidance in prior decisions of the Washington Supreme Court to resolve this issue. Accordingly, the court DENIES Defendants' request to certify the question to the Washington Supreme Court. The court now turns to the issue presented by the parties: the enforceability of Massachusetts Bay's defense costs reimbursement endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In urging the court to deny Massachusetts Bay's motion for summary judgment that it is entitled to recoup its defense costs expended in the Underlying Lawsuit, Defendants do not take issue with the intended effect of the endorsement or assert that the endorsement is ambiguous; nor do they dispute that Massachusetts Bay notified them in its reservation of rights letters of its intent to rely on the endorsement to recoup its defense costs. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 13-20; Def. Resp. at 20-23; Def. Reply at 11-12.) Instead, Defendants' argument rests entirely on the notion that the endorsement violates public policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 13-21; Def. Resp. at 20-23; Reply at 11-12.) Thus, the court confines its analysis to that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Washington \"[c]ourts are reluctant to invalidate an insurance policy clause on the grounds of public policy, but will do so if the clause is prohibited by statute, condemned by judicial decision or contrary to public morals.\"\n   <em>\n    Safeco Ins.

(Def. MSJ at 21.) The insurer in\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   attempted to reserve its right to recoup its defense costs in the event a court determined that it did not owe a duty to defend, but the policy at issue did not contain any language allowing such recoupment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20P.3d%20688\">\n    297 P.3d at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Washington Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   informs the court's decision, the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   holding does not control the outcome here. Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   Court narrowly defined the issue before it as \"whether [an] insurer may\n   <em>\n    unilaterally\n   </em>\n   condition its reservation of rights defense on making the insured absorb the defense costs if a court ultimately determines there is no coverage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20P.3d%20688\">\n    297 P.3d at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Unlike the policy in\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   , the Massachusetts Bay policies include an express endorsement stating that Massachusetts Bay is entitled \"to seek reimbursement for defense costs\" if it initially defends an insured or pays for an insured's defense but it is later determined that none of the claims are covered. (Colville Decl. \u00b6 10, Ex. 8 at 137;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, Ex. 9 at 157.) Defendants nevertheless argue that the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   court's ruling applies to situations, like here, where the policy contains\n   explicit language reserving the right to recover defense costs if a court ultimately determines that no such duty exists. Defendants ground their argument on the court's following statement: \"We hold that insurers may not seek to recoup defense costs incurred under a reservation of rights defense while the insurer's duty to defend is uncertain.\"\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20P.3d%20688\">\n    297 P.3d at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants maintain that the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   court did not expressly limit its holding to those situations in which the policy does not contain a defense costs recoupment provision, and so this court should apply that holding here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 21; Def. Reply at 11.) Although the quote Defendants cite is expansive, it must be read in the context of the specific issue the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   court stated it was deciding-\"whether [an] insurer may\n   <em>\n    unilaterally\n   </em>\n   condition its reservation of rights defense on making the insured absorb the defense costs if a court ultimately determines there is no coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=297%20P.3d%20688\">\n    297 P.3d at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). So read, the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   court's holding is considerably narrower than Defendants insist and does not control the outcome here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   court's intent to so cabin its holding is reinforced by the court's repeated reliance upon cases that carve out an exception where the insurance contract expressly provides for defense cost reimbursement. For example, the\n   <em>\n    Immunex\n   </em>\n   court relies upon and quotes from\n   <em>\n    Shoshone First Bank v.

In that case, the Alaska Supreme Court held that the state's independent counsel statute, AS 21.96.100, precludes the enforcement of language in a professional liability policy granting the insurer the right to recoup defense costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingaldson Fitzgerald, PC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6805141\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/1101/#p1112\">\n    370 P.3d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the court finds no basis for invalidating the endorsement on public policy grounds and concludes that Massachusetts Bay is entitled to recoup the defense costs it paid in the Underlying Lawsuit.
