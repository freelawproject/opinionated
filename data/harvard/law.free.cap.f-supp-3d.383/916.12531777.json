BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Swafford is a resident of Santa Clara County, California and a software sales representative at IBM since 2009. Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 12. IBM is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in the state of New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Swafford's compensation as an IBM sales representative consisted of a salary plus commissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. This case concerns Swafford's commission payments (also referred to as \"incentive payments\") and IBM's commission plan and policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Facts and Allegations Related to IBM's Commission Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Swafford had a written commission plan known as the Incentive Plan Letter (\"IPL\") for the second half of 2016 that covered the sales period from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mot., Ex. 1 (\"IPL\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The IPL provided that Swafford's sales quota for the second half of 2016 was $ 512,600. IPL at 2. The IPL also provided information about Swafford's commissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, the IPL provided that, without an IPL in place, an employee is \"not eligible\n   to receive any related incentive payments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The IPL defined the \"Plan\" as the incentive plan information contained in the IPL and at IBM's Worldwide Incentives Workplace website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, the IPL provided that IBM had the right to make changes to incentive payment rates or quotas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The IPL stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Right to Modify or Cancel:\n   </strong>\n   The Plan does not constitute an express or implied contract or a promise by IBM to make any distributions under it. IBM reserves the right to adjust the Plan terms, including, but not limited to, changes to sales performance objectives (including management-assessment objectives), changes to assigned customers, territories, or account opportunities, or changes to applicable incentive payment rates or quotas, target incentives or similar earnings opportunities, or to modify or cancel the Plan, for any individual or group of individuals, at any time during the Plan period up until any related payments have been earned under the Plan terms. Managers below the highest levels of management do not know whether IBM will or will not change or adopt any particular compensation plan; they do not have the ability to change the Plan terms for any employee; nor are they in a position to advise any employee on, or speculate about, future plans. Employees should make no assumptions about the impact potential Plan changes may have on their personal situations unless and until any such changes are formally announced by IBM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, the IPL provided that IBM could change incentive payment calculations resulting from errors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The IPL stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Adjustments for Errors:\n   </strong>\n   IBM reserves the right to review and, in its sole discretion, adjust or require repayment of incorrect incentive payments resulting from incomplete incentives processes or other errors in the measurement of achievement or the calculation of payments, including errors in the creation or communication of sales objectives. Depending on when an error is identified, corrections may be made before or after the last day of the full-Plan period, and before or after the affected payment has been released.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The IPL also provided that IBM may review significant transactions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Significant Transactions:\n   </strong>\n   IBM reserves the right to review and, in its sole discretion, adjust incentive achievement and/or related payments associated with a transaction which (1) is disproportionate when compared with the territory opportunity anticipated during account planning and used for the setting of any sales objectives; or for which (2) the incentive payments are disproportionate when compared with your performance contribution towards the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, the IPL also explained how incentive payments are earned under the Plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Full-Plan Earnings:\n   </strong>\n   Regardless of your start date, your incentive payments are earned under the Plan terms, and are no longer considered Plan-to-Date advance payments, only after the measurement of complete business results following the end of the full-Plan period or (if applicable) after the measurement of complete business results after the date you left the Incentive Plan early. Incentive payments will be considered earned only if you have met all payment requirements, including: (1) you have complied with the Incentive Plan, the Business Conduct Guidelines and all other applicable IBM employment policies\n   and practices; (2) you have not engaged in any fraud, misrepresentation or other inappropriate conduct relating to any of your business transactions or incentives; (3) and the customer has paid the billing for the sales or services transaction related to your incentive achievement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite the IPL, during Swafford's time at IBM, IBM repeatedly made representations that Swafford's commissions would be uncapped. Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. For instance, Swafford regularly received from IBM PowerPoint presentations with over 200 slides, which IBM called \"Educational Materials,\" that described the terms of the commission plans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Each year, the Educational Materials stated repeatedly that \"commissions are uncapped.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Nowhere in the Educational Materials is there anything even suggesting that the sales commissions may be capped in some instances or that IBM reserves the right to cancel or modify whether and to what extent commissions may be capped.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During the second half of 2016, Swafford received and reviewed a PowerPoint titled \"Our Purpose, Values &amp; Practices\" relating to \"Your 2016 Incentive Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-20. Page 13 of the PowerPoint specifically stated that \"[e]arnings opportunity remains uncapped,\" and that the presentation mentions no less than six times in its 18 pages that \"payments\" and/or \"earnings opportunit[ies]\" are \"uncapped.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. These representations were repeated in sales meetings and by IBM managers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. These representations are \"also in line with IBM's written guidance to its managers,\" which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Conditions that may lead to an adjustment include the need to correct errors or the need to balance with employee's contribution to the success of a large sales transaction (which criteria must be clearly provided to Commissions team). Adjustments must not be done only as a ceiling or cap on the total earnings allowable to employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The amended complaint alleges that \"[i]n other words, IBM's official policies provide that sales representatives' commissions may be adjusted to correct errors, but their commissions may not be arbitrarily capped for the purpose of limiting an employee's earnings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Swafford's Allegations That His Commission Payments Were Capped\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2016, Swafford worked on behalf of IBM to close two large deals of IBM products and services with Oracle (\"Oracle Deal\") and Sabre, Inc. (\"Sabre Deal\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Swafford's efforts in closing the Oracle and Sabre Deals resulted in a total sale of approximately $ 3 million in IBM products and services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Swafford's revenue credit on all the deals he closed in the second half of 2016, including the Oracle and Sabre Deals, was approximately $ 4,983,275, and Swafford's quota was $ 512,600.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On those recognized amounts, Swafford earned commissions of $ 966,316, that should have been paid to him in January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Swafford was not paid any commission in January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Swafford's first line manager, Mark Briggs (\"Briggs\"), informed Swafford that because of the size of the deals, Swafford's commissions were going through an internal review process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. On February 23, 2017, Briggs emailed Swafford to tell Swafford that Briggs had just been \"informed by IBM that [Swafford's] attainment has been capped at 250% of plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A. Briggs told Swafford in a phone call after that email that \"IBM decided it was simply too much money to pay Mr. Swafford the full commissions he had earned, and thus, IBM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   would be paying him only a portion of those commissions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IBM ultimately paid Swafford $ 716,522 in commissions for the second half of 2016, which was $ 249,765 less than what Swafford should have been paid in commissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The only reason Swafford was \"ever provided by IBM for why he was not paid all of the commissions he had earned, was that IBM thought it was simply too much money to pay Mr. Swafford, and thus, [IBM], was unwilling to pay him in full.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. After Swafford's further attempts to learn why he had not been paid in full, Swafford's second line manager, Richard Wirtenson (\"Wirtenson\") emailed him on May 1, 2017 and said: \"I made the recommendation to Don [Leeke] [ (Swafford's third line manager) ] that we pay on all other deals 100% but CAP the Oracle and Sabre transactions at 150% of your quota on each.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Swafford's Allegations Regarding IBM's History of Capping Commissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The amended complaint quotes from a case in the Middle District of North Carolina,\n   <em>\n    Bobby Choplin v. International Business Machines Corporation\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-cv-1412-TDS-JEP (the \"Choplin Action\"), where the plaintiff, who had an IPL, alleged that IBM had represented in PowerPoint presentations that it would not cap commissions, yet capped Choplin's commissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amend. Compl. \u00b6 41.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the Choplin Action ultimately settled, Choplin had taken four depositions: (1) a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of IBM, through corporate designee Richard Martinotti,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C; (2) a deposition of Choplin's first-line manager, Thomas Batthany,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

E; and (4) a deposition of Mark Dorsey, a former IBM Vice President of Software Sales,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. F (collectively, the \"Choplin Depositions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that these Choplin Depositions demonstrate that IBM had an obligation not to cap, that Swafford was entitled to rely on the statements in the PowerPoints, and that what IBM did when it reduced Swafford's commission was in fact \"capping.\" \u00b6 43. During the Choplin Depositions, for instance, IBM testified through corporate designee Richard Martinotti that it had an \"obligation\" not to cap Choplin's earnings opportunity or payments: \"Q. Okay. So you would agree that IBM when explaining [Choplin's] compensation plan for the first half of 2015 represented to Bobby Choplin that his earnings opportunity remains uncapped, wouldn't you?\" \"A. Correct.\" \"Q. Would you also agree that IBM represented to Bobby Choplin regarding his first half of 2015 compensation plan that payments were uncapped?\" \"A. Correct.\" \"Q. So would you agree that IBM had an obligation not to cap Bobby Choplin's earnings opportunity?\" \"A. Yes.\" \"Q. Would you agree that IBM had an obligation not to cap Bobby Choplin's payments?\" \"A. Correct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C at 18:19-19:12. Additionally, IBM testified through corporate designee Richard Martinotti that it would be reasonable for a salesperson to rely on the statements in various PowerPoints regarding the compensation plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 66:5-68:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court agrees with IBM that Swafford's\n   failure to identify the \"who\" and \"when\" for this allegation \"as it relates to any alleged oral representations by managers\" falls short of the pleading standard required by Rule 9(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652195\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/1120/#p1126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the Court also agrees with Swafford that \"IBM implicitly concedes in its brief that the PowerPoint representation is sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, the Court DENIES IBM's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim for lack of sufficient particularity to the extent Plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim is based on the PowerPoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, to the extent Plaintiff's fraudulent misrepresentation claim is based on oral statements by IBM executives and managers at sales meetings, the Court finds that the allegation is not pled with sufficient particularity, and therefore the Court GRANTS IBM's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Beard v.

Mot. at 11-12. The Court finds that IBM's argument fails. IBM's argument focuses primarily on whether reliance was reasonable, not whether IBM intended to deceive, and the IPL disclaimers do not reveal IBM's motivation for informing sales representatives in the PowerPoint presentation and managers' statements that commissions were uncapped. As Swafford points out, circumstantial evidence may be used to prove a party's intent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Eashai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"592,6477515\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1082/\">\n    87 F.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1090 (9th Cir. 1996).

Reasonable Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   IBM also argues that Swafford cannot allege reasonable reliance because Swafford's IPL unambiguously states that IBM reserved the discretion to review and adjust commission payments. Mot. at 13. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, the Court finds inconsistent IBM's insistence that Swafford is bound by the representations in the IPL. IBM repeatedly states that the IPL is not a contract and that the IPL does not create any obligations for IBM.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. at 16 (\"[T]he IPL does not create an enforceable contract.\"); Reply at 9 (\"[T]he IPL does not create an enforceable contract that imposes contractual obligations on IBM\"); Mot. at 11 (stating that IBM expressly informed Swafford that \"his incentive plan did not create a contractual obligation or promise by IBM to pay commissions\"). Yet, IBM nonetheless insists that Swafford was required to rely only on IBM's representations in the IPL and nothing else. Moreover, although the IPL stated that IBM did not promise to make any commission payments under the Plan and that IBM had the right to modify or cancel the Plan, Swafford has nonetheless alleged that IBM made representations in a PowerPoint that his commissions would not be capped. Amend. Compl. \u00b6 79. These IBM representations were inconsistent with the representations in the IPL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IPL at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, Swafford has alleged why IBM may have made the inconsistent representations: most employers in Swafford's field do not cap commissions and IBM would be unable to recruit good sales representatives if IBM informed sales representatives that their commissions would be capped. Amend. Compl. \u00b6 40. IBM should not be allowed to make inconsistent representations and then insist that, as a matter of law, its sales representatives were incorrect to rely on IBM's representations. The Court concludes that, given the inconsistent representations in the PowerPoint and given that the IPL was not a contract, it is plausible that Swafford reasonably relied on IBM's representations that the commissions would be uncapped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   United States District Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California recently considered the question of whether an IBM sales representative sufficiently alleged reasonable reliance in a case concerning substantially similar allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   , No. C 18-06783 WHA, Dkt. No. 51. Judge Alsup found that the sales representative plaintiff had plausibly alleged reasonable reliance on the misrepresentations. Specifically, Judge Alsup noted that, \"[f]ollowing his receipt of the IPL, plaintiff received the PowerPoint presentation which repeatedly and without reservation stated that his compensation would not be capped. His managers said the same.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Judge Alsup continued \"[p]laintiff then worked hard to earn a large commission that IBM later capped (or so a jury might reasonably find).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Alsup concluded that \"even though the IPL contained disclosures regarding IBM's 'right to adjust the Plan terms[,]' the complaint alleges sufficient facts to plausibly suggest that plaintiff reasonably relied on statements in the PowerPoint presentation and by management assuring plaintiff that IBM would not cap his compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Alsup determined \"[i]t will be a question of fact for the jury whether the reliance was reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Alsup therefore denied the motion to dismiss plaintiff's misrepresentation claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Judge Alsup's ruling is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Vinson v.

The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia's decision in\n   <em>\n    Fessler\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent and conclusory because the\n   <em>\n    Fessler\n   </em>\n   court simultaneously found that the IPLs were not a contract, but nonetheless the IPLs' statements bound the plaintiff as a matter of law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206220209\">\n    2018 WL 6220209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-8. Moreover, the United States District Court for Northern District of Georgia's decision in\n   <em>\n    Middleton v. Int'l Bus. Machs.
