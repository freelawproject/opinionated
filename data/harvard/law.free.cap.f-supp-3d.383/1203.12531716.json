Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 24-34-401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Before the Court are (1) Defendant Weld County's motion for complete summary judgment (ECF Nos. 72, 73, 88) and (2) Plaintiff Kimberly Aubrey's cross-motion for partial summary judgment, which narrowly seeks a determination that she was \"disabled\" within the meaning of the ADA (ECF Nos. 74, 85). The parties have responded to the others' respective motions, and the matters are fully briefed. (ECF Nos. 72, 73, 74, 81, 84, 85, 88.) For the following reasons, the Court grants the County's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Weld County Clerk and Recorder's Office comprises three departments: Recording, Motor Vehicle, and Elections. (R-DSUMF \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 21, 2012, the County hired Plaintiff Kimberly Aubrey as an Office Technician II in the Motor Vehicle Department. (DSUMF \u00b6 1.) Shortly thereafter, the County promoted her to Office Technician III. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) On September 6, 2013, she transferred to the Recording Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Among other things, an employee in that role\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   [e]xamines and analyzes legal documentation submitted for land record recording. Assesses and collects all associated fees as required by law. Issues marriage licenses and civil union licenses and registers marriage and civil union certificates. Assists the public in person, by phone, through electronic media, and in writing regarding search procedures and requirements. Other duties may be assigned....Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions....The organization retains the right to modify or change the duties and responsibilities of the job at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (R-DSUMF, Ex. 11.) As an employee, Aubrey was well-liked and considered hard-working by her superiors, including Defendant Carly Koppes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) In 2014, Koppes, an Election Department head, ran for public office and could no longer oversee that department. To help fill the void, Aubrey temporarily transitioned to Elections and was to return to the Recording Department when the election concluded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Koppes won and became\n   County Clerk and Recorder in January 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Aubrey's Medical Condition and Time Away from Work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In late 2014, Aubrey developed a rare medical condition known as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), a blood pressure regulatory problem that affects brain function, undermines cognitive ability, and can even cause coma and death. (DSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.) Aubrey experienced severe anxiety, tremors, seizures, and brain-swelling that caused a coma. (PSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10-11.) She also had severe limitation of her functional capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) On December 8, 2014, because of her condition, Aubrey applied for work leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which was approved by the County's third-party FMLA claims administrator, FMLA Source. (DSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.) While she was away, the County sent Aubrey a letter explaining her rights to job-protected leave under the FMLA and Colorado Family Care Leave Act (CFCA) and notifying her that \"[i]n order to be restored to your job, you must present to your employer certification from your doctor stating that you are fit to return to work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, Ex. T.) Aubrey's FMLA leave expired on February 22, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both during and after her leave, Aubrey saw several medical professionals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Angela Swayne at the Northern Colorado Long Term Acute Hospital admitted Aubrey and anticipated her return to work date would be August 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Mark Bernsten, who also treated Aubrey for her PRES, issued a FMLA leave of absence medical certification for her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.) On December 31, 2014, he related that Aubrey suffered from severe tremors, anxiety, and an inability to focus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) At that time, he found that Aubrey would be unable to work until February 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) On March 9, 2015, Dr. Bernsten filled out an attending physicians statement, in which he opined that-based on her February 27 visit-Aubrey had a Class-5 physical impairment, meaning she was unable to perform any job task and not capable of taking care of herself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-27, Ex. L.) He recommended vocational counseling and rehabilitation and clarified that no job modifications or restrictions would permit her to work for the next four to six months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, Ex. L.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Another treating physician, Dr. Revelyn Arrogante at the Northern Colorado Rehabilitation Hospital, explained that Aubrey's PRES caused cognitive issues (including with executive functioning, attention, and memory), balance issues, respiratory problems, a seizure disorder, peripheral vascular disease, depression, and visual deficits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) On February 11, 2015, Dr. Arrogante recounted severe impairments with executive functioning and verbal reasoning and mild impairment with attention and memory-all of which impacted Aubrey's ability to work because she would be unable to sufficiently process any issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-38.) On that date, Dr. Arrogante signed an FMLA leave of absence certification for FMLA Source indicating that hospitalization was medically necessary and that Aubrey was receiving 24-hour nursing care, as well as physical, occupational, speech, and respiratory therapies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) In Dr. Arrogante's opinion at that time, Aubrey would not be able to return to work in any capacity until July 31, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Speech language pathologist Michelle Underhill also treated Aubrey at the Life Care Center of Greeley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) On February 24, 2015, Underhill diagnosed Aubrey with a cognitive communication deficit and found that she was struggling with attending to and manipulating visual-spatial information; was severely deficient in communicating her thoughts, needs, and wishes; had difficulties with planning, organizing, and strategizing; and was unable to complete basic tasks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-56.) Even so, Underhill noted that Aubrey had sufficient vision, hearing, and alertness to participate in therapy; had demonstrated higher functional levels compared to her current condition; was responding positively to therapy; and that Aubrey's age and self-motivation were strong indicators of improvement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) As of April 1, 2015, according to Underhill, Aubrey was \"unable to work pending resolution of cognitive-linguistic concerns.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Aubrey's Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During all this time, Aubrey stayed in contact with the County. On February 27, 2015, after her FMLA leave had expired, she called the County's benefits manager to say she had been released from the hospital, but-even though her condition was \"reversible\"-it would be months before she could return to work because of her memory problems and her inability to see well. (R-DSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) While Aubrey was away, another employee, Michelle Wall, had been temporarily performing Aubrey's duties in the Recording Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11, Ex. 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Human Resources Director Patricia Russell testified that the County's typical process for medical accommodations makes a disabled employee responsible for filling out an ADA form, taking it to their physician with a copy of their job description, and having the medical professional return it so the County knows what accommodations can or cannot be made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 4.) Depending on the situation, employees have about fifteen days to complete this task, but more time is given in certain circumstances if the employee requests it or it is in the County's best interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-34-401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-34-401\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Koppes agreeing that she sometimes extends the time per her discretion).) Though no one ever told her there was a deadline, the County had told Aubrey that she needed medical clearance to return to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17; DSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, Ex. T.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Koppes was aware that Aubrey's FMLA leave expired had on February 22, 2015, and had permitted her leave to extend long beyond that date. (R-DSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) But on April 15, 2015, Koppes sent Aubrey a letter scheduling a pre-dismissal hearing for the next day. The letter states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Dear Kimberly, You have been unable to report to work due to your current medical condition since December 8, 2014. Additionally, you have exhausted your 12 weeks of Family Medical Leave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Office Technician III position is a vital position for the smooth operation and completion of our department's mandated responsibilities in order to fulfill the needs of the citizens of Weld County. It is essential that the Office Technician III position be filed on a full-time basis to perform the essential functions of that position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Since you are not able to perform the essential functions of your job as an Office Technician III and we are not\n   able to accommodate your restrictions, a pre-dismissal hearing has been scheduled for you on Thursday, April 16, 2015....During this hearing, you have the right to present any updated information regarding your medical condition as it relates to your ability to perform the essential functions of the Office Technician position. If you have any medical updates from your doctor, please bring the information to the scheduled hearing. This hearing is your opportunity to present any relevant information which would have bearing on you employment status.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (DSUMF \u00b6 58, Ex. I.) According to Aubrey, since she was slotted in the Recording Department as of April 15, 2015, it was that position that Koppes was looking at to determine if there could be an accommodation. (R-DSUMF \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 16, 2015, Aubrey's hearing took place in front of Koppes and Russell. (DSUMF \u00b6 59; R-DSUMF \u00b6 3.) During the hearing, the participants delved into the reasons for possible termination and whether Aubrey would be able to perform the essential functions of her position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   KOPPES: And do you have any questions with the letter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   AUBREY: No. I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   KOPPES: And I want to make sure that you, a hundred percent, know it has nothing to do with your job performance at all.... You've definitely been a standout employee for us. And so it's - this is not that easy, either, for us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   AUBREY: So I guess I really do have questions. I mean, so does this mean I am automatically dismissed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   RUSSELL: This is your opportunity to tell us why we shouldn't dismiss you. Carly [Koppes] then has to go back and make the decision if she should or should not. Contributing factor at this point is could you come back to work within the next couple of weeks to - you know, to do your full position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   AUBREY: Actually, if you ask me to, I could come back next week. But I would not be able to do the things you asked me to. I mean, I could not go back to Motor V[ehicles Department]. I would probably have to be somewhat retrained. I am finally remembering some of the things I did in [the Election Department], you know....I am still going to therapy. Not even finished with that. I can't even get in to see an eye specialist, which is a neuro ophthalmologist....I feel confident yet that I could do what I was. With a little bit of prompting and things like that, yes. But I can't even drive yet. I have to see the neuro ophthalmologist. I can't even do that until the 30th. Can't even get a doctor's - I have to go to a neurologist, and the first time I can get in is May 22nd. I mean, you can't just get these things done. You don't know how hard I've tried....It's been very frustrating. I am able [to] do my own insurance stuff now. I can write my own checks. I type. It's hard because of my vision, but it's all getting better. And I'm very thankful for that, because I could be dead, and I'm up and walking....So I guess that's my rebuttal to all of this. I've tried very hard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   KOPPES: [E]verybody that you've worked with has always said that you are very much a team player and very much somebody that everybody enjoys working with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   AUBREY: I mean, even if you guys would consider letting me come back in a capacity, I would go down to an [Office] Tech[nician] II. Just give me some time to get all my doctors in order and say I can come back. Because I can't even get a doctor to tell me, until I go to\n   the neurologist, to say I can go back. It's the 22nd of May, you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   RUSSELL: Okay. You've had a tough fight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   AUBREY: Yep. Have a little more ways to go, and I'm just thankful to be where I'm at.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   AUBREY: There's more. I mean, I've been to therapy here in Greeley. This is something I'm trying to make up for long-term disability. So - and I've typed it. So if there's errors. It took me forever, but that was a couple of weeks ago. I'm working hard on the computer.... I could even, at this point, in the Motor V[ehicles] [D]epart[ment], if somebody would check the titles, I'm sure I could enter them, you know. And they always have a backlog of entering titles.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   KOPPES: They've been working pretty hard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   AUBREY: Yeah. So I do understand that. I know how hard it is for an office not to have a person there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   AUBREY: But they do say I probably - more than likely, it will never, ever happen again. It's just one of those things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   RUSSELL: Well, we will - Carly [Koppes] will let you know probably tomorrow, one way or the other, what we're going to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DSUMF, Ex. J.) The balance of Aubrey's testimony makes clear that she believed she had been either meeting or exceeding rehabilitation and treatment expectations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-34-401\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2024-34-401\">\n    at 6:5-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"I was supposed to be [at the hospital] the minimum six weeks. I was out in two.\").) Additionally, Koppes understood Aubrey's intimations about being \"somewhat retrained\" and receiving \"a little bit of prompting\" to be requests for accommodations of her condition. (R-DSUMF \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In considering if any accommodations could be made, Koppes testified that she\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   look[ed] at every single job process in the Recording department. And, unfortunately, everything involved being on the computer and typing, and having good eyesight, and being able to understand over 200 different document types. There - there isn't a job in the Recording department that doesn't require you to be on the computer and be able to answer the phones and the public. There isn't any type of back-office jobs to do. It's all - all up front, dealing with the public and answering the phones and taking in recordings....[E]verything is - is dealing with documents that are legal documents. And we have to make sure that they're indexed and verified properly, because it is a historical recording of property deeds, which is very important to have correct....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   We were more looking at the lines of, is there any job that we could put her in. It was - it was more of can we find something for her to do or not. And, unfortunately, it wasn't - there just wasn't anything. From the information that she gave to Patti [Russell] and I at the predismissal hearing, trying to figure out if there was anything that we could do, we - we looked at everything. And it was more of the information that she gave us that we could not - unless we completely re-created a whole brand-new job and put a whole bunch of extra burden on her coworkers, we - there wasn't anything that we could do. It was more on what she said and the information that she gave us is what we had to go off of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29, Ex. 2.) On April 20, 2016, the County terminated Aubrey by letter from Koppes, who is the relevant final decisionmaker. (DSUMF \u00b6 60; R-DSUMF \u00b6 47,\n   Ex. 9.) The termination letter stated in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   During the pre-dismissal hearing held yesterday, in the Human Resources Office, you indicated that you continue with ongoing active medical treatment for your health condition(s) and are unable to return to work until 07/31/2015. As you are unable to return to work and therefore unable to perform the duties of your job. I have no other choice than to dismiss you from employment with the Weld County Clerk &amp; Recorder's Office effective immediately....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   If your restrictions change and you are able to fulfill the essential functions of an Office Technician and a position becomes available in the future, feel free to apply at which time your application will be considered accordingly. If there are other positions available on the County's Employment Opportunities web page that you feel you may qualified to do at this time, contact Human Resources at [phone number].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   You may also be eligible for Short and/or Long Term disability benefits through Sun Life Assurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (R-DSUMF, Ex. 9.) Even though Aubrey later testified that-in order to return to work from a continuous or reduced-schedule leave-she knew she needed a fitness-for-duty release from a doctor, at no point prior to her termination did Aubrey provide any such communication from any medical professional. (DSUMF \u00b6 65-66, Ex. E; R-DSUMF \u00b6 18.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She saw neurologist Dr. William Shaffer on May 22, 2015-as she indicated during the hearing-but Dr. Shaffer did not clear Aubrey to drive and did not provide her with a clearance to work, even though she requested one. (PSUMF, Ex. 3; DSUMF, Ex. EE.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Aubrey's Application for Disability Benefits and Ongoing PRES Difficulties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On April 20, 2015, the same day the County terminated her, Aubrey signed an application seeking long term disability benefits from Sun Life Assurance. (DSUMF \u00b6 67.) On her application, she verified that she was \"totally disabled\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   because she could not perform her job responsibilities like before she had PRES. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-71.) Aubrey testified that as of June 2015, she still had eye problems and could not drive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. E.). She further confirmed that, had she had been asked as of August 2015, she would have agreed that her memory issues still caused her too much stress to go back to her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By December 2015, Aubrey still considered herself to be \"totally disabled\" within the meaning of the benefits policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Aubrey also applied for social security disability benefits, but she was denied the same on December 22, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex.

Rebutting this proposition, the County walks a thin line. On one hand, \"for purposes of [its own motion for] summary judgment only, [the County does] not contest Plaintiff had a disability at the time of her termination in satisfaction of the first element.\" (ECF No. 88, at 2.) And given both parties' thorough recounting of Aubrey's PRES, subsequent difficulties, and the assessments of Aubrey's doctors, the Court does not see a legitimate way for the County to dispute the facts on this element. But even as it cedes this point, the County asks the Court to deny Aubrey's motion, claiming that \"a motion for entry of partial judgment on a single element is improper pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

Thus, summary judgment would be an appropriate instrument to decide the narrow issue of Aubrey's disabled status at the time of her termination as a matter of law.

In reviewing the supplied job description, the Court is satisfied that Aubrey initially had the necessary skill, experience, and education for the job. She worked as an Office Technician III for several years in different departments, and the record is awash with high praise from her superiors regarding her pre-disability work. But with her disability, there are no facts which the Court could construe in Aubrey's favor that show her ability to perform the job's essential functions. First, Aubrey herself made clear through testimony, at her hearing, and on her disability benefits applications (even long after her termination) that she was incapable of doing the work without an accommodation. Despite these acknowledgements, Aubrey submits that on June 4, 2015, a physician sent a letter to the County clearing her to work with no restrictions. But that same physician would not clear her on May 22, 2018-more than a month after her termination. It would not be reasonable for a jury to infer Aubrey's ability to perform the essential functions of her job at the time of her termination from a clearance provided two months later, provided by the same doctor\n   that did not clear her more than a month after her dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   So the question becomes whether Aubrey would have been able to perform with a reasonable accommodation. \"Whether an accommodation is reasonable under the ADA is a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Mason v.

It appears that Aubrey believes her request was definite because she knew she would be seeing her doctor on a date certain. But this is nothing more than a proposed date by which she would have had more information; it certainly didn't-as requested by Aubrey-represent a definite end date by which her PRES (or management of it) would have been resolved. The Tenth Circuit requires an employee to provide an\n   <em>\n    expected duration of the impairment\n   </em>\n   (not the duration of the leave request).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"587\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/1167/#p1169\">\n    87 F.3d at 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"This court agrees with plaintiff that a reasonable allowance of time for medical care and treatment may, in appropriate circumstances, constitute a reasonable accommodation.

Therefore, Aubrey's open-ended request for additional time to consult with a doctor was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   With respect to retraining, the Court has no basis to evaluate the actual accommodation Aubrey requested. At the hearing, Aubrey intimated that she would \"probably have to be somewhat retrained. I am finally remembering some of the things I did in [the] election [department], you know. I know I have to tab, and don't space or enter, you know.\" Aubrey cannot convert this passing suggestion into a request for a reasonable accommodation. From the information she provided, it appears that she was only just beginning to remember how to perform a single key-function task she once performed in a department other than the one to which she hoped to return. While retraining may be a reasonable accommodation under certain circumstances, the record reflects that Aubrey would be starting somewhere near square one. Aubrey has neither quantified the retraining she requested or shown how the same would be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, Aubrey has not shown how the downgrade to Office Technician II is a reasonable accommodation. There are no facts on the record that show that, as of her termination, Aubrey was capable of performing any of the essential functions\n   of that lower position, and she remained without a clearance from any doctor. As it stood, she was in a state of severe cognitive impairment, and the record does not show what the essential functions of the lesser position were, or how Aubrey would be more capable of performing those lesser functions. The Court is simply unable to evaluate the reasonableness of the downgrade-meaning Aubrey has failed to put forth facts that, even taken in the most favorable light, meet her burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because Aubrey fails to make out a prima facie case, the Court's analysis ends here, even though she has further done nothing to show as mere pretext the reasons for her termination supplied by the County-that because she was unable to come back to work, and therefore unable to perform the duties of her job, and because she agreed with the County's perception of her illness and admitted she had a ways to go before she would be able to work, there was no remaining choice but to dismiss her.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Holly v.

In order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADA, the plaintiff must show: \"(1) that she engaged in an activity protected by the statute; (2) that she was subjected to [an] adverse employment action subsequent to or contemporaneous with the protected activity; (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\"\n   <em>\n    Selenke v.

A request for accommodation is a protected activity, and a favorable reading of the hearing transcript shows that she made such requests on April 16, 2015. Moreover, her termination on April 20, 2015 followed those requests and is certainly an adverse employment action. On this second element, Aubrey goes one step further, suggesting that the County's failure to hire her after Wall left the Recording department constitutes adverse action. This supposition is unconvincing because there is no evidence that Aubrey ever applied for her old position once it opened or that the County rejected her and continued to seek other applicants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cruces v. Utah State Veterans Nursing Home\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089559\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/222/776/#p779\">\n    222 F. App'x 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779 (10th Cir. 2007) (\"In the failure-to-hire context, a plaintiff must show that she applied for and that she was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants and the employer continued to seek applicants after rejecting the plaintiff's application.\"). Thus the Court considers whether Aubrey has sufficiently alleged a causal connection between her request for accommodation and her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On causation, there is no direct evidence that the County terminated Aubrey because of her requests, and Aubrey relies exclusively on the four-day temporal proximity between the events. The Tenth Circuit has indicated that the \"date of Plaintiff's termination is key to this inquiry because the closer it occurred to the protected activity, the more likely it will support a showing of causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Coors Brewing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663871\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/1171/#p1179\">\n    181 F.3d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1179 (10th Cir. 1999). But this principle, by\n   which causation has been inferred by proximity alone, does not alter the over-arching requirement that there must be \"genuine issues of material fact concerning [a] defendant's motivation.\"\n   <em>\n    Marx v. Schnuck Markets, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7628945\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/76/324/#p329\">\n    76 F.3d 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 329 (10th Cir. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   While her reliance on temporal proximity to make out a prima facie case is not entirely misguided, Aubrey has failed her duty, in the burden-shifting framework, to overcome the County's proffered legitimate reason for going through with the termination. After the hearing, Koppes testified that the County looked at every single job process in the Recording Department, attempting to find ways to accommodate Aubrey. Koppes concluded that there was no job available to someone who was \"unable to return to work and therefore unable to perform the duties of [the] job.\" She also encouraged Aubrey to apply for a position that became available in the future if her restrictions were to change. Koppes also stated, and Aubrey agreed, that a department could not function adequately at less than capacity. The Court finds that the County has shown legitimate business reasons for termination, which Aubrey could have refuted by showing these reasons were mere \"pretext by demonstrating 'such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.' [However, m]ere conjecture that the employer's explanation is pretext is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Coors Brewing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11663871\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/1171/#p1179\">\n    181 F.3d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1179 (10th Cir. 1999) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. Hilti, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639593\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/108/1319/#p1323\">\n    108 F.3d 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1323 (10th Cir. 1997). On this claim, Aubrey has not even suggested how the County's actions were pretextual. But borrowing from other portions of her brief, Aubrey believes the County's temporary accommodation of her absence by implanting Wall into her position demonstrates that the provided reasons for her termination were a mere pretext. But this fails because the County temporarily assigned Wall to Aubrey's position before the hearing, and therefore the two events cannot be causally related. Aubrey additionally provides other loosely formed hypotheses-none of which subvert the legitimate business reasons provided by the County. Judgment for the County on Aubrey's retaliation claim is appropriate as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to Accommodate Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   If an employer fails to satisfy its duty to accommodate, a disabled employee or job applicant may bring a failure-to-accommodate claim under the Rehabilitation Act. To state a failure-to-accommodate claim, Aubrey must allege that she: (1) is disabled; (2) is \"otherwise qualified\"; and (3) requested a plausibly reasonable accommodation.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v. United States Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275495\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/1185/#p1195\">\n    870 F.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1195 (10th Cir. 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson v.

The Court permitted Aubrey to move forward with this claim because the required elemental showing is technically different than an ADA discrimination cause of action and the County did not cite authority precluding her from alleging failure-to-accommodate as a separate and distinct claim. But under the circumstances now, and with the benefit of the discovery record, the Court finds that Aubrey's failures on her first claim extend to this one because she cannot show that she presented the County any reasonable accommodation. Judgment is appropriate on this claim as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
