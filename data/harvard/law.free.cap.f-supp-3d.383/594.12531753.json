Plaintiff responded in opposition and defendant replied. In this posture, the issues raised are ripe for ruling. For the following reasons, defendant's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, who formerly worked at an EconoLodge hotel located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina (the \"EconoLodge\" or the \"hotel\"), commenced this action against defendant, allegedly a franchisor of the EconoLodge, asserting claims of negligence arising from an assault upon plaintiff by a hotel guest. In amended complaint filed July 17, 2018, plaintiff asserts claims of negligence due to failure to provide a safe and secure premises and work environment, and failure to provide proper training. Plaintiff seeks award of compensatory and punitive damages, as well as costs upon jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss on October 16, 2018, seeking dismissal of all claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts alleged in the complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   may be summarized as follows. Plaintiff began working at the EconoLodge at the end of 2015, when she was 17 years of age. Defendant, a Delaware corporation with principal office in Maryland, was at all times relevant herein a franchisor of the EconoLodge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was employed to run the front desk and perform other menial tasks at the hotel. At the time of her employment plaintiff was a senior in high school, with limited work experience. Plaintiff applied for the position by calling the hotel and asking if they had any open positions. Plaintiff \"believed she was being employed by 'EconoLodge,' a national hotel chain, which is owned and controlled by\" defendant. (Compl. \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon employment, plaintiff received minimal training, including training to use a software system for payment and reservations, which was controlled, owned, and created by defendant. Defendant also provides software for further training to employees of the EconoLodge regarding day-to-day employment activities. Plaintiff was tasked with working a 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift, and she primarily worked her shift alone, without any other staff, including security officers, present at the hotel property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff was informed during her training that upon complaint of any guest or request for service that in the course of her duties plaintiff was to attempt to fulfill said request. Her manager directed her that this included going to a guest's room unaccompanied. Defendant's training policies did not prohibit this conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff received minimal training regarding entering guest rooms and what if any precautions should be taken. She was not specifically trained to decline to enter a room where the door was open and a guest did not appear to be present. In the past five years leading up to the assault on plaintiff, there were at least 200 reported crimes, including 30 assaults (sexual or otherwise), 22 drug related incidents, and at least 13 occurrences where employees of this EconoLodge in Elizabeth City were themselves harassed or assaulted while on the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the days leading up to the assault on plaintiff, fellow employees had referenced odd behavior from a guest of the hotel, Aeron Nicholas Etheridge (\"Etheridge\"). This was documented in a log maintained by employees. Etheridge had been staying at the hotel off and on since his release from jail in November of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the evening of the assault on plaintiff, January 11, 2016, plaintiff was working the front desk with no other staff present. Etheridge contacted plaintiff at the front desk on two occasions that evening, the first regarding an issue with the television and the second with a request for towels and soap. As required by her training, plaintiff went to Etheridge's room in each instance. The second time she approached the room the door was open and Etheridge did not upon inspection appear to be in the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Upon entering Etheridge's room to deliver the items, Etheridge, who had been hiding, assaulted plaintiff by attacking her, tying her up, and raping her, over the course of approximately one hour, until he released her. At no time during the assault did an employee or other staff member know the whereabouts of plaintiff as she was working alone without any security presence. Plaintiff suffered severe and lasting physical and mental injuries. She has not returned to work since the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    COURT'S DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To state a claim for negligence against defendant, as plaintiff asserts in her complaint, plaintiff must allege facts establishing that defendant \"failed to exercise proper care in the performance of some legal duty owed [to plaintiff] and that the breach of this duty was the proximate cause of [plaintiff's] injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodman v. Wenco Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2546568\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/333/1/#p18\">\n    333 N.C. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=423%20S.E.2d%20444\">\n    423 S.E.2d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff asserts two theories in the complaint under which defendant allegedly owed a duty to plaintiff: 1) an actual or apparent agency theory, based upon defendant's role as a franchisor for EconoLodge, and 2) a theory of an independent duty owed by defendant by taking responsibility for a safe working environment. The court addresses each in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1. Agency liability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that defendant is liable for plaintiff's injuries by virtue of its role as a franchisor of EconoLodge, under a theory of actual or apparent agency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 34-35). Although plaintiff does not provide any briefing in support of this theory of liability in opposition to motion to dismiss, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. (DE 23) at 3), analysis thereof is important to understanding the posture of plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under North Carolina law, as a general rule, \"[w]hoever commits a wrong is liable for it, and it is immaterial whether it be done by him in person or by another acting by his authority, express or implied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, applying North Carolina law, has noted that \"[t]hough no actual agency exists, a party may be held to be the agent of another on the basis that he has been held out by the other to be so in a way that reasonably induces reliance on the appearances.\"\n   <em>\n    Crinkley v.

Applying this rule in the context of a hotel franchise, the Fourth Circuit determined that \"[b]y virtue of [its] franchise agreement, Holiday Inns retained a significant degree of control over the operation of the Holiday Inn-Concord,\" which was sufficient to impose liability upon the franchisor for the negligence of the franchisee in failing to protect a guest of the hotel from an assault by a third party entering upon the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542658\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/156/#p166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, however, liability based upon actual or apparent agency is precluded because the alleged franchisee here, EconoLodge, plaintiff's purported employer, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4, 6, 7), is itself excluded from liability in negligence under the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act. \"The North Carolina Workers Compensation Act was created to ensure that injured employees receive sure and certain recovery for their work-related injuries without having to prove negligence on the part of the employer or defend against charges of contributory negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamby v.

With respect to other alleged conduct by defendant, plaintiff alleges that she \"was trained\" to use defendant's \"software system for payment and reservations,\" and \"day-to-day employment activities,\" (Compl. \u00b6 10), and plaintiff points to defendant's adversting and \"online training materials,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 40), but plaintiff does not allege these systems governed workplace safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Comparison to\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   is instructive.

The same can be said here. Plaintiff has not alleged any specific undertaking by defendant to assume primary responsibility for workplace safety at the EconoLodge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Other examples cited in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   are equally applicable to the circumstances alleged here. The court cited, for instance, a case where \"Good Samaritan\" liability was rejected \"where the parent corporation provided\n   <em>\n    general safety guidelines to be implemented by local management\n   </em>\n   , which ... amounted to only a\n   <em>\n    mere concern with safety matters\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 759-60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20S.E.2d%20146\">\n    685 S.E.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Equally insufficient are \"allegations that the parent company was concerned about safety at the subsidiary and that the parent company\n   <em>\n    promulgated safety procedures that the subsidiary was supposed to implement\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 760,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20S.E.2d%20146\">\n    685 S.E.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (emphasis added). Such emphasized insufficient allegations are similar to what plaintiff relies upon here. Likewise, where \"minimal contact about safety matters\" is not sufficient to create liability,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 759,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20S.E.2d%20146\">\n    685 S.E.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , then no actual contact alleged here about safety matters must also be insufficient to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At bottom, plaintiff's direct liability claim as presently asserted based upon defendant's responsibility for providing a safe working environment for plaintiff is barred by the exclusion in the Workers' Compensation Act. Where plaintiff also seeks to advance her negligence claims based upon a \"Good Samaritan\" theory of liability outside of the exclusion in the Workers' Compensation Act, such a claim is not well supported in the law, and plaintiff in any event has not alleged facts supporting such a claim. Because such claims in part are subject to dismissal for failure to plead sufficient facts, dismissal in that part is without prejudice. Plaintiff's third \"claim\" for \"punitive damages,\" (Compl. p. 9), which is derivative of her negligence claims, also is dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For that part of plaintiff's claims dismissed without prejudice, the court allows plaintiff an opportunity to seek leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goode v.
