Bennett, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In these consolidated cases, nine blind or visually impaired inmates formerly or presently housed in correctional facilities maintained by the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services have challenged the conditions of their confinement. (Consolidation Order, ECF No. 2.) Together, Plaintiffs Steven Brown (\"Brown\"), Wilbert M. Delano (\"Delano\"), Gregory Hammond (\"Hammond\"), Sedric Holley (\"Holley\"), Russell Hopkins (\"Hopkins\"), Johnny James (\"James\"), Tyrell Polley (\"Polley\"), Maynard Snead (\"Snead\"), and Robert Wilson (\"Wilson\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") allege that Defendants Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (the \"Department\"), Dayena Corcoran (\"Corcoran\"), Richard Miller (\"Miller\"), and Stephen Moyer (\"Moyer\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   have deprived them of their right to access the courts, subjected them to cruel and unusual punishment, and discriminated against them on the basis of their disabilities. Their Amended Complaint (ECF No. 23) brings two Counts pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Counts I and II), a third Count under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count III), and a fourth Count invoking Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently pending before this Court are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 100); Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 172); Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 178); Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Surreply (ECF No. 207); and Plaintiffs' Motion for Substitution or for Judicial Notice of Substitution under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d) (ECF No. 208).

For the reasons stated below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 100) is DENIED AS MOOT; Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 172) is DENIED; and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 178) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a Surreply (ECF No. 207) is GRANTED;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Plaintiffs' Motion for Substitution or for Judicial Notice of Substitution under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d) (ECF No. 208) is GRANTED.

Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    550 U.S. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hardwick ex rel. Hardwick v.

Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have subjected them to constitutional deprivations and discriminated against them on the basis of their disabilities. All nine Plaintiffs suffer from varying degrees of visual impairment. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-21; PSJ\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ex. 1.) When Plaintiffs commenced this action by filing nine\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Complaints in March 2016, all Plaintiffs were incarcerated at the Roxbury Correctional Institution (\"RCI\"). Some Plaintiffs have also been housed at other institutions like Eastern Correctional Institution (\"ECI\"), Patuxent Institution, and the Maryland Reception, Diagnostic and Classification Center (\"MRDCC\"). (ECF Nos. 1, 3.) Since the filing of this case, five Plaintiffs (Delano, Hammond, Holley, Hopkins, and Polley) have been released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Structure of the Department.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services is overseen by the Department Secretary. (PSJ Ex. 16.) Within the Department, the Commissioner of Correction supervises the wardens at each prison. (PSJ Ex. B, Corcoran Dep. 46:13-20.) Roxbury Correctional Institution (\"RCI\") and Eastern Correctional Institution (\"ECI\") are facilities within the Division of Correction, each of which is managed by a Warden or Acting Warden. (PSJ Ex. C, Campbell 30(b)(6) Dep.; Ex. D, West 30(b)(6) Dep.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Stephen Moyer was the Secretary of the Department since January 2015. (DSJ Ex. 11, Moyer Dep. 18:5-16.) In this position, he managed approximately 10,000 employees and a $ 1.4 billion budget. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:9-33:15.) He was heavily involved in coordination efforts between his Department and other Maryland political bodies and had little involvement in the day-to-day operations at Department facilities: his work included preparing and participating\n   in budgetary hearings and meetings with the Governor's Office and the Department of Legislative Affairs, monitoring pending bills, and meeting with other cabinet members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:2-34:5, 36:2-38:1.) On March 7, 2019, Moyer announced his departure from state service effective at the end of that month. (Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. 5, n.4.) While this case was pending, Robert L. Green (\"Green\") became the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Dayena Corcoran was the Commissioner of Correction for the Department from 2016 until September 2018. (DSJ Ex. 12, Corcoran Dep. 46:10-12, 48:2-10.) In that role, she was responsible for implementing and enforcing Division of Correction policies and managed the wardens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:10-47:14, 99:3-20.) Defendant Richard Miller was the Warden of RCI from April 2015 to November 2017. (DSJ Ex. 13, Miller Dep. 25:10-16.) His job required him to manage the operations of the entire RCI facility, including over 400 employees and 1,800 inmates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:2-58:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Department contracts with the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (\"Department of Labor\") to provide educational, vocational shop, and library programs, services, and activities at RCI and ECI. (PSJ Ex. 17; Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 172:7-10, 190:4-8, 192:5-11.) The Department also contracts or otherwise arranges with third-party entities to provide medical services and other programs, services, and opportunities to inmates at RCI. (PSJ. Ex. F, Baucom 30(b)(6) Dep. 37:10- 38:9; Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 291:4-292:11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Services Provided at RCI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs generally complain that Defendants have provided inadequate aids and services to permit them to conduct their affairs in prison privately and independently. Because they have been denied adequate training or other services, they complain that they have been forced to rely on other inmates to complete various tasks like filing grievances and court complaints, reading and writing correspondence, and navigating prison facilities. They also complain that they have been forced to share prison cells with other inmates, a practice the parties refer to as \"double-celling\" (as opposed to being celled alone, or \"single-celling\") and that they have been excluded from various programs on the basis of their visual impairments, including desirable jobs. The net effect of all this, Plaintiffs complain, is that they have been rendered vulnerable to violence and extortion at the hands of sighted inmates and they have been denied benefits accorded to other inmates, including additional diminution credits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the following pages, these grievances are discussed in greater detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Housing Blind Inmates at RCI and ECI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants admit that RCI, a medium security facility, was and continues to be the designated Department facility for blind inmates, regardless of their security classification. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 37:15-18; Ex. C, Campbell 30(b)(6) Dep. 29:16-17, 194:5-7, 414:18-20; Ex. K, Baker Dep. 103:21-104:14; Ex. M, Gelsinger Dep. 122:5-7; Ex. N, Hershberger Dep. 19:14-16.) Although some inmates with visual impairments have been housed at ECI, once an inmate's visual impairment becomes sufficiently severe, they are sent\n   to RCI because ECI does not \"have the accommodations that Roxbury Correctional Institution has\" for the blind. (PSJ Ex. D, West 30(b)(6) Dep. 60:7-61:5.) With the exception of a few days spent at other facilities, all Plaintiffs have spent all or the majority of their incarceration at RCI, with some Plaintiffs (Hammond and Wilson) also housed at ECI for significant periods. (PSJ Ex. 27; Ex. 28; Ex. 29; Ex. 30; Ex. 31; Ex. 32, at 1676; Ex. 33, at 183; Ex. 12, at 1084-85; Ex. J-78, at POLLEY 420-21; Ex. 14; Ex. 34.3.) Plaintiffs Brown, James, Snead, and Wilson remain incarcerated at RCI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSJ Ex. 35; Ex. 12, at 1084-85; Ex. 14; Ex. D, West 30(b)(6) Dep. 44:8-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Communications with Blind Inmates.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Department provides access to many of its programs, activities, and services through reading and writing but does not provide documents in alternative formats that blind inmates can access independently, such as large print, audio, Braille, or accessible electronic formats that could be accessed on a computer with the use of a screen reader or screen magnification software. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 116:19-117:19, 201:11-16; Ex. C, Campbell 30(b)(6) Dep. 128:14-21; Ex. M, Gelsinger Dep. 108:11-109:18; Ex. D, West 30(b)(6) Dep. 51:15-52:15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 19, Olivero Rpt. 6, 20-27 (discussing alternative formats for print usable by blind people)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When inmates want to make a request or register a complaint, they can use either an informal or formal grievance process, each of which relies on the submission of a print form. The informal request process depends on submission of an informal complaint form or another written document. (PSJ Ex. C, Campbell 30(b)(6) Dep. 99:21-100:11; Ex. D, West 30(b)(6) Dep. 50:21-51:14.) That form is not available in any alternative formats. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 116:15-117:19; Ex. D, West 30(b)(6) Dep. 51:15-52:15.) The formal complaint process, known as the administrative remedy procedure (\"ARP\"), requires use of a print form that is not available in large print or any other accessible format. See Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. at 201:11-16 (stating that the ARP form is not available in large print and that \"we are not allowed to manipulate forms\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   It is undisputed that no staff are explicitly assigned to act as readers and scribes for visually impaired inmates. The RCI Inmate Handbooks and Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and Department of Corrections Directives make no mention of any staff position or inmate assignment to provide these services, but the case management manual does specify that \"case managers are to assist inmates as required or as requested.\" (PSJ Ex. C, Campbell 30(b)(6) Dep. 122:2-8; E-94; Ex. G-102; Ex. D-124; Ex. I-3.) Former RCI Warden Gregg Hershberger and former Commissioner Dayena Corcoran described staff assistance to blind inmates as voluntary. (PSJ Ex. B, Corcoran Dep. 94:9-95:9; see Ex. N, Hershberger Dep. 88:3-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants assign sighted inmates as escorts, or \"walkers,\" for blind inmates to help them navigate the prison. (PSJ Ex. 49, The Department's Supp. Answers Delano Interrog. No. 8 (Mar. 13, 2019)). Inmate escort is a \"preferred\" job, the criteria for which are that the inmate be housed at RCI and off disciplinary segregation a certain number of days. (PSJ Ex. E-94, at S BROWN 140-141; Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 214:13-215:17.) Sex offenders were permitted to be walkers until 2018. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 214:18-215:3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. E-5, at BROWN 3101-02; Ex. E-94, at S BROWN 140-41.) Defendants choose the inmates who serve as\n   escorts without input from blind inmates. (PSJ Ex. K, Baker Dep. 147:20-148:3.) The former lieutenant for the housing unit containing the tier for blind inmates claimed to instruct his tier officers how to train walkers, and that the tier officers were tasked with training walkers. (Ex. A, Franklin Dep. 40:6-41:17.) Nevertheless, there is conflicting evidence of this topic: the former tier officer for the blind tier denied any such training existed (Ex. L, Conrad 20:4-6), as did Defendant's designee (Ex. E, Reid Dep. 223:14-224:12), and a former walker (Ex. U, Willey Dep. 50:3-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is disputed whether inmate walkers are responsible for reading and writing for blind inmates. Maureen Reid, one of the Defendants' Rule 30(b)(6) designees,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that reading and writing for blind inmates is part of walker duties. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 194:2-7.) Other evidence suggests that this help was discretionary. (PSJ Ex. U, Willey Dep. 67:10-70:18) (testimony of former walker for Russell Hopkins indicating that reading and writing for blind inmates was in his discretion); (PSJ Ex. 24, Job Duties for Inmates Assigned as Walkers) (declaring that walkers \"may assist\" the visually impaired inmate with any written correspondence). There is no dispute that inmate walkers are not required to have a GED or high school diploma, are not tested on their ability to read and write for inmates, and are provided no training in being a reader or scribe. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 215:18-216:21; Ex. E-94, at S BROWN 140-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Work Assignments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Kitchen (or \"dietary\" or \"food service\") assignments allow inmates at RCI to earn 10 credits off their sentences (\"diminution credits\") per month, which can significantly reduce the length of a sentence. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 236:15-237:14.) Other jobs, such as sanitation and laundry, earn only 5 credits a month. (PSJ Ex. 64.) There is evidence that Defendants excluded Plaintiffs from kitchen jobs because they were concerned about the safety of blind inmates operating unsupervised in a prison kitchen. (Defs.' Resp. Ex. 21; Ex. 22, Schenck Dep. 93:16-94:2; 129:17-130:2.) In 2016, Defendants created the \"blind greeter\" position within dietary, which is reserved for a blind inmate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117:18-118:13, 119:4- 120:4.) The blind greeter's sole job is to greet correctional officers as they enter the officers' dining room and request that the officers sign a clipboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After numerous requests from Mr. Delano and Mr. Hopkins to be reassigned to the kitchen, Defendants placed Delano in the blind greeter position on February 25, 2016, and Hopkins in the blind greeter job in July 2017. (PSJ Ex. 68; Ex. 65; Ex. AA-151, at R HOPKINS 332-42; Ex. AA-149, at W DELANO 65, DELANO 563, W DELANO 67-68, 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Celling Arrangements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Almost all Plaintiffs were placed in double-cells at some point during their incarcerations. Hammond was double-celled around March 2016 (PSJ Ex. 53; 54); Delano was double-celled for various periods beginning in October 2017, February 2018, and again in March 2018 (PSJ Ex. 8); Brown was briefly double-celled between December 2014 and January 2015 (PSJ Ex. 7); Wilson was double celled from September 20, 2015 to March 29, 2017 (PSJ Ex. 15); and Polley was double-celled for some period in 2016. (PSJ Ex. 62.) The Department's own medical contractor had\n   recommended the assignment of a single-cell to many of these placements, and plaintiffs have submitted evidence to show that these recommendations were not always followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 30, 2016, this Court received ten identical pleadings filed by an unknown prisoner seeking appointment of counsel for nine visually impaired inmates. By Order of this Court, these cases were consolidated on April 4, 2016. (ECF No. 2.) The Order also granted the Plaintiffs' Motion for appointment of counsel. On April 5, 2016 Damien Dorsey of the Prisoner Rights Information System of Maryland (\"PRISM\") entered an appearance on behalf of the plaintiffs. (ECF No. 4.) Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 7, 2016. (ECF No. 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   This Court granted Defendants numerous extensions of time to respond to the Amended Complaint. The deadline was extended to December 12, 2016 (ECF No. 30); to January 27, 2017 (ECF No. 32); to March 15, 2017 (ECF No. 34); to May 15, 2017 (ECF No. 37); to July 17, 2017 (ECF No. 39); to September 15, 2017 (ECF No. 41); to October 16, 2017 (ECF No. 44); and to December 15, 2017 (ECF No. 48). Defendants neither moved to dismiss the Complaint nor filed an Answer for over two years. Finally, on January 10, 2019, Defendants responded to the Complaint by moving to dismiss. (ECF No. 100.) This motion was filed in the midst of a tight discovery period set to end on March 1, 2019 and with trial set for April 22, 2019. In the Motion, Defendants asserted-for the first time in the history of this litigation-that they were immune to Plaintiffs' ADA claims. The Defendants have still not filed an Answer to the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 18, 2019 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment seeking judgment on some of their claims brought pursuant to Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (Counts III and IV). (ECF No. 172.) On March 19, 2019, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, seeking Judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims. (ECF No. 178.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In light of the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is DENIED AS MOOT. Many of the substantive arguments of the Motion to Dismiss are incorporated into Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment and are addressed herein. To the extent that Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations, such arguments are rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In this case, nearly all the alleged incidents Plaintiffs invoke to support their access-to-courts claim occurred before the Defendants were on the job. Moyer became Secretary in 2015; Corcoran was Commissioner from 2016 until 2018; and Miller was the Warden at RCI from April 2015 until November 2017. No jury may conclude that these Defendants were \"personally involved\" in actions which took place before they had any supervisory authority over RCI. Instead, Plaintiffs are tasked with holding these Defendants liable for the very few purported constitutional violations occurring during their tenure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants \"bur[ied] their heads in the sand\" while overseeing RCI and ignored clear indications that Plaintiffs were being deprived of their access to the courts.\n   <em>\n    Makdessi v.

For this proposition, they rely in part on Defendants' \"knowledge of the present lawsuit\" and a civil Complaint Wilson filed in May 2016, alleging that he was \"partially blind and crippled, and has no help from the Institution to access the law books.\" (Pl.'s Resp. 37, ECF No. 182; Ex. 34, WILSON 403-11.) Plaintiffs do not cite authority holding that knowledge may be imputed from the allegations in a Complaint. Moreover, this Court is mindful that both the Amended Complaint in this suit and Wilson's filing neglects to cite even a single specific instance in which Plaintiffs were denied access to the courts.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Voutour v.

Defendants cannot be charged with the knowledge of constitutional violations merely because Plaintiffs filed lawsuits containing vague allegations. As Plaintiffs wholly rely on the existence of this lawsuit to impute knowledge to Secretary Moyer, he cannot be held liable for these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiffs cite a handful of purported red flags which they conclude put Defendants Corcoran and Miller on notice of their claims. They note that soon after Miller became the warden of RCI, Holley sent him a 2012 decision issued by the Inmate Grievance Office (\"IGO\") which found that \"RCI was not providing ... library services for the sight impaired.\" (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 1, Miller Dep. 95:8-96:1, 157:5-158:5; PSJ Ex. I-17, at S HOLLEY 10.) Miller considered taking remedial action by purchasing Dragon transcription software, but ultimately did not see the purchase through before leaving RCI. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 1, 49:7-53:17.) In December 2017, Corcoran participated in discussions and a demonstration of auxiliary aids. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 13, Corcoran Dep. 63:1-64:6; Ex. 39, Stanford Dep. 14:6-15:10.) Defendants also cite ARPs filed in 2016 by Snead. In one ARP appeal, he\n   complained that blind inmates could not obtain staff assistance with filing ARPs. (PSJ Ex. G-110, at SNEAD 1196-99, 1202-05, 1207-09.) In another, Snead claimed that he had sent several letters to the Warden complaining that his case manager would not arrange private telephone calls with his attorneys and that he could not communicate with them in writing, fearing that recruiting the help of other inmates to do so would jeopardize his attorney-client privilege. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 40, SNEAD 81-82.) Miller and Corcoran dismissed the first ARP appeal. Plaintiffs argue that a jury may infer that the latter was also brought to their attention based on the deposition testimony of a corporate designee, Maureen Reid, who indicated that staff members would know to advance disability-related requests to their supervisors. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 85:18-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   One IGO finding and two ARPs submitted over the course of two years are not sufficient to infer that Miller and Corcoran had actual knowledge that their subordinates were placing plaintiffs in a pervasive and unreasonable risk of constitutional injury. This evidence falls far short of the \"longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expressly noted\" rights violations contemplated by the Fourth Circuit. Furthermore, neither the IGO nor the ARPs cited by Plaintiffs conclude or allege that blind inmates were unable to file lawsuits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

At best, Miller and Corcoran knew that the library lacked certain auxiliary aids and that one inmate, Snead, complained of trouble pursuing grievances and consulting with his attorney. There is no evidence that Miller and Corcoran buried their heads in the sand while plaintiffs were shut out of court. Accordingly, Defendants Corcoran, Miller, and Moyer may not be held liable. They are entitled to Judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs have not adduced evidence of actual injuries.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Even if Defendants could be held liable, they would be entitled to Judgment in their favor because there is no evidence that Plaintiffs suffered an actual injury. To adequately demonstrate an \"actual injury\" for purposes of summary judgment, plaintiffs must show that the underlying claim is \"nonfrivolous,\" that is, at least \"arguable\" and based on \"more than hope.\"\n   <em>\n    Christopher v.

In response to an interrogatory asking them to \"identify each occasion on which you claim that because of your blindness you were denied access to court,\" these plaintiffs either admitted that their claims were baseless or did not answer the question. Wilson answered that he made \"no such allegations\" at the time. (DSJ Ex. 17, Wilson Supp. Answers to Interrog. No. 7.) Holley complained\n   that he lacked accommodations \"allowing him to perform his own legal research\" but that \"[h]e was able to retain an attorney.\" (DSJ Ex. 18, Holley Supp. Answers to Interrog.

Polley answered that, aside from being able to use an accessible computer at the library to conduct his own legal research, he \"was not otherwise denied access to court.\" (DSJ Ex. 20, Polley Supp. Answers to Interrog.

Additionally, there is substantial evidence in the record of Plaintiffs filing claims and consulting with attorneys. For example, Brown received legal assistance from Karen Polic, a lawyer from the Collateral Review Division of the public defender's office, to assist his efforts to enter the \"8-505\" drug program and to successfully pursue a significant reduction in the length of his sentence. (DSJ Ex. 28, Brown's Answers Interrog No. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As Plaintiffs have failed to raise evidence of actual injury and this Court cannot presume that they suffered one, there is no genuine issue of material fact to present to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The right to access the courts does not encompass filing grievances and obtaining a divorce.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Unable to produce competent evidence that Defendants have stymied their efforts to challenge their sentences or conditions of confinement, Plaintiffs argue that their troubles obtaining access to RCI's grievance procedures deprives them of their constitutional right to access the courts. The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e, requires prisoners to exhaust their administrative remedies before pursuing claims in Court. \u00a7 1997e(a). Accordingly, Plaintiffs argue, their denial of access to ARP proceedings prevents them from filing court complaints. To support this claim, Plaintiffs have produced evidence that the ARP process at RCI requires the use of a print form that is not available in large print or any other accessible format. (PSJ Ex. E, Reid 30(b)(6) Dep. 201:11-16; PSJ Ex. Q, Smart Dep. 132:6-8.) Appeals of ARP forms, made through the Inmate Grievance Office (\"IGO\"), must also be submitted through standard print forms. (PSJ Ex. C, Campbell 30(b)(6) Dep. 128:1-21.) There is evidence that Plaintiffs were unable to file grievances or faced difficulties finding assistance to file them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This argument fails because the constitution does not confer a right \"to participate in grievance proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

The plaintiffs purported exclusion from the grievance process does not give rise to a constitutional claim. Moreover, Plaintiffs' alleged inability to access inmate grievance procedures would not foreclose their access to the courts. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs need only pursue administrative proceedings which are \"capable of use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597464\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1850/#p1858\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the PLRA, Plaintiffs may forego ordinary exhaustion requirements by demonstrating that they\n   were unable to read the print-only grievance materials or that they otherwise had no ability to use the grievance procedures. Accordingly, even assuming that Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of access to grievance procedures, this deprivation did not foreclose their access to the courts and does not amount to a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, prisoners' constitutional right of access to the courts does not encompass James's claim that he was unable to obtain a divorce, resulting in his \"remain[ing] legally married against his wishes.\" (DSJ Ex. 21, Pls.'

In\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court clearly specified that prison officials must make available to prisoners the tools necessary to \"attack their sentences, directly or collaterally, and ... to challenge the conditions of their confinement.

Harmonizing these authorities with\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth and Seventh Circuits have concluded that in civil actions unrelated to their incarceration, prisoners enjoy a First Amendment right to petition the courts free from state-imposed \"barriers\" or \"undue interference.\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9209987\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/279/#p290\">\n    380 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   291 ;\n   <em>\n    John L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514562\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/228/\">\n    969 F.2d at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accepting this persuasive authority, the record reveals that James does not have a claim. He does not maintain that his divorce was stymied by an affirmative action taken by the Defendants; rather, it is their failure to provide him with auxiliary aids and services which he finds constitutionally infirm. No binding precedent compels this Court to accept this theory, and the language in\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   expressly forecloses such a claim.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6 92, ECF No. 23.) Plaintiffs additionally claim that the Defendants failure to \"reasonably modify their policies or procedures\" or \"to supply auxiliary aids or services\" forced them to rely on other inmates for assistance, placing them at risk of abuse and extortion by other inmates.

(PSJ Ex. 76.) On February 9, 2016 Franklin asked Miller with assistance housing blind inmates, complaining that RCI only had \"9 cells that were designated to house them and we currently have 16 visually impaired inmates in the unit ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later that day, Todd Faith forwarded an email to Miller which he had previously sent to Lt. Necole Haggie. In that email, Faith stated that \"I believe we are going in a unsafe direction with ADA and [Prison Rape Elimination Act \"PREA\"] laws if [double-celling blind inmates] isn't corrected soon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Miller admitted that \"assigning a cell partner to a blind inmate could prove counterproductive,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   and stated that \"the level of cooperation in the cell between inmates, one of which is blind, will have to offer a higher degree of respect and higher levels of compromise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is not possible for a jury to infer that Miller was aware of a substantial risk of serious injury facing blind inmates based on his comments in this email exchange. The exchange does not reveal that Miller was personally aware of any real incidents of misconduct involving double-celled blind inmates (neither Lt. Franklin nor Lt. Haggie reported anything of the sort) and Miller's mild concern that double-celling blind inmates could be \"counterproductive\" does not suggest that he believed blind inmates were in any real danger. Nor should he have been; as discussed below, the record in fact reveals that serious altercations between blind inmates and their cellmates were few and far between.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs would offer even less evidence for the jury to conclude that Corcoran possessed the requisite knowledge. Citing to her deposition, Plaintiffs complain that Corcoran ordered double-celling of blind inmates without making individualized inquiries into the risks associated with this arrangement. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 13, Corcoran Dep. 214:2-217:5.) The deposition testimony cited, however, does not indicate that Corcoran ordered double-celling. Citing to the exact same email exchange referenced in the preceding paragraph as well as deposition testimony from Denise A. Gelsinger, Plaintiffs baldly claim that \"DOC never responded\" to RCI officials' requests to single-cell blind inmates. To be clear, Corcoran was not copied on the emails by Franklin and Faith, and there is no evidence that she was aware of any instances of harm inflicted on blind inmates as a result of their double-celling. Because there is not a whiff of evidence that Corcoran had any knowledge of the supposed risk that Plaintiffs complain of, she cannot be held liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs come close to acknowledging that they cannot impose liability on Moyer. Instead, they claim that \"Plaintiffs' lawsuit put him on notice of [the double-celling] issue as of at least March 2016.\" (Pls.' Resp. 36, ECF No. 182.) Plaintiffs also fault him for failing to issue policies or guidance to prevent blind inmates from being inappropriately double-celled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As the record is devoid of any evidence establishing that Moyer had actual knowledge (as opposed to constructive knowledge imputed by the Plaintiffs' filing of a civil action), he cannot be held liable for the offenses about which Plaintiffs complain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs have also failed to put forth sufficient evidence to suggest that their periodic placement in double-cells put them at a substantial risk of harm or that they were \"particularly vulnerable to abuse from their cellmates.\" (Pl.'s Resp. 12, ECF No. 182.) They admit that Holley and Snead never had a cellmate and that James was not double-celled at RCI. Accordingly, these two cannot submit to the jury any constitutional claim arising from double-celling. As discussed in greater detail below, two of the remaining Plaintiffs suffered absolutely no injuries at the hands of cellmates. Another Plaintiff complains only that his cellmates were able to steal from him. Four Plaintiffs complain that they were involved in isolated altercations with a cellmate, and three of these did not suffered physical injuries. The evidence is not such as would permit a jury to find that a risk was\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   or that they faced potentially\n   <em>\n    serious\n   </em>\n   injury. Putting it simply: if double-celling were unconstitutional in this case, where there is only evidence of the rare altercation resulting in little or no harm, then double-celling would be unconstitutional in all cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   There is no evidence that either James, Brown or Hopkins suffered serious injuries because of their double-celling. Brown testified that he was briefly double-celled for a few months in 2013 but was otherwise single-celled in accordance with a medical order. (Def.'s Reply Ex. 2, Brown Dep. 25:11-26:7, 28:12-14.) There is no evidence that any harm, even\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   harm, came to Brown because he was double-celled. When James was first arrested in 2013, he was briefly double-celled at the Department's Maryland Reception, Diagnostic and Classification Center (\"MRDCC\"), where inmates stole from him. (DSJ Ex. 6, James Dep. 117:12-20.) Hopkins also represented that cellmates stole from him, and during his deposition he testified that cellmates \"went in my commissary, stuff like that.\" (PSJ Ex. 3, Hopkins Interrog. No. 2, \u00b6 2; DSJ Ex. 5, Hopkins Dep. 117:13-118:1.) There is no evidence that Brown, James or Hopkins suffered any physical injuries at the hands of cellmates, and the mere theft of property cannot amount to a constitutional violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v. Sherman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1036566\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/49/611/\">\n    49 F.App'x 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2002) (holding that the deliberate indifference to the security of his property is not cognizable under the Eighth Amendment);\n   <em>\n    Wa-Gino v. Arizona Dep't of Corrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20F.3d%20654\">\n    94 F.3d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1996) (same). Accordingly, neither Brown, James or Hopkins can claim that their double-celling amounted to a constitutional deprivation; nor can they show that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm arising from their placement in double-cells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   While two of the Plaintiffs complain of altercations with other cellmates, neither suffered injuries which would suggest that they were in serious danger. One testified that his cellmate poked his forehead, so he threw a punch. (DSJ Ex. 7, 17:15-19:19.) The poke did not harm him, and the two did not fight again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:6-11, 40:11-41:12.) Another testified that \"a couple times\" a cellmate \"physically grabbed [him] on [his] chest\" and that he was assaulted on other occasions but did not report these assaults. (DSJ Ex. 9, 23:7-25:4, 26:9-27:11.) It is undisputed that the chest-grabbing incident did not result in any physical injuries and there are no details concerning the other incidents of assault. There is no evidence that either Plaintiff experienced anything beyond the ordinary jailhouse scuffle in which nearly every inmate is involved, unfortunately, at some point or another. There is certainly no evidence that Defendants were aware of, but disregarded, any substantial risk of serious harm faced by these inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Another Plaintiff, while double-celled with several inmates over time, was only ever attacked by one. (DSJ Ex. 3, 16:8-12, 17:21-19:10, 21:12-17, 67:17-68:10.) Angered that he had lost his preferred job as an inmate escort, the cellmate punched, slapped, and choked the Plaintiff over a period of three weeks, causing bruising on his stomach, chest, ribs, and arms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:11-18.) Prison officials relocated the cellmate about two weeks after he reported the incidents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:3-8.) His second cellmate did not injure him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69:14-15; 72:11-12; 74:20-75:5.) As prison officials separated this inmate from his attacker soon after the altercation, and his continued double-celling was without incident, it cannot be said that Defendants disregarded a substantial risk of harm facing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, one Plaintiff claims that he \"got into three arguments\" with his cellmate when he was double celled for approximately one month in December 2014 or the beginning of 2015. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 2, Ans. Interrog. No. 4 \u00b6 4.) Arguments do not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. He also claims, however, that in or around 2011, his cellmate attempted\n   to rape him while he was sleeping. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; DSJ Ex. 2, 56:3-7, 56:17-57:2.) Plaintiffs acknowledge that this event falls outside of the statutory period, but maintain that it is relevant to show that he faced a substantial risk of serious harm while double-celled. This single incident cannot give rise to the inference that he faced a substantial risk of serious injury in any future double-celling arrangement with other cellmates. The cellmate posed no threat to him after his transfer from ECI. There is no indication that the Defendants knew of this Plaintiff's encounter with his cellmate, an event which occurred at a different prison, and before they were hired to oversee RCI. Even if they were aware of this single incident, the mere fact that he faced danger at the hands of one cellmate in the past does not suggest that any double-celling arrangement placed him in substantial risk of serious injury from other cellmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs' evidence cannot demonstrate that they were in a worse a position than the scores of other inmates currently housed in double-cells today. Of the nine Plaintiffs before this Court, only three complain of physical altercations with fellow inmates, and no such altercation within the limitations period resulted in serious injury. With so little evidence of serious injury suffered by any of these nine Plaintiffs despite a voluminous factual record probing several years of incarceration, there can be no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether these Plaintiffs faced a \"substantial\" risk of injury or whether Defendants were deliberately indifferent to such risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In sum, the record contains insufficient evidence to establish that Plaintiffs faced a special, magnified risk of harm resulting from double-celling and, critically, that the Defendants they have chosen to sue apprehended such risk. To permit Plaintiffs to submit such a flimsy record to the jury invites liability for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   double-celling arrangement. Such holding would counsel prison officials to house blind inmates in single-cells no matter the circumstances, thereby depriving inmates from a potentially valuable cellmate relationship simply because they are blind. This is simply not constitutionally mandated. Accordingly, Summary Judgment IS ENTERED in favor of Defendants on Plaintiffs' claim that their double-celling violated the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dependence on Other Inmates.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiffs cannot establish that their dependence on other inmates for reading and writing and navigating prison facilities created a significant risk of serious injury. Once again, there is no evidence that any of the named Defendants were privy to the substantial risk Plaintiffs allege. While Miller acknowledged, in the abstract, that putting inmates under the control of others \"could create violence, extortion\" (PSJ Ex. 1, Miller Dep. 64:4-21, 66:5-17), this nebulous assertion is far from an admission that Miller understood plaintiffs to be in the control of others or that he thought that any particular plaintiff was in serious danger. Moreover, there is unrefuted testimony that Miller had reviewed RCI's provision of assistive devices to the visually impaired and that he believed these services were adequate. (Pls.' Resp. Ex. 1, Miller Dep. 96:3-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   To foist liability upon Corcoran, Plaintiffs pursue a similar tack. They note that Corcoran answered in the affirmative when asked whether guidance in the Inmate Handbook was \"in tension\" with the proposition that inmates are not able \"to choose who they rely on to read or write or travel or to help them.\" (Corcoran Dep. 219:13-220:8.) Plaintiffs also claim, based on a fair reading of deposition testimony, that Corcoran \"understood that having one\n   inmate supervise, direct, or control another inmate could lead to conflict, violence and extortion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104:3-13.) Plaintiffs assert that these abstract assertions, coupled with Corcoran's general knowledge of the walker program and blind inmates' reliance on other inmates for reading and writing, provide sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that she was deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious injury. These snippets of deposition testimony are plainly insufficient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact on this record, which is utterly devoid of any evidence that Corcoran was aware that a single Plaintiff was in peril. At best, Plaintiffs' evidence could support the conclusion that Corcoran was aware of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   risk to the general body of blind inmates, but there is no evidence that Corcoran believed this risk to be especially pronounced or that\n   <em>\n    these\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs faced a higher degree of danger than the average inmate, confined at any institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, and once again, Plaintiffs cannot establish that Moyer-sitting at the highest reaches of the Department-had any awareness of a substantial risk of injury facing a miniscule subset of the prison population he oversaw. Plaintiffs even acknowledge that Moyer believed that, at RCI, Plaintiffs had access to \"equipment ... to assist them.\" (Moyer Dep. 83:19-84:1.) There is simply no evidence that Moyer possessed the requisite\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   to hold him liable for a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs have additionally failed to produce evidence that abuse at the hands of a walker or other inmate assistants was \"widespread.\" For many of the Plaintiffs, there is not a shred of evidence that their visual impairments rendered them predisposed to assault from other inmates. Brown did not complain that the inmate escorts he relied upon caused him harm (Brown Dep. 42:5-44:6). While James claimed that he was grabbed by a walker and kicked by another, both of these walkers were replaced soon after he requested new ones and he suffered no injuries from these incidents (James Dep. 75:21-79:22, 106:7-9, 121:16-124:19.) The only injury Polley sustained at RCI occurred when he bumped his head, for which he was provided Motrin and an ice pack. (Polley Dep. 38:14-40:10). Aside from isolated incidents involving cellmates, neither Wilson nor Hammond were ever assaulted or injured by any other inmates. (Wilson Dep. 23:7-25:4, 26:9-27:11; Hammond Dep. 69:14-15, 72:11-12, 74:20-75:5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs have failed to establish that all but a few of their number suffered any injuries based on their reliance on others for various forms of assistance. There is no evidence that the individual Defendants were aware of the scattered incidents of violence affecting these Plaintiffs. Without such evidence, Plaintiffs cannot submit this claim to a jury. Accordingly, Summary Judgment IS ENTERED in favor of Defendants on Plaintiffs' claim that their general reliance on other inmates resulted in constitutional violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendants assert qualified immunity as a defense to Plaintiff's constitutional claims. \"To establish a qualified immunity defense, a public official must demonstrate that (1) a plaintiff has not alleged or shown facts that make out a violation of a constitutional right, or that (2) the right at issue was not clearly established at the time of its alleged violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

In this case, Plaintiffs have failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support their constitutional claims. There is no evidence that they\n   were unable to pursue a specific, non-frivolous legal claim in violation of their right to access the courts. As to their cruel and unusual punishment claims, there is no evidence that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm facing the Plaintiffs. Deliberate indifference is a critical element of a failure to protect claim; it is not merely a means of attributing liability to a Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmer v.

Having failed to meet their evidentiary burden on this element, Plaintiffs cannot establish an Eighth Amendment violation. Furthermore, because plaintiffs have identified only scattered incidents of ill-documented injuries, and some plaintiffs suffered no serious injuries whatsoever, they have failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to their constitutional violations.

Defendants obtained numerous extensions to respond to Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint to permit the facilitation of settlement discussions. On December 18, 2017, this Court extended the deadline to \"file a response to the complaint\" to ten (10) days after referral of this matter to a Magistrate Judge for settlement discussions and either (a) \"development of a schedule\" or (b) \"joint declaration of an impasse in developing a schedule after reasonable attempts to do so.\" (ECF No. 51.) On January 31, 2018 this case was referred to Magistrate Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher for settlement purposes. (ECF No. 54.) On February 27, 2018, Judge Gallagher scheduled an initial settlement\n   conference and a follow-up settlement conference. (ECF No. 55.) Accordingly, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss was due on March 9, 2018. Defendants completely failed to meet this deadline by filing a Motion to Dismiss on January 10, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In that Motion to Dismiss, Defendants sought to dismiss the Amended Complaint on various grounds and argued, for the first time,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   that they were immune to Plaintiff's ADA claims. At the time, the parties were constrained by a tight discovery deadline and trial date had been established. Defendants' dilatory tactics, combined with their numerous appearances before magistrate judges for settlement and discovery purposes amounts to a waiver of the State's sovereign immunity defense. Although the Defendants had not previously filed a formal pleading in this action, its activities before this Court constitute affirmative acts signaling the Defendants' consent to suit. Because Defendants conduct is plainly incompatible with an invocation of sovereign immunity, they have waived their sovereign immunity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Additionally, Defendants vulnerability to suit under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act precludes them from asserting that defense against Plaintiffs' identical Title II claims. Plaintiffs assert the same claims under both Section 504 and Rehabilitation Act and seek the same remedies under both statutes. The parties have indicated that the slight differences between these statutes, including their distinct causation requirements, are not at issue. Accordingly, these claims are subject to identical legal analyses. Under these circumstances, it would make little sense to hold, on the one hand, that Defendants are susceptible to suit under Section 504, but, on the other hand, that they are immune to Plaintiffs' legally indistinguishable ADA claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pace v.

Under the circumstances presented here, Defendants may not evade liability under the ADA by invoking sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs have not established that they are entitled to Summary Judgment on their ADA or Rehabilitation Act claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs petition this Court to grant partial Summary Judgment and to \"declare\" ten items enumerated in their Motion. (ECF No. 172.) This list of items would require this Court to make certain factual findings (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"Defendants failed to give primary consideration to the choices of blind inmates in determining what auxiliary aids or services to provide\") and make mixed rulings of fact and law (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"All Plaintiffs are individuals with disabilities protected by Title II and Section 504.\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This Court's analysis will focus on whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be resolved by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   During the Motions Hearing, Plaintiffs clarified that they sought Summary Judgment on \"six major claims\": (1) failing to establish a process for providing auxiliary aids and other reasonable modifications or notifying Plaintiffs of their rights under Title II and Section 504; (2) denying auxiliary aids to ensure that plaintiffs' communications with Defendants, courts, and others\n   were equally effective as those enjoyed by other inmates; (3) refusing to make reasonable modifications to ensure safe celling arrangements for blind or visually impaired inmates; (4) failing to supply training or other services to permit Plaintiffs to safely navigate department facilities, and instead requiring Plaintiffs to rely on escorts or \"walkers\" recruited from the prison population; (5) excluding plaintiffs from desirable kitchen jobs which provided the opportunity to earn additional diminution credits; and (6) restricting plaintiffs to incarceration at medium security facilities even when (a) they had lower security classifications which would entitle them access to minimum security facilities and/or (b) they needed programs that were not available at RCI, all in violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

Defendants also argue that they have satisfied their legal obligations by designating a special kitchen job, the \"blind greeter,\" for blind inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has held that vocational programs are among the benefits and services provided by prisons for purposes of Title II.\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr. v.

The Department of Justice has promulgated regulations describing how a public entity is to assess whether an individual poses a direct threat:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, a public entity must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.139\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In this case, there is evidence that RCI employees were concerned that Plaintiffs posed a risk to themselves and others when operating in an understaffed prison kitchen. (Defs.' Resp. Ex. 22, Schenck Dep. 131:6-10 (expressing concerns that Hopkins might put hot food on someone's hand or upend a tray while working in close quarters with sixty other inmates). Moreover, there is evidence that Plaintiffs have received adequate accommodations by being able to work in the \"blind greeter\" position. On this record, it is a question of fact whether plaintiffs were qualified to work in the kitchen and whether the blind greeter position presents a reasonable modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Plaintiffs are not entitled to Summary Judgment on Claim 6.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Department of Justice regulations proscribe the practice of housing inmates in a discriminatory manner. The regulations state as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   (2) Public entities shall ensure that inmates or detainees with disabilities are housed in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individuals. Unless it is appropriate to make an exception, a public entity-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   (i) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in inappropriate security classifications because no accessible cells or beds are available;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   (iii) Shall not place inmates or detainees with disabilities in facilities that do not offer the same programs as the facilities where they would otherwise be housed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.152\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(i), (iii), and (iv).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In this case, there is no dispute that RCI is the Department's designated facility for the blind and that it lacks certain programs and opportunities available at other facilities. Nevertheless, there are factual questions at issue. There is evidence that Hopkins requested to stay at RCI; that Wilson requested to leave Dorsey Run; that James was placed in a minimum security prison; and that Delano could not stay at Patuxent because of safety concerns. The jury must resolve factual disputes concerning whether it was \"appropriate\" to house inmates in RCI because it offered at least some specialized assistance for blind inmates. The \"appropriateness\" of this decision must be based upon resolutions of other factual disputes, including the degree to which RCI provided reasonable accommodations to blind inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In sum, there are numerous factual issues that raise genuine issues of material fact to be addressed at trial.
