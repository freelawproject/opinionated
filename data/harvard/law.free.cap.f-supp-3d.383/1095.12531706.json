Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Dr. Ogisu's opinion regarding Plaintiff's standing/walking limitations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 28, 2014, Dr. Ogisu performed a consultative examination of Plaintiff at the request of the ALJ. Tr. 60-61, 365-69. Dr. Ogisu found, among other things, that Plaintiff could sit, stand, and walk \"up to at least half the time but less than 6 hours\" in an eight-hour workday. Tr. 369. He also indicated Plaintiff is capable of \"standing and walking combined for up to less than 6 hours.\" Tr. 369.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The ALJ assessed Plaintiff's RFC for light work and concluded Plaintiff can \"sit, stand, and walk 6 hours each in an 8-hour workday.\" Tr. 23. The ALJ gave \"some weight\" to Dr. Ogisu's opinion, \"but only to the extent that it was consistent with the overall evidence of record.\" Tr. 35. The ALJ also stated Dr. Ogisu's opinion regarding Plaintiff's limitations was based on Plaintiff's \"unusual clinical presentation during her examination, which was notably inconsistent with her presentation to other treating and examining clinicians\"; was \"inconsistent with his own clinical findings\"; and was \"inconsistent with the [Plaintiff's] reported activities.\" Tr. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Dr. Ogisu's opinion is supported by other evidence in the record.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The ALJ found Dr. Ogisu's opinion that Plaintiff could only sit, stand, and walk for four to six hours a day was inconsistent with other evidence in the record. The ALJ did not cite to any evidence in the record that contradicted Dr. Ogisu's opinion. In fact, the Court finds the record supports Dr. Ogisu's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In February 2014 Martin Kehrli, M.D., a state-agency consultant, opined Plaintiff could stand and/or walk for a total of two hours in an eight-hour workday. Tr. 105. In July 2014 Neal Berner, M.D., another state-agency consultant, opined Plaintiff could stand and/or walk for a total of four hours in an eight-hour workday. Tr. 117. In May 2016 Raymond Nolan, M.D., an examining physician, indicated Plaintiff \"should be able to stand and/or walk less than two hours\" in an eight-hour workday. Tr. 640. In summary, Dr. Berner imposed limitations at least equal to Dr. Ogisu's opinion regarding Plaintiff's ability to stand and/or to walk, and Drs. Kehrli and Nolan imposed greater limitations than Dr. Ogisu on Plaintiff's ability to stand and/or to walk. Thus, the Court finds each of these doctors imposed limitations on Plaintiff's ability to walk and/or to stand that are greater than the limitations found by the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based on this record the Court finds Dr. Ogisu's opinion that Plaintiff was limited to standing and to walking combined for up to six hours was consistent with some of the medical evidence in the record, and the ALJ's opinion that Plaintiff could stand and/or walk for six hours in an eight-hour workday is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Dr. Ogisu's Examination of Plaintiff.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The ALJ also stated Dr. Ogisu's opinion regarding Plaintiff's limitations was based on Plaintiff's \"unusual clinical presentation during her examination, which was notably inconsistent with her presentation to other treating and examining clinicians.\" Tr. 640. Dr. Ogisu indicated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   With toe walking, [Plaintiff] is unable to stay up on the right side. Heel walking is done a few steps at a time due to unsteadiness. She complains of lower back pain. Tandem walking is moderately unsteady and results in a loss of balance every few steps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Tr. 367. To support his conclusion, the ALJ cited a July 2015 emergency-room record indicating Plaintiff \"routinely ambulated with a normal, steady, unassisted gate.\" Tr. 35, 602. A nurse's note for that visit reflected Plaintiff walked \"to and from restroom, steady gait, tolerated well.\" Tr. 606. A single incident showing Plaintiff was able to walk to the restroom, however, does not provide clear and convincing support for the ALJ's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Dr. Ogisu's Clinical Findings.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The ALJ also stated Dr. Ogisu's opinion was \"inconsistent with his own clinical findings.\" Tr. 35. The ALJ relied on Dr. Ogisu's observation that Plaintiff did not have any difficulty getting on and off the examination table or moving between sitting, standing, and supine positions. Tr. 35, 366.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Dr. Ogisu's opinion of Plaintiff's limitations, however, was not based solely on Plaintiff's ability to get on and off an examination table, but instead was based on his objective examination and assessment of Plaintiff's entire condition. Tr. 366-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Plaintiff's Activities.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the ALJ stated Dr. Ogisu's opinion was \"inconsistent with the [Plaintiff's] reported activities that she took care of her two grandchildren, who were under age 7, every day for a full 18-month period until March 2015.\" Tr. 35. There is not any evidence in the record, however, to show\n   that Plaintiff was required to stand or to walk in excess of the limitations assessed by Dr. Ogisu in order to care for her grandchildren. \"The critical differences between activities of daily living and activities in a full-time job are that a person has more flexibility in scheduling the former than the latter, can get help from other persons, and is not held to a minimum standard of performance, as she would be by an employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Garrison v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1012\">\n    759 F.3d 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1016 (9th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In summary, on this record the Court concludes the ALJ erred when he rejected Dr. Ogisu's opinion regarding Plaintiff's standing and/or walking limitations because the ALJ did not provide legally sufficient reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dr. Cole's Opinion Regarding Plaintiff's Social Limitations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On May 19, 2016, Dr. Cole performed a consultative psychological examination of Plaintiff. Tr. 626-35. Dr. Cole's examination was specifically requested by the ALJ \"because there's nothing in the record from a treating source discussing psychological function.\" Tr. 50, 60-61. Dr. Cole reviewed Plaintiff's medical records and diagnosed Plaintiff with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), recurrent episode-severe; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), without dissociative symptoms; and Panic Disorder. Tr. 630, 634. In the Medical Source Statement for the examination, Dr. Cole indicated Plaintiff would be moderately impaired in all types of social interactions and would be markedly impaired in responding appropriately to \"usual\" work situations. Tr. 628.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The ALJ did not include any limitations in his evaluation of Plaintiff's RFC related to Plaintiff's interactions with others in the workplace even though he gave Dr. Cole's opinion \"some weight.\" Tr. 24,35. The ALJ pointed out that Dr. Cole's examination was performed approximately five months after Plaintiff's date last insured, that Plaintiff's self-reported symptoms described to Dr. Cole were not reported to other treating providers or supported by other evidence in the record, and that Dr. Cole's assessment is inconsistent with his own clinical examination that showed Plaintiff had average immediate memory capability and above average delayed memory ability. Tr. 21-22, 35. The ALJ did not identify any inconsistency between Dr. Cole's assessed social limitations and his clinical findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The record, however, supports Dr. Cole's opinion regarding Plaintiff's interpersonal limitations. For example, a medical report in January 2015 notes Plaintiff became angry at a medical assistant, yelled at her, and threatened her because Plaintiff thought the medical assistant was \"smirking\" at her. Tr. 542. In July 2015 Plaintiff also received a referral for a mental-health assessment based on her tearful and anxious behavior during an emergency-room visit. Tr. 606. Plaintiff later received a mental-health assessment, which indicated a history of depression and anxiety due to the effects of past trauma and included a diagnosis of MDD and PTSD at that time. Tr. 608-10, 612. These records support Dr. Cole's assessment of Plaintiff's mental-health limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on this record the Court concludes the ALJ erred when she rejected Dr. Cole's opinion regarding Plaintiff's mental-health limitations because the ALJ did not provide legally sufficient reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The ALJ erred at Step Five when she determined Plaintiff could perform other work.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff contends the ALJ erred at Step Five when she failed to identify substantial\n   evidence in the record to show that Plaintiff could perform other work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As noted, if the Commissioner reaches Step Five, she must determine whether the claimant is able to do other work that exists in the national economy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(v).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Keyser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739941\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/721/#p724\">\n    648 F.3d at 724-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Commissioner may satisfy this burden through the testimony of a VE or by reference to the Medical-Vocational Guidelines (or the grids) set forth in the regulations at 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart P, appendix 2. If the Commissioner meets this burden, the claimant is not disabled.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The ALJ's Hypotheticals Posed to the VE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The ALJ posed hypotheticals to the VE at the second hearing. The first hypothetical was based only on the physical limitations assessed in Plaintiff's RFC and did not include any limitation that Plaintiff only \"can understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions consistent with work classified at SVP level 2.\" Tr. 24, 86-87. The VE testified a person with the physical limitations identified by the ALJ could not perform Plaintiff's past work. Tr. 87. The VE, however, testified there were three jobs consistent with the ALJ's hypothetical: telemarketer, usher, and furniture-rental consultant. Tr. 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The ALJ added to her second hypothetical a limitation for occasional handling, fingering, and feeling. Tr. 90. The VE testified such a limitation would eliminate the telemarketer occupation, but it would allow work as a surveillance-system monitor and an election worker. Tr. 90-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In her third hypothetical the ALJ included the limitation to \"understand, remember and carry out simple instructions in a setting that did not require public contact, [and] did not require teamwork.\" Tr. 91. The VE testified a person with this additional limitation would be able to perform only the surveillance-system monitor occupation. Tr. 91. The VE, however, specifically excluded the occupations of telemarketer, usher, and furniture rental-consultant based on the \"no public contact\" limitation. Tr. 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Based on Plaintiff's age, education, vocational background, and RFC, the ALJ concluded Plaintiff could perform other work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. Tr. 37-38. Specifically, the ALJ found Plaintiff could perform the occupations of telemarketer, usher, and furniture-rental consultant. Tr. 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The ALJ Erred in Her Hypotheticals to the VE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court has concluded the ALJ erred when she evaluated Plaintiff's RFC and disregarded Dr. Cole's opinion regarding Plaintiff's limitations as to social interaction and public contact. The ALJ, therefore, erred when she determined Plaintiff could perform the jobs of telemarketer, usher, and furniture-rental consultant, which are jobs the VE testified Plaintiff would not be able to perform if she had limitations as to social interaction and public contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff also contends the \"simple instruction\" limitation included in Plaintiff's RFC is in conflict with Reasoning Level 3 required for each of the positions identified by the ALJ except the usher occupation. Plaintiff relies on the Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Zavalin v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   that there is \"an apparent conflict between the RFC to perform\n   simple, repetitive tasks, and the demands of Level 3 reasoning.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051147\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/842/#p847\">\n    778 F.3d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847 (9th Cir. 2015). Nevertheless, the Commissioner contends any error was harmless because \"at least two of the occupations identified by the [VE] did not require more than SVP 2 level work.\" The Commissioner, however, compares apples to oranges. As a California district court has noted, Reasoning Level and SVP are separate vocational considerations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Other courts decided that, contrary to the Commissioner's argument here, the SVP level in a DOT listing indicating unskilled work, does not address whether a job entails only simple, repetitive tasks.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucy v.

Aug. 25, 2004). A job's SVP is focused on \"the amount of lapsed time\" it takes for a typical worker to learn the job's duties. DOT at 1009. A job's reasoning level, by contrast, gauges the minimal ability a worker needs to complete the job's tasks themselves. As one court noted, \"SVP ratings speak to the issue of the level of vocational preparation necessary to perform the job, not directly to the issue of a job's simplicity, which appears to be more squarely addressed by the GED [reasoning level] ratings.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall-Grover v.

Although the ALJ included the \"simple instructions\" limitation in the third hypothetical, it appears the VE's response that a person could perform only the surveillance-system monitor occupation was based on the limitation of \"no public contact.\" There was not, however, any discussion by the ALJ or the VE regarding the required Reasoning Level for each of the occupations identified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Zavalin\n   </em>\n   and because Reasoning Levels do not equate to SVPs, it is unclear whether a person with a limitation as to \"simple instructions\" could perform occupations identified by the ALJ that have a Reasoning Level of 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Based on this record the Court concludes the ALJ erred at Step Five when she found Plaintiff could perform the occupations of telemarketer, usher, and furniture-rental consultant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     REMAND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court must determine whether to remand this matter for further proceedings or to remand for the calculation of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The decision whether to remand for further proceedings or for immediate payment of benefits generally turns on the likely utility of further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1179.
