Cass's position as athletic director of the Wayland Public Schools. Cass asserts that his contract was\n   not renewed in retaliation for his bringing Title IX concerns about gender equity and questionable budgetary and fundraising practices in Wayland's sports programs to school officials' attention. Cass also claims he was arrested and prosecuted for not returning a used school laptop in retaliation for his exercise of his First Amendment rights. Defendants contend that he was not renewed for entirely performance-driven reasons. Cass has sued the Town of Wayland, and other institutional and individual defendants, alleging: unlawful retaliation and discrimination in violation of Title IX (Count I); unlawful retaliation and termination in violation of the Massachusetts Whistleblower Act (Count II); malicious prosecution (Count III); intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count IV); violations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7 11H (Count V); defamation (Count VI); and intentional interference with contractual relations (Count VII). Defendants move for summary judgment on all counts. After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' motion (Docket No. 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     First Year (2013-2014)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the spring of 2013, Stephen F. Cass applied to be the athletic director for the Wayland Public Schools (\"WPS\") in Wayland, Massachusetts. During the interview, Dr. Paul Stein, superintendent of WPS, told Cass about the \"need to tighten up on the athletic budget a little bit.\" Docket No. 96-1 at 5. Cass signed a 1-year employment contract for the 2013-2014 school year on July 31, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   John Ritchie served as Wayland High School (\"WHS\") interim principal for the 2013-2014 school year. An ongoing source of tension between the athletic coaches and Cass was the athletic department's budget and the school's fundraising policy for sports teams. Principal Ritchie and Assistant Superintendent Brad Crozier were helpful throughout the fall in supporting Cass's efforts to restrict expenditures. On November 24, 2013, Cass sent Superintendent Stein an email emphasizing his concerns about the imbalance in fundraising between different sports teams, and a resulting disparity in funding between the boys' and girls' sports teams. On January 6, 2014, Cass provided the Wayland School Committee with an overview of some of the fiscal issues facing the athletic department. As reported in the meeting's minutes, Stein \"praised [Cass's] efforts in taking on a vast number of issues related to the athletic program in his first year as Athletic Director.\" Docket No. 81-12 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early February 2014, Assistant Principal Allyson Mizoguchi was chosen as the next principal of WHS, to begin in July 2014. Throughout the spring, Cass continued to meet frequently with school officials concerning fundraising, fiscal issues, and problems with specific coaches. On May 21, 2014, Cass met with Principal Ritchie, Assistant Principal Mizoguchi, and Scott Parseghian - head football coach and another assistant principal at WHS - to review the year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ritchie's term as interim principal ended on June 30, 2014. At that time, Ritchie provided Cass with a generally favorable performance evaluation. He stated that given the challenges Cass faced, \"he did a good job in his first year in many ways, most particularly in beginning to bring order and control to expenditures, and imposing certain restrictions on how monies are spent.\" Docket No. 81-20 at 2. But Ritchie also pointed out two areas where Cass could improve:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The first involves spending significant time trying to build supportive relationships with the coaching staff, and indeed with the teaching staff at the school. The second involves eliciting administrative support for any initiatives, alterations, or restrictions that need to be implemented, so that difficult changes or decisions are not perceived as emanating solely from the Athletic Director.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One part of this, Ritchie continued, was for Cass to work on his \"tendency to see himself as, and then be seen as, the 'new sheriff' in town.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Second Year (2014-2015)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In mid-June 2014, Cass entered into a second 1-year employment contract to serve as the athletic director for the 2014-2015 school year. Like the first contract, the second contract provided that \"[i]f the Superintendent intends to reappoint Stephen Cass at the end of this contract, he will so notify Stephen Cass of that intention before April 1 of the year in which the contract would terminate.\" Docket No. 81-21 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fundraising Guidelines\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Throughout the summer, Cass continued to discuss fiscal concerns about fundraising with now-Principal Mizoguchi. In mid-August, Cass sent an email to select parents of student-athletes to advise them of an informational meeting later that month to discuss, among other things, team fundraising policies. Additionally, at Cass's request, at the beginning of the 2014-2015 school year, Mizoguchi sent a letter to all WHS coaches containing new fundraising guidelines. On September 1, 2014, Cass sent Mizoguchi an email in which he stated that after \"doing a lot of thinking [the past] weekend over the fiscal state of Wayland athletics and [his] role in fixing it,\" he \"realized that [he was] totally alone on an island regarding the issue of fiscal responsibility - at odds with select coaches, schools administrators and ... parents.\" Docket No. 81-28 at 2. Cass told Mizoguchi that he would like a meeting with her, Stein, Parseghian, and a member of the school committee to further discuss his concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Tension with Coaches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the same time, Cass's relationship with some of WHS's coaches was becoming strained. In August, Cass had tense exchanges with Guy Enoch - the WHS girls' soccer coach - and Dave Gavron - the WHS boys' soccer coach. On September 8, 2014, Mizoguchi emailed Crozier and Stein, stating in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I am struggling with supporting Stephen Cass and could really use a bit of time with either or both of you to get some advice.... [H]e is frustrating some coaches both because of these new practices (coaches are accustomed to having a long leash) and sometimes because of his interpersonal manner. I have mediated two difficult conversations between him and a coach in the last two weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   This is a point of transition for Athletics, and I have tried to understand and support Stephen with many of his ideas for change.... At the same time, I am feeling that I am spending a lot of (too much?) time on Athletics issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Docket No. 81-29 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Two days later, Cass emailed Mizoguchi with additional complaints about Parseghian, Gavron, and Sean Chase - the wrestling coach - because of perceived violations of school policies. Cass also noted Title IX concerns, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   We have three people/programs that have consumed so much of my time and energy over the last two years - football, wrestling, BSoccer ... the old guard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The latter two have been by far the most selfish with their resources, and football works independently of the school and is a walking Title IX violation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Docket No. 81-30 at 4 (alteration in original). On September 12, 2014, Mizoguchi responded to Cass's complaints in part, and expressed her view that his last voicemail to her was a \"rant\" and that his comments about coaches were \"pretty caustic and unproductive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Docket No. 81-31 at 2. She did not appear to address his Title IX statement. Later that evening, Mizoguchi forwarded the email chain to Crozier, stating that she had \"stopped trusting that Stephen's communication can be civil or productive.\" Docket No. 81-32 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C. \"A Walking Title IX Violation\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On September 15, 2014, a WHS parent emailed Cass his thoughts in response to the informational meeting Cass held with select parents in late August. Cass forwarded the parent's email to Stein, Crozier, Mizoguchi, and others stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Hello All,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I am beyond exhausted being the lightening rod for all the fiscal problems in athletics. I did amazing things bringing us close to budget last year - and took lots and lots of abuse from parents and coaches to make that happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   WHS athletics is a walking Title IX violation. The gender inequity is atrocious and has been so for some time. However, I cannot bring fairness and equity to the program by myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   I would like some public support for [sic] the administration and school committee on these issues. Otherwise, this is a losing battle and I'm not going to fight it alone any longer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Thank you,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Stephen Cass\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Docket No. 81-33 at 2. This was the first time Cass raised Title IX concerns with Stein and Crozier, although he had voiced his concerns to Mizoguchi earlier in the month. Stein instructed Crozier to meet with Cass about the allegations. At the time, Crozier oversaw WPS's human resources function, including Title IX complaints. Crozier immediately responded to Cass: \"This is the first time that you are expressing a concern about a Title IX issue. I would like to hear more about the specifics, so that we can officially look into the concern and address any issues. Please set up a meeting with me to discuss ASAP.\" Docket No. 81-33 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the time of Cass's email, the WHS staff handbook included a discrimination policy which instructed that anyone with a Title IX complaint \"shall bring it to the attention of the principal as soon as possible,\" and that \"[t]he principal will investigate the complaint and respond in writing within seven days.\" Docket No. 91-32 at 2. Then, \"[i]f the complaint is not satisfactorily resolved, it may be forwarded to the superintendent or his designee who will investigate the complaint and respond in writing within fourteen days.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Cass and Crozier met on September 18, 2014 to discuss Cass's Title IX concerns. At some point during the meeting, Cass stated that he raised the Title IX concerns to \"cover [his] ass.\" Docket No. 79-3 at 178:11-19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 92 \u00b6 54. Cass explained that he \"was putting Mr. Crozier on notice that if they fire me for upholding gender equity, they would be in violation of the law.\" Docket No. 91-1 \u00b6 99. When Crozier asked Cass about specific data or instances to support his allegations, Cass provided an excel sheet he maintained detailing expenditures broken-out by sports team, but not cost per athlete. On October 9, 2014, Crozier emailed\n   Cass to follow-up on the meeting. His email stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Thank you for meeting with me on 9/18 regarding an email you sent .... Several days have past and I wanted to be sure that you were clear that I was expecting some follow-up from the meeting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   At the meeting you provided me with some general accounting expenses to support the claim of inequity. I asked for more background on the expenditures ... specifically, historical data by sport for both boys and girls broken out by cost per athlete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In our meeting, you indicated that the Title IX claim was more to protect your job, never the less, now that you have raised the concern, I want to be assured that the concerns are addressed .... I would even suggest we seek a third party to review the data and your concerns. Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Docket No. 81-34 at 3. Cass did not respond to this email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On October 28, 2014, Cass emailed Mizoguchi expressing concern about the Henley Foundation providing the boys' golf team, which had won the state tournament, with jackets because \"[i]t's part of the gender equity piece that is still problematic and part of the need for things to flow through the athletic office and not have too many things done independently.\" Docket No. 81-39 at 2. Mizoguchi responded: \"Got it. Add it to the list.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The school department's outside counsel, Attorney Gini Tate, presented a ninety-minute Title IX training on November 4, 2014. Crozier, Mizoguchi, and Cass all attended the training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Throughout the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015, Cass continued to experience tension with some of WHS's coaches on non-gender-related issues. For example, he sparred with the football coach, Parseghian, concerning the cancellation of the Thanksgiving Day football game due to snow and with the wrestling coach, Chase, about transportation costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Evaluation and Non-Renewal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Around February 12, 2015, Mizoguchi provided Cass with a verbal performance evaluation. On March 31, 2015, Cass emailed Mizoguchi a document titled \"Wayland Athletic Concerns,\" stating, \"I feel it is important for me to put all things in writing going forward since I have been the subject of so many false accusations by the school administration over the past few weeks.\" Docket No. 81-46 at 2. The document, addressed to Mizoguchi and Stein, began: \"I want to put a number of things in writing regarding my 20 months in Wayland. I am extremely frustrated with my role as athletic director; most specifically by the fact that I am constantly excluded from many of the most important decisions pertaining to athletics.\" Docket No. 91-25 at 4. Cass proceeded to list fourteen ongoing issues he had with Wayland athletics, many of which dealt with fundraising. The sixth issue specifically stated: \"There is a significant gender equity issue in athletics resulting from fundraising and gifts received from outside agencies that support our athletic program.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Superintendent Stein did not notify Cass whether he was intending to renew Cass's employment contract prior to April 1, 2015 as specified in the contract. On April 1, 2015, Mizoguchi recorded notes in her day planner - as she typically did - related to meetings she had throughout the day. On that date, she wrote the words \"whistleblower,\" \"Title 9 issue?\" and \"May 1 letter\" in relation to Cass. Docket No. 91-7 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On April 8, 2015, Mizoguchi held a meeting with Stein, Crozier, Parseghian, and Assistant Principal Ethan Dolleman to discuss whether to renew Cass's employment contract. After the meeting, Mizoguchi emailed her friend, Wayne Ogden, and stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Good meeting today in the sense that we're all in synch. It also became clear that, although it is ultimately my decision, everyone thinks that the dude should go for a host of legitimate reasons. I really feel like Judas here. The next couple of weeks will be all about crafting my evaluation, meeting with him initially (probably early next week, with Ethan [Dolleman] ), and then meeting for a final time, probably with Brad [Crozier]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Docket No. 91-26 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On April 13, 2015, Crozier emailed Tate with a draft of Mizoguchi's evaluation, writing: \"I wanted your thoughts on Allyson's evaluation of the [Athletic Director]. There are similarities between this Eval and last year's Eval. The plan is to give the Eval on May 1st and non-renew later in May.\" Docket No. 81-50 at 2. Mizoguchi met with Cass on April 15, 2015 and provided him with his performance evaluation. While Mizoguchi praised Cass as \"extremely hard-working and dedicated when it comes to the varied demands of the position,\" she also noted that \"[t]he overarching theme of concern is Mr. Cass's leadership approach, which in style and substance has frequently been ineffective.\" Docket No. 91-8 at 2. Mizoguchi quoted the \"new sheriff\" observation from Cass's prior performance evaluation, and also stated that \"[s]ome of his relationships with coaches are adversarial and have required the involvement of another administrator in order to reach a comfortable understanding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mizoguchi was specifically thinking of Cass's relationship with Parseghian, Chase, Gavron, and Enoch. \"Lastly,\" Mizoguchi wrote, \"Cass's volatility in his personal conduct has been of concern.... It is for these reasons that I am uncertain whether to renew Mr. Cass's contract for the 2015-2016 school year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On April 24, 2015, Cass emailed Stein about the performance evaluation. He wrote, in part: \"I felt the majority of points [Mizoguchi] made regarding me and my ability were inaccurate and was quite stunned to learn that my future as Wayland athletic director is not secure.\" Docket No. 91-28 at 3. Stein, on the advice of counsel, asked Cass to put his concerns in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On May 5, 2015, Cass sent a six-page letter to Stein detailing his various complaints. He began by recalling the interview process and how Stein had told Cass that \"the budget need[ed] to be tightened up,\" but did not disclose that the athletic department exceeded its budget by $ 60,000 the prior year. Docket No. 91-29 at 3. Cass stated that \"had people on the search committee been transparent about the magnitude of the fiscal issues\" he \"would not have accepted the position.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Cass went on to state that Mizoguchi's evaluation of him was \"blatantly false\" because he had \"a wonderful working relationship with almost every coach at Wayland\" with the exception of three outlier coaches \"who had built up their mini-empires over time and were not interested in fiscal responsibility or constraints on their way of doing things.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Cass specifically mentioned in the letter that football coach Parseghian, \"publicly opposed measures designed to promote fiscal responsibility, preserve gender equity, and require ethical fundraising.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, under the heading \"Gender Equity\" Cass wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   When I arrived, athletic funds were not being disbursed in a fair or equitable\n   manner. As mentioned, football and wrestling were travelled excessively, and girls did not receive fair treatment (for example, there were not enough girls track uniforms - the girls had to share uniforms). Since I arrived, I have purchased badly needed uniforms for many girls teams: [list of ten teams].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Despite my efforts, gender equity has not been achieved. This is a result of fundraising that has directed a disproportionate amount of funds into the coffers of boys teams. In addition, funds from the Steve Henley Foundation (an athletic fundraising organization) have ended up mostly with boys teams. During my time at Wayland, this organization has purchased championship jackets for golf, boys soccer, hockey, and wrestling (I'm told but not confirmed). No girls team has received championship jackets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   I instituted an athletic department policy to prevent teams from accepting outside funding, but the boys soccer and wrestling coaches have ignored this policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   I have issued complaints about this inequity through emails to Wayland administrators - in 9/2014 and 4/2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Three days later, on May 8, 2015, Stein formally advised Cass, via letter, that WPS would not be renewing Cass's contract for another year. The letter did not list a specific reason for the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Letter to Wayland School Committee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On May 19, 2015, Cass sent a letter to the Wayland School Committee reiterating his concerns previously expressed to Mizoguchi and Stein. Cass focused on WPS's \"long-standing fiscal problem\" and alleged that the behavior of some coaches ranged \"from unethical to blatantly illegal.\" Docket No. 81-56 at 2. Cass, speaking about the fiscal reforms he implemented, wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   As a result of these efforts, I experienced furious pushback from three coaches of boys' teams, and a lack of support from the principal.

Subsequently, Tate sent a copy of Cass's May 19 letter to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, the Office of the Inspector General, the State Ethics Commission, the Massachusetts Attorney General, and the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (\"OCR\"). OCR responded on September 24, 2015 that it could not move forward with a formal investigation without a signed consent form from Cass. Cass never provided a signed form. He eventually filed a complaint with OCR in the spring of 2016 but decided not to pursue the claim on advice of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In a follow-up meeting on June 22, 2015, the Wayland School Committee concluded that the decision not to renew Cass's contract fell within the purview of the Superintendent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     End of Employment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On June 7, 2015, while he was still an employee, Cass met two unidentified high school kids around WHS and arranged to meet them at a liquor store in Wayland. Cass paid them to distribute approximately one hundred fliers around WHS reading \"STEIN/CROZIER/FRAUD/THE 3 AMIGOS.\" Docket No. 92 \u00b6 89. The fliers were investigated by the Wayland Police Department (\"WPD\"), but no charges were filed. On June 12, 2015, Cass ran into Ritchie in the WHS parking lot. Ritchie described Cass's demeanor as \"an uncontrolled rage\" and suggested to Mizoguchi that she consider putting a safety plan in place. Docket No. 81-6 \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On June 16, 2015, Reid Lyons - the human resources director for WPS - emailed Crozier to let him know that Cass's last day would be June 23, 2015. Later that day, Crozier emailed Susan Ginsberg - a systems administrator for WPS - to ask what equipment had been issued to Cass. Ginsberg responded, \"Stephen has 2 laptops (macbook pro and macbook). I have asked Keith [Clevenger] to verify that.\" Docket No. 81-60 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On June 17, Lyons emailed Cass to follow-up, stating: \"Now that we agree next Tuesday June 23rd is your last day can you come to my office around three and drop off your computers, ID badge and your keys?\" Docket No. 81-61 at 2. And the next day, on June 18, Wayland IT Technician Keith Clevenger emailed Cass to retrieve laptop WPS08204, a white macbook that had been loaned to Cass in February 2014 as a replacement machine while his school-issued MacBook Pro was being repaired. Cass did not reply to Clevenger's email. The parties dispute whether IT Specialist Mary Barber told Cass in the summer of 2014 that he could keep the loaner laptop, WPS08204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, on the afternoon of June 23, on Cass's last day, Crozier asked Cass about failing to drop-off his laptops, keys, and ID badge with Reid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 96-1 at 225:6-9. Cass responded that he told Reid he would drop his things off the next day, but Crozier asked him to return the items that afternoon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 225:12-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Crozier Dep.

According to Cass, Crozier specifically asked about a second MacBook Pro and Cass said he had stepped on it. At the time, Cass did not offer that he still had the laptop WPS08204, the loaner computer, because he did not \"even think about any other computer.\" Docket No. 91-1 \u00b6 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Summer of 2015 and Arrest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Interactions with Parents and School Officials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Beginning in August 2015, several incidents involving Cass were reported to the Wayland Police Department (\"WPD\"). First, on August 14, Cass sent two emails to James Lampert, the father of a WHS student, who had supported the school administration during Cass's nonrenewal. In the emails, Cass pretended to be Lampert's son's lacrosse coach contacting coaches at Colgate University and other NESCAC schools. The emails stated: \"Basically, [the son] is not D1 player even though he may have been advertised as\n   such.... Plus, throw in character issues and a very high-maintenance father, and it is a recipe for failure.\" Docket No. 81-65 at 7. Cass did not actually send either email to any college lacrosse coach. Lampert also received a note in his mailbox he believed came from Cass stating, \"Payback is a bitch.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 81-69, 81-70, 81-71. Lampert reported these incidents to the WPD, which assigned Detective Sergeant Jamie Berger to investigate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, on August 24, Cass drove to Camp Caribou in Winslow, Maine to watch the WHS football team. Cass suspected the team of violating Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (\"MIAA\") rules. After gaining access to private property, and without consent from the team, students, or parents, Cass took photos of the students' football practice and saved the photos to a flash drive to show to the MIAA. When Cass learned that the WPD was involved, he disposed of the photos. Chief of Police Robert Irving received emails from parents complaining that Cass had taken photos of their children without permission and assigned the case to Detective Berger. Berger spoke with Cass about the incident on September 8, 2015. It was the one and only interaction between Cass and Detective Berger prior to Cass's arrest on October 26, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Third, on August 27, Cass created fliers with \"Fire GAV\" on them - in reference to Gavron, the boys' soccer coach. He enlisted his brother, David Cass, to distribute them in the WHS parking lot early that morning before athletic team practices. Witnesses, believing it was Stephen Cass who distributed the fliers, reported the incident to the WPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Fourth, on August 28, Cass went to the WPS's offices where he spoke with Stein. The parties dispute how confrontational the interaction was, but Stein reported the interaction to Chief Irving, and shortly thereafter the court issued a no-trespass order against Cass. After these incidents, Chief Irving was \"concerned about the number of things that were occurring with Mr. Cass and whether or not this could escalate into more of a problem than there already was.\" Docket No. 79-4 at 46:2-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On October 22, 2015, WPS Systems Administrator Ginsberg emailed Crozier that she had been \"looking through computer inventory and found that Stephen Cass' macbook (the one never turned in) is still active and that it is showing a location of Woodland Rd (Stephen lives on Woodland Rd).\" Docket No. 81-75 at 12. Ginsberg provided screen shots of the macbook's location and activity log, and asked Crozier how to proceed. The screen shots indicated that for laptop WPS08204, the \"Last Inventory Update\" had been performed on October 21, 2015 at 11:05 PM, and the last time Cass had logged in was on October 19, 2015 at 1:49 PM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Chief Irving, Stein, and Crozier discussed the laptop at a meeting that afternoon. Chief Irving was informed that WPS had issued a loaner laptop to Cass, which WPS had asked Cass to return at the end of his employment, but that he had not returned it. Irving also learned that inventory software had located the missing macbook at Cass's home. Chief Irving suggested that the police could investigate. Stein reported the computer as stolen, and subsequently, Irving assigned the matter to Detective Berger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On Monday, October 26, 2015, Detective Berger met with Crozier, Ginsberg, Clevenger, and others at WHS. School staff provided Berger with the email messages between Cass and school officials described above, and location information for laptop WPS08204. Relying on this information, Berger prepared an affidavit in support\n   of an application for a search warrant and sent the application to the Middlesex District Attorney's office, as was standard practice, which approved the application. The clerk magistrate of the Framingham District Court approved and signed the warrant that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Detective Berger served the search warrant at Cass's home on October 26, 2015. When Cass answered the door, Detective Berger explained his presence, and Cass directed Berger to the laptop on the couch. The computer was marked with a tag reading \"PROPERTY OF WAYLAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS/WPS08204.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 81-78, 81-79. Detective Berger took possession of the laptop and placed Cass under arrest for possession of stolen property and larceny of an item valued over $ 250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   After the arrest, Berger returned to WPD where another officer booked Cass. Berger issued a press release which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   On Monday, October 26, 2015, the Wayland Public School District reported that an employee no longer employed by the district was believed to be in possession of a computer owned by the district. The Wayland Police Department conducted an investigation, was issued a search warrant and recovered the stolen computer. Subsequently, Stephen F. Cass of Wayland was arrested and charged with [larceny over $ 250 and receiving stolen property over $ 250].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Docket No. 81-80 at 2. Berger faxed the press release to a pre-set list of local media outlets. He provided a copy of Cass's booking photograph to one reporter from the MetroWest Daily News upon request. Berger also posted a copy of the press release and booking photo to the WPD Facebook page. Chief Irving was away at this time due to a death in the family; when he returned to Wayland the next day, he requested that Berger take down the Facebook post. This was not the first time the WPD had posted about an arrest on its Facebook page, although posting was infrequent. Prior to trial, the charge of receiving stolen property over $ 250 was dropped, and the felony charge of larceny over $ 250 was reduced to a misdemeanor. The trial resulted in a directed verdict for Cass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Cass told school officials that Wayland athletics was a \"walking Title IX violation\" in September 2014, and later sent two letters sent on March 31, 2015 and May 5, 2015. In his March 31 letter to Stein and Mizoguchi, Cass wrote, \"[t]here is a significant gender equity issue in athletics resulting from fundraising and gifts received from outside agencies that support our athletic program.\" Docket No. 91-25 at 4. The next day, Mizoguchi wrote in reference to Cass, \"whistleblower,\" \"Title 9 issue?\" and \"May 1 letter.\" Docket No. 91-7 at 2. Within a week, on April 8, school officials decided not to renew him. On May 5, Cass wrote Stein a long letter which included complaints about gender equity. Three days later, Stein sent Cass a formal letter indicating that WPS would not be hiring him for a third year.

Here, there are disputed issues of fact that preclude summary judgment. One reasonable inference is that school officials perceived Cass to be a whistleblower, who called a foul on the way certain boys teams were funded. The timing of the non-renewal followed multiple complaints about gender equity. Cass claims that he had good relationships with most coaches, and that the performance evaluation unfairly relied on opinions from specific coaches who were most resistant to Cass's reforms and who were the main cause of WPS's gender equity problems. While Defendants have produced evidence of unprofessional, angry behavior on the part of Cass, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to him, the Court concludes there is a disputed question as to the motive for the nonrenewal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718898\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/25/#p33\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718898\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/25/#p33\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Courts should be especially cautious before granting summary judgment when pretext and retaliatory animus are at issue.\").
