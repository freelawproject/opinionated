Defendant emphasizes that the private cause of action of ORS \u00a7 652.615 allows a victorious plaintiff to collect \"actual damages or $ 200, whichever is greater.\" Defendant argues that the statute does not allow \"$ 200 per violation\" and that the Court may not read language into the statute that is not already there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Portland Gen. Elec. Co. v. Bureau of Labor and Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210090\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/317/606/#p611\">\n    317 Or. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2210090\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/317/606/#p611\">\n    859 P.2d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff argues that language expressly allowing $ 200 per violation is not necessary, because the statute already provides that there is \"a private cause of action for\n   <em>\n    a violation\n   </em>\n   of ORS 652.610(3).\" ORS \u00a7 652.615 (emphasis added). Plaintiff asserts that the use of the singular \"violation\" and the article \"a\" must mean that a victorious plaintiff may collect $ 200 for each \"violation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landsem Farms, LP v. Marion Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"696456\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/190/120/#p127\">\n    190 Or. App. 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"696504,696456\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/78/103/\">\n    78 P.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (stating that a reviewing court may consider whether the legislature used a noun in the singular or plural).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court is unconvinced that the singular usage of \"violation\" in the statute is reflective of the legislature's intent to make the $ 200 penalty available \"per\" violation. It is equally plausible that the legislature did not wish to use the plural \"violations\" because doing so would wrongly suggest that a cause of action was only available to a plaintiff whose employer violated ORS \u00a7 652.610(3) multiple times, or at least more than once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court also finds the Plaintiff's emphasis on the statute's use of the article \"a\" preceding \"violation\" to be unpersuasive. Although Plaintiff is correct that the article \"a\" may be used to indicate one in number, as in \"I own\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   dog and two cats,\" the article may also be used to indicate any non-specified member of a group or category, as in \"this conduct is\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   violation of the statute.\" The latter usage is not necessarily intended to indicate only one in number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The statute that ORS \u00a7 652.615 references, ORS \u00a7 652.610(3), further confuses the issue. Although ORS \u00a7 652.615 creates a cause of action for \"a violation\" of ORS \u00a7 652.610(3), at least one prohibited category of deduction is described using the plural form: \"An employer may not withhold, deduct or divert any portion of an employee's wages unless ... (b) The\n   <em>\n    deductions\n   </em>\n   are voluntarily authorized in writing by the employee, are for the employee's benefit and\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   recorded in the employer's books.\" ORS \u00a7 652.610(3) (emphases added). If the Court were strictly to construe the statutory use of plural and singular nouns as dispositive of how to define a violation and its penalty, then at least one type of singular \"violation\" of ORS \u00a7 652.610(3) would only be triggered by multiple wrongful deductions. Ultimately, the Court finds that the statutory language is not clear, so the Court must turn to the statute's legislative history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Legislative History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant cites the precursor to ORS \u00a7 652.610 to show that the prior version of the wrongful deductions law expressly allowed\n   a penalty \"for each offense,\" in contrast to the current statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF 49-6. The 1943 law described the remedy for wrongfully withholding an employee's wages as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Any person, firm, copartnership, association or corporation violating any of the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($ 10.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($ 100.00)\n   <em>\n    for each offense.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1943, Oregon Laws Chapter 434, Section 3 (emphasis added). Defendant argues that this legislative history indicates that the legislature knows how to draft a penalty \"for each offense\" when it intends to do so, and that the modern statute does not. The Court finds this legislative history persuasive, but also notes that the 1943 law described the punishment for \"violating any of the provisions of this act\" rather than the punishment for \"a violation.\" The former is a gerund, or a verbal noun, which does not make clear how many violations the person, firm, or other entity engaged in. In contrast, the modern statute refers to the penalty for \"a violation\" (which in Plaintiff's view means \"per\" violation) of the wrongful deduction statute. The legislative history, therefore, also does not conclusively resolve this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

As a result, Smith is entitled to recover the greater of his actual damages or $ 200.00.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2023537985\">\n    2003 WL 23537985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (citing ORS \u00a7 652.615 ). The\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   decision indicates that multiple \"deductions\" entitle a victorious plaintiff only to an\n   award of either actual damages or a single sum of $ 200. But the Plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   claimed actual damages of $ 2,899.90 and did not request that the court compute damages as $ 200 per wrongful deduction. The issue before this Court, therefore, was never directly considered by the court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , nor is the opinion clear about how many wrongful deductions the plaintiff alleged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (\"Defendants made a number of deductions from the $ 2,500.00 monthly credit due under the Cattle Care Agreement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff argues that a different line of reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   indicates that the court understood the $ 200 in damages to be assessed per violation. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the court \"made multiple awards of 'actual damages or $ 200, whichever is greater,' for\n   <em>\n    multiple\n   </em>\n   different violative deductions.\" ECF 45. Plaintiff notes that the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   plaintiff recovered $ 2,899.90 for payroll costs deducted from his wages (actual damages); $ 5,650.00 for cash deductions from labor credit (actual damages); $ 147.48 for Forest Service overcharges (actual damages); and $ 200 for cattle charges (no actual damages because cattle charges were already repaid by the defendant).\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2023537985\">\n    2003 WL 23537985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-10. All of the actual damages and the $ 200 statutory damage for cattle charges were recovered under ORS \u00a7 652.615. Plaintiff concludes by arguing that \"if damages had been aggregated among the several violations, as ABM urges, then Smith could not have recovered $ 200 for the cattle charge deductions-his aggregate actual damages were already far more than $ 200.\" ECF 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court disagrees. The court in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was not allowing $ 200 or actual damages to be collected \"for multiple different violative deductions,\" as Plaintiff asserts; instead, the court was allowing $ 200 or actual damages to be collected for multiple\n   <em>\n    categories\n   </em>\n   of violative deductions. As Defendant correctly notes, the fact that the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   plaintiff was awarded the statutory penalty of $ 200 for cattle charges despite not having any actual damages does not support Plaintiff's interpretation of the statute. If Plaintiff's interpretation of the court's view in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   were correct, the court would have awarded the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   plaintiff a $ 200 penalty for every pay period with a deduction taken over the 13.5 month period relating to the plaintiff's son's cattle. The\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   court did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court is bound when the supreme court of the state has decided a question of state law.\n   <em>\n    Erie R.
