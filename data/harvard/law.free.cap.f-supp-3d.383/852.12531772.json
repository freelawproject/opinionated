In this particular case, Plaintiff, the Liquidating Trustee for one of Petters's now-defunct companies, Petters Company Inc. (\"PCI\"), seeks to \"avoid,\" or \"claw back,\" approximately four million dollars of interest payments, or \"transfers,\" received by Defendants Steve Papadimos and Chris M. Kanios during the heyday of Petters's scheme,\n  <em>\n   i.e.\n  </em>\n  , 1997 to 2006, on grounds that those interest payments (and the promissory notes underlying the payments) were made directly in furtherance of Petters's fraud, and are therefore subject to \"claw back\" under the Trustee's interpretation of the Minnesota Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (\"MUFTA\"). Because the Court agreed with the Trustee's interpretation of MUFTA during a November 2018 jury trial the Court conducted in a companion case to this one,\n  <em>\n   see\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Kelley v. Boosalis\n  </em>\n  , No. 18-cv-868 (SRN/TNL),\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206322631\">\n   2018 WL 6322631\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (D. Minn. Dec. 3, 2018), and because the Trustee believes there are no material facts in dispute that would warrant another jury trial here, the Trustee now moves for summary judgment.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Defendants not only oppose the motion, but argue that\n  <em>\n   they\n  </em>\n  , not the Trustee, are the parties entitled to summary judgment. This is so, Defendants argue, because the Court erred in the\n  <em>\n   Boosalis\n  </em>\n  case. And, Defendants continue, were the Court to adopt the \"proper\" interpretation of MUFTA here, the Trustee's case would fail as a matter of law. In the alternative, Defendants also argue that the Court should certify the meaning of certain critical terms under MUFTA to the Minnesota Supreme Court, so that that Court could resolve what Defendants describe as \"unsettled\" questions of state law. Defendants further contend that, at the least, the Trustee's summary judgment motion should be denied on grounds that a jury trial is still needed to resolve genuine disputes of material fact.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  For the reasons explained below, the Court grants the Trustee's summary judgment motion in full. Judgment will accordingly be entered for the Trustee.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Defendants Lend Millions of Dollars to Petters Company, Inc., Between 1997 and 2006, and Receive Millions of Dollars of Interest in Return\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Steve Papadimos and Chris Kanios (collectively, \"Defendants\") are a married\n   couple that live in the suburbs of Toledo, Ohio. Papadimos is a government attorney and Kanios is a physician. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 30 [Doc. No. 110-3] (\"Kanios Dep.\") at 6-7.) At some point in 1997, Papadimos heard about an investment opportunity with a Minneapolis businessman named Tom Petters, and, more specifically, with a \"diverting\" business that Petters was running with consumer goods. In short, Papadimos believed, Petters needed Papadimos's money so that Petters could buy large lots of older, unsold consumer goods from wholesalers, and then re-sell, or \"divert,\" those goods to retailers at a substantial profit. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Ex. 23 [Doc. No. 110-2] (\"Papadimos Dep. I\") at 46-47 (Q: What did you think were funding? A: Oh, that I was lending money... there would be promissory notes, and that Petters, PCI was buying distressed goods, bankruptcy goods, liquidated goods, and re-selling them.\"). Papadimos also thought that, because Petters was working with \"distressed goods and bankruptcy goods,\" Petters would be generating 40 to 60 percent in \"annual rate[s] of return.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. B. [Doc. No. 105-1] (\"Papadimos Dep. II\") at 17 (describing a conversation he had with one of Petters's associates).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before investing with Petters, though, Papadimos did some due diligence. Among other things, he (a) had a short meeting with Petters in Minneapolis, and, while there, observed that Petters owned actual warehouses and retail stores that had \"thousands of boxes\" inside of them (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Papadimos Dep. II. at 13-14), (b) spoke with Thomas Hays (a well-regarded lawyer who worked with Petters) on multiple occasions, and learned that Hays was confident about Petters's business acumen (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-19), (c) talked to at least one business that Petters had purportedly conducted a merchandise transaction with, Montgomery Ward, and confirmed that a business relationship existed between the two companies (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34, 76), and (d) read articles in the\n   <em>\n    Minneapolis Star-Tribune\n   </em>\n   newspaper about Petters's businesses (thus again confirming the fact that the businesses did exist) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 76, 132).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Consequently, in July 1997, Papadimos decided to begin lending to Petters's wholly-owned company, Petters Company, Inc. (\"PCI\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. J [Doc. No. 105-2] (\"July 8, 1997 Promissory Note\").) Papadimos first lent money to PCI in 30- or 60-day loans, with an annualized interest rate averaging about 38 percent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 22 [Doc. No. 110-2] (\"Martens - Papadimos Tracing Report\") at ECF p. 494.) As time went on, however, Papadimos lent Petters larger sums of money, and often simply \"rolled\" his principal investment from one promissory note to another, so as to keep receiving interest payments without putting any \"new\" money into PCI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 20 [Doc. No. 110-2] (\"Martens - Papadimos Transfers Report\") at ECF p. 445 (showing that Papadimos stopped investing new principal into PCI in 2001).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moreover, in March 2000, Papadimos also convinced his wife, Chris Kanios, to invest some of her personal 401(k) retirement fund with PCI, too, on virtually identical terms to his own loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kanios Dep. at 7-8;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 29 [Doc. No. 110-3] (\"Martens - Kanios Tracing Report\") at ECF p. 54.) Kanios relied entirely on her husband's due diligence, and \"had no understanding of what PCI's business was.\" (Kanios Dep. at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The couple continued to lend money to PCI until 2005, when PCI told them that it only wanted to work with larger-scale investors, like hedge funds, from then on out. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Papadimos Dep. II at 13, 17.) Shortly thereafter, PCI re-paid Defendants their principal investment(s) in full. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Papadimos Dep. I at 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In sum, between July 1997 and March 2006, Papadimos lent $ 3,297,300 to PCI, arising out of at least 87 promissory notes and 115 related \"transactions.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martens - Papadimos Tracing Report \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at n.2 (noting that \"the difference between the 115 transactions and the 87 promissory notes\" arose for \"one of the following reasons\": \"(1) rolling of principal and/or interest on certain notes; (2) multiple interest and/or principal payments on the same note; or (3) reversals due to insufficient funds, uncollected checks, or missing endorsements\").) In return, PCI paid Papadimos $ 3,126,524.37 in interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Similarly, between March 2000 and March 2006, Kanios lent $ 690,000 to PCI, arising out of at least 13 promissory notes and 21 related transactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martens - Kanios Tracing Report \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12.) In return, PCI paid Kanios $ 572,500.22 in interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Kanios Dep. at 14-15 (admitting that she received this amount in interest income).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Notably, during this entire time period, it is undisputed that Defendants believed they were investing in PCI's \"diverting\" business, and in the merchandise purchases and re-sales undergirding that business; they did not believe they were providing general business loans to PCI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 858-59.) In fact, the vast majority of the promissory notes Defendants signed with PCI included a security interest in a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   order of merchandise that PCI had purportedly bought with Defendants' money, as well as in any proceeds from sales of that merchandise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Matens - Papadimos Tracing Report \u00b6 33 (stating that 74 of Papadimos's promissory notes referenced a security agreement and accompanying \"purchase order\" underlying that agreement); Martens - Kanios Tracing Report \u00b6 28 (same, with respect to nine of Kanio's promissory notes).) What's more, these security agreements contained language confirming that the express purpose of Defendants' loans was to allow PCI to purchase, and then re-sell, merchandise,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]his Security Interest is granted to secure payment of funds loaned to [PCI]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   which\n   <em>\n    has enabled or is intended to enable\n   </em>\n   [PCI] to\n   <em>\n    acquire rights in or use of certain merchandise\n   </em>\n   , which the\n   <em>\n    parties understand and anticipate that\n   </em>\n   [PCI]\n   <em>\n    intends to resell as part of its business\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. M [Doc. Nos. 105-3 to 105-4] (\"Defendants' Loan Documentation\") (approximately 100 pages of promissory notes, security agreements, and purchase orders exchanged between PCI and Defendants, all containing materially identical language).) These purchase orders and security agreements constituted an \"important factor\" in encouraging Defendants to invest with PCI. (Papadimos Dep. I at 84.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. In 2008, the Public Learns that PCI Was Actually a Massive, Years-Long Ponzi Scheme, In Which Funds from Investors Like Defendants Were Primarily Used to Re-Pay Other Investors, Rather Than to Finance Legitimate Commercial Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In reality, however, Defendants were not investing in a diverting business, much less in specific merchandise transactions. Rather, Defendants were investing in a Ponzi scheme that maintained only a superficial veneer of a diverting business.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Petters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5882427\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/375/\">\n    663 F.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2011) (providing general background on the now-infamous \"Petters Ponzi Scheme\"). As one of the key participants in this scheme (Deanna Coleman) has repeatedly testified since she first turned state's witness in 2008, including in a lengthy deposition she sat for in this case, \"all of\" the purchase orders attached to Defendants' security agreements were either vastly overstated or fabricated in their entirety. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 13 [Doc. No. 110-1] (\"Coleman Dep. I\") at 88 (\"[I]nvestors [in PCI] never invested in a real transaction with a real purchase order, because every purchase order that [an] investor received or invested in was fake.\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 1 [Doc. No. 110-1] (\"Boosalis Civil Trial Tr.\") at 232 (Coleman); Petters Crim. Trial Tr. at 648 (Coleman).) Instead, Coleman testified, PCI's three principal officers (Coleman, Petters, and a man named Bob White) essentially operated the company as a four-part scam:\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   , PCI would conduct some unprofitable, low-volume diverting business for show (ala a Potemkin village);\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   , Coleman or White would forge purchase orders and bank statements to make investors believe that those low-volume \"Potemkin deals\" were actually high-volume purchases resulting in multi-million dollar sales;\n   <em>\n    next\n   </em>\n   , PCI would use its fake purchase orders (and high promised returns) to solicit \"securitized loans\" from investors like Defendants; and,\n   <em>\n    finally\n   </em>\n   , PCI would use these loans to re-pay\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   investors as\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   loans became due (or to pay expenses otherwise unconnected to PCI's purported diverting business). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Coleman Dep. I;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Boosalis Civil Trial Tr. at 227-33 (Coleman); Petters Crim. Trial Tr. at 632-48 (Coleman).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to Papadimos in particular, Coleman testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q: Do you recall ever speaking to [Papadimos]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: Yeah, I talked to [him].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q: Do you remember what you talked about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A: If [PCI] needed money I might have called him up and asked for two, three million dollars to do a certain deal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q: And at the time you called him to ask him to do a certain deal, were you providing false or misleading invoices at that time?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q: And I think you testified that there was not one legitimate invoice ever used with the small investors,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A: There was no real purchase order ever given to an investor, correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (Coleman Dep. I at 193-94.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At a subsequent deposition, Ms. Coleman further noted that the \"Montgomery Ward\" deal that Papadimos had relied on as part of his due diligence had, in fact, been one of PCI's signature \"Potemkin deals,\" in which Petters (and Coleman) vastly overstated the amount of merchandise PCI had purchased from Montgomery Ward, and then lied about the millions of dollars in \"accounts receivable\" it was \"owed\" from purported \"re-sales\" of that inventory. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 1 [Doc. No. 115-1] (\"Coleman Dep. II\") at 370-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On a more general level, Coleman also testified that she, Petters, and White had been intentionally committing this fraud since 1994. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Coleman Dep. I at 21, 24, 208-09;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Boosalis Civil Trial Tr. at 228 (Coleman); Petters Crim. Trial Tr. at 567, 773-74 (Coleman).) Indeed, shortly after the FBI discovered this scheme, Coleman pled guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 10 [Doc. No. 110-1] (\"Coleman Criminal Judgment\").) White similarly pled guilty to two criminal charges - aiding and abetting mail fraud, and illegal monetary transactions - and testified as such at Petters's criminal trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 11 [Doc. No. 110-1] (\"White Criminal Judgment\"); Petters Crim. Trial Tr. at 1271 (White) (admitting that he forged \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" of merchandise sales to wholesalers that did not in fact occur).) And, perhaps most notably, after a month-long trial, a jury found Petters guilty of 20 criminal charges, including 13 counts of wire fraud and mail fraud, and four counts of money laundering. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 9 [Doc. No. 110-1] (\"Petters Criminal Judgment\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Coleman similarly testified that she, Petters, and White took substantial steps to keep this scheme secret from both investors and other PCI employees, such as by falsifying bank account, profit and loss, and insurance statements. (See Pl.'s Ex. 14 [Doc. No. 110-1] (\"Coleman Dep. II\") at 389-90, 409-10; Petters Crim. Trial Tr. at 1140-41, 1163-66 (White).) PCI's tax accountant, James Wehmhoff, also testified that, in 2007, he discovered that PCI had been \"maintain[ing] two different sets of\n   books,\" which he understood to be evidence that PCI was \"tell[ing] investors or lenders one thing,\" but then \"us[ing] funds for something else.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 15 [Doc. No. 110-1] (\"Wehmhoff Dep.\") at 40, 55-56.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, in an exhaustive forensic accounting investigation conducted after the Petters Ponzi Scheme became public knowledge, the Trustee's expert forensic accountant (the aforementioned Theodore Martens) discovered that PCI had effectively been insolvent from December 31, 1996 until its collapse in 2008. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 19 [Doc. No. 110-2] (\"Martens Solvency Report\") \u00b6 9.) In other words, at the end of 1996, PCI's liabilities exceeded its assets by at least $ 6.5 million, and that gap only increased until it had reached $ 3.25 billion by June 2008, when PCI went out of business as a result of the criminal prosecutions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Wehmhoff Dep. at 69-72 (noting that the tax returns he prepared for PCI in 2000, 2001, and 2002 all showed losses in the tens of millions of dollars).) This insolvency occurred largely because \"the assets reported on the PCI Balance Sheets included fictitious accounts receivable and inventory balances that resulted from falsified purchases of goods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Indeed, Martens added, \"PCI ... did not engage in actual inventory and accounts receivable financing, with the exception of some limited transactions involving the purchase of small amount of goods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Petters also did not contribute much of his own capital to PCI, which, in Martens's opinion, further \"evidence[d] ... that [PCI] served no functional purpose from [its] inception other than to perpetuate the fraud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Importantly, Martens and his forensic accounting team also built upon Coleman and White's generalized \"Ponzi scheme testimony\" by conducting an ex-post, individualized \"tracing\" investigation with respect to each PCI investor (including both Defendants here). As part of this investigation, Martens scoured PCI's bank account records (and any other available evidence) to glean whether any individual loan was used to fund a real merchandise order, as well as whether that loan was re-paid from revenue earned from the re-sale of a real merchandise order. With respect to both Papadimos and Kanios, Martens found \"no evidence\" \"to indicate that any of the transactions to/from [Defendants] were related to potentially real PCI purchases and/or sales transactions,\" but that, \"rather,\" \"the funds received from/sent to [Defendants] were part of the rolling churn of the Petters Ponzi Scheme.\" (Martens - Papadimos Tracing Report \u00b6 35; Martens - Kanios Tracing Report \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Martens concluded that Defendants' funds were \"part of the rolling churn of the Petters Ponzi Scheme,\" based largely upon the (highly suspect) timing between incoming loans and outgoing loan payments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martens - Papadimos Tracing Report \u00b6 15.c (\"[W]e observed that the typical churn of the Ponzi scheme was such that cash received on one day was disbursed to other investors the same or the day after.\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Coleman Dep. II at\n   443 (Q: What did [PCI] then use to pay investors' notes? Where did the money come from? A: Other investors.\").) Although Martens acknowledged that several of Defendants' transactions occurred around the same time as \"real\" PCI \"purchases/sales,\" Martens ultimately concluded that no evidence linked that (extremely limited) \"real\" activity to Defendants' money. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Martens - Papadimos Tracing Report \u00b6\u00b6 22, 27-29; Martens - Kanios Tracing Report \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 24-25.) In fact, Martens specifically analyzed the\n   <em>\n    relative\n   </em>\n   amount of \"real sales activity\" in PCI's bank accounts during each of these \"ambiguous\" time periods, and found that the amount of money flowing through the Ponzi scheme substantially dwarfed the amount of money flowing from \"real business.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Martens - Papadimos Tracing Report \u00b6 27 (finding that, although Papadimos received an interest payment of $ 3,300 on May 3, 1999, which was three days after PCI received a $ 68,798.64 \"sales\" payment, there was \"no evidence to suggest that the payment to [Papadimos] was funded by potentially real sales transactions,\" and further noting that, \"excluding the $ 68,798.64 incoming transfer marked \"SALES,\"\n   <em>\n    over $ 8.4 million\n   </em>\n   was deposited into [PCI's] bank account between April 29, 1999 and May 3, 1999 from the serial churn of the Petters Ponzi scheme\") (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Martens also conducted a \"cash tracing analysis\" to determine if any of Defendants' money flowed to one of Petters's more \"legitimate\" companies (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.8), and was then used for real diverting activity.

The Bankruptcy Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   entertained the first of these motions on March 5, 2018, in a case called\n   <em>\n    Kelley v. Charap\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. A [Doc. No. 113-1] (\"Mar. 5, 2018 Bankr. Hr'g Tr.\").) The Bankruptcy Court denied the Trustee's summary judgment motion from the bench, and then applied its oral ruling to the other at-issue \"Petters claw black\" adversary proceedings, including to the Trustee's action against Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. C [Doc. No. 113-2] (\"Mar. 20, 2018 Papadimos Summ. J. Ruling\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As best this Court can tell, the Bankruptcy Court reached this decision for two reasons. First, the Bankruptcy Court found that material disputes of fact existed as to whether PCI acted with fraudulent intent with respect to each individual transfer the Trustee sought to claw back (which, again, collectively totaled in the thousands). (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mar. 5, 2018 Bankr. Hr'g Tr. at 75-76.) Although the Bankruptcy Court acknowledged the testimony of Ms. Coleman that \"all of\" the security agreements and purchase orders at issue were fabricated or exaggerated, the Court found that, at least in the case of Charap, the defendant-investor had rebutted that presumption of fraud by testifying that \"he [was] not told that the loans were tied to specific deals, [and] did not rely on specific statements that tied the loans to specific deals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 67 (noting that Charap had \"testified that he would give [PCI] the money and it could be used for any purpose\").) \"There [were] no security agreements [with Charap],\" the Bankruptcy Court added. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Second, the Bankruptcy Court found that Martens's expert testimony did not sufficiently detail whether Defendants' money was used to finance legitimate merchandise transactions (as opposed to whether it was simply part of the \"Ponzi churn\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78.) On this point, the Bankruptcy Court emphasized that, per Martens's own analysis, other Petters' companies \"had legitimate business,\" and that PCI transferred \"over a billion dollars\" to those companies during the relevant time period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    but cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 863-64 (noting that this activity amounted to only three percent of PCI's total cash flow, and that Martens conducted an analysis with respect to these \"intercompany\" transfers).) Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, a reasonable juror could find that at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of any individual investor's funds\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have flowed to legitimate, non-PCI transactions, and thus provided \"reasonably equivalent value\" to PCI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After reaching this decision, the Bankruptcy Court transferred many of the Petters claw back adversary proceedings before it to the District Court for trial (and/or further settlement negotiations). These cases were then distributed among the judges of the District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Court Holds the First \"Petters Claw Back\" Jury Trial in Late 2018, in the Case of\n    <em>\n     Kelley v. Boosalis\n    </em>\n    ; the Jury Rules for the Trustee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Between November 26 and December 4, 2018, the undersigned presided over the first (and, to date, only) Petters claw back trial, in the case of\n   <em>\n    Kelley v. Boosalis\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   No. 18-cv-868 (SRN/TNL). Although the facts in that case differed in some ways from the facts here, the Trustee put on an affirmative case that largely mirrored what the Court set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (albeit in a vastly more detailed fashion). For instance, Coleman provided factual testimony about PCI's fraudulent intent, and Martens provided expert testimony about how each one of the at-issue transfers directly played into the \"Ponzi churn.\" The Trustee also put on four other witnesses, including an IRS agent, a PCI secretary, and a PCI tax accountant (the aforementioned James Wehmhoff). In his defense, Boosalis offered solely his own testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Most importantly for present purposes, though, in the days before closing arguments, the Court had to resolve a legal dispute as to what the jury instruction defining \"reasonably equivalent value\" should say. The Trustee offered the following instruction, which the Court found to be an accurate statement of Minnesota law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Reasonably equivalent value may be found if the value Petters Company, Inc. received from Mr. Boosalis in exchange for a payment was reasonably equivalent to the value of the payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Value may be reasonably equivalent where the payment made to the investor satisfies a valid antecedent debt. Any payment above the amount of the principal investment is not in satisfaction of a valid antecedent debt if it was made in furtherance of a fraud, enabled by a fraud, or paid on dishonestly-incurred debt. If you find that an interest payment made by Petters Company, Inc. to Mr. Boosalis was made in furtherance of a fraud, enabled by a fraud, or paid on dishonestly-incurred debt, then that payment does not satisfy a valid antecedent\n   debt, and is not for reasonably equivalent value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Boosalis Doc. No. 111 at 14.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Boosalis's counsel objected to this instruction, on grounds that it both conflicted with a recent Minnesota Supreme Court decision called\n   <em>\n    Finn v. Alliance Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887529\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/860/638/\">\n    860 N.W.2d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Minn. 2015), and misstated the law of contract enforceability more generally. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Boosalis Doc. No. 101.) Rather, Boosalis argued, the Court should excise any mention of \"fraud\" from its instruction, and should instead simply instruct the jury that \"[v]alue may be reasonably equivalent where the payment is made to satisfy an antecedent debt,\" and that an \"antecedent debt includes any legally enforceable right to payment against Petters Company, Inc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court overruled Boosalis's objection and maintained its original instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelley v. Boosalis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206322631\">\n    2018 WL 6322631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Minn. Dec. 3, 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Boosalis Doc. No. 103. In its decision, the Court observed that, not only did Boosalis's instruction leave the jury to resolve the\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   question of what constituted a \"legally enforceable right to payment,\" but that, under Boosalis's proposed instruction, interest paid directly out of a Ponzi scheme could\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   be for \"reasonably equivalent value,\" so long as it was received in good faith and in accordance with a facially legitimate contract. Because this reasoning lacked substantial legal support (including from the\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   decision, discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), the Court instead concluded that the jury should be informed that, in accordance with prevailing legal standards, an interest payment received \"in furtherance of a fraud, enabled by a fraud, or paid on dishonestly-incurred debt\" did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   constitute a \"legally enforceable right to payment.\" From that premise, the Court reasoned, the jury could find no \"\n   <em>\n    valid\n   </em>\n   antecedent debt,\" and, hence, no reasonably equivalent value, if it found that Boosalis's interest payments were \"directly connected\" to PCI's fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Trustee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Boosalis Doc. No. 116 (verdict form).) Specifically, the jury found that the Trustee had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that PCI made interest payments to Boosalis with an \"intent to defraud\" its other creditors, and that Boosalis had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   proven by a preponderance of the evidence that he had accepted\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of his interest payments in \"good faith\" or \"in exchange for a reasonably equivalent value.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (the \"actual fraud\" claim under MUFTA).) The jury also found that the Trustee had proven its \"constructive fraud\" claim by a preponderance of the evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 865 (listing elements).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The jury accordingly awarded the Trustee $ 3,502,455 in damages,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the interest that Boosalis had earned from his PCI loans. The Court later increased the Trustee's award to $ 6,382,144.71, in accordance with Minnesota's prejudgment interest statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

This is so for three reasons.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the Trustee has provided substantial \"direct proof\" of PCI's intent to defraud, on a transfer-by-transfer basis, and in the manner contemplated by Judge Kishel.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , under a \"badges of fraud\" analysis, the Trustee has also proven its entitlement to an inference of fraudulent intent.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Third\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Defendants have not set forth any evidence, beyond the speculative, from which a reasonable juror could rebut the Trustee's proof of actual fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the testimony of Deanna Coleman directly shows that PCI intended to defraud its future (and current) creditors when it made the at-issue interest payments to Defendants. That is, Coleman's testimony shows that, from 1994 through 2008, PCI\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   lured investors to lend it money by promising \"security interests\" in merchandise that did not, in fact, exist, and then\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   kept those investors coming back by paying them interest with\n   <em>\n    other investors' money\n   </em>\n   (who similarly believed they were investing in \"securitized\" merchandise orders). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 861-62.) Because PCI applied this fraud scheme through thousands of promissory notes and security agreements, Coleman (understandably) could not testify as to PCI's intent at the exact moment of each of the 100-some transfers at issue here. However, Coleman has testified (repeatedly and consistently) that she was responsible for drafting the promissory notes, security agreements, and purchase orders that undergirded each of the at-issue transfers, and that, from 1994 onwards, \"\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   purchase order that [an] investor received or invested in was fake.\" (Coleman Dep. I at 88 (emphasis added).) Indeed, all of the security agreements in the record, from 1997 onwards, contain the same fraudulent misrepresentation that Coleman would make to Papadimos when she \"called him up and asked for\" a loan (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 193-94), namely, that PCI needed Papadimos's (or his wife's) money so that PCI could \"acquire rights in or use of certain merchandise,\" and then \"resell [that merchandise] as part of [PCI's] business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   at 860-61;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Papadimos Dep. I at 84 (noting that these purchase orders and security agreements constituted an \"important factor\" in encouraging him to invest with PCI).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Moreover, what Coleman asserts on a general basis, Martens (the forensic accountant) confirms on a transfer-by-transfer basis. That is, as contemplated by Judge Kishel, Martens analyzed each transfer at issue here, and, in so doing, found that PCI did exactly what Coleman claimed it did: (a) used fraudulent security agreements and promissory notes to \"induce\" Defendants to lend money; (b) \"misdirected\" Defendants' \"cash infusions toward the payment of earlier investments,\" rather than to investments in real merchandise; and (c) paid Defendants' interest with funds provided by \"the successive misdirection\" of subsequent investors' cash, rather than from revenue realized as a result of real merchandise re-sales.

In the Trustee's view (which this Court\n   adopted in\n   <em>\n    Boosalis\n   </em>\n   ), these four principles stand for the proposition that not \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   contracts between a Ponzi scheme operator and an investor are unenforceable as a matter of public policy, as [that] would deprive the investor of an opportunity to prove that its contract was outside the Ponzi scheme and therefore legally enforceable.\" (Pl.'s Reply Br. at 8;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

But, the Trustee continues, if the evidence definitively shows that a lending contract was \"in furtherance of\" the \"fraudulent\" Ponzi churn, that contract is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   enforceable, under either\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   or the longstanding federal bankruptcy case law cited above.

In other words, the Trustee argues,\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   did not outright reject the prior law concerning the unenforceability of Ponzi scheme \"profits.\" Rather,\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   merely sought to limit any \"presumptions\" arising out of that case law, so as to align Ponzi scheme claw back cases with MUFTA's individualized, \"transfer by transfer\" mode of analysis, and with MUFTA's focus on combating \"fraudulent\" transfers, rather than mere \"preferences\" to \"bona fide\" creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887529\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/860/638/\">\n    860 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   647 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887529\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/860/638/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887529\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/860/638/\">\n    at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"MUFTA does not prohibit a debtor from making a preferential transfer in favor of one bona fide creditor over another,\n   <em>\n    so long as the transfer is not fraudulent\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Summ. J. Br. at 10-14; Defs.' Reply Br. at 5-8.)

And, there, it instructed the jury that \"[v]alue may be reasonably equivalent where the payment made to the investor satisfies a valid antecedent debt,\" but that \"any payment above the amount of the principal investment is not in satisfaction of a valid antecedent debt if it was made in furtherance of a fraud, enabled by a fraud, or paid on dishonestly-incurred debt.\" (Boosalis Doc.

That is, just as Defendants failed to adduce\n   evidence showing that PCI might have had a \"legitimate\" intent with respect to some of the at-issue interest payments (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 873-74), Defendants failed to adduce evidence showing that any one of their interest payments was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"made in furtherance of a fraud, enabled by fraud, or paid on dishonestly-incurred debt,\" (Boosalis Doc. No. 111 at 14). Accordingly, Defendants' interest payments were not \"in satisfaction of a valid antecedent debt,\" and did not provide \"reasonably equivalent value\" to PCI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Admittedly, Defendants did submit some expert testimony suggesting that the interest rates on their loans were \"reasonable,\" given the \"high risk\" of \"this type of financing.\" (Defs.' Summ. J. Br. at 6-7 (describing testimony of Matthew Polsky).) The Trustee did not address this evidence in its briefing in any substantial manner. However, the Court finds that, because Defendants failed to show that their promissory notes were in exchange for non-fraudulent business purposes, the Court need not consider the reasonableness of the interest rate attached to the notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court also acknowledges that, were there evidence that Defendants' \"promissory notes\" were intended to function as \"general business loans\" to PCI, this case might present a closer call on \"reasonably equivalent value.\" In that scenario, a lender could perhaps argue that interest payments on their loans were in exchange for \"value,\" in the sense that the loans were intended to be spent on employee salaries and building rent and the like, and were therefore not \"directly connected\" to a Ponzi scheme operator's fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

However, this is not such a case. As detailed above, the vast majority of Defendants' promissory notes were executed in connection with indisputably fraudulent security agreements and purchase orders (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 860-61), and were not, in any way, connected to \"real\" diverting activity.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887529\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/860/638/\">\n    860 N.W.2d at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]here is [ ] no dispute that the banks in this case purchased non-oversold participation interests in\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   loans to\n   <em>\n    real\n   </em>\n   borrowers, which provided [the Ponzi scheme operator] with a legitimate source of earnings with which to pay the banks.\"). Consequently, any further refining of the law, with respect to the meaning of \"reasonably equivalent value\" in the lending context, will await another day, when more nuanced fact patterns emerge than the one at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Finally, the Court acknowledges that the Bankruptcy Court denied the Trustee summary judgment on the question of \"reasonably equivalent value\" earlier in this litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 866-67.) Upon close examination of the Bankruptcy Court's reasoning, though, it appears that the Bankruptcy Court took this action because it found that the Trustee had failed to meet\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   burden on the issue, as is the case in the \"constructive fraud\" context. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mar. 5, 2018 Bankr. Hr'g Tr. at 78.) Because this Court, unlike the Bankruptcy Court, has found that the Trustee is entitled to summary judgment on \"actual fraud,\" and that therefore it is\n   <em>\n    Defendants'\n   </em>\n   burden to prove \"reasonably equivalent value,\" the Court finds this case distinguishable from that earlier decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Residential Funding Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4027892\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/850/961/#p964\">\n    850 F.Supp.2d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing that \"one who relies upon an affirmative defense to defeat an otherwise meritorious motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   adduce evidence which, viewed in the light most favorable to and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, would permit judgment for the non-moving party on the basis of that defense\") (emphasis added) (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For these reasons, the Court grants the Trustee summary judgment as to Defendants' affirmative defense of \"reasonably equivalent value.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

First, and most importantly, the Court is not \"genuinely uncertain\" about its interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   , as set forth in its\n   <em>\n    Boosalis\n   </em>\n   Order and now again in this Order.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534659\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/151/#p153\">\n    935 F.2d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Court finds that its interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   largely accords with that of Judge Kishel, who is the only other jurist to have written at length about the legal implications of\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 877-78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Next, although the Court acknowledged above that other cases may present \"closer calls\" as to the\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 879-80), the Court in no way believes that the\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   portion of this Order constitutes a \"conjectural\" interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   in particular, or of Minnesota state law in general.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520935\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/406/#p412\">\n    922 F.3d at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the fact that a recent Minnesota Supreme Court decision even speaks to the relevant legal issues in and of itself distinguishes this case from other instances where this Court has been confronted by a truly \"novel\" or \"unsettled\" question of state law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Friedlander v.

(\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 868-69 (discussing the\n   <em>\n    Boosalis\n   </em>\n   appeal).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Defendants make two additional arguments to the contrary, neither of which the Court finds availing. First, Defendants suggest that, because the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals once certified an analogous legal question involving the interpretation of Texas's fraudulent transfer act, the Court should do likewise here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Janvey v.

However, as the Trustee correctly notes, the Fifth Circuit only certified that legal question because there was express disagreement between the District Court and the Fifth Circuit panel, \"none of whom had the benefit of a Texas Supreme Court case defining reasonably equivalent value.\" (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 16.) Here, by contrast, not only does this Court have the benefit of\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   , but there is also no express disagreement among members of the District or the Eighth Circuit (or even the state courts, for that matter) as to the relevant legal questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Second, Defendants also contend that, because the legal questions addressed by this Order will \"likely reoccur\" in some of the other pending \"Petters claw back\" cases, and will prove \"dispositive\" in those cases, certification is particularly appropriate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Summ. J. Br. at 23-24 (citing \"more than twenty\" pending cases).) As an initial matter, and as the Court noted above, there are only a handful of \"Petters claw back\" cases actually pending in the District. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.12.) Moreover, to the extent Defendants are correct about the number of cases, the Court finds that this number must be tempered by the Trustee's assertion that several of these matters \"are subject to active settlement negotiations,\" and involve different kinds of \"non-lender\" defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 16-17.) Finally, in any event, there is no need to even consider the \"dispositive\" effect a Minnesota Supreme Court ruling may have on future cases because the undersigned lacks \"genuine uncertainty\" about its legal reasoning here.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. John Deere Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534659\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/935/151/#p153\">\n    935 F.2d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The most important consideration guiding the exercise of [the] discretion [of whether to certify a question of state law to a state Supreme Court] is whether the reviewing court finds itself genuinely uncertain about a question of state law.\"). Indeed, to the extent\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   decision has any \"dispositive\" impact on the other pending \"Petters claw back\" cases before this District, that is solely because the Court's colleagues found this Order and the\n   <em>\n    Boosalis\n   </em>\n   Order persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Special Situations Fund III, L.P. v.

Remaining Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court will conclude by addressing a few remaining, ancillary disputes between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   First, the parties dispute various issues with respect to the Trustee's \"constructive fraud\" claim, such as the appropriate statute of limitations. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Summ. J. Br. at 17; Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 18-23.) However, because the Court finds for the Trustee on its \"actual fraud\" claim, and because the relief sought under that theory is identical to the relief sought under its \"constructive fraud\" claim, the Court need not resolve these issues. (\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   Mar. 8, 2019 Hr'g Tr. at 4 (Trustee's counsel: emphasizing that the damages between the \"actual fraud\" claim and the \"constructive fraud\" claim are \"duplicative\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Second, the parties also dispute whether the Trustee has sufficiently set forth a case of \"personal liability\" against Kanios (as opposed to liability solely against her 401(k) retirement fund). Defendants contend that, under federal law, a lawsuit against an \"employee benefit plan\" (like a 401(k)) must separately \"establish\" \"personal liability\" with respect to a plan's beneficiary, and that the Trustee failed to do so here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp. Br. at 18-19 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ).) Defendants do not cite any factual evidence in support of this contention. In response, the Trustee observes that Kanios \"admits she received promissory notes from PCI and decided herself to invest in PCI through\n   her pension plan,\" and is therefore \"indisputably the beneficiary of the notes between PCI and [her 401(k) plans].\" (Pl.'s Reply Br. at 11.) The Court agrees with the Trustee. The deposition transcripts of both Kanios and Papadimos, as well as the other record evidence, make clear that Kanios is the intended beneficiary of the at-issue 401(k) retirement fund (aptly titled \"the Chris M. Kanios 401(k) Savings Plan\"), and that PCI's interest payments were meant to (and, in fact, did) benefit Kanios directly, that is, by increasing the size of her retirement fund. Based on this evidence, and in the absence of any specific contention by Defendants to the contrary, the Court finds that the Trustee has sufficiently proven \"personal liability\" on Kanios's behalf.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re McCook Metals, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9040304\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/319/570/#p590\">\n    319 B.R. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590-92 (Bankr.

The Trustee argues that the Court should simply adhere to its analysis from\n   <em>\n    Boosalis\n   </em>\n   , and apply Minnesota's statutory 10% per annum prejudgment interest rate from September 10, 2010 (when the Trustee commenced this lawsuit against Defendants) to the date of final judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Summ. J. Br. at 30-31 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

Dec. 7, 2018) and Boosalis Doc. Nos. 117, 124).) For their part, Defendants again argue that the Court should re-consider its\n   <em>\n    Boosalis\n   </em>\n   decision (without citing any new case law or defendant-specific evidence), and should instead either (a) deny prejudgment interest all together, (b) grant prejudgment interest at the (far lower) federal interest rate, from a later date of the litigation (such as October 31, 2017, the date Martens issued his final expert report) to the date of final judgment, or, at worst, (c) grant prejudgment at the federal interest rate from September 10, 2010 to the date of final judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp. Br. at 19-22.) In making this argument, Defendants rely heavily on equitable considerations, namely, that \"this adversary proceeding [was] part of a large, extraordinarily complex bankruptcy proceeding,\" involving \"questions of unsettled, and shifting, law,\" and that it was therefore \"reasonable for Defendants to decline payment and approach the Court to adjudicate the rights of the parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   For the reasons already explained in the\n   <em>\n    Boosalis\n   </em>\n   Order, Minnesota law, not federal law, provides the prejudgment interest rate for this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

In support of this argument, Defendants contend that a \"corrected 2006 Form 1099-INT,\" showed that Papadimos only received $ 63,436.83 in interest income in 2006, as opposed to the $ 370,697.87 originally reported.

However, as the Trustee pointed out at oral argument, its expert forensic account, Mr. Theodore Martens, took this corrected 1099 form into account when calculating the amount of interest Papadimos received from PCI. Defendants' counsel did not attempt to rebut this interpretation of Mr. Martens's accounting at any point during the hearing, and the Court cannot find any evidence in the record that would have allowed them to do so.

Not only are these cases clear \"outliers\" among judicial authorities,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Silverman v. Cullin\n    </em>\n    , 633 Fed.App'x 16, 17 (2d Cir. 2016) (describing these two cases as \"outliers\"), but the Court finds that adopting this position would effectively create a conclusive presumption\n    <em>\n     against\n    </em>\n    creditors (or bankruptcy trustees) trying to \"claw back\" interest payments made out of a \"fixed-income Ponzi scheme,\" no matter how directly connected those payments/promissory notes were to a fraud. Such a \"presumption\" would no more accord with\n    <em>\n     Finn\n    </em>\n    than the countervailing \"Ponzi scheme presumption\" the Minnesota Supreme Court rejected.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Although Defendants repeatedly imply that this Court's decision and the Judge Kishel \"effect of\n    <em>\n     Finn\n    </em>\n    \" decision are at odds (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Defs.' Reply Br. at 12), that is not the case. True, Judge Kishel declined \"to reach the theory of unenforceability as a matter of public policy\" (which the Court relied on above), on grounds that \"unenforceability\" could be determined solely by reference to law holding that contracts \"fraudulently induced\" are \"voidable.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Petters Co., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261116\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/550/457/#p481\">\n     550 B.R. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    479 n.32 and accompanying text. However, a fair reading of Judge Kishel's decision makes plain that he was not \"rejecting\" the \"public policy\" theory adopted here and in\n    <em>\n     Boosalis\n    </em>\n    ; indeed, as noted above, in conducting his analysis, Judge Kishel explicitly relied on the same pre-\n    <em>\n     Finn\n    </em>\n    federal bankruptcy case law that the Court relied on here.
