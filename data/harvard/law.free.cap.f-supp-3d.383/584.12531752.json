Also before the court is defendants' motion to strike a portion of plaintiffs' response in opposition to the motion to dismiss (DE 36). The issues raised have been fully briefed, and in this posture are ripe for ruling. For the reasons that follow, defendants' motion to dismiss is granted for reasons of comity, and defendants' motion to strike is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case concerns the constitutionality of a municipality collecting revenue from undeveloped property owners within a sewer treatment district authorized by state law. Plaintiffs, proceeding pro se, commenced this action on June 20, 2018, alleging violation of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In their complaint, plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss on October 19, 2018, asserting this action is barred by the Tax Injunction Act (\"TIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as principles of comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs initially responded in opposition only to defendants' jurisdictional arguments, and moved to stay briefing on defendants' 12(b)(6) motion. The court denied plaintiffs' motion, but allowed plaintiffs leave to respond to the remaining part of\n   defendants' motion. Plaintiffs followed with a supplemental brief totaling 61 pages, together with a \"memorandum of clearly established law\" presenting another 49 pages of legal arguments. Defendants moved to strike the filing in opposition for exceeding the page limit for memoranda allowed by Local Civil Rule 7.1(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The facts in the complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   may be summarized as follows. Plaintiffs are local undeveloped property owners within the jurisdiction of defendant Town of Oak Island (\"Town\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2006, the North Carolina General Assembly granted defendant Town authority to create a fee-supported sewer treatment district.

Sess. Laws at 117; 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws at 85. The charge may not exceed the cost of providing sewer services, and \"shall be imposed on owners of each dwelling unit or parcel of property that could or does benefit from the availability of sewage treatment.\" 2004 N.C. Sess. Laws at 117; 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws at 85. The charge is \"to be used only to pay the debt service for the sewer system.\" 2004 N.C. Sess. Laws at 118; 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws at 85. The law further requires defendant Town to \"administer the fund to provide for the payment of said sewer services provided by the county.\" 2004 N.C. Sess. Laws at 118; 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws at 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 25, 2009, defendant Town adopted a resolution establishing a sewer treatment district and levied a charge of $ 146.15 for property tax year 2009 upon all property owners. (Compl. \u00b6 15). At the same time, defendant Town also approved a refund of the 2009 sewer treatment district charges to developed parcel owners, but not undeveloped parcel owners. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Following discussion and approval of the resolution, defendant Town's mayor made the following statement summarizing the rationale behind the measure:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Let [me] make this clear for the people watching on TV. The annual fees imposed on parcels of property within the district in the amount of $ 146.15 per parcel-everybody's gonna get it. The collection fees will be applied to debt service for the Town Wastewater Project; a credit will be applied to users of the Town system. So if you're buying water now, you're buying any kind of utility now, you're gonna get a credit for the amount that we're billing. This is so the\n   parcels of property that don't have anything on it can help pay their share which they're not doing now. So don't let anybody tell you that you're getting billed $ 146.15 and that's the way it is. You're gonna get a credit for it. So let's make that clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Town Counsel Meeting (DE 11-2) at 4-6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, defendant Town proceeded to adopt similar annual resolutions. Each year from 2015 to 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant Town approved annual sewer treatment district charges of $ 803.82, then credited that amount back to developed parcel owners but not undeveloped parcel owners.

Plaintiffs contend that sewer treatment service was not \"available\" to their undeveloped properties because, in order to access sewer service, defendant Town must approve a sewer hookup application and certain development fees must be paid to develop and establish a connection to the sewer system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Town Fee Schedule (DE 11-3) at 1-2). On September 18, 2017, plaintiff Brad Johnson (\"Johnson\") served a demand letter upon defendant Town, requesting individually and on behalf of those similarly situated a refund of charges paid by undeveloped property owners. (Compl. \u00b6 21; Demand Letter (DE 11-6) at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    COURT'S DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the court's subject matter jurisdiction. Such motion may either 1) assert the complaint fails to state facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction may be based, or 2) attack the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact, apart from the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Where, as here, a defendant raises a \"facial challenge[ ] to standing that do[es] not dispute the jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint,\" the court accepts \"the facts of the complaint as true as [the court] would in context of a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    Kenny v.

Plaintiffs also represent that all revenue from the charge will flow into the sewer district\n   fee enterprise fund, and that no refunds in the form of credits will be issued to owners of developed parcels. (Resp. Opp. (DE 35) at 3). As a result of defendant Town's post-filing enactments, plaintiffs \"withdraw\" their \"requested equitable relief.\" (Resp. Opp. (DE 35) at 4). The court construes plaintiffs' statements as an abandonment of their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, and dismisses those claims without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs may not abandon their claims in their briefs.

Moreover, the underlying benefit defendant Town sought to pay for is the \"availability of sewer service.\" 2004 N.C. Sess. Laws at 117-18; 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws at 85. Revenue raised for the \"availability of sewer service\" does not provide an individualized benefit, and is not meant to regulate or punish. Even plaintiffs' complaint intimates that the availability of a sewer system yields a benefit to the entire community. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 12 (discussing the potential increase in land value generally accruing to local property owners with the presence of a sewer system)). Consequently, the uses prescribed by law for the sewer treatment district charge more closely resemble as tax than a fee. Applying the factors together, the court concludes for purposes of the comity doctrine that the charge is a tax, notwithstanding plaintiffs' several arguments the charge is a fee, which the court treats in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs first argue that defendant Town's sewer treatment district charge is regulatory in nature because it is part of a\n   \"comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme designed to provide sewer services to its customers.\" (Pl. Resp. (DE 28) at 28). In addressing plaintiffs' argument, the Fourth Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Norfolk S. Ry.\n   </em>\n   is instructive. There, the Fourth Circuit held that a charge imposed by defendant pursuant to a Virginia statute related to stormwater management was used for regulatory purposes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520176\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/315/#p319\">\n    916 F.3d at 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court then noted that, because of the complex mandates of state and federal law involving stormwater, \"[defendant] is now a participant in a comprehensive scheme regulating stormwater management and the assessment of charges to pay for it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520176\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/315/#p319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the court concluded that the that stormwater management charge was a fee because it \"ensure[s] that owners of impervious surfaces bear the cost of managing stormwater runoff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520176\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/315/#p319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520176\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/315/#p319\">\n    at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Norfolk S. Ry.\n   </em>\n   , the statute in this case does not serve a regulatory or punitive purpose. The statute in the present lawsuit only allows fees to be used in a manner that makes sewer services generally available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 N.C. Sess. Laws at 118; 2006 N.C. Sess.

In sum, plaintiffs' first argument that the sewer district treatment charge is regulatory fails in light of its general revenue raising purpose related to debt servicing and general availability of sewer services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the sewer district treatment charge is not being used for the purposes designated by state law. (Pl. Resp. (DE 28) at 28-30). Plaintiffs' argument has no bearing on whether the uses designated by law for the sewer district treatment charge are consistent with that of a tax. The uses for the charge, which plaintiffs themselves contend was levied under the state law examined by this court, are consistent with a tax. Plaintiffs' argument merely underscores why federal courts require states provide a \"plain, adequate, and complete remedy\" for constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DIRECTV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3166017\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/119/#p128\">\n    513 F.3d at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
