Jan. 11, 2018) (\"Although the Second Superseding Indictment may lack particulars, the Criminal Complaint and the discovery propounded in this case are more than adequate.\"). The facts recounted here are taken from the Superseding Indictment (Dkt. No. 71) and the affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint (Dkt. No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between February and April 2017, Defendants provided cell phones to an individual who they believed was going to travel to Syria to fight on behalf of ISIS, so that the phones could be used to create improvised explosive devices. Unbeknownst to Defendants, that individual was a confidential human source (\"CHS\") for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"). After the CHS informed Defendants that he wished to join ISIS, Defendants worked together to prepare and support the CHS's purported international travel. For example, Schimenti voiced his support for the CHS's travel plans, took the CHS shopping in preparation for his travel, and counseled the CHS regarding how to avoid detection by law enforcement. For his part, Jones introduced the CHS to an individual who Jones believed to operate an ISIS facilitation network capable of delivering the CHS to ISIS-controlled territory in Syria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 12, 2017, the FBI arrested Schimenti. After his arrest, FBI agents interrogated Schimenti about his activities and relationship with the CHS. Schimenti made several false statements during the interrogation. For example, when confronted with recordings of his conversations with the CHS, Schimenti falsely denied that it was his voice on the recordings. FBI agents also asked Schimenti about his interactions with the CHS and the CHS's plan to obtain cell phones for ISIS. Schimenti falsely answered that he thought the phones would be repaired and used by the CHS's family in Syria and falsely denied having conversations with the CHS about using the phones as bomb detonators. Schimenti also falsely denied that the CHS said that he was traveling overseas to fight for ISIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both Defendants were originally indicted in April 2017. Subsequently, in April 2018, the grand jury returned a two-count Superseding Indictment charging both Defendants\n   with conspiracy to \"provide material support and resources, namely, personnel and equipment\" to ISIS (Count I), and charging Schimenti for making materially false statements \"involving international terrorism in a matter within the jurisdiction of the [FBI].\" (Count II).

Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At issue in Defendants' motion to dismiss Count I is the constitutional validity of \u00a7 2339B, which makes it unlawful to \"knowingly provide[ ] material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, or attempt[ ] or conspire[ ] to do so.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B(1). Defendants do not dispute that ISIS has been designated as an FTO by the Secretary of State. However, Defendants argue that the Court should deem \u00a7 2339B void for vagueness and overbreadth. The Court is not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a criminal statute define an offense with sufficient clarity that an ordinary person has fair notice of what conduct is prohibited and so as to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court must consider the purported vagueness of the statute here \"as applied\" to the facts of this particular case, rather than in the abstract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 550. Accordingly, Defendants must show that the statute \"is vague as applied to [them]; and if the statute undoubtedly applies to [their] conduct, [they cannot] argue that the statute is vague as to one or more hypothetical scenarios.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants argue that \u00a7 2339B is unconstitutionally vague because it is unclear whether supporting an individual who purportedly desires to join but is not currently a member of an FTO, such as the CHS, constitutes the provision of material support. Defendants claim that the statute \"fails to give adequate notice of guidance ... as to what type of individual they cannot interact with.\" (Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Count I of the [Superseding] Indictment as Unconstitutionally Overbroad and Void for Vagueness at 7, Dkt. No. 85.) But under the plain language of the statute, Defendants need not interact with an actual or purported member of the FTO to be charged with violating \u00a7 2339B.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lamie v. U.S. Trustee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897517\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/526/#p534\">\n    540 U.S. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897517,9068198\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/124/1023/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897517\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/526/#p534\">\n    157 L.Ed.2d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (\"It is well established that when the statute's language is plain, the sole function of\n   the courts ... is to enforce it according to its terms.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Instead, \u00a7 2339B makes it unlawful to provide, attempt to provide, or conspire to provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, without any mention of a requirement of actual interaction. Moreover, courts have consistently applied the statute in situations where the defendant did not meet any actual members of an FTO.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hammadi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732011\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/1043/#p1045\">\n    737 F.3d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1045 (6th Cir. 2013) (affirming conviction under \u00a7 2339B where the defendant believed he was donating to a third-party fundraising group that supports various FTOs but he was actually interacting with a CHS);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

July 18, 2018) (upholding conviction where the defendant believed he was donating $ 300 to an FTO even though he \"had no direct contact with the members of any terrorist organization ... never committed any act of violence, nor did he advocate for any particular violent act\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the Superseding Indictment does not merely accuse Defendants of associating with the CHS; they have also been charged with arranging the CHS's travel and providing cell phones to ISIS. While Defendants claim that they provided the phones to the CHS for use by the CHS's family members in Syria, the Court must assume the truth of the Government's version of the facts. And according to the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, Defendants sought to provide the phones for ISIS to use in creating improvised explosive devices and tried to support the CHS's plans to join ISIS. The Court finds that Defendants had fair notice that such conduct would run afoul of \u00a7 2339B(h), regardless of whether the CHS ultimately joined ISIS or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, Defendants argue that it is unclear whether they may be convicted under \u00a7 2339B(h) despite the fact that they are not members of ISIS themselves. But Defendants misread the statute, which imposes criminal liability on anyone who \"has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or conspired to provide a foreign terrorist organization with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1 or more individuals\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (who may be or include himself)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to work under that terrorist organization's direction or control\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to organize, manage, supervise, or otherwise direct the operation of that organization.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B(h) (emphasis added). A plain reading of the provision reveals no requirement that Defendants be under the direction or control of ISIS. Rather, the Government need only prove that Defendants attempted to provide \"1 or more individuals,\" namely, the CHS, \"to work under [ISIS]'s direction or control.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203490886\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Schimenti contends that because the FBI had already conducted extensive surveillance and gathered sufficient evidence before his interrogation to\n   file a criminal complaint his statements could not have had any influence. But \"[u]nder section 1001 a false statement may be material even though the agency did not rely on it and was not influenced by it.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751727\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/657/\">\n    551 F.3d 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2008), the defendant argued that his false statements were immaterial because the FBI possessed incriminating recordings and thus \"already knew the answers to the questions before they asked him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751727\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/657/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751727\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/657/\">\n    at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit acknowledged that the defendant's statements \"probably had very little\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     actual\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   influence on the agents,\" but nonetheless held that \"the point of his [false statements to the agents] was to cast suspicion away from him, which in the ordinary course would have had an intrinsic capability-a natural tendency-to influence an FBI investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751727\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/657/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751727\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/657/\">\n    at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   court concluded, \"[The defendant'] statements were aimed at misdirecting the agents, and this is enough to satisfy the materiality requirement of \u00a7 1001.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751727\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/657/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the same way, Schimenti made several false statements about his interactions with the CHS and the CHS's plan to obtain cell phones for ISIS that were aimed at misdirecting the FBI. For example, Schimenti falsely claimed that the CHS never told him that he was traveling to join ISIS and he did not provide the phones to be used by ISIS. The Court finds that Schimenti's statements had a natural tendency to influence the FBI's investigation of his conduct, even if the FBI had enough evidence at that point to know that he was lying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Schimenti also argues that \u00a7 1001 does not apply to statements made after the conclusion of a federal agency's investigation, pointing out that his alleged false statements were made after the FBI had conducted extensive surveillance of his activities and consequently arrested him. But again, the Court must accept as true all facts in the Superseding Indictment, and it alleges that, at the time Schimenti made the false statements, the FBI was still \"investigating possible violations of federal criminal law in connection with [Defendants] attempting to provide material support and resources to [ISIS].\" (Superseding Indictment at 3.) To the extent Schimenti's argument that the FBI had already concluded its investigation relates to the immateriality of his false statements, the Court reiterates that actual reliance by the federal agency is not a requirement under \u00a7 1001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Schimenti argues that the statutory maximum sentence for his alleged violation of \u00a7 1001 should be five years instead of eight years because his alleged false statements did not concern terrorism or any aspect of national security.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under \u00a7 1001, a defendant faces a maximum imprisonment of eight years if\n   his false statements \"involve[ ] international or domestic terrorism.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The term \"international terrorism\" is defined to include activities that meet three requirements: (1) the activities must involve \"violent acts or acts dangerous to human life,\" (2) they must appear to be intended to \"intimidate or coerce a civilian population,\" \"influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,\" or \"affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping,\" and (3) they must occur primarily outside of the United States.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202331\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Here, the Superseding Indictment charges Schimenti with making false statements about his knowledge and support of the CHS's plan to join ISIS, as well as his provision of cell phones to ISIS for use as bomb detonators. If the CHS indeed joined ISIS, he would be adding to the ranks of an organization that engages in international terrorism. And if carried out, an ISIS bombing would qualify as an act of international terrorism. Therefore, the Court determines that Schimenti's false statements clearly concerned terrorism, and the appropriate statutory maximum sentence under \u00a7 1001 is eight years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Defendants' joint motion to dismiss Count I of the Superseding Indictment (Dkt. No. 85) and Defendant Schimenti's motion to dismiss Count II of the Superseding Indictment (Dkt. No. 86) are both denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Court construes Schimenti's arguments in this respect as a motion raising a defect in the indictment or information under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3)(B), rather than a motion to dismiss the indictment.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
