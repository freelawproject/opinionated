This Opinion &amp; Order addresses all pending motions, which seek dismissal of four separate amended complaints: (1) the First Amended and Supplemental Complaint of Plaintiff JBR, Inc. (d/b/a Rogers Family Company) (\"Rogers\"), a privately held roaster, packager, and seller of coffee products, which alleges that Keurig has engaged in anticompetitive practices that had the effect of excluding Rogers from the market for cups or pods used in Keurig's single-server brewer machines, (No. 14-CV-4242, Doc. 83 (the \"Rogers Amended Complaint\" or \"Rogers AC\")); (2) the Amended and Supplemental Complaint of Plaintiff TreeHouse Foods, Inc., a food manufacturer operating in the United States, as well as its wholly-owned subsidiaries Plaintiff Bay Valley Foods, LLC (\"Bay Valley\") and Plaintiff Sturm Foods,\n   Inc.

The DPP Amended Complaint alleges claims for common law unjust enrichment under the laws of the fifty states and the District of Columbia, (DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 290-300), and the IPP Second Amended Complaint raises claims for common law unjust enrichment under the laws of seventeen states and the District of Columbia, (IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 481-516).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Rogers Amended Complaint also alleges claims for violation of the California Cartwright Act, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 389-90), and for: (1) violation of the California False Advertising Law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 393-97); (2) violation of the California Unfair Competition\n   Law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 398-406); (3) violation of California common law unfair competition, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 391-92); (4) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage under California law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 407-11); and (5) intentional interference with contractual relations under California law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 412-14). The TreeHouse Amended Complaint also alleges claims for violations of: (1) the Illinois Antitrust Act, (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 569-602, 611-38, 650-53); (2) the Wisconsin Antitrust Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 569-602, 611-38, 654-57); (3) the New York Donnelly Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 577-84, 625-38, 644-45); (4) the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 639-43); (5) the New York Consumer Protection Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); (6) the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 639-43, 646-49); and (7) Wisconsin common law unfair competition, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 658-61). The TreeHouse Amended Complaint also alleges claims for negligent and intentional interference with business relations under New York law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 662-70), tortious interference with contract under New York Law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 671-77), tortious interference with contract under Wisconsin law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 678-80), tortious interference with prospective business expectancy under Illinois law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 681-84), and tortious interference with contract under Illinois law, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 685-91). The IPP Second Amended Complaint alleges violations of the antitrust and unfair competition laws of twenty-one states and the District of Columbia, (IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 225-50, 295-447), and the consumer protection and unfair trade practices laws of six states, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 448-80). Keurig purports to move to dismiss the amended complaints in each action in their entirety under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I held oral argument on these motions on July 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Keurig's motions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Keurig's Products and the Relevant Markets\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Keurig manufactures and sells Single Serve Brewers\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Portion Packs\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in,\n   among other places, the United States. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 82; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 3; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7; IPP SAC \u00b6 7.) Keurig introduced the K-Cup Brewer,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the first commercially successful Single Serve Brewer, to the United States market in or around 1998. (Rogers AC \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   IPP SAC \u00b6 110.) While Portion Packs come in many different forms, to be usable with a particular Single Serve Brewer, a Portion Pack must be compatible with that Single Serve Brewer. (DPP AC \u00b6 8.) The same year it introduced the K-Cup Brewer, Keurig introduced its branded Portion Packs, or K-Cups,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   which are compatible with and used in K-Cup Brewers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 110.) Today, K-Cups also include Portion Packs licensed by Keurig that are compatible with K-Cup Brewers. (Rogers AC \u00b6 31; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 4; DPP AC \u00b6 9; IPP SAC \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   K-Cups are not the only Portion Packs that are compatible with K-Cup Brewers. Keurig's competitors, including Rogers and TreeHouse, manufacture, distribute, and sell their own Competitor Cups,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which are Portion Packs that are compatible with K-Cup Brewers. (Rogers AC \u00b6 31; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 105-06; DPP AC \u00b6 9; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.) Compatible Cups\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   -Portion\n   Packs that are compatible with K-Cup Brewers-thus include (i) K-Cups, and (ii) Competitor Cups. (Rogers AC \u00b6 31; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 105-06; DPP AC \u00b6 9; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Since Keurig's initial introduction, Keurig has designed, manufactured, and sold a variety of different K-Cup Brewers marketed either for use in the individual consumer's home or for use outside the home at locations such as office buildings, hotels, and gas stations. (Rogers AC \u00b6 19.) K-Cup Brewers are compatible only with Compatible Cups, and Portion Packs designed to work in other Single Serve Brewers are not compatible with K-Cup Brewers. (IPP SAC \u00b6 93.) Keurig has dominated the markets for the design, manufacture, and sale of Single Serve Brewers, Portion Packs, and Compatible Cups. Specifically, in the United States, Keurig controls at least 89% of the market for Single Serve Brewers (the \"Single Serve Brewer Market\"), 73% of the market for Portion Packs (the \"Portion Pack Market\"), and 95% of the market for Compatible Cups (the \"Compatible Cup Market\"). (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 27, 46, 59; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 6, 83, 128, 151; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 69, 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Growing Competition Against Keurig\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Until 2012, Keurig had patents covering the filter technology used in its K-Cups (\"K-Cup Filter Patents\"). (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 4; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 15; IPP SAC \u00b6 125.) Virtually all Compatible Cups on the market were K-Cups until 2010. (Rogers AC \u00b6 34.) In 2010, TreeHouse decided to undertake a substantial investment in order to enter the Compatible Cup market, (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 210), but because the K-Cup Filter Patents covering the use of filters in Portion Packs had not yet expired, TreeHouse decided to manufacture and sell Competitor Cups that did not contain filters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 214.) In August 2010, TreeHouse subsidiary Sturm introduced the first Compatible Cups for use in K-Cup Brewers that were neither sold by Keurig nor under a Keurig license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 215; Rogers AC \u00b6 35; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 126-27; IPP SAC \u00b6 128.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In October 2011, Rogers introduced to the market its first Compatible Cups for use in K-Cup Brewers, in its proprietary OneCup format under its \"San Francisco Bay\" and \"Organic Coffee Company\" brands. (Rogers AC \u00b6 36.) Rogers' initial version of OneCup reduced the environmental footprint and contained 30% to 35% less packaging than other Compatible Portion Packs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In October 2013, Rogers introduced a unique 97% biodegradable Compatible Cup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rogers sells or has sold its packs through retailers such as Costco and Amazon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 289.) Sales of its OneCup Portion Pack account for more than 40% of Rogers' business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 277.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When the K-Cup Filter Patents expired in 2012, a number of companies launched, or announced plans to launch, Portion Packs compatible with K-Cup Brewers. (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 15, 216-18.) TreeHouse launched its first filtered Competitor Cups in the Fall of 2012, which were sold at a lower price than Keurig's filtered K-Cups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 219.) Between September 2012 and December 2013, TreeHouse subsidiary Bay Valley entered into supply arrangements with dozens of retailers for filtered Competitor Cups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 220.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Keurig's Anti-Competitive Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Threatened by this competitive pressure, Keurig took various steps to regain\n   its \"complete control\" of the market for Competitor Cups, including (i) filing baseless lawsuits against Rogers and TreeHouse, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 158-75; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 226-40; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 125-38; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 124-35); (ii) entering into \"non-competition,\" tying, and exclusive dealing agreements and threatening companies who would do business with Compatible Cup manufacturers, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 87-154; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 225, 241-397; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 139-96; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 141-206); (iii) redesigning K-Cup Brewers and introducing the Keurig 2.0 K-Cup Brewer (the \"2.0 Brewer\") to lock out Competitor Cups and misinforming customers about the motivation for, and the abilities of, this lock-out technology, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 176-232; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 225, 398-458; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 221-35; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 136-40); and (iv) maligning Competitor Cups and otherwise interfering with competitors' business relationships, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 233-67; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 225, 459-548; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 197-220).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Patent Litigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Within a matter of weeks after Sturm's introduction of its Competitor Cups, Keurig sued Sturm for patent and trademark infringement and false advertising, (the \"TreeHouse Litigation\"). (Rogers AC \u00b6 158; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 228-30; DPP AC \u00b6 128; IPP SAC \u00b6 129.) The District Court for the District of Delaware dismissed Keurig's patent claims on summary judgment, which Keurig appealed. (Rogers AC \u00b6 163; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 235; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 131-33; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 130-31.) The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling, reasoning that Keurig was attempting to make an \"end-run\" around the patent laws with \"a tactic that the Supreme Court has explicitly admonished,\" and that it was attempting \"to impermissibly restrict purchasers of Keurig brewers from using non-Keurig [Competitor Cups] by invoking patent law.\" (Rogers AC \u00b6 170 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Keurig, Inc. v. Sturm Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710075\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1370/#p1374\">\n    732 F.3d 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1374 (Fed.

(Rogers AC \u00b6 158; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 239; DPP AC \u00b6 136; IPP SAC \u00b6 133.) In May 2013, the District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted Rogers' motion for summary judgment, holding that Rogers' designs were \"sufficiently distinct\" and quoted the district court's decision in the TreeHouse Litigation in admonishing Keurig for \"attempting to institute a postsale restriction that prevents non-Keurig cartridges from being used in Keurig brewers.\" (Rogers AC \u00b6 321 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Keurig, Inc. v.

After Keurig appealed, the Federal Circuit Court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in Rogers' favor. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 171, 322; IPP SAC \u00b6 135.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Keurig pursued its claims relying on a theory of liability that had been previously rejected by the United States Supreme Court, as noted by the Federal Circuit in denying Keurig's appeal of the District Court's ruling in the TreeHouse action. (Rogers AC \u00b6 170; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 236; DPP AC \u00b6 133; IPP SAC \u00b6 131.) Plaintiffs allege that Keurig's patent claims had no objective basis, and they imposed costs on competitors and cast a cloud over the legality and legitimacy of competitors' products, which impeded market acceptance of those products and deterred other competitors from entering the market. (Rogers\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 172-74; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 238-40; DPP AC \u00b6 138; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 124-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Exclusive and Restrictive Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Keurig has entered into over 600 exclusive and restrictive agreements with various entities involved in the line of manufacture and distribution of Compatible Cups, as well as with potential competitors. For example, Keurig entered into exclusive agreements with, or otherwise coerced, suppliers of the machinery required to manufacture Compatible Cups; suppliers of the cups, lids, and filters required in Compatible Cups; and suppliers of the lock-out technology, a special taggant ink that is included on the lid of the Compatible Cup, incorporated in the 2.0 Brewer, to keep competitors from sourcing the technology. (Treehouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 54, 143, 244-85, 401; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 169-91; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 141-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition, Keurig has locked up virtually all of the distributors who provide Compatible Cups for use outside of the home (the \"Away-From-Home Market Segment\") in long-term exclusive contracts. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 87-106; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 162-68; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 173-200.) Keurig-in an apparent effort to foreclose the entry of or expansion by competitors in the home use market-entered into exclusive contracts with large retailers that serve the consumers who use Compatible Cups at home (the \"At-Home Market Segment\"), (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 107-11; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 162-68; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 173-200). That effort has been aided by Keurig's exclusive contracts with numerous major coffee brands (\"Roasters\"), which limited the ability of Roasters to provide inputs to or enter into other agreements with Competitor Cup manufacturers, as well as prevent Roasters from entering the Single Serve Brewer Market. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 112-54; Treehouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 286-330; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 139-61; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 153-72.) As of November 2014, Keurig admitted that it has \"now signed the large majority of previously unlicensed portion pack volume to our system and we're in the process of transitioning these brands.\" (Rogers AC \u00b6 201 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Keurig Green Moutain's (GMCR) CEO Brian Kelley on Q4 2014 Results - Earnings Call Transcript\n   </em>\n   , Seeking Alpha (Nov. 20, 2014), http://seekingalpha.com/article/2697145-keurig-green-mountains-gmcr-ceo-brian-kelley-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-calltranscript?all=true &amp;find=keurig).) Keurig also eliminated potential competitors through acquisitions of competitors and previous licensees. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 155-57; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 122-24; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 118-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. False Advertising and Promotional Efforts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Keurig has engaged in false, deceptive, and/or misleading advertising and promotional efforts directed at consumers and retail customers regarding the key qualities and characteristics of its K-Cup Brewers, K-Cups, and Competitor Cups made by TreeHouse, Rogers, and others. (Rogers AC \u00b6 233; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 459-62; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 197-220.) Those efforts were intended to and did drive up Keurig's own sales while eliminating or diminishing competition from Competitive Cup makers by sullying their reputations. (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 459.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For example, despite learning that competitors had developed Compatible Cups that worked in the 2.0 Brewer, Keurig has continued to convey to purchasers of the 2.0 Brewers through the packaging and the promotional materials provided with the brewers that only Keurig brand cups would work with the 2.0 Brewer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 471.) The packaging of the 2.0 Brewer states \"Works only with Keurig Brand Packs,\" and the user manual warns consumers that their \"Keurig 2.0 brewer will\n   not work with packs that don't have the Keurig logo,\" among other misrepresentations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 472.) The 2.0 Brewer itself displays the misleading message that \"[t]his pack wasn't designed for this brewer\" when a consumer attempts to use a Competitive Cup in it. (Rogers AC \u00b6 251;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TreeHouse AC \u00b6 472.) In addition, Keurig through its websites, social media, and customer service representatives, disseminated false and misleading messaging regarding quality and safety issues with respect to Competitor Cups. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 246-47, 253; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 473; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 199, 202-11.) Such statements caused or likely will cause consumers to mistakenly believe that only K-Cups work with 2.0 Brewers, and therefore that they have to buy higher priced K-Cups rather than Competitor Cups to use their 2.0 Brewers. (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 478; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 218-20.) Keurig has also made misstatements to consumers about quality and safety issues with the use of non-Keurig cups in the 2.0 Brewer, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 234-37, 240-42; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 479-92), about how use of unlicensed Compatible Cups affects the brewer warranty, (Rogers AC \u00b6 238; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 493-99; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 213-15), as well as misrepresentations made to both consumers and retailers about compatibility and quality issues, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 256-67; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 501-28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    4. 2.0 Brewer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Keurig successfully implemented a plan, known as \"Project Squid,\" to recapture market share lost to unlicensed Competitive Cup makers by designing a brewer that would only function with K-Cup and Keurig-licensed Compatible Cups. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 176-91; Treehouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 398-403;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 221-35; IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 136-40.) The new brewer, referred to as the \"2.0 Brewer,\" was solely intended to further lock out competitors. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 183, 190; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 398, 401; IPP SAC \u00b6 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In or about July 2012, Keurig began working on an \"authentication\" mechanism with Sagentia, a global product development firm, that would enable Keurig to manufacture Single Serve Brewers that provide degraded or non-functionality when used with competitors' Portion Packs. (Rogers AC \u00b6 177; Treehouse AC \u00b6 400.) Keurig thus developed a \"taggant,\" a special kind of ink, which could be identified by the 2.0 Brewer's sensors to authenticate that the Portion Pack was a Keurig or Keurig-licensed pack. (Rogers AC \u00b6 184; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 503.) Keurig announced the 2.0 Brewer in November 2013. (Rogers AC \u00b6 192.) In connection with the rollout, Keurig knowingly made false representations that its lockout technology had consumer benefits, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 214-32; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 404-31; DPP AC \u00b6 271), and disparaged all Competitor Cups, including those of Rogers and TreeHouse, to retailers, distributors, consumers, and the general public, (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 233-67; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 463-548; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 197-220). Although advertised as a closed system with technology that would not allow the brewer to function with non-Keurig or Keurig-licensed Portion Packs, (Rogers AC \u00b6 192), some competitors have reverse-engineered 2.0 Brewer-compatible Portion Packs, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 457, 465).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Effects of Keurig's Anti-Competitive Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Keurig's anti-competitive conduct has negatively impacted competition in the Portion Pack Market, and the Compatible Cup Market. (Rogers AC \u00b6 268; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 549.) This has resulted in harm to manufacturers of Competitor Cups, including Rogers and TreeHouse, potential market entrants, distributors, retailers,\n   and consumers. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 268-89; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 551-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   More specifically, through its anti-competitive conduct, Keurig is able to sell its K-Cup Brewers at or below cost to create a captive base of consumers while at the same time selling its K-Cups to those consumers at supra-competitive prices. (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 131, 196, 587; DPP AC \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rogers AC \u00b6 314.) Keurig's anti-competitive conduct has thus caused consumers to pay supra-competitive prices for K-Cups. (IPP SAC \u00b6\u00b6 32-35.) In particular, Keurig's conduct has had the effect of overcharging the DPPs, who are direct purchasers of K-Cups. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) Direct purchasers, in turn, passed these overcharges on to the IPPs, who are end-user consumers of K-Cups, either directly or through intermediaries. (IPP SAC \u00b6 30.) The IPPs claim that because the distribution channel for K-Cups \"is not complex, generally involving only one or two intermediaries between Keurig and the [IPPs],\" and because K-Cups are individual products that remain unaltered through the distribution chain, \"the chain of commerce for this market allows for the tracing of overcharges that have passed through the chain of commerce to [IPPs].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On February 11, 2014, TreeHouse filed a complaint against Keurig alleging antitrust and related violations. (No. 14-CV-905, Doc. 2.) Shortly thereafter, on March 13, 2014, Rogers filed its complaint in the Eastern District of California. (No. 14-CV-4242, Doc. 1.) The Rogers and TreeHouse lawsuits were two of many similar actions filed in early 2014 in federal district courts around the country alleging that Keurig engaged in unlawful anticompetitive conduct related to the 2.0 Brewer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among those suits were numerous actions filed by individual direct purchasers and individual indirect purchasers. On March 20, 2014, the named plaintiff in one of the related cases moved the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") to centralize all of the cases concerning the 2.0 in a single multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\") in this District. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1.) The proposed MDL encompassed three types of actions: direct purchaser class actions, indirect purchaser class actions, and individual actions by Competitor Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Although the Competitor Plaintiffs opposed centralization, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), the JPML concluded that all of the related actions, including those filed by the direct purchasers and indirect purchasers, raised \"virtually identical factual questions concerning the conduct of Keurig.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) On June 3, 2014, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the JPML transferred these related actions to this District and assigned the action to me for consolidated pretrial proceedings as part of the MDL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) On May 28, 2014, I appointed interim co-lead counsel for the Named Plaintiffs and proposed direct purchaser Plaintiff class. (No. 14-CV-1609, Doc. 19.) On June 26, 2014, I appointed interim co-lead counsel for the Named Plaintiffs and proposed indirect purchaser Plaintiff class. (Doc. 36.) On July 24, 2014, the DPPs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint, (Doc. 65), and the IPPs filed a Consolidated Amended Indirect Purchaser Class Action Complaint, (Doc. 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On August 11, 2014, Rogers filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction. (Doc. 84.) I denied the motion on September 19, 2014, finding that Rogers had not made a clear showing that it is imminently likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the requested injunction. (Docs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   145, 160.) On August 5, 2014, I issued an order setting the schedule for Keurig's anticipated motions to dismiss. (Doc. 70.) In accordance with that schedule, Keurig filed motions to dismiss the four consolidated actions, (Docs. 162, 165, 168, 171), on October 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rogers filed its Amended Complaint on December 8, 2014, (No. 14-CV-4242, Doc. 83), TreeHouse filed its Amended Complaint on December 2, 2014, (No. 14-CV-905, Doc. 86), the DPPs served their Amended Complaint on November 25, 2014, (No. 14-CV-1609, Doc. 42),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the IPPs served their Second Amended Complaint on November 25, 2014, (Doc. 206).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, consistent with the briefing schedule proposed by the parties, (Doc. 215), on February 2, 2015, Keurig filed its motions to dismiss (1) Rogers' Amended Complaint, (Docs. 226-28); (2) TreeHouse's Amended Complaint, (Docs. 223-25); (3) the DPPs' Amended Complaint, (Docs. 229-30), and (4) the IPPs' Second Amended Complaint, (Docs. 231-32). On April 13, 2015, Rogers filed a memorandum in opposition to Keurig's motion to dismiss, (Doc. 253), as did TreeHouse, (Doc. 254), the DPPs, (Docs. 251-52), and the IPPs, (Doc. 255).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Keurig filed replies in further support of its motion to dismiss the DPPs' Amended Complaint on May 11, 2015, (Doc. 261), and in further support of its motions to dismiss the Rogers' Amended Complaint, (Docs. 265-66), the TreeHouse Amended Complaint, (Doc. 264), and the IPPs' Second Amended Complaint on May 13, 2015, (Doc. 267).

Although the efficient enforcer factors related to damages may not be directly relevant to an action for injunctive relief, the principles underlying those factors still inform the analysis. As District Court Judge Katherine Forrest articulated when applying the\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   factors to dismiss a claim by a class of indirect purchasers seeking injunctive relief in an antitrust case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   In this regard, issues with complex and speculative damages concern the fact and nature of harm (that is, damage) as much as a calculation of dollars and cents. Is determining the fact of damage complex? Does remedying plaintiff's injury through injunctive relief present complex issues?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Similarly, to assess the potential for duplicative recovery, the Court must reasonably ask not only whether there is another plaintiff who will recover a quantum that would account for monetary damage, but also whether the relief one plaintiff seeks more generally (such as injunctive relief), is being adequately pursued by another, better situated-party. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   factors are reasonably applicable to actions in which only injunctive relief is sought. Finally, in all cases the court is cautioned to be mindful the manageability of litigation. That is, allowing actions to proceed in which plaintiffs seek overlapping relief and in which their presence provides no additional benefit may well add to manageability issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-md-2481 (KBF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204277510\">\n    2014 WL 4277510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17-18 (S.D.N.Y.

Although the conduct of which the DPPs complain largely targeted Keurig's direct competitors, such as TreeHouse and Rogers, the DPPs' alleged injury\n   of overcharge was \"inextricably intertwined\" with the conduct's anti-competitive effects and thus \"flow[ed] from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    McCready\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/\">\n    457 U.S. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190625\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/465/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The DPPs have therefore pled antitrust injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   With regard to the \"efficient enforcer\" factors that bear on whether the DPPs are \"proper\" antitrust plaintiffs, each factor supports the DPPs' antitrust standing. With regard to the directness of the injury, Keurig argues, citing to specific allegations of Keurig's anticompetitive scheme aimed at its competitors, that the claims of harm are \"attenuated.\" (DPP Def. Mem. 5-6.) Keurig's focus on the allegations related to the scheme is misplaced and misstates the DPPs' alleged harm: the payment of supra-competitive prices, set by Keurig, for K-Cups bought directly from Keurig or its agents. (DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 245, 258.) As an initial matter, the DPPs' injury-like the direct purchaser plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    DDAVP\n   </em>\n   -was that they were forced to pay \"supra-competitive prices as a result of defendants' anticompetitive conduct\" thereby preventing the competitive market entry of others and the lower prices that would have resulted for the direct purchasers.\n   <em>\n    In re DDAVP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p688\">\n    585 F.3d at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants in\n   <em>\n    DDAVP\n   </em>\n   -like Keurig here-argued that anticompetitive conduct targeted defendants' competitors and therefore the harm to the direct purchaser plaintiffs was too far removed. The Second Circuit rejected that argument. As was the case with the direct purchaser plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    DDAVP\n   </em>\n   , even though the injuries to the DPPs were \"derivative of the direct harm experienced by the defendants' competitors, harming competitors was simply a means for the defendants to charge the plaintiffs higher prices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p688\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The directness of the injury to DDPs-the payment of supra-competitive prices-supports the DPPs' antitrust standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As to the second factor, motivation and alternative enforcers, Keurig argues that TreeHouse and Rogers have filed lawsuits and are motivated to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement. (DPP Def. Mem. 6.) Here, Keurig attempts to argue that TreeHouse and Rogers are more motivated than the DPPs and that, therefore, the DPPs should not enjoy antitrust standing. This misstates the law; the issue is not what plaintiff is the most motivated. \"The second factor simply looks for a class of persons naturally motivated to enforce the antitrust laws.... Even if the competitors might be the most motivated, the plaintiffs are also significantly motivated due to their 'natural economic self-interest' in paying the lowest price possible.\"\n   <em>\n    In re DDAVP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p688\">\n    585 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   689 (citing\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280352\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/408/#p443\">\n    428 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   444 ). Moreover, because TreeHouse and Rogers are seeking lost profits while the DPPs are seeking overcharges, \"[d]enying the plaintiffs a remedy in favor of a suit by competitors would thus be 'likely to leave a significant antitrust violation undetected or unremedied.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280352\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/408/#p443\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    459 U.S. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The DPPs are motivated enforcers, and therefore this factor supports their antitrust standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Keurig argues further that the third and fourth factors, speculative nature of injury and difficulty of apportionment, weigh against the DPPs' standing because \"[t]he injury DPPs allege is highly speculative, with alleged damages that would be nearly impossible to determine.\" (DPP Def. Mem. 7.) However, I find that the nature of the alleged injury-the overpayment for K-Cups purchased directly from Keurig or its agents-is not speculative. With regard to apportionment, lost profits-sought by Keurig's competitors-are separate from the overcharges the DPPs seek to recover. However, \"[e]ven assuming some overlap\n   between lost profits and overcharges ..., the two are conceptually different measures that we think can be fairly apportioned in order to avoid duplicative recoveries.\"\n   <em>\n    In re DDAVP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p688\">\n    585 F.3d at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These factors also weigh in favor of the DPPs' standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Therefore, all four efficient enforcer factors support the DPPs antitrust standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Application to the IPPs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although the IPPs assert only a claim for injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws, they must still demonstrate antitrust standing to assert such a claim.\n   <em>\n    Paycom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803115\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/283/#p290\">\n    467 F.3d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that private antitrust plaintiffs must demonstrate antitrust standing whether they seek monetary or injunctive relief). Unlike the DPPs, the IPPs fail to sufficiently allege that they are efficient enforcers, and therefore, they lack antitrust standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   First, the IPPs' alleged injury is, by definition, indirect. The IPPs allege that they were \"end-user[s]\" who purchased Keurig K-Cups through distribution channels \"generally involving only one or two intermediaries\" between the IPPs and Keurig. (IPP SAC \u00b6 28.) They do not allege that Keurig directly overcharged them, but rather that one or more intermediaries passed on overcharges to the IPPs. The Supreme Court clearly admonished the use of pass-on theories to establish standing in treble damages actions, in part due to the concern that \"the massive evidence and complicated theories\" involved in tracing the effect of an overcharge through the distribution chain would impose \"burdens ... on the effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1590\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/720/#p741\">\n    431 U.S. 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1590\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/720/#p741\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1590\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/720/#p741\">\n    52 L.Ed.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). That concern is no less present in the context of an action for an injunction, as the question of whether a party several levels down in the distribution chain suffered an injury at all may be as complicated and indeed intertwined with quantifying the damages associated with the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, there are alternative enforcers that are better situated to bring suit, and have brought suit. The DPPs in particular seek injunctive relief that largely, if not completely, overlaps with the injunctive relief sought by the IPPs. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   DPP AC \u00b6 302(f)-(h),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   IPP SAC at 116.) Given the claims brought by the DPPs and the Competitor Plaintiffs, denying the IPPs' federal claims is not \"likely to leave a significant antitrust violation undetected or unremedied.\"\n   <em>\n    AGC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    459 U.S. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This factor, therefore, weighs against a finding of antitrust standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Third, and related to the directness inquiry, the IPPs' alleged injury is speculative\n   \"because the claimed damages are too indirect and may have been produced by factors independent from any alleged overcharge.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-MD-2420 YGR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204955377\">\n    2014 WL 4955377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2014). The IPP Second Amended Complaint alleges that \"[t]he distribution channel for Keurig K-Cups is not complex, generally involving only one or two intermediaries between Keurig and the end-user consumer Plaintiffs,\" (IPP SAC \u00b6 28), and that \"Keurig's anticompetitive conduct resulted in direct purchasers being overcharged for Keurig K-Cups, and such overcharges were passed on by direct purchasers to Plaintiffs and the members of the Classes in whole or in part,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). These conclusory allegations fail to describe with sufficient factual detail the chain of distribution between Keurig and the IPPs, leaving numerous questions unanswered. Who were the intermediaries? How often was there one intermediary versus two or more? How does one know to what extent, if at all, any of the intermediaries passed on the overcharges to the next link in the chain? The IPPs' Second Amended Complaint sheds no light on any of these questions, and thus, this factor weighs against a finding of antitrust standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204277510\">\n    2014 WL 4277510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *22 (dismissing claims when \"plaintiffs [were] one or more levels down the supply/distribution chain\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The IPPs emphasize that they \"purchased the exact product sold by Keurig,\" but just not directly from Keurig. (IPP Def. Mem. 11-12.) However, the fact that the product did not change as it flowed down the line of distribution does not preclude the possibility that independent factors, such as costs for transportation, handling, storage, or any other service-rather than overcharges passed down from Keurig-could have led to the IPPs' purported damages. The vague allegation that \"[t]he distribution channel for Keurig K-Cups is not complex,\" (IPP SAC \u00b6 28), does not cure the speculative nature of the alleged harm. Moreover, if the allegation is accurate the IPPs should have provided the details of the distribution channel-including its length-with more specificity since the IPPs have had ample opportunities to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, while the difficulty in apportioning damages would not hinder a finding of antitrust standing in this action for injunctive relief, the IPPs do request relief that is largely duplicative of the relief requested by the DPPs, as discussed above.

(Rogers Def. Mem. 16-22; TreeHouse Def. Mem. 27-32; DPP Def. Mem. 18-24.) Rogers, TreeHouse, and the DPPs allege two separate relevant product markets in which Keurig's anticompetitive conduct arose: (1) the Single Serve Brewer Market; and (2) the Compatible Cup Market. (Rogers AC \u00b6 17; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 64; DPP AC \u00b6 53.) The Competitor Plaintiffs also allege the Portion Pack Market as a third relevant product market.

First, with respect to Rogers' market-which it defines as the market for the design, manufacture, and sale of \"pressurized hot water brewing equipment that is capable of brewing at least a single serving of coffee or other hot beverages,\" (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 17)-Keurig argues that Rogers does not define what \"pressurized\" means and, because \"[a]ny brewer can brew 'at least one serving,' ... [Rogers is] gerrymandering a market definition to suit its case,\" (Rogers Def. Mem. 16). However, as Rogers alleges, Keurig itself defines \"competing systems\" as Rogers does in defining Single Serve Brewers. Specifically, Keurig's licensing agreements describe \"competing systems\" as having the following characteristics: (1) \"A brewing chamber designed to be pierced during the brewing process to allow hot water in and the brewed beverage out;\" and (2) \"[a] pressurized brewing process that takes place at pressures less than 30 psi inside the brewing chamber.\" (Rogers AC \u00b6 13). Further, in these agreements, Keurig clarifies that it does not compete with \"hopper-based single-cup coffee systems\" and \"espresso pod-based systems,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14), let alone standard drip brew coffee systems. In this vein, Rogers has sufficiently pled a market for Single Serve Brewers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Todd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454201\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/191/#p198\">\n    275 F.3d at 199-200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second, Keurig attempts to attack the market definition alleged by Rogers,\n   TreeHouse, and the DPPs by highlighting their allegations that Keurig sells its Single Serve Brewers at or below cost, (Rogers Def. Mem. 16 (citing Rogers AC \u00b6 314);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TreeHouse Def. Mem. 27-28; DPP Def.

In sum, pricing Single Serve Brewers at or below cost in no manner suggests that the Single Serve Brewer Market is somehow broader than defined, or that Keurig does not in fact enjoy monopoly power in that market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Third, the DPPs allege a Single Serve Brewers Market that is distinct from traditional coffee in that it is more convenient and efficient. Keurig argues that the DPPs' market definition fails because \"a difference in process or convenience does not create a plausible inference that end products do not compete.\" (DPP Def. Mem. 19.) However, the DPPs do not simply allege a difference in process but describe a difference in fact-the DPP Amended Complaint details why traditional drip coffee machines are not interchangeable with and do not compete with Single Serve Brewers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 55-58.) Further, Keurig's recitation of the law misses the mark because courts have found that functionality and consumer perspective is an important part of a market evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Payment Card Interchange Fee &amp; Merch.

For example, the Rogers Amended Complaint alleges that Keurig \"controls approximately 89% of total unit sales and 93% of total dollar sales in the Single Serve Brewer Market.\" (Rogers AC \u00b6 27.) Similarly, the TreeHouse Amended Complaint alleges that Keurig \"controls approximately 93% of the Single-Serve Brewer Market.\" (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 83, 87-88, 90-94.) The DPPs, in turn, allege that during the entire relevant time period,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Keurig has dominated the Single-Serve Brewer market with at least 88% market share. (DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 75, 101.) These allegations support an inference of a \"substantial monopoly\" and monopoly power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grinnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046547\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/563/#p570\">\n    384 U.S. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046547\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/563/#p570\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (87% is a \"substantial monopoly\");\n   <em>\n    Am.

In particular, Rogers alleges that, after taking steps to regain market share it lost to market entrants, as of November 2014, Keurig controls approximately 95% of the Compatible Cup Market. (Rogers AC \u00b6 46.) According to Rogers, the alternative Portion Pack Market, in addition to Compatible Cups, includes portion packs that do not fit in or work with K-Cup Brewers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Rogers alleges that, \"[a]s of early 2013, Keurig controls approximately 73% of the Portion Packs Market.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) TreeHouse alleges that in 2014, Keurig controlled 86% of the Compatible Cup Market and after taking steps to regain market share it lost to market entrants, Keurig now controls approximately 95% of the Compatible Cup Market. (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 125-30.) TreeHouse also alleges the same alternative Portion Pack Market, (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-57), and similarly claims that Keurig \"possesses and exercises monopoly power over the Portion Pack Market\" and \"controls over 73% of the Portion Pack Market,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151). The DPPs allege that Keurig, through outright brand ownership or exclusive licensing, controlled, at its lowest point, an 86% share of the Compatible Cup Market, which has grown to a 95% share as a result of Keurig's purported anticompetitive\n   conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 105-07, 113, 169, 242.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Keurig argues that both the Compatible Cup and Portion Pack Markets are \"aftermarkets\" for consumables, sold for use with the primary product, Single Serve Brewers, and therefore the allegations of market share alone are insufficient. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DPP Def. Mem. 21-23.) Keurig relies upon the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Xerox III\n   </em>\n   , which provided that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   [F]or a\n   <em>\n    nonmonopolist\n   </em>\n   producer of a durable good to be held to have monopoly power in the aftermarket for parts, service, or supplies, a plaintiff generally must show that (i) customers who own the good are \"locked in\" by the prohibitive costs of switching to an alternate product, and (ii) the lock-in permitted those customers to be exploited, either because (a) some limitation on information undermined their ability to know that the aftermarket goods and services were being sold at high prices, or (b) the defendant changed its aftermarket prices after the lock-in occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Xerox III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3781653\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/660/535/#p539\">\n    660 F. Supp. 2d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). As is clear, this case applies only to a \"nonmonopolist\" producer in the primary market; in other words, for\n   <em>\n    Xerox III\n   </em>\n   to apply, the Single Serve Brewer Market must be competitive. As discussed above, Plaintiffs have clearly alleged it is not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the correct standard to Plaintiffs' allegations, they have clearly alleged a plausible Compatible Cup Market and a plausible Portion Pack Market, in the alternative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Specifically, Rogers has alleged that Keurig has effectively restrained the Portion Pack and Compatible Cup Markets by (1) coercing distributors and retailers to enter into anticompetitive exclusive agreements that restrain market entry, exclude competitors, and unreasonably restrain competition; (2) conspiring with competitor roasters and coffee brands to enter into anticompetitive agreements to exclude competitors, unreasonably restrain competition, allocate markets, and limit output; (3) filing objectively and subjectively baseless litigations and appeals against manufacturers of Competitor Cups, including Rogers; (4) tying the purchase of K-Cups to the purchase of K-Cup Brewers in order to unreasonably restrain competition from Competitor Cup manufacturers; (5) interfering with Rogers' business relationships by making false and disparaging comments to customers and potential customers regarding Rogers' products; (6) threatening to unreasonably restrain competition through the introduction of technology that unnecessarily and unjustifiably excludes competitors from the Compatible Cup Market; (7) raising competitors' costs above those that would exist under competitive conditions by requiring the manufacturers of Competitor Cups to enter restrictive licensing agreements; and (8) making material misrepresentations to retailers, distributors, and consumers regarding the compatibility, performance, safety, and quality of Competing Portion Packs as compared to K-Cups. (Rogers AC \u00b6 297.) TreeHouse and the DPPs have asserted very similar, and often identical, allegations. (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 45, 572; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 8, 257.)

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rogers Def. Mem. 4-6.) Keurig notes that, \"[w]hen it comes to product design, a firm 'may generally bring its products to market whenever and however it chooses,' \" and that the only narrow exception to this \"rule\" would arise when a monopolist coerces consumers into buying a new product, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Berkey Photo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1440749\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/603/263/\">\n    603 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   287 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DPP Def.

Rogers \"cannot allege that consumers have been coerced into buying the 2.0 brewer\n   here,\" according to Keurig, because \"Keurig continues to make K-Cups that work in 1.0 brewers,\" and because Keurig did not and does not hide the fact that the 2.0 Brewer is designed to lock-out Competitor Cups.

In connection with TreeHouse's allegations that the introduction of the 2.0 Brewer was intended to lock competitors out of the market for Compatible Cups and maintain its monopoly, to the detriment of consumers, (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, 373, 385, 402-03, 422-32), Keurig also argues that it was not required to pre-disclose to its competitors how the 2.0 Brewer would function to facilitate their ability to reverse engineer Compatible Cups that would function with the machine and that it would be improper for me to consider whether the innovations in the 2.0 Brewer were necessary or if alternatives existed, (TreeHouse Def.

Rogers' Amended Complaint alleges that a stated objective in redesigning its brewer in 2012 was to \"redesign the K cup holders in new brewers to lock out the competitors.\" (Rogers AC \u00b6 183.) TreeHouse's Amended Complaint points to Keurig's Project Squid and the \"My K-Cup\" redesign project, with the stated objective to \"redesign the K-cup holders in new brewers to lock-out the competitors.\" (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 14.)

But that did not stop [Keurig] from pursuing a baseless lawsuit to try to keep Competitive Cups off the market.\"), \u00b6\u00b6 43, 227-28, 230-31. In addition, contrary to Keurig's argument, the DPPs do not merely allege \"that Keurig lost the prior [patent infringement] litigations.\" (DPP Def. Mem. 14.) Rather, the DPPs allege, consistent with their argument that the Patent Litigation was objectively baselessness, that \"[n]o reasonable litigant could have realistically expected to succeed on the merits of such claims, and, thus, Keurig's complaint was objectively baseless.\" (DPP AC \u00b6 129.) The DPPs go on to detail the deficient bases for the failed patent suits. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-38.) For example, Keurig alleged that Sturm's Compatible Cups infringed Keurig's patents directed at brewers and methods of brewing, not even asserting any patents covering K-Cups themselves. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.) These assertions are sufficient to allege objective baselessness, and therefore Plaintiffs have met the first prong of stating a sham\n   litigation claim. While Keurig attempts to argue that Rogers' allegations fail because it did not file a motion to dismiss the Patent Litigation and because the Federal Circuit heard argument on the appeal, which it would not have done if the appeal were frivolous, (Rogers Def. Mem. 7), neither of these facts are fatal to a sham litigation claim,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitsubishi Heavy Indus., Ltd. v. Gen. Elec.

Rogers alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   [R]ather than attempting to prove infringement, the real reason that Keurig initiated [the Patent Litigation] was to harm Rogers' and Sturm's ability to compete with Keurig's Compatible Portion Packs business by causing Rogers and Sturm to divert resources from marketing their respective Compatible Portion Packs businesses to defend against Keurig's claims and to incur substantial legal fees associated with their defenses, thereby increasing ... the costs [of] Rogers' and Sturm's Compatible Portion Pack products. On information and belief, Keurig initiated these suits to harm Rogers' and Sturm Foods' ability to compete with Keurig's Compatible Portion Packs business also by creating confusion and doubt among Rogers' and Sturm's potential and existing customers about the commercial viability of Rogers' and Sturm's Compatible Portion Pack products, and by delaying Rogers' and Sturm's ability to grow their respective Compatible Portion Pack businesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   (Rogers AC \u00b6 174.) Similarly, TreeHouse alleges that the Patent Litigation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   [W]as instituted in an attempt to interfere with TreeHouse's ability to compete in the Compatible Cup Market, to intimidate market entrants, to raise a rival's costs, to harm TreeHouse's reputation, to sow doubt and confusion as to the legality of purchasing and selling Competitive Cups, and to deprive TreeHouse of resources that would have otherwise been spent on bringing more Competitive Cups to consumers at favorable prices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 238.) The DPPs also allege that Keurig filed the sham suits against its competitors \"for the purpose of interfering with their ability to compete in the Compatible Cup Market.\" (DPP AC \u00b6 257.) The Competitor Plaintiffs and the DPPs have therefore adequately pled objective baselessness and direct interference with their business relationships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prof'l Real Estate Inv'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/#p60\">\n    508 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/#p60\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In connection with the DPPs, Keurig also argues that the DPPs' allegations that the patent suits were subjectively baseless are conclusory. (DPP Def. Mem. 15.) However, the DPPs point specifically to language in the opinions of the district and circuit courts positing that Keurig was misusing patent law to improperly interfere with competitors and take control of the Compatible Cup Market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 132, 137.) For example, the DPPs quote the Federal Circuit: \"Keurig is attempting to impermissibly restrict purchasers of Keurig brewers from using non-Keurig [Compatible Cups] by invoking patent law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Keurig, Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rogers Def. Mem. 8.) However, Rogers alleges that it \"devoted significant resources to the defense against these baseless claims, including approximately $ 2 million in legal costs and fees,\" (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 173, 329), and TreeHouse alleges that, \"[a]s a result of this sham litigation and appeal, Plaintiffs were forced to incur three years' worth of litigation fees and costs, rather than use those resources to compete against [Keurig]. Competition in the market for Compatible Cups has thus been harmed,\" (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 602). Litigation costs incurred in defending against a sham litigation are \"a well recognized type of antitrust injury....\"\n   <em>\n    Bio-Tech. Gen. Corp. v. Genentech, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7836391\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/886/377/#p380\">\n    886 F.

Cir. 1995). Additionally, the DPP Amended Complaint makes clear that Keurig filed the sham suits against its competitors \"for the purpose of interfering with their ability to compete in the Compatible Cup Market.\" (DPP AC \u00b6 257.) Therefore, the Competitor Plaintiffs, and the DPPs have adequately alleged antitrust injury in connection with this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Keurig also challenges the Competitor Plaintiffs' patent misuse claim for lack of a live controversy. Keurig argues that to state a claim for patent misuse, requires an \"affirmative act\" to enforce patents; a subjective fear of harm will not suffice. (Rogers Def. Mem. 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Prasco LLC v. Medicis Pharm. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129395\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/1329/#p1338\">\n    537 F.3d 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1338-39 (Fed.

Mem. 26), and, to the extent the patent misuse claim arises from the introduction of the 2.0 Brewer, that TreeHouse has not alleged any attempted patent use or threat of patent litigation connected to the 2.0 Brewer, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \"Patent misuse relates primarily to a patentee's actions that affect competition in unpatented goods or that otherwise extend the economic effect beyond the scope of the patent grant.\"\n   <em>\n    C.R.

The Competitor Plaintiffs allege the same,\n   as well as a Portion Pack Market in the alternative to a Compatible Cup Market. Rogers alleges that Keurig's exclusive agreements with \"Keurig Authorized Re-Distributors\" and large distributors foreclose Competitor Cup manufacturers' access to approximately 80% of the Compatible Cup Market sales to Away-From-Home customers, (Rogers AC \u00b6 98); that Keurig has exclusive agreements with retailers and distributors for the At-Home Market Segment that prohibits them from marketing any Competitor Cups, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107-08); and that Keurig has exclusive agreements with competitor brands and roasters that restrict them from selling products to, licensing brands to, or allowing Competitor Cup manufacturers to manufacture Competitor Cups for the brand, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 120-21). TreeHouse alleges that Keurig \"has entered into unduly restrictive, anticompetitive, and exclusionary agreements with companies at every level of the Compatible Cup distribution system\" which \"are not only unduly restrictive and unreasonable in length, but also serve the anticompetitive purpose of substantially foreclosing competitors from access to resources they need to compete with.\" (TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 241-42;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 185.) The DPPs allege that Keurig dominates the Single Serve Brewer and Compatible Cup Markets, with an 88% and 95% share, respectively, of each. (DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 101, 107.) The DPPs allege that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Keurig, at its lowest market-share point, controlled approximately 86% of the Compatible Cup Market. The remaining 14% of the Compatible Cup Market was then composed of sellers of unlicensed and private label Competitor Cups. Responding to this market share loss to Competitor Cups, Keurig reinforced its anti-competitive scheme by, among other actions, furthering its web of exclusionary arrangements throughout the Compatible Cup supply and distribution chain. As a result, Keurig has almost entirely recouped its lost market share and now controls roughly 95% of the Compatible Cup Market.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107 (internal footnote omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   These allegations notwithstanding, Keurig points to Plaintiffs' allegations that they and other competitors have continued selling Competitor Cups and, in some circumstances, have increased sales of Competitor Cups despite Keurig's alleged anti-competitive conduct. (Rogers Def. Mem. 9; TreeHouse Def. Mem. 7; DPP Def. Mem. 8-9.) Keurig argues that \"courts in this Circuit and others have found no foreclosure where competitors experienced a 'sales increase,' and even where competitors simply 'remained in the market and successfully competed.' \" (Rogers Def.

First, it ignores the allegations that Keurig's exclusionary contracts have substantially foreclosed competition in the Portion Pack and Compatible Cup Markets causing the Competitor Plaintiffs to lose significant sales and profits, Keurig's profits to increase, and the DPPs to pay supra-competitive prices for K-Cups. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rogers AC \u00b6 310; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 6, 130, 366-72; DPP AC \u00b6\u00b6 107, 112.) Second, it misreads the law on substantial foreclosure, which does not require a complete lack of growth to sustain a Section 2 claim. \"Of course, the law has never required complete market exclusion as a prerequisite to suit. Indeed, some successful \u00a7 2 plaintiffs have both grown their market\n   shares and earned high profits even through the period that the exclusionary practices were occurring.\" 3 Phillip E.

Keurig challenges the Plaintiffs' allegations by arguing that \"alleging substantial foreclosure requires both a numerator (the partners allegedly locked up) and a denominator (all of the available partners).\" (Rogers Def.

(Rogers Def. Mem. 10; TreeHouse Def. Mem. 11; DPP Def. Mem. 12.) Similarly, Keurig maintains that there are no allegations that competitors are foreclosed from competing to work with Keurig's established partners, such as Kroger or BJ's, who contracted with Keurig after working with Rogers, (Rogers Def. Mem. 10), or Starbucks and Wolfgang Puck, with whom TreeHouse competed for deals, (DPP Def.

As the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Cargill\n   </em>\n   went on to clarify, \"the antitrust laws do not require the courts to protect small businesses from the loss of profits due to continued competition, but only against the loss of profits from practices forbidden by the antitrust laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Cargill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212134\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/104/\">\n    479 U.S. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212134\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/104/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed in detail, Plaintiffs have alleged various practices that run afoul of the antitrust laws and that Keurig has undertaken a scheme of various anticompetitive and unlawful acts to restrict the normal functioning\n   of a healthy competitive market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rogers AC \u00b6 8; TreeHouse AC \u00b6 2; DPP AC \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   2)\n   <em>\n    Substantial Foreclosure Based on Input Contracts\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Keurig argues that TreeHouse and the DPPs improperly limit their allegations to domestic suppliers of inputs. (TreeHouse Def. Mem. 9; DPP Def. Mem. 9-10.) To the contrary, however, TreeHouse and the DPPs have plausibly alleged a national geographic market based on the \"area to which consumers can practically turn for alternative sources of the product and in which the antitrust defendants face competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Heerwagen v. Clear Channel Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"936143\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/219/#p228\">\n    435 F.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 228 (2d Cir. 2006),\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Initial Pub.

TreeHouse clearly alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   The relevant geographic market is the United States. To compete effectively within the United States, Compatible Cup manufacturers and sellers need distribution assets and relationships within the United States. Compatible Cup manufacturers and sellers located outside of the United States that lack such assets and relationships are unable to constrain the prices of Compatible Cup manufacturers and sellers that have such domestic assets and relationships.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 191.) TreeHouse further alleges, with regard to machinery, that \"[b]eing forced unnecessarily to obtain large machinery from overseas ... substantially raises TreeHouse's and other Competitive Cup makers' costs, thereby depriving Competitive Cup makers of fair competition on the merits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 256.) In sum, TreeHouse has adequately alleged a national geographic market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Finally, Keurig challenges TreeHouse's and the DPPs' exclusive dealing claims by noting that although TreeHouse and other competitors had to expend resources to train suppliers when they were not able to contract with existing input suppliers, TreeHouse has no right to free-ride on Keurig's developments and investments, and that this does not harm competition generally. (TreeHouse Def. Mem. 9-10; DPP Def. Mem. 11.) First, Keurig indeed may seek to limit how competitors or potential competitors might free-ride on its investments. However, Keurig may not unlawfully restrict other parties in its manufacturing and distribution chain from contracting with competitors-TreeHouse and the DPPs allege that Keurig is not protecting against free-riding on its own investments, but is rather blocking competitors from accessing inputs and distribution networks that others created. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 242, 581 (Keurig's exclusive dealing agreements \"serve the anticompetitive purpose of substantially foreclosing competitors from access to resources they need to compete with [Keurig]\"); DPP AC \u00b6 170 (\"Keurig restricts the ability of machinery manufacturers to sell machinery to Keurig competitors who intend to use it to make Compatible Cups, but allows machinery manufacturers to sell the same machinery for other purposes.

Here, Rogers has alleged that, through various anticompetitive agreements Keurig has removed the potential for competition from the largest roasters and brands that would be the most likely to compete against Keurig-branded Portion Packs.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   For example, the 2013 \"Noncompetition Agreement Between Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. and Global Baristas, LLC\" provides that [Keurig's brand] Tully's \"will not, and will cause its respective subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, operate in the Coffee Business in [the] United States of America, Canada, Mexico and the Islands of the Caribbean\" for five years. Although Global Baristas concurrently entered into a supply and license agreement for Keurig to supply K-Cups using the Tully's brand, the broad prohibition on competition is not reasonably necessary or tailored to achieve any procompetitive effects associated with that arrangement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   (Rogers AC \u00b6 122 (internal citation omitted).) Use of such agreements has permitted Keurig to \"eliminate[ ] competition with the largest roasters and brands that would otherwise have the most financial incentives to enter into the Single Serve Brewer Market and to work with Competing Portion Pack manufacturers to increase output or decrease prices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Similarly, TreeHouse alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   [Keurig] itself is a roaster that owns its own brand names, [and therefore] would be a direct, horizontal competitor of other roasters and brands, but for its \"Non-Competition\" agreements with those companies....

Further, TreeHouse alleges that by entering into an unlawful scheme, \"[Keurig] and its [Licensees] can limit competition from lower-priced Competitive Cups by agreeing ... not to do business with Competitive Cup manufacturers unless they also become licensed and cede control of their pricing and output to [Keurig] in order to elevate prices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 299;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 286-300.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Keurig challenges these allegations by pointing to case law that finds supply agreements-such as those covering intellectual property, distribution, or manufacturing-to be vertical rather than horizontal agreements.

The Second Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Toshiba\n   </em>\n   that, under the facts of that case, the distributor plaintiff and manufacturer defendant were party to vertical agreements even though they also happened to compete at the distribution level (the manufacturer distributed its products independently as well as through a distributor in a so-called \"dual distribution\" arrangement).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11894100\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/240/#p246\">\n    129 F.3d at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, that is not what is alleged here. The Competitor Plaintiffs allege that Keurig entered into agreements with licensees who would otherwise compete in the Compatible Cup Market, and who would potentially seek to enter and compete in the Single Serve Brewer Market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 122-23; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 286-300.) Such anticompetitive agreements are directly related to the competitive landscape in the Compatible Cup and Single Serve Brewer Markets, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Toshiba\n   </em>\n   , where the market in which the parties happened to compete was not relevant to the anticompetitive claims. While Rogers includes only one example of a specific agreement with a potential competitor, (Rogers AC \u00b6 122), this, coupled with allegations that Keurig has entered into similar agreements with other potential competitors, is sufficient to state a claim for horizontal agreement in restraint of trade, as are TreeHouse's Section 1 claims based on purported unlawful horizontal agreements among competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Next, Keurig challenges the Competitor Plaintiffs' allegations of a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, arguing that Rogers fails to allege any agreement among the \"spokes\" and that TreeHouse fails to allege agreement among the brand owners or any other possible \"spokes.\" (Rogers Def. Mem. 23; TreeHouse Def. Mem. 33-34.) I find that the Competitor Plaintiffs allege facts that support the conclusion that the \"spokes\" have agreed to enter into restrictive agreements with Keurig to keep prices at a supra-competitive level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   For example, Rogers alleges that an \"expansive system of exclusionary and noncompetition agreements is orchestrated by Keurig, and coffee and other beverage brands that enter into a license or manufacturing agreement with Keurig do so with the express knowledge of Keurig's anticompetitive agreements with other competitor roasters and brands.\" (Rogers AC \u00b6 148.)

(Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 123,\n   128.) Further, Rogers alleges that \"[c]o-conspirators entered into [multi-year exclusionary] agreements with the knowledge and agreement that distributors and other resellers will be required to enter into, or already have entered into, agreements that limit their freedom to do business outside of specified authorized locations,\" thereby restraining the ability of Competitor Cup manufacturers to enter into their own agreements with distributors or other resellers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 366-67.) TreeHouse alleges that \"the coffee and beverage brands' agreements not to deal with Competitive Cup makers that could otherwise increase their product output and sales revenue and provide a back-up or second manufacturer or the like\" can only be explained by a conspiracy to sustain supra-competitive prices for K-Cups by restraining price competition.

Nature Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414342\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/464/#p474\">\n    71 F.3d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"Subjective claims about products, which cannot be proven either true or false, are not actionable under the Lanham Act.\" (internal quotation marks omitted));\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Lighting Co. v. Bridge Metal Indus. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415743\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/601/556/#p564\">\n    601 F. Supp. 2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564-65 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (granting motion to dismiss where allegations did not allege the statement was false and there was no indication that consumers would be misled). Keurig similarly argues that TreeHouse condemns only subjective statements of quality, performance, and safety. (TreeHouse Def. Mem. 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The Rogers Amended Complaint and TreeHouse Amended Complaint detail numerous purported misrepresentations made in the course of advertising through a variety of traditional and social media advertising platforms. (Rogers AC \u00b6 234; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 417, 471, 473, 475, 487.) Keurig's argument that mere \"suggestions\" about differences in quality, or implications in advertising that Competitor Cups are of inferior quality are not actionable under the Lanham Act, is incorrect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1181956\" index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/661/272/#p277\">\n    661 F.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (2d Cir. 1981) (\"Whether or not the statements made in the advertisements are literally true, [\u00a7] 43(a) of the Lanham Act encompasses more than blatant falsehoods. It embraces innuendo, indirect intimations, and ambiguous suggestions evidenced by the consuming public's misapprehension of the hard facts underlying an advertisement.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Similarly, although Keurig categorizes certain qualifiers used, such as \"perfect,\" as \"puffery,\" this characterization ignores the context in which the qualifiers were used. For example, the TreeHouse Amended Complaint alleges that consumers were misled about the necessity of using Keurig brand cups, as opposed to Competitor Cups that Keurig directly or by implication labeled of inferior quality, and the functioning of the lock-out technology introduced in the 2.0 Brewer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TreeHouse AC \u00b6 640.) Such statements involve more than the mere use of qualifiers and cross the line into statements of direction or fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pizza Hut, Inc. v. Papa John's Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190182\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/227/489/#p501\">\n    227 F.3d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501-02 (5th Cir. 2000) (finding that in certain contexts, what appears to be puffery \"is no longer mere opinion, but rather takes on the characteristics of a statement of fact\"). In any event, any challenge based on the actual truth or falsity of the statements, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rogers Def. Mem. 25-26), is not appropriately raised on a motion to dismiss. At the motion to dismiss stage, an allegation that the representation was \"false and\n   misleading in certain respects\" is sufficient \"to go forward with the discovery process to substantiate [plaintiff's] claim that the [representation] was clearly false, clearly material, and clearly likely to induce reasonable reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Ayerst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792526\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/904/#p916\">\n    850 F.2d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Keurig also argues that its statements to consumers who called to complain about the 2.0 Brewers are not \"advertising\" and cannot satisfy the dissemination requirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rogers Def. Mem. 26-27.) Similarly, Keurig argues that messages displayed on the 2.0 Brewer and messages in the 2.0 Brewer warranty cannot be considered advertising since those messages were received by consumers who had already purchased the brewer and thus were not made \"for the purpose of influencing consumers to buy defendant's goods or services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Fashion Boutique of Short Hills, Inc. v. Fendi USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9380323\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/48/#p57\">\n    314 F.3d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57-58 (2d Cir. 2002) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TreeHouse Def. Mem. 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The Second Circuit has adopted a three-part test to determine if the statements at issue are covered by the Lanham Act: the speech is covered if it is (1) commercial speech; (2) for the purpose of influencing consumers to buy defendant's goods or services; and, (3) \"although representations less formal than those made as part of a classic advertising campaign may suffice, they must be disseminated sufficiently to the relevant purchasing public.\"\n   <em>\n    Fashion Boutique of Short Hills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9380323\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/314/48/#p57\">\n    314 F.3d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this standard, the Competitor Plaintiffs' allegations sufficiently state a claim for relief under the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   The Competitor Plaintiffs allege that the challenged statements made to consumers of the 2.0 Brewer are in fact intended to influence those consumers \"to purchase defendant's goods,\" namely the Keurig-licensed K-Cups. For example, the Competitor Plaintiffs allege that, to discourage consumers from using Competitor Cups, Keurig warns customers that use of Competitor Cups may void their brewer warranties, even though Keurig honors brewer warranties when consumers use such cups, or stop the brewer from functioning. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 238, 242; TreeHouse AC \u00b6\u00b6 493-99.) Furthermore, Keurig cites no case law, and I have found none, in which a court has held that warranty policies fall outside the scope of the Lanham Act as a matter of law. In fact, the Lanham Act does not define the metes and bounds of what qualifies as \"commercial advertising or promotion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Moreover, I note that certain of Keurig's statements were made to consumers by using Facebook and Amazon.com. Assuming, as Keurig asserts, that these statements were all made to consumers who had already purchased the brewer, they were made in the open. In other words, they were available to be viewed by not only consumers who owned brewers but also by consumers who were contemplating purchasing brewers. This type of communication is materially different from a one-on-one communication between a manufacturer and a consumer inquiring about the product owned by the consumer. Therefore, such statements are appropriately viewed as being made for consumption by a wider audience for the purpose of influencing other consumers to buy defendant's goods or services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Finally, Keurig challenges Rogers' allegations of false or misleading statements made to retail customers. Specifically, Keurig argues that Rogers does not have standing to challenge the statements because it \"does not explain how Keurig's allegedly inaccurate statements to retailers ... about how the 2.0 [Brewer's] interactive technology works were the proximate cause of harm to [Rogers],\" and Rogers has not pled materiality. (Rogers Def. Mem. 28.) However, Rogers has sufficiently\n   alleged that Keurig's misrepresentations are material and have caused injury. (Rogers AC \u00b6\u00b6 258-62, 270-74 (alleging that Keurig misrepresented the simplicity of the 2.0 Brewer, causing Rogers to lose business with companies such as Costco).) Therefore, Rogers has standing and the claims survive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lexmark Int'l., Inc. v.

Mem. 40.) TreeHouse alleges that it had entered into a Co-Manufacturing Supply Agreement with Unilever on August 13, 2012, which Unilever terminated on December 27, 2012. (TreeHouse AC \u00b6 296.) Thereafter, in March 2013, Unilever announced an agreement with Keurig by which it would become a licensee of the Keurig brand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) TreeHouse alleges\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   [o]n information and belief, the contract entered into between [Keurig] and Unilever prohibited Unilever from proceeding with its co-manufacturing agreement with Sturm.

Therefore, TreeHouse's state law tortious interference with contract claims survive solely related to this one contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leibowitz v.

Keurig challenges these claims on three grounds: (1) that such claims \"are not linked to any particular state\"; (2) that such claims \"are not premised on anything other than DPPs' deficient antitrust claims, and they must be dismissed along with those claims\"; and (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   that the named DPPs lack constitutional standing to assert such claims \"under the laws of the states where they neither reside nor purchased [the K-Cups].\" (DPP Def.

Keurig argues that because the IPPs have failed to allege conduct that violates the antitrust laws, they fail to state a claim under each state's consumer protection laws. (IPP Def. Mem. 27.) The IPPs contend that the state consumer protection laws are intended to be broadly construed\n   to protect consumers and not to be limited by antitrust concepts.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IPP Def. Mem. 27.) Regardless, as discussed above, the IPPs' Second Amended Complaint is substantially similar to the complaints of TreeHouse, Rogers, and the DPPs, and so they have adequately alleged the substantive elements of an antitrust claim under both federal and state laws.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A-B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the IPPs' tenth cause of action under the laws of Arkansas, California, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Mexico, and North Carolina survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   <strong>\n    7.

The IPPs allege that through their\n   overpayments, they conferred a benefit upon Keurig, which Keurig knowingly accepted under circumstances that made such acceptance inequitable, namely that Keurig obtained the overpayments through unlawful and anticompetitive acts. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , IPP SAC \u00b6 483.) Keurig argues that the IPPs' unjust enrichment claims fail because the IPPs have failed to allege an antitrust claim. (IPP Def.

Therefore, their unjust enrichment claims do not fail on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   Even if the IPPs had not alleged a viable antitrust claim, the sole authority on which Keurig relies for the proposition that an unjust enrichment claim hinges on a successful antitrust claim is a New York federal district court case interpreting New York law.

In a footnote, without citation, the IPPs assert that \"[e]ach of [the six state laws under which they bring consumer protection claims] allows indirect purchasers to bring antitrust claims under their consumer protection laws.\" (IPP Opp. 15 n.17.) Keurig does not directly address this issue. Instead, Keurig cites to several cases to support the proposition that \"[w]here conduct is alleged to harm consumers\n    <em>\n     through its impact on competition\n    </em>\n    , the conclusion that it does not violate the antitrust laws means that it does not harm consumers.\" (IPP Def. Mem. 27 (emphasis in original).) The IPPs in turn cite to several cases for the proposition that \"the laws of each of these six states are intended to be broadly construed to protect consumers and not to be limited by the reach of traditional antitrust concepts.\" (IPP Opp. 15.) Only one of the cases cited by either party sheds light on whether any of the relevant states' consumer protection laws incorporate principles of antitrust standing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Meijer, Inc. v.
