In Count Two, Nautilus seeks a declaration that it has no duty under the Policy to defend or indemnify \"as a result of the assault or battery exclusion\" under the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subject matter jurisdiction is\n   founded on diversity of citizenship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The case is rooted in litigation arising from a tort suit filed by King in February 2016, in the Circuit Court for Cecil County against 200 West, Woollens, and several others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v. Nauti-Goose Saloon\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-C-16000229 (Cir. Ct. for Cecil Cty. Feb. 10, 2016);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 1-1 (the \"Tort Suit\"). King alleged that Woollens, a 200 West employee, assaulted King on August 24, 2013, after King left the Saloon. ECF 1-1, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nautilus has moved for summary judgment (ECF 23, the \"Motion\"), supported by two exhibits. ECF 23-1; ECF 23-2. Saloon opposes the Motion (ECF 30, the \"Opposition\") and submitted four exhibits. ECF 30-1 to ECF 30-4. Plaintiff has replied. ECF 31 (\"Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Motion is fully briefed and no hearing is necessary to resolve it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6. For the reasons that follow, I shall deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Tort Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Saloon is a restaurant and bar with its principal place of business located in Cecil County, Maryland. ECF 1-1, \u00b6 5. At the relevant time, Woollens was an off-duty Maryland State Police officer, providing private security services for 200 West.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14; ECF 1, \u00b6 11. King was a patron of the Saloon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 10, 2016, in the Circuit Court for Cecil County, King filed the Tort Suit, alleging claims against Woollens; 200 West; TTS Properties, Inc.; Anchor Boats, Inc.; Marcus Brown, individually and in his capacity as former Superintendent of the Maryland State Police; the Maryland State Police; and the State of Maryland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tort Suit contained thirteen counts, but it proceeded only as to six of them: \"Battery\" (Count I); \"Gross Negligence\" (Count IV); \"Negligence - Security\" (Count X); \"Negligence: Hiring, Training, Retention, and/or Supervision\" (Count XI); \"Negligence - Failure to Warn\" (Count XII); and \"Negligence - Negligent Misrepresentation\" (Count XIII). ECF 1, \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 1-1. Nautilus defended 200 West in the Tort Suit, retaining Eccleston &amp; Wolf as defense counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 30 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Tort Suit, King alleged that on the night of August 23, 2013, he and several friends went to the Saloon. ECF 1-1, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 12. At about 12:45 a.m. on August 24, 2013, a member of Saloon security allegedly asked King's friend to leave the bar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. King's friend left, and King followed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. King claimed that when he arrived in the parking lot, his friends were arguing with the Saloon's security personnel, including Woollens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. According to the Tort Suit, Woollens, an off-duty police officer working security for 200 West, wore his Maryland State Police badge and carried a firearm and handcuffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. He also identified himself as a Maryland State Trooper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   King asserted that he was unarmed and posed no threat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Nevertheless, when he started walking toward his friends, he was pushed to the ground by the Saloon's security personnel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, King asserts that when he stood up, Woollens grabbed him, lifted him above Woollen's head, and \"swiftly slammed [King's] head to the concrete pavement,\" with \"such force that patrons located more than one hundred feet away - on the lower deck inside of the restaurant - heard the thud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. As a result, King was knocked unconscious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While King lay\n   bleeding on the concrete, Woollens handcuffed him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   King suffered \"catastrophic injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. These included \"a fractured bone in the [right] side of his skull, a fractured plate in the middle of his skull, a fractured in [sic] right eye socket, a fractured bone in the rear area of the side of his skull, a concussion, severe bleeding behind his skull, and severe mental anguish.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   King \"was charged with second degree assault, trespass, disorderly conduct, failure to obey, and resisting arrest in Cecil County District Court case number 4K00065839,\n   <em>\n    State of Maryland v. William King.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. He received a sentence of probation before judgment on April 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, there was no imposition of a judgment of conviction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the course of litigation in the Tort Suit, the Saloon and other defendants moved for summary judgment. Of relevance here, in its \"Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\" (ECF 30-2) (\"Memorandum\"), 200 West disputed King's version of events, stating, ECF 30-2 at 6-7:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff ignored [Woollens'] orders to leave and instead went towards TFC Woollens in an aggressive manner, and stated, \"I don't care if you're a cop, I'll stab you.\" [Exhibit No. 12, Affidavit of Richard A. Woollens, \u00b6 6]. This statement gave TFC Woollens concern that Plaintiff had a concealed knife or sharp weapon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That fact, coupled with Plaintiff's aggressive behavior, his intoxication, and the large number of people in the vicinity led TFC Woollens to believe Plaintiff would harm him or other people at the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Fearing for his safety and others, TFC Woollens wrapped his arms around Plaintiff in order to prevent the threatened assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. TFC Woollens realized that the only way to gain control of Plaintiff in a safe manner was to execute a takedown, and therefore, he executed a take-down technique to take Plaintiff down to the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   During the takedown, Plaintiff sustained a head injury ; TFC Woollens had no intent to cause an injury, only to take Plaintiff down as a quickly as possible to prevent him from causing an injury to those at the scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Judge Keith A. Baynes, of the Circuit Court for Cecil County, presided at the hearing on the motions for summary judgement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 30-4. At the close of the hearing, he issued an oral ruling (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-41), granting the motions (ECF 30-4). Judge Baynes stated,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [T]he Court does find looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff [i.e., King] that there's really not any dispute as to material fact and the Court does believe that the force used by the officer [i.e., Woollens] was reasonable based upon the conduct and language of the plaintiff at the time of the events.... [U]sing the reasonable officer standard, again, the Court finds that the conduct of the officer was reasonable based upon the threat that was immediately apparent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   ECF 30-3 (Judge Baynes's orders granting summary judgment to defendants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   King noted an appeal to the Maryland Court of Special Appeals. ECF 30 at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v. Nauti-Goose Saloon\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-2183 (Md. Ct. Spec. App.). And, Nautilus has continued to defend 200 West in the appeal, pursuant to a reservation of rights letter (ECF 30-1), dated November 22, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 30-2 at 3 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As noted, Nautilus's request for declaratory judgment arises out of a Commercial Lines Policy of insurance issued to 200\n   West.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 23-2. The Policy was in effect, and covered 200 West and its employees, from March 12, 2013 through March 12, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Policy contains two sections relevant to coverage in this case: (1) Coverage under the \"Commercial General Liability [\"CGL\"] Coverage Form,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-18 (the \"CGL Form\") and (2) an endorsement modifying the Policy, titled \"EXCLUSION - ALL ASSAULT OR BATTERY.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (the \"Battery Exclusion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The CGL Form of the Policy provides, in relevant part,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION I - COVERAGES\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    COVERAGE A BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    DAMAGE LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

And, \"occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. However, it does not appear that the Policy defines \"accident.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The CGL Form also contains an \"exclusion\" for expected or intended injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (\"Expected or Intended Injury Exclusion\").

Further, the Battery Exclusion applies to all injuries resulting from \"any actual or alleged assault or battery 'regardless of culpability or intent of any person.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (quoting ECF 23-2 at 19).

ECF 31 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Further, Nautilus maintains that its reading of the Policy does not invalidate the Reasonable Force Exception. To illustrate the continued effect of the Exception, Nautilus provides a hypothetical example in which the Battery Exclusion would not apply to an insured's use of reasonable force, i.e., the Policy would cover the resulting injury. ECF 31 at 5. In this hypothetical, a store owner places a guard dog inside the store but does not post a warning sign outside the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A thief illegally enters the store, is bitten by the dog, and sues the store owner. According to Nautilus, the dog bite is not excluded by the Policy. Even if the dog bite was expected or intended, the Expected or Intended Injury Exclusion does not apply because the owner used reasonable force to protect his property. And, because the dog bite did not \" 'necessarily arise out of a \"physical altercation,\" ' \" the Battery Exclusion also does not apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting ECF 30 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   I agree with 200 West's interpretation of the Policy.

Under 200 West's interpretation, the Battery Exclusion applies to all injuries resulting from an insured's use of\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   force in an altercation, assault, or battery. This interpretation gives effect to the Battery Exclusion without unduly limiting the scope of the Reasonable Force Exception.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675769\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/388/162/#p173\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If the endorsement conflicts with the main policy, the endorsement controls.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In contrast, Nautilus's construction of the Policy would essentially read the Reasonable Force Exclusion out of the Policy. Although Nautilus arguably finds an example in which the Reasonable Force Exception is not rendered meaningless, its example represents an extremely unusual, if not unlikely, scenario. ECF 31 at 5. A reasonableness standard, such as \"the use of\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   force to protect persons or property,\" does not ordinarily refer to such a narrow class of cases.

ECF 31 at 3. It reasons that because the Clerk has entered a default as to Woollens (ECF 21), 200 West cannot \"assert that [Woollens] is entitled to a defense from Nautilus.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=347%20A.2d%20842\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is true that 200 West cannot establish Nautilus's duty to defend Woollens. But, Nautilus, as the movant, still must demonstrate that it is entitled to an entry of summary judgment, and it has not done so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p322\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Duty To Indemnify\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, the denial of summary judgment as to Nautilus's duty to defend does not necessarily entail a denial of summary judgment as to Nautilus's duty to indemnify. This is because \"the duty to defend depends only upon the facts as alleged\" in a tort suit, whereas \"the duty to indemnify depends upon liability,\" so \"the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.\"\n   <em>\n    Walk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2186208\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/382/1/#p15\">\n    382 Md. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2186208\" index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/382/1/#p15\">\n    852 A.2d at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the duty to indemnify turns, first, on whether the insured is found liable in the underlying tort suit; and second, on whether the actual liability established in the tort suit (as opposed to the potential liability) comes within the scope of policy coverage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Penn-America Ins.

If the Court of Special Appeals upholds the trial court's decision, the Saloon will not be liable and Nautilus's duty to indemnify will not be triggered. On the other hand, if the Court of Special Appeals overturns the trial court's ruling, it is uncertain whether Nautilus's duty to indemnify will be triggered. Therefore, at this juncture, the Court is unable to determine whether Nautilus has a duty to indemnify 200 West and Woollens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
