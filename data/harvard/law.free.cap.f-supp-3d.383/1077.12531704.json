Miguel also seeks a declaratory judgment that the Defendants' actions were illegal. Before the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment on Miguel's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Undisputed facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Miguel accompanied his wife to Yellowstone County Justice Court in Billings, Montana. (Doc. 64 at 2). His wife had a hearing on her request for an order of protection against a third party and Miguel planned to testify on her behalf. (Doc. 64 at 3). Pedro Hernandez, a Justice of the Peace at the time, presided over the hearing. (Doc. 64 at 1-3). Before the hearing began, Justice Hernandez excluded Miguel and other witnesses from the court room so they wouldn't hear the testimony. (Doc. 64 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the hearing, the third party against whom the order of protection was sought testified that Miguel was \"not a legal citizen.\" (Doc. 64 at 3-4). The third party made a similar accusation against another witness. When the third party's testimony concluded, Justice Hernandez stated \"What I'm hearing here are allegations about illegal immigrant [sic].\" (Doc. 64 at 5). Justice Hernandez halted the hearing and told his staff to \"call me a deputy. I have two illegals sitting outside. I want them picked up.\" (Doc. 64 at 7). On the phone a few seconds later, Justice Hernandez told the Sheriff's Office to \"send me a couple of deputies. I have two illegal immigrants out in the hallway ... they are in the hall. Get them here as quickly as possible.\" (Doc. 64 at 8). Justice Hernandez ordered Miguel's wife to remain in the courtroom to prevent her from telling Miguel a deputy was coming to investigate his immigration status. (Doc. 64 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meanwhile, the Sheriff's Office dispatch told Derrek Skinner, a deputy sheriff at the time, that Justice Hernandez called about \"two illegal immigrants outside his courtroom that he wants picked up.\" (Doc. 64 at 10-11). When Deputy Skinner entered Justice Hernandez's courtroom, Justice Hernandez said \"the information I have from them two under oath, they are illegal aliens,\" to which Deputy Skinner responded \"I'll take care of it.\" (Doc. 64 at 11-13). Justice Hernandez responded \"see what happens. If you guys take them, let me know please,\" and suggested \"you may\n   have to call immigration ... their testimony from the witness stand is they are illegal.\" (Doc. 64 at 11-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Deputy Skinner stepped into the hallway, detained Miguel, and asked him for identification and about his immigration status. (Doc. 64 at 14-15). Miguel gave Deputy Skinner an expired Mexican consulate ID but could not answer Deputy Skinner's questions about immigration because Miguel was not fluent in English. (Doc. 64 at 16-17). When Miguel attempted to enter the courtroom to see his wife, Deputy Skinner blocked and handcuffed him. (Doc. 64 at 18). Deputy Skinner searched Miguel's person and, finding nothing suspicious, walked Miguel outside the courthouse and placed him into a patrol car. (Doc. 64 at 18). While Miguel sat handcuffed in the patrol car, Deputy Skinner ran a warrants check. (Doc. 64 at 19). When the warrants check came back clean, Deputy Skinner asked dispatch to see if Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"wanted him.\" (Doc. 64 at 19). An ICE agent contacted Deputy Skinner on the phone and asked Deputy Skinner to transport Miguel to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility. (Doc. 64 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miguel remained in ICE custody, being transported amongst various detention facilities, while a deportation proceeding was initiated. After three months, the Department of Homeland Security dismissed its deportation proceeding against Miguel. (Doc. 59). Miguel filed this \u00a7 1983 action against Justice Hernandez and Deputy Skinner, claiming they deprived him of his constitutional rights under color of state law and requesting compensatory and punitive damages and a declaratory judgment that Justice Hernandez and Deputy Skinner acted illegally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Overlapping these elements is the protection afforded public officials against \u00a7 1983 claims, known as qualified immunity.

When, as here, the parties agree the public officials were acting under color of law, the qualified immunity determination necessarily resolves \u00a7 1983 liability because qualified immunity and \u00a7 1983 share the same first element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Justice Hernandez does not assert he is entitled to absolute judicial immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briscoe v.

A similar test, used in the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   line of cases when determining whether a suspect is in custody, instructs that an arrest must be determined based on how a reasonable person in the suspect's situation would perceive his circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Yarborough v.

Deputy Skinner argues he had reasonable suspicion to detain Miguel based on sworn testimony that Miguel was \"not a legal citizen.\" (Doc. 64 at 3-4).

Therefore, the undisputed facts show Deputy Skinner's\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop of Miguel was unconstitutional because \"suspicion of unauthorized presence alone does not give rise to an inference that criminal activity is afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    Melendres v.

Deputy Skinner argues he had the sworn testimony, Miguel's difficulty with English, Miguel's expired Mexican consulate ID, and Miguel's inability to answer immigration questions. There are at least two problems with Deputy Skinner's argument. First, as with the sworn testimony, none of the additional facts articulated indicate Miguel committed the crime of illegal entry. At best, the articulated facts make it possible Miguel committed illegal\n   entry, but probable cause requires more than the possibility an offense was committed.\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865927\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/1067/#p1072\">\n    482 F.3d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In a country as diverse as the United States, it is common to encounter someone who struggles with English. The Fourth Amendment would be of little value if the police were able to arrest anyone with a foreign ID and difficulty with English. And while the sworn testimony meant Deputy Skinner had slightly more than that, he still didn't have a fair probability Miguel illegally entered the country because a person who overstayed his visa, had a change of student status, or acquired prohibited employment could very likely fit precisely into that profile.\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Medina\n   </em>\n   , 673 at 1036 n. 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10595779\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/468/#p476\">\n    722 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   476 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   What Deputy Skinner needed, but never obtained, was evidence that supplied a fair probability Miguel's allegedly unlawful presence in the United States was due to illegal entry. Therefore, the undisputed facts show Deputy Skinner's arrest of Miguel was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Deputy Skinner additionally argues he had reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause to detain and arrest Miguel under the collective knowledge doctrine. Under the collective knowledge doctrine, courts may impute the collective knowledge of other police officers to the officer making the stop or arrest.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

After a witness made an unsubstantiated assertion that Miguel was \"not a legal citizen,\" Justice Hernandez ordered his staff to \"call me a deputy\" because he had \"two illegals sitting outside\" and he \"want[ed] them picked up.\" On the phone with the Sheriff's Office, Justice Hernandez told them to \"send me a couple of deputies ... get them here as quickly possible\" because he had \"two illegal immigrants out in the hallway.\" The Sheriff's Office understood Justice Hernandez's words to mean he had \"two illegal immigrants outside his courtroom that he wants picked up.\" To ensure Miguel would be caught by surprise, Justice Hernandez ordered Miguel's wife to remain in the courtroom so she couldn't tell Miguel a deputy was coming for him. When Deputy Skinner arrived in the courtroom, Justice Hernandez stated the men in the hall were \"illegal aliens,\" to which Deputy Skinner responded \"I'll take care of it.\" Immediately thereafter Deputy Skinner detained and questioned Miguel.
