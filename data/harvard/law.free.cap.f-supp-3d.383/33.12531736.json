That group was controlled by Muqtada al-Sadr, an Iraqi insurgent, politician, and cleric, and supported by Iran. El-Maadawy, Mohamed, and Frost sued Iran for its material support for their kidnapping under the terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. After proper service and an entry of default, they moved for default judgment against Iran. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motions for Default Judgment (ECF Nos. 27, 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court received testimony from El-Maadawy, Mohamed, and Frost's widow, as well as two expert witnesses. The first, Stuart Bowen, served as Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. The Court qualified him as an expert on the history of Shia militias in Iraq, including al-Sadr's role in those militias, and Iranian influence in Iraq. The second, Michael Pregent, is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, as well as a former intelligence officer and visiting fellow at the National Defense University. Pregent served in Iraq as an embedded advisor to the Iraqi government and as an adjunct fellow and contributor to the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army's Operation Iraqi Freedom Study Group, which researched and wrote an operational history of the Army's experience in Iraq from 2003 to 2011.

The Purpose Behind the Kidnapping\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The JCPOA was an agreement between Iran, the United States, and other countries to lift sanctions against Iran in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear program. Rough Tr. Feb. 12 at 115 (Bowen). The JCPOA's implementation was a highly sensitive moment in the relationship between Iran and the United States in which Iran was jockeying for leverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115, 123. That implementation was scheduled within a day or so of Saraya al-Salam's kidnapping of El-Maadawy, Mohamed, and Frost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Both experts testified that in their opinion, Saraya al-Salam abducted El-Maadawy, Mohamed, and Frost to further Iran's objectives, and increase its political leverage, as the JCPOA's implementation drew near. The Court credits these opinions, which it found credible, considered, and persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Bowen testified that the kidnapping was intended to increase Iran's leverage over the negotiation and subsequent implementation of the JCPOA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128-34. He\n   based his opinion on several factors. First, in his view, Iran and its proxies know that U.S. hostages are valuable bargaining chips because the United States places a high value on recovering its citizens if they are detained abroad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-32. Indeed, he noted, on the day the JCPOA was implemented, Iran released five American hostages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117, 128. Second, to Bowen, the timing was telling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134. The kidnapping of El-Maadawy, Mohamed, and Frost was the first abduction of U.S. citizens in Iraq in five years, and it came within a day or so of the JCPOA's implementation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130-31. And just the week before, apparently in a similar effort, the IRGC had briefly detained U.S. sailors whose boat had strayed into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128-29. Third, Iran closely controls its proxies when it comes to their insurgent activities. In Bowen's view, a Shia militia in Iraq under the direction of al-Sadr would not have abducted an American unless so directed by Iran.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135-36. And finally, Bowen relied on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Worldwide Threat Assessment presented by then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 9, 2016-during the very time the three men were being held. ECF No. 49-1 at 1. At that time, the Intelligence Community assessed that Iran might \"use American citizens detained when entering Iranian territories as bargaining pieces to achieve financial or political concessions in line with their strategic intentions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibit 34, James Clapper, Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Statement for the Record before Senate Armed Services Committee, at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Pregent testified similarly. Rough Tr. Feb. 13 at 104-08 (Pregent). In his view, the abduction of El-Maadawy, Mohamed, and Frost was motivated either by Iranian leverage-seeking against the United States in connection with the JCPOA's implementation, or by the IRGC or Quds Force's desire to compel the United States to withdraw from the agreement entirely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107-08, 114-15. He, like Bowen, also based his opinion on the timing and boldness of the kidnapping and Iran's careful advancement of its interests through Shia militias in Iraq.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pregent pointed out that the agreement had received a mixed reception in Iran, with some elements within the Iranian government, including the IRGC and the Quds Force, reportedly opposed to it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104-05, 107-08. And, like Bowen, he noted that the IRGC had taken several actions widely interpreted as at least potentially intended to undermine the JCPOA, including briefly detaining the U.S. sailors the week before.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104-05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to satisfy both causation elements. First, Iran's material support for Saraya al-Salam was a substantial factor in the torture and hostage-taking of El-Maadawy, Mohamed, and Frost. As their experts testified, Iran provided Saraya al-Salam weapons and money through al-Sadr, and provided it training through Hezbollah and the Quds Force. These resources were plainly a \"substantial factor\" in the kidnapping, which began with a group of armed Saraya al-Salam members surrounding the apartment in which the three men were meeting with the translator they had hired. Moreover, Plaintiffs' experts testified that, in their view, Saraya al- Salam would not have kidnapped Americans without support for that tactic from Iran. Rough Tr. Feb. 12 at 135-36 (Bowen); Rough Tr. Feb. 13 at 115 (Pregent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs' injuries were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of Iran's material support.

That Saraya al-Salam did what Iran trained and equipped it to do, at a politically advantageous moment for Iran, easily satisfies this element.

Latasha El-Maadawy is the mother of Plaintiffs A.G., M.E., and G.E., the latter two of whom are her biological children with Waiel El-Maadawy. Although Latasha El-Maadawy asserts only her own U.S. citizenship, the Court accepts this as satisfactory evidence that her children are also U.S. citizens.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Both El-Maadawy and Mohamed testified that during their interrogations, their captors told them directly that they were members of Saraya al-Salam and that they had received training and weapons from Iran.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Rough Tr.

In light of the other evidence in the record, the Court need not-and does not-rely on them for any purpose, including to conclude that Saraya al-Salam kidnapped the three men. Plaintiffs offered ample other evidence of that. The flags of both Saraya al-Salam and Iran were present in various buildings in which they were held. Rough Tr. Feb. 12 at 184 (El-Maadawy); Rough Tr. Feb. 13 at 23-24 (Mohamed). Pictures of al-Sadr were prominently displayed in those same buildings, and another photo of al-Sadr appeared on the phone of one of their kidnappers. Rough Tr. Feb. 12 at 179, 184 (El-Maadawy); Rough Tr. Feb. 13 at 24 (Mohamed). The men were forced to record a video thanking al-Sadr for their impending release. Rough Tr. Feb. 12 at 201-03 (El-Maadawy); Rough Tr. Feb. 13 at 42 (Mohamed). And Saraya al-Salam was the only group that exercised control over Sadr City at the time. Rough Tr.
