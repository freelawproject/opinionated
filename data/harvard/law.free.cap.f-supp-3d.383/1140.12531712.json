As part of that treatment, the VAMC assigned Ami Phillips, a licensed social worker, to hold weekly therapy sessions with Plaintiff. Morgan Decl. Ex. C at 1, ECF 15. In December 2015, those weekly sessions became twice-weekly sessions. Kirk Decl. \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Eventually, Phillips and Plaintiff began a personal, romantic relationship. Phillips provided Plaintiff with her personal cell phone number, and the two began exchanging text messages. Morgan Decl. Ex. A at 1.

Here, Plaintiff alleged Phillips' professional negligence. Thus, the alternative\n   <em>\n    Fearing\n   </em>\n   test-which allows a court to ask whether duties within the scope of employment were a necessary precursor to the allegedly tortious acts-is not applicable. The Court is therefore bound to the traditional test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under the traditional test, the Court finds there is a question of fact as to (1) whether Phillips' conduct occurred in the time and space limits authorized by the employment and (2) whether Phillips was motived in part to serve her employer. However, Plaintiff has not shown that Phillips' conduct was of a kind that she was hired to perform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether Act Occurred Substantially Within the Time and Space Limits Authorized by the Employment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is a question of fact as to whether the personal relationship developed within the time and space limits authorized by Phillips' employment. Plaintiff and Phillips met through the VAMC. Phillips was assigned by the VAMC to conduct weekly therapy sessions with Plaintiff. Over the course of their personal relationship, Plaintiff and Phillips continued to meet, on a weekly basis, at the VAMC, for those therapy sessions. Phillips admits to having physical contact with Plaintiff at the VAMC,\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   therapy sessions. This physical conduct included one instance of kissing, and other instances of touching. Even when there was no physical contact, the two sometimes discussed their personal relationship during these sessions. After the relationship ended, Phillips falsely reported to the VAMC and her supervisor that Plaintiff had threatened to kill her, which prompted the mental health clinic at the VAMC to close for the remainder of the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Phillips and Plaintiff also communicated via text message during the work day, when Phillips was presumably working. Those texts included conversations about Plaintiff's treatment at the VAMC and on-going therapy sessions. They highlight the connection between the personal and professional relationship. For example, Phillips once threatened to cancel their therapy appointments and terminate Plaintiff from the clinic if Plaintiff did not apologize following a fight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While much of the personal relationship appears to have occurred outside of the workplace-at Plaintiff's apartment, for example-not\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the conduct occurred outside of the workplace. Because many of the contacts occurred during work hours, on the VAMC campus, and even in therapy sessions themselves, a jury could reasonably conclude that the tortious conduct at issue occurred substantially within the time and space limits authorized by the employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Employee was Motivated, at Least Partially, by a Purpose to Serve the Employer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is a question of fact as to whether Phillips was motivated, at least partially, by a purpose to serve her employer. Defendant argues that Phillips was motivated solely by her own interests and not by any purpose to serve the VAMC. Defendant argues that Phillips knew the relationship was prohibited, took actions to keep the relationship secret, and urges the Court to rely on\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Hood facility.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156153\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/151/546/\">\n    151 Or.

Rather, the court found that the \"uncontroverted evidence\" showed that Dyer \"was undertaking a social relationship for his own benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156153\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/151/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156153\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/151/546/\">\n    at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156153\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/151/546/\">\n    950 P.2d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [a]fter plaintiff began her relationship with Dyer, she did not return to the facility where Dyer worked. None of Dyer's inappropriate conduct occurred in the workplace. Moreover, Mt. Hood's treatment plan for plaintiff did not contemplate social contacts with Dyer, nor is there any evidence that it included counseling of plaintiff by Dyer as a \"private counselor.\" In fact, Dyer failed to inform his employer of the relationship with plaintiff. It is a mere fortuity that Dyer may have rendered counseling to plaintiff during the course of their social relationship. Thus, plaintiff has failed to present any evidence that Dyer, during the period in question, was motivated to serve Mt. Hood[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156153\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/151/546/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156153\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/151/546/\">\n    at 554-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"156153\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/151/546/\">\n    950 P.2d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While there are superficial parallels between\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   and the case at hand-including that Dyer and Phillips were both mental health professionals, and the parties met at a mental health facility-the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   actually counsels the opposite conclusion in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , who had no sanctioned therapy relationship with the plaintiff, Phillips was assigned\n   <em>\n    by\n   </em>\n   the VAMC to hold weekly-and then twice weekly-therapy sessions with Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   the VAMC. These sessions continued through the duration of the personal relationship, and the facts suggest that Philips used these sessions to both counsel Plaintiff in an official capacity\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to pursue a personal relationship. For example, Plaintiff\n   describes one instance where Phillips told him to put his hands on her hips during a session because it would help him in his \"personal interactions\" with others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This same mix of the personal and professional appears to have continued outside of work: evidence suggests that Phillips and Plaintiff discussed their authorized sessions and the therapeutic relationship via text message. For example, the two scheduled appointments and discussed changes to Plaintiff's treating team via text. Significantly, the Court notes one exchange where Plaintiff, in crisis, texted Phillips that he was contemplating suicide. Phillips directed Plaintiff to report to the emergency room, \"pulled strings\" to have him admitted, stayed at work to facilitate his entry, and told him that if he didn't show up, she would have to contact the police. Instead of calling the police, however, it appears that she went alone to his apartment. A jury could infer that Plaintiff was reaching out to his therapist for help. And Phillips, at least initially, took the very actions one might expect a therapist, in her official capacity, to take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the lines between the personal relationship and the authorized therapeutic relationship are hazy at best. A jury could infer that, throughout the relationship, Phillips was motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the VAMC. At the very least, in cultivating a relationship with Plaintiff, Phillips was, at least initially, motivated by a desire to fulfill her duties as a therapist and a jury could infer that over time, her motives became mixed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether Act was of a Kind which the Employee was Hired to Perform\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Phillips was not hired to engage in a personal, romantic relationship with a patient. Plaintiff argues only that, under the\n   <em>\n    Fearing\n   </em>\n   test, Phillips' tortious conduct resulted from acts that she was hired to perform. In other words, Phillips was hired to perform the very acts that were a necessary precursor to the misconduct at issue, and the misconduct was the direct outgrowth of, and engendered by, conduct that was within the scope her performance as an employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fearing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"241557\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/328/367/#p373\">\n    328 Or. at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"241557\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/328/367/#p373\">\n    977 P.2d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that \"[a] jury reasonably could infer that Bucher's performance of his pastoral duties with respect to plaintiff and his family were a necessary precursor to the sexual abuse and that the assaults thus were a direct outgrowth of and were engendered by conduct that was within the scope of Bucher's employment.\"). However, as explained above, Plaintiff cannot rely on\n   <em>\n    Fearing\n   </em>\n   , as he has alleged only negligence under the FTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Without\n   <em>\n    Fearing\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff cannot show that the negligent acts were \"of a kind\" that Phillips was hired to perform. While Phillips was assigned to-and did, at some point-provide counseling services to Plaintiff, the conduct at issue went far beyond what was authorized. Phillips spent time outside of work with Plaintiff. She discussed her desire to move in with Plaintiff, raise a child together, and get married. Not only were these acts unrelated to the work she was hired to perform, but they directly violated the Social Worker Code of Ethics, resulted in her termination, and led to criminal charges. In sum, Phillips pursued a \"personal, secret, and sexual relationship,\" that completely surpassed the therapy she was hired to perform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because Plaintiff cannot show, without the\n   <em>\n    Fearing\n   </em>\n   test, that Phillips' tortious conduct was \"of a kind\" that she was hired to perform, Plaintiff cannot hold Defendant vicariously liable for Phillips' actions. The Court therefore grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant's motion for summary judgment [14] is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center is part of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, a department of the federal government.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Plaintiff objects to Defendant's exhibits B and D as inadmissible hearsay.
