In this case, the parties have identified no novel issues as to the scope of USAS's obligations under the California Labor Code.

As it stands, class members will only be able to find this information by viewing the case file in person at the courthouse in San Francisco, California, or accessing the docket through PACER, which at the moment charges fees for access. ECF No. 74-1 at 42-43, 48. Class members should not have to travel to the Court or pay a fee to review the information necessary to make an informed choice as to whether to opt out of the class, absent some compelling explanation from Plaintiff why that is necessary in this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Second, for a class member to request exclusion from the Settlement, the only information the class member must provide in a letter to the Settlement Administrator is (1) the class member's name, (2) a statement that the class member wishes to\n    be excluded from the settlement class in\n    <em>\n     Haralson v.
