Neither party contends that Plaintiff has ever traveled to the United Kingdom in connection with the arrangement or equestrian-related activities, or that she performed any part of her obligations under the alleged agreement in the United Kingdom. Rather, Plaintiff maintains that she resides in California and has \"no ties to the United Kingdom.\" Opp. at 8. Compared to the burden that defending herself in California would place\n   on Defendant, the Court finds the burden that litigating in the United Kingdom would place on Plaintiff to be far greater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant also contends that litigating in this forum would be unreasonable because \"all of the relevant physical evidence and witnesses (except for the Plaintiff) are located in the United Kingdom.\" Mot. at 12. But even assuming that all breeding work and other care for the horses did take place in the United Kingdom, Defendant does not show how proximity to potential witnesses and evidence related to such upkeep services is necessary to resolve the present dispute. Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to pay for certain upkeep services of the horses, Mot. at 6-7, but the Court cannot infer at this juncture that evidence regarding those services is central to the efficient resolution of Plaintiff's actual claims. Plaintiff only seeks to recover her payments made to Defendant pursuant to the alleged agreement. Compl. at 3. She contends that the foal to be purchased with those payments was never delivered as promised, and that Defendant failed to refund the money. Opp. at 3-4. Nowhere in her pleadings does Plaintiff dispute the specific amounts invoiced for breeding work and other care of the horses, and therefore evidence regarding the upkeep issues does not appear crucial to Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Public Interest Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As to the public interest factors, Defendant contends that the public interest would be served by having the case adjudicated in the United Kingdom because the United Kingdom has an interest in resolving a dispute that \"involves the breeding and care of horses located within its borders.\" Mot. at 13. But Defendant's brief and unsupported assertion that the United Kingdom has an interest in resolving this dispute is insufficient to warrant dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 13.

Whichever of these two forums is chosen, it is inevitable that one of the parties must bear the burden of traveling to and defending in a foreign forum. Under the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis, Plaintiff's choice of forum is entitled to deference, and Defendant has not sufficiently demonstrated that the private and public interest factors \"strongly favor dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tuazon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881060\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/1163/#p1177\">\n    433 F.3d at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Considering Plaintiff's lack of contacts with the United Kingdom, and Defendant's more regular contact with California and the affirmative steps she has allegedly taken to do business with a California resident while in California, the Court finds that Defendant has not met her heavy\n   burden of making a \"clear showing\" that litigating in this forum is so \"oppressi[ve] and vexatio[us]\" as to be \"out of proportion to plaintiff's convenience.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ravelo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743568\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/509/#p514\">\n    211 F.3d at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the Court thinks it would be too convenient for Defendant to reap the benefits of engaging in at least some business in California over a period of years, only to plead inconvenience when sued in a California court based on Plaintiff's claim that Defendant conducted such business in this case. Of course, whose version of events will prove to be correct is a hotly-disputed merits question, but the Court does not need to pick a side in that dispute to resolve the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   motion before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
