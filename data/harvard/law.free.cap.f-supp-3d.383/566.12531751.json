The parties have filed responses in opposition and replies. (DE ## 84, 86, 88, 90, 91, 94, 97-100.) The matter is now ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2006, New Bern Riverfront Development, LLC (\"New Bern\"), as the developer, and Weaver Cooke, as the general\n   contractor, entered into a contract for construction of a condominium complex in New Bern, North Carolina. Weaver Cooke, in turn, entered into subcontracts with others for performance of work required to construct the project. In 2009, New Bern filed suit against Weaver Cooke and others based on allegedly defective construction of the project. New Bern declared bankruptcy, and the case--the Underlying Action--eventually ended up in the bankruptcy court for this district, where it remains pending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   With the exception of Weaver Cooke, the parties involved in the instant action are insurers of parties involved in the Underlying Action. Specifically, Westfield and Zurich issued to Weaver Cooke, as a named insured, commercial general liability policies. Selective issued to William H. Dale d/b/a DD Plumbing Company (\"DD Plumbing\"), a subcontractor of Weaver Cooke, as a named insured, commercial general liability policies. [Defendant Penn National Insurance Company (\"Penn National\") ] issued to East Carolina Masonry, Inc., [ (\"ECM\") ], a subcontractor of Weaver Cooke, as a named insured, commercial general liability policies. Westfield and Zurich have been contributing to the costs of Weaver Cooke's defense of the Underlying Action pursuant to a reservation of rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (3/1/17 Order, DE # 55, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Weaver Cooke entered into a subcontract with DD Plumbing on 4 October 2006, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DD Plumbing Subcontract (DE # 71-22) Ex. 19 at 2), and a subcontract with ECM on 25 September 2006, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECM Subcontract (DE # 71-21) Ex. 18 at 2) [hereinafter \"Subcontracts\"].

(Weaver Cooke Tender Letters (DE # 71-31) Ex. 28 at 2, 5.) On 12 September 2013, Westfield sent two subsequent identical letters to Selective and Penn National (the \"Second Tender Letter\") tendering the defense in the Underlying Action. (Selective App'x (DE # 80-4) at 1; Penn National Req. for Admis. and Am. Answers (DE # 71-23) Ex. 20 at 85.) Pursuant to the commercial liability policies, Selective and Penn National have defended DD Plumbing and ECM, respectively, in the Underlying Action under a reservation of rights. (Selective App'x (DE # 78-2) Ex. 1.1 at 15; Penn National Resp. Opp'n (DE # 84) at 2.) To date, neither Selective nor Penn National has defended Weaver Cooke as an additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In this action, Westfield, as the plaintiff, seeks a judgment declaring that its subject policy affords Weaver Cooke no\n   coverage for the claims asserted in the Underlying Action; it has no further duty to defend Weaver Cooke against the claims asserted in the Underlying Action; and, Selective and/or Penn National have the duty to defend Weaver Cooke in the Underlying Action as an additional insured under their policies on a primary and non-contributory basis or, alternatively, on a contributory basis in equal shares with other insurers. It also asserts a claim for equitable subrogation/contribution against Selective and Penn National for defense costs and expenses it has incurred in the Underlying Action or, alternatively, for those costs and expenses it has incurred in the Underlying Action beyond its pro-rata share. Zurich has filed cross-claims against Weaver Cooke and the other insurer-defendants alleging declaratory judgment and equitable subrogation/contribution claims similar to those Westfield alleges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Weaver Cooke asserts a counterclaim and cross-claims against Westfield and Zurich, respectively, for a declaration that each owes Weaver Cooke a defense and indemnity to the claims in the Underlying Action. It also asserts cross-claims against Selective and Penn National. It alleges that it is an insured or additional insured under their respective policies and that those insurers engaged in prohibited claim settlement practices. Weaver Cooke seeks declaratory and monetary relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (3/1/17 Order, DE # 55, at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On 1 March 2017, the court stayed this action on \"[t]he issue of the insurers' duty to indemnify[,]\" while \"the issues of the insurer's duty to defend Weaver Cooke (including coverage as an additional insured) and Selective's and Penn National's handling of Weaver Cooke's claim\" were allowed to proceed.

While the triggering event for the lawsuit in Nautilus was the failure to pay for the services rendered by Afterdisaster, here, the underlying action is a result of property damages, due to poor or incomplete\n   craftsmanship at the project. Based on the pleadings above, there are allegations of damage to previously undamaged property as a result of work allegedly performed by ECM and DD Plumbing under their subcontracts. Specifically, property that was previously undamaged, such as the sheetrock on the first floor, allegedly became damaged as a result of DD Plumbing's poor installation of plumbing. The defective plumbing installation was unrelated to the craftsmanship of the sheetrock, and accordingly, damage caused by that work to the sheetrock fits under the definition of property damage covered under the policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

Primary Insurer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Multiple parties seek damages as a result of Selective's and Penn National's failure to defend Weaver Cooke in the Underlying Action. First, Westfield and Zurich contend that \"[a] material term in both the ECM and [DD] Plumbing subcontracts required them to name Weaver Cooke as an additional insured under their respective commercial general liability insurance policies on a primary and non-contributory basis relative to any insurance policies issued directly to Weaver Cooke as a named insured.\" (Westfield &amp; Zurich Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 71) at 8.) Based on their representation of Weaver Cooke under a reservation of rights in the Underlying Action, over the past five years, Westfield maintains it has incurred a total of $ 836,942.82 and Zurich maintains it has incurred $ 1,087,459.23. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Both parties request a declaration that Selective and Penn National reimburse them for all \"costs fees, and other expenses they have incurred in defending Weaver Cooke in the Underlying Action from at least September of 2013 through the date that the Court enters its order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Weaver Cooke alleges that although Westfield and Zurich have undertaken Weaver Cooke's defense in the Underlying Action, it \"has been forced to pay the remainder of its defense costs itself.\" (Weaver Cooke Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 76) at 11, citing Weaver Cooke Ans. (DE # 24) \u00b6 12.) Weaver Cooke does not provide a specific number totaling its costs and instead requests \"judgement for recovery of all of the defense costs that [it] has been required to pay out of its own pocket[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Specifically, Weaver Cooke contends Selective's and Penn National's policies provide primary coverage and therefore are \"jointly responsible to Weaver Cooke for all its defense\n   costs....\" (Weaver Cooke Reply (DE # 100) at 3 &amp; n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Neither Selective nor Penn National dispute the contention that if it is determined they have a duty to defend, their respective policies are primary. Rather, Selective and Penn National suggest that they should pay nothing because Westfield and Zurich have defended Weaver Cooke in the Underlying Action and Weaver Cooke chose to pay its selected attorney at a higher rate than Westfield and Zurich wanted to pay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Penn National Resp. Opp'n. (DE # 88) at 8-9; Selective Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 80) at 11; Selective Resp. Opp'n. (DE # 90) at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Both Penn National's and Selective's additional insured provisions acknowledge that their insurance is primary and non-contributory if required by contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Penn National Policy Excerpts (DE # 71-29) Ex. 26 at 4) (\"If a written contract or agreement that requires any person(s) or organizations(s) to be an additional insured also requires this insurance to be primary and noncontributory, then this insurance is primary over any other insurance in which the additional insured is a Named Insured.\"); (Selective Policy Excerpts (DE # 71-30) Ex. 27 at 6) (\"This coverage shall be excess with respect to the person or organization included as an additional insured by its provisions; any other insurance that person or organization has shall be primary with respect to this insurance, unless this coverage is required to be primary and not contributory in the contract or agreement referred to above [i.e., the contract that provides the person or organization be an additional insured].\"). As recognized above, the Subcontracts require the additional insured's insurance to be primary and on a non-contributory basis. Accordingly, under the respective policies and Subcontracts, Selective and Penn National are primary, non-contributory insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Selective's arguments to the contrary are unavailing because they ignore the scope of the duty to defend. When an insured provides notice to an insurer of a claim, the broad nature of the duty to defend provides the insurer the opportunity to mount its defense early to control defense costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westfield Ins.

Such a result would encourage insurers to rebuke their duty to defend.

Because of the delay, Weaver Cooke claims it had to fund part of its own defense. (Weaver Cooke Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 76) at 12.) Selective disputes that it in any way delayed its response to Weaver Cooke or that Weaver Cooke suffered damages given that Westfield and Zurich are defending it in the Underlying Action. In its own motion for summary judgment, Selective contends \"[t]he entire basis for Weaver Cooke's Claims Practices violation is found in two letters.\" (Selective Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 80) at 21.) Selective contends that it did not receive the First Tender Letter, the Second Tender was insufficient, it acted reasonably, and Weaver Cooke has not been damaged.

(Weaver Cooke Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 76) at 17.) An insurer violates that portion of the IUTPA by failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications, such as inquiries or tender letters, regarding an insured's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guessford v.

Selective contends, without citation to authority, that the statute \"is not applicable because no\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   made a claim to Selective.\" (Selective Resp. Opp'n (DE #90) at 8) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Selective Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 80) at 31. This is an overly strict reading of the statute. By its plain language, \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(b) applies to insurances claims. Although a third-party, i.e., one who is neither an insured nor in privity with an insurer cannot maintain a cause of action under \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(b) and \u00a7 75-1.1 against an adverse party's insurer,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Therefore, that Westfield, as opposed to Weaver Cooke, notified Selective of the claim is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As to whether Selective failed to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly depends on the actions it took upon communications with respect to the additional insured claim for Weaver Cooke. Selective opened a claim investigation as to Weaver Cooke's additional insured status upon receipt of the Second Tender Letter. To that end, Selective arguably acted reasonably promptly in response to the Second Tender Letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Selective App'x (DE # 78-2) Ex. 1.1 at 91-92.) However, there is a factual dispute as to whether Selective received the First Tender Letter (the letter Weaver Cooke authored itself). If it did, Selective would have failed to acknowledge Weaver Cooke's additional insured claim at least until it opened the coverage file in September or October 2013, well over a year after the First Tender Letter, without explanation. With an unknown date of initial tender, the court is unable to determine when Selective acted \"upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies.\" Accordingly, on the facts presented, Weaver Cooke's and Selective's motions for summary judgment on Weaver Cooke's UDTPA claim based on a violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(b) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof-of-loss statements have been completed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Weaver Cooke contends that Selective did not deny its claim until at least a year after the Second Tender Letter was received in violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(e). (Weaver Cooke Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 76) at 17-18.) Selective contends its filing of a declaratory judgment action against DD Plumbing, Weaver Cooke, and New Bern on 12 June 2014 was its timely denial of Weaver Cooke's claim only nine months after its receipt of the Second Tender Letter. (Selective Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 80) at 6-7, 32; Selective Resp. Opp'n (DE # 90) at 3); (\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Selective App'x (DE # 78-2) Ex. 1.1 at 10-11 (\"There is no discreet letter responding to the tender for defense costs by Westfield.... And there are circumstances where we have not responded to a tender for defense with a coverage position - coverage determination letter, and we started a [declaratory judgment] action.\").) Whether Selective's actions constitute a denial of coverage within a reasonable time is an issue of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2058-63-15\">\n    N.C.

App'x 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Selective also contends \"Section (e) is not applicable because no insured made a claim and no proof of loss statements have been submitted.\" (Selective Resp. Opp'n (DE # 90) at 8.) Neither argument is persuasive. First, subsection (e), like the other subsections, does not specify the manner in which the insurance claim has to be communicated. Second, the statute does not define what constitutes a proof of loss statement. The record also does not reflect any Selective policy provision on proof of loss. In fact, in reviewing the Selective policies provided, the court is unable to find a single provision in a Selective policy that requires a proof of loss statement or instructs an insured how to submit a proof of loss statement. Additionally, neither party has provided briefing or argument, aside from the singular comment above, on the proper presentation of proof of loss. Weaver Cooke's and Selective's motions for summary judgment on Weaver Cooke's UDTPA claim based on a violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(e) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Failing to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial of a claim or for the offer of a compromise settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Weaver Cooke contends that Selective failed to provide it a reasonable explanation of the basis of Selective's denial of the claim in its answer to Weaver Cooke's counterclaim in the declaratory judgment action in violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(n). (Weaver Cooke Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 76) at 18.) In response, Selective contends\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Section (n) fails because Weaver Cooke never made a request to Selective; Selective engaged in frequent communications with Weaver Cooke defense counsel; Selective provided a full defense for all plumbing claims; and Selective filed a declaratory judgment action because no damages asserted in the underlying action included a claim that met the definitions of occurrence, property damage or policy period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (Selective Resp. Opp'n (DE # 90) at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Selective's arguments are unavailing. The subsection at issue does not contain that requirement that the insured itself submit the claim. Furthermore, as to any communications Selective may have had with Weaver Cooke's defense counsel and the contents thereof, Selective has not cited to evidence on the record. Also, Selective's defense on behalf of DD Plumbing does not negate its responsibilities as to any other insured. Finally, whether Selective's filing and the timing thereof in the declaratory judgment action promptly provided a reasonable explanation of the basis of its denial of Weaver Cooke's claim is an issue of fact to be determined at trial. Therefore, Weaver Cooke's and Selective's motions for summary judgment on Weaver Cooke's UDTPA claim based on a violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(n) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Selective also contends it is entitled to summary judgment on Weaver Cooke's UDTPA claims based on the lack of damages. (Selective Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 80) at 10-11, 25.) Selective argues that Weaver Cooke suffered no harm because it is receiving a defense from Zurich and Westfield in the Underlying Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) However, as recognized above, the fact that Weaver Cooke funded, in part, its own defense does not relieve Selective of liability for damages nor does the fact that Zurich and Westfield have provided Weaver\n   Cooke with a defense. Weaver Cooke has demonstrated damages relating to its UDTPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Penn National\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As for its UDTPA claim against Penn National based on violations of the IUTPA, Weaver Cooke contends,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Penn National did not respond to the tenders for at least three years and four months after it received the first (Weaver Cooke) tender. The delay could have been longer but, as discussed, Penn National acknowledges that it received the Weaver Cooke tender no later than November of 2012 and did not respond to Weaver Cooke's crossclaim until March, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (Weaver Cooke Mot. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 76) at 17.) In response, Penn National offers the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   The identification of potential \"trigger dates\" for coverage under its policy as testified to by 30(b)(6) designee Gary Johnson shows the extent to which Penn National reviewed information it had received to formulate its decision to deny coverage as an additional insured to Weaver Cooke. Although Penn National admits that it would have preferred to have located letters in its file showing a formal written response, there is no indication that Weaver Cooke ever understood it would be an additional insured under Penn National's policy or that Penn National in some way communicated that its decision was to provide additional insured status to Weaver Cooke. Throughout Penn National's investigation and ultimate determination that Weaver Cooke did not enjoy additional insured status, Weaver Cooke was being represented by counsel and was in no way prejudiced by any failure on the part of Penn National to provide a formal written response to Weaver Cooke's tender if such was the case. There is no evidence that Weaver Cooke was harmed in any way by any alleged delay in responding to its tender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   (Penn National Resp. Opp'n (DE # 88) at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In reviewing the portion of Gary Johnson's (\"Johnson\") testimony and other documents attached to Penn National's response, it is evident that Penn National did have internal communications regarding Weaver Cooke as an additional insured and that the claim should be denied. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johnson Dep. (DE # 71-7) Ex. 4 at 12-41 (claim notes); Penn National Resp. Opp'n (DE # 88-3) Ex. C at 3-14) (claim notes). The timing of the investigation, what materials were reviewed, and what independent investigation, if any, actually took place are glaringly absent from the sporadic claim file notes provided. Johnson's testimony does not shed any more light on the matter. Through Johnson, Penn National admitted that the First Tender Letter was in its files, but it could not confirm the date of receipt of the letter, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Johnson Dep. (DE # 71-7) Ex. 4 at 8), and that it is likely but not certain whether Penn National's employee Gregg Gross spoke with different parties at mediation in the Underlying Action in November 2013 regarding Penn National's position on Weaver Cooke's status, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10; Penn National Resp. Opp'n (DE # 89-2) Ex. B at 3). Penn National was unable to provide the specific date when it concluded there was not additional insured coverage to be afforded for Weaver Cooke, but stated it was early on in the claim process, likely in July 2012. (Johnson Dep. (DE # 71-7) Ex. 4 at 7.) Further, it was unable to answer whether it responded to the Second Tender Letter, which it confirmed it received, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   On the undisputed factual record, Penn National failed to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis in the\n   insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial of a claim, in violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(n), and failed to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time in violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Like Selective's argument, the court rejects Penn National's argument that Weaver Cooke suffered no harm. However, it is unclear if Penn National has failed to meet the standard under \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(b) because there is a factual dispute as to when Penn National acknowledged and acted upon Weaver Cooke's claims. Penn National did show that it did act upon them, but the timeline, scope, and materials reviewed is unknown. Therefore, Weaver Cooke's motion for summary judgment on its UDTPA claims based on violations of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(e) and (n) will be granted, and its UDTPA claim based on violation of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(b) will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the court DENIES Selective's motion for summary judgment (DE # 72). The court GRANTS Westfield and Zurich's motion for summary judgment (DE # 67). The court GRANTS Weaver Cooke's motion for summary judgment on the issue of Selective's and Penn National's duty to defend and Penn National's violations of \u00a7 58-63-15(11)(e) and (n) (DE # 74); otherwise, the motion is DENIED. The issue of damages regarding the duty to defend and liability and damages on the remaining unfair trade practices claims are STAYED until the Underlying Action is resolved. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE # 55.) Upon conclusion of the Underlying Action, a party may file a motion to dissolve the stay.

In its summary judgment brief, Selective refers to Weaver Cooke's crossclaims under \u00a7 58-63-15(11) (b), (c), (e), and (n). (Selective Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 80) at 26.) Although Weaver Cooke arguably pled a violation of (c) in its crossclaim, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Weaver Cooke Ans. (DE # 24) at 10-11), Selective does not discuss any facts or law to support summary judgment on such a claim, (Selective Mem. Supp. Summ. J. (DE # 80) at 31-32). Accordingly, the court only addresses claims based on violations of (b), (e), and (n).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
