Plaintiff, Jason Miller, filed a Response [ECF No. 72], to which Defendant filed a Reply [ECF No. 82]. The Court has carefully considered the First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 5], the parties' written submissions, the record, and applicable law. For the following reasons, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises over an allegedly defamatory statement published in an article on a news website,\n   <em>\n    Splinter\n   </em>\n   , then circulated by other media outlets, and then posted on Twitter. While the First Amended Complaint details the alleged defamation, only the allegations relevant to the issue of personal jurisdiction are outlined below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a communications strategist and political manager who served as Senior Communications Advisor on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 37). In February 2017, Plaintiff joined Teneo Strategy, a company that advises Fortune 500 CEOs on crisis communications and media relations. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). In March 2017, Plaintiff also began working as a political commentator for CNN, often appearing on national television advocating for and defending the Trump Administration. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). He resides in Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Katherine Krueger is the Managing Editor of a news website,\n   <em>\n    Splinter\n   </em>\n   , and an outspoken critic of the Trump Administration. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95). She resides in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). Defendant Gizmodo Media Group, LLC's sole member is Univision Interactive Media, Inc. (\"Fusion\"), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). Fusion operates a network of national and local online and mobile websites, including\n   <em>\n    Splinter\n   </em>\n   , from offices in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-24). Defendant William Menaker, a close friend of Krueger's, is a freelance writer, contributor for the\n   <em>\n    Huffington Post\n   </em>\n   , and host of a podcast known for its commentary on the 2016 election. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-117). Menaker also resides in New York. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The background of this case begins in 2016, when Plaintiff allegedly had an affair with Arlene Delgado, who served with Plaintiff on the 2016 campaign. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40). The alleged affair resulted in Deglado's pregnancy. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37). Delgado lives in Miami, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2017, Plaintiff filed a petition in Miami-Dade Family Circuit Court to ensure he would be part of his and Delgado's son's life. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41). The proceedings in Family Court turned hostile. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 42-50). In March 2018, Delgado filed a motion in Family Court to compel Plaintiff to a psychological evaluation. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Family Court Case Docket [ECF No. 5-9] 13-14). On September 14, 2018, Delgado filed a Supplement to that motion, in which she accused Plaintiff of surreptitiously giving a woman an \"abortion pill\" - inducing an abortion without the woman's consent years earlier. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 52, 88, 97-98, 162). From the time it was filed, the Supplement was sealed. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 21, 2018, Krueger published a news report on\n   <em>\n    Splinter\n   </em>\n   exposing the story recounted in the Supplement. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 96-98;\n   <em>\n    see also Splinter\n   </em>\n   Article [ECF No. 5-3] ). The article, titled \"Court Docs Allege Ex-Trump Staffer Drugged Woman He Got Pregnant with 'Abortion Pill,' \" included a link to the sealed Supplement. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 96). After the\n   <em>\n    Splinter\n   </em>\n   report was published, widespread coverage of the story by other media outlets began. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104). The coverage prompted Fox News Sunday to cancel Plaintiff's scheduled appearance for the following Sunday, September 23, 2018 (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ), and by the end of the weekend,\n   Plaintiff had lost his job at CNN (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 109-111).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 15, 2018, Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint [ECF No. 1] against Krueger and\n   <em>\n    Splinter\n   </em>\n   's corporate parent, Gizmodo. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.). Plaintiff stated claims for defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   (Count I), tortious interference with advantageous business relationships (Count II), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count III), invasion of privacy (Count IV), and civil conspiracy (Count V). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 127-173). He sought damages exceeding $ 100,000,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The next day, Menaker posted on Twitter: \"Rat-faced baby-killer and Trump PR homunculus, Jason Miller, is suing my girlfriend for $ 100 million, cool!\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 120). Menaker's Twitter post linked to an article in the\n   <em>\n    New York Post\n   </em>\n   's celebrity news and gossip site\n   <em>\n    Page Six\n   </em>\n   about this case, titled \"Jason Miller files $ 100M defamation suit against Gizmodo Media Group.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 18, 2018, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint, alleging the same claims against Defendants Krueger and Gizmodo as in the original Complaint, and adding a defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   claim against Menaker (Count VI) for calling Plaintiff a \"baby killer\" in his October 16, 2018 Tweet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 207-216). Plaintiff alleges significant damages \"to his reputation, humiliation, embarrassment, mental suffering, shame, emotional distress and other harms....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 213 (alteration added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following jurisdictional discovery, Menaker filed the present Motion, seeking dismissal of the First Amended Complaint based on lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.; Joint Status Report Regarding Jurisdictional Discovery [ECF No. 67] ). Along with their briefing, the parties supply additional facts uncovered through jurisdictional discovery for the Court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Menaker submits his declaration emphasizing his lack of contacts with Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of William Menaker [ECF No. 70-1] (\"Menaker Decl.\")). In his Declaration, Menaker states he lives in Brooklyn, New York and has never lived in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). He does not own any property or have bank accounts in Florida, has never paid taxes or registered to vote in Florida, does not have direct investments in any Florida business, and has never been employed by a Florida business or resident. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-11). Menaker also attests that to the best of his recollection, he has only visited Florida four times - twice on family vacations to Disney World and twice on family vacations to Key West. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Plaintiff's most recent visit to Florida was over 10 years ago. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, and perhaps most significantly, Menaker states he did not call anyone in Florida or otherwise communicate with any Florida sources in connection with the Twitter post. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff provides his own declaration, in which he states although he resides in Virginia, he previously resided in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jason Miller [ECF No. 72-1] \u00b6 1 (\"Miller Decl.\")). He states CNN has a wide Florida audience, and as part of his employment with Teneo Strategy, he works with clients who conduct business in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). In addition, the case in family court is still pending in Miami, Florida; and Delgado and their minor son reside in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). Plaintiff also explains the\n   <em>\n    Splinter\n   </em>\n   article at issue\n   was about the Supplement filed in Miami-Dade Family Court; and Menaker's October 16, 2018 Twitter post called Plaintiff a \"baby killer,\" referencing this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). Plaintiff contends he has \"vested personal and economic interests in this state; most importantly [his] minor son, as well as [his] paternity case, this lawsuit, and [his] personal and professional reputation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (alterations added)). He claims his \"interests in Florida were harmed by Menaker's defamatory Tweet, and [he] suffered effects of Mr. Menaker's tweet in Florida, specifically including damage to [his] personal and professional reputation in Florida.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the Response, Plaintiff also relies on a declaration filed as an exhibit to his Motion for Leave to Amend the First Amended Complaint [ECF No. 57]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 4-5, 7). In that declaration, Erik Zimmerman, a Project Manager at Trial Consulting Services, LLC, details his review of Menaker's Twitter account. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Erik Zimmerman [ECF No. 57-7] \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (\"Zimmerman Decl.\")). At the time of the review, Menaker had approximately 82,000 Twitter followers and about 200 of Menaker's followers listed their location as Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7). At least three of Menaker's Florida Twitter followers \"liked, commented on, or retweeted\" Menaker's October 16, 2018 Tweet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
