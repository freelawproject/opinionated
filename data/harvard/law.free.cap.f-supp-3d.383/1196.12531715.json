BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are delivery drivers working for Defendants Amazon.com or Amazon Logistics. (Dkt. No. 76 at 1.) Plaintiffs are parties to individual contracts with Defendants (collectively, the \"contract\"), and Defendants have classified Plaintiffs as independent contractors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Of the tens of thousands of putative class members, all but approximately 165 are parties to a contract with Defendants containing a provision mandating individual arbitration (the \"Arbitration Provision\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 49 at 4, 77 at 2, 37-1, 37-2.) The Arbitration Provision further mandates that the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") will govern any disputes arising between the parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 37-1 at 5, 37-2 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Directly after the contract's Arbitration Provision, a provision entitled \"Governing Law\" (the \"Governing Law Provision\") states: \"These Terms are governed by the law of the state of Washington without regard to its conflict of laws principles. However, the preceding sentence does not apply to [\n   <em>\n    the Arbitration Provision\n   </em>\n   ], which is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable federal law.\" (Dkt. No. 37-1 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the heart of Plaintiffs' complaint is their allegation that Defendants have misclassified Plaintiffs as independent contractors instead of employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 83.) Simultaneous to when this lawsuit was filed, the Ninth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court were poised to answer questions relevant to the arbitrability of Plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 77.) As a result, the Court stayed this action, pending those decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those questions have now been answered, and the parties stipulate to a partial lift of the stay so that the Court can determine the arbitrability of Plaintiffs' claims.

Cal. 2016). In this case, Plaintiffs deliver packaged goods that are shipped from around the country and delivered to the consumer untransformed. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' work is readily distinguishable from the workers discussed in the above-cited case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Postmates\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the plaintiffs had not established that they fell within the transportation worker exemption because they \"do not cite any case holding that making only local deliveries,\n   <em>\n    for a company that does not hold itself out as transporting goods between states\n   </em>\n   , constitutes engaging in interstate commerce within the meaning of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206605659\">\n    2018 WL 6605659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , slip op. at 7 (emphasis added). But here, Defendants are akin to UPS and FedEx-they are widely known as a company able to transport goods across the country to consumers in a couple of days. To be sure, Defendants admit that they historically contracted with UPS and FedEx for the services that Plaintiffs now provide. (Dkt. No. 37 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   And in\n   <em>\n    Levin v. Caviar\n   </em>\n   , the court found that local food delivery did not constitute interstate commerce, despite the fact that the ingredients had travelled interstate, because the ingredients \"ended their interstate journey when they arrived at the restaurant where they were used to prepare meals.\"\n   <em>\n    Levin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264683\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/1146/#p1152\">\n    146 F. Supp. 3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, this case is different: Defendants are in the business of delivering packages and goods across the country that are not transformed or modified during the shipping process. Plaintiffs deliver goods in the same condition as they were shipped, and the goods are shipped around the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Vargas v. Delivery Outsourcing\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the plaintiff did not fall within the transportation worker exemption, despite the fact that he was in the business of delivering delayed airline luggage to its owners.\n   <em>\n    Vargas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20946112\">\n    2016 WL 946112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , slip op. at 1, 3-5. But in\n   <em>\n    Vargas\n   </em>\n   , the luggage was not a \"good\" to be delivered until it was delayed or lost by the airline and then discovered when it was already intrastate.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20946112\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Much like a food delivery service, a luggage delivery service is not engaged in interstate commerce because it is not in the business of shipping goods across state lines, even though it delivers goods that once travelled interstate. As mentioned above, Defendants are in the business of shipping goods across state lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Several out-of-circuit cases are more relevant to the facts at issue here because they have dealt with goods that often travel interstate without transformation. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Palcko v. Airborne Express\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the Third Circuit found that the plaintiff supervisor, who did not deliver packages herself, fell within the transportation worker exemption because she supervised employees who delivered packages, even though those employees' delivery routes were entirely intrastate.\n   <em>\n    Palcko v. Airborne Express, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9233990\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/588/#p590\">\n    372 F.3d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590, 593 (3d Cir. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zamora v.

Tex. 2008). In\n   <em>\n    Palcko\n   </em>\n   , the package delivery at issue involved the interstate shipment of untransformed goods, unlike prepared food delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   And in\n   <em>\n    Christie v. Loomis Armored US\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the plaintiff fell within the transportation worker exemption, even though he travelled strictly intrastate, because he delivered currency, \"a good that is undisputedly in the stream of interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Christie v. Loomis Armored US, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206152979\">\n    2011 WL 6152979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , slip op. at 3 (D. Colo. 2011). The\n   <em>\n    Christie\n   </em>\n   court reasoned that a delivery person \"need not actually transport goods across state lines to be part of a class of employees engaged in interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206152979\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Consider the following hypothetical: A national freight company delivers finished goods to individuals and businesses using a series of distribution centers located across the country. The company employs both \"long-haul\" and \"short-haul\" drivers-the former transporting goods from distribution center to distribution center, the latter from distribution center to customer. A distribution center in Northern California receives a shipment of mattresses from New York, some of which are then transported by a long-haul driver to a distribution center in Southern California, others of which are delivered by a short-haul driver to a customer in Southern Oregon. The long-haul truck driver would not be any less subject to the transportation worker exemption than the short-haul truck driver, whose route happens to cross state lines. If an employer's business is centered around the interstate transport of goods and the employee's job is to transport those goods to their final destination-even if it is the last leg of the journey-that employee falls within the transportation worker exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, when deciding whether a particular employee falls within the transportation worker exemption, courts often consider whether a strike by a group of the employees at issue would interrupt interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Levin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264683\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/1146/#p1152\">\n    146 F.

The Court finds that a strike by a large group of Plaintiffs and those similarly-situated would interrupt interstate commerce. As mentioned previously, Defendants are one of the country's largest businesses engaged in the interstate shipment of packages and goods. A strike by Plaintiffs would be akin to local UPS or FedEx drivers striking-a strike by UPS or FedEx drivers, who only personally travel intrastate, would cause a ripple effect in interstate commerce because goods travelling interstate would\n   still not make it to their final destination. Therefore, Plaintiffs fall within the FAA's transportation worker exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Enforceability of the Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \" Section 1 [of the FAA] does not, however, in any way address the enforceability of employment contracts exempt from the FAA.

No. 37-1 at 5.) Having found that the FAA is inapplicable to the Arbitration Provision, the parties dispute whether it remains a valid agreement to arbitrate because the FAA's inapplicability conflicts with the language of the Governing Law Provision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Any reference in this order to the terms of one type of contract is applicable to the other.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In their initial briefing, Plaintiffs made two additional arguments that are without merit. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. Nos. 46 at 15-21, 62 at 22.) First, they argued that the Arbitration Provision is unenforceable because it contains a class action waiver, in violation of the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\"). (Dkt. No. 46 at 15-21.) However, the Supreme Court has clarified that \"[n]othing in our cases indicates that the NLRA guarantees class and collective action procedures, let alone for claims arising under different statutes and despite the express (and entirely unmentioned) teaching of the Arbitration Act.\"\n    <em>\n     Epic Sys.

In their supplemental briefing, Plaintiffs make no mention of their NLRA argument, and the Court concludes that they are no longer pursuing it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Second, Plaintiffs argued that the Arbitration Provision is unenforceable because, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employees' rights to bring a collective action are not waivable. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 62 at 22.) However, the Ninth Circuit has rejected that argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Horenstein v. Mortg.

Defendants argue that the postal worker cases are distinguishable because postal workers are members of a national collective bargaining agreement, which effectively turns intrastate postal workers into workers that fall within the transportation worker exemption. (Dkt. No. 108 at 11-12.)
