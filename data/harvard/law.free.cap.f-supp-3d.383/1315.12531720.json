SARGUS, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an \"\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   lawsuit by Plaintiff Patricia Harris (\"Plaintiff'), as Personal Representative of the Estate of Gerald Harris (\"Mr. Harris\"), against three cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris USA, Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and Lorillard Tobacco Company (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The case is before the Court on Defendants' Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on All Claims or in the Alternative, Motion for New Trial (Doc. 178), and Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment (Doc. 179). Plaintiff has responded to both motions. (Doc. 182; Doc. 183). The Court has also reviewed the parties' supplemental briefs. (Doc. 201; Doc. 202). The matter is thus ripe for a decision. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on All Claims and alternative Motion for New Trial is due to be denied. Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment is due to be granted to the extent that the Court will amend the judgment to reflect each party's comparative fault. Otherwise, the Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 12, 2013, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint against the Defendants pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 5). Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants' cigarettes were responsible for Mr. Harris's coronary heart disease (CHD) and oral cavity cancer, as well as the lung cancer that ultimately claimed his life. Plaintiff sought wrongful death and survival damages under theories of negligence, strict liability, fraudulent concealment, and conspiracy to conceal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following a trial, the jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff on the claims of negligence and strict liability, but not on the claims of fraudulent concealment and conspiracy to conceal. (Doc. 143). In reaching its verdict, the jury determined as a threshold matter that Mr. Harris was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). The parties stipulated mat Mr. Harris's CHD manifested on or before the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class cutoff date of November 21, 1996 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 121 at 35 \u00b6 2; Doc. 163 at 180), but the jury determined that Mr. Harris's addiction to cigarettes was not the cause of his heart disease (Doc. 143 at 2 \u00b6 3). However, the jury found that while Mr. Harris's oral cavity cancer had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   manifested by the cutoff date (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6 2), Mr. Harris's addiction to cigarettes\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the cause of the oral cavity cancer (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6 3). The jury further found that Mr. Harris's addiction to cigarettes was the cause of the lung cancer that resulted in his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In accordance with the Court's instructions, the jury awarded two sets of compensatory\n   damages: one for the diseases that\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   cause Mr. Harris's death (i.e., oral cavity cancer )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one for the diseases that\n   <em>\n    did cause\n   </em>\n   Mr. Harris's death (i.e., lung cancer ). The Court reasoned that damages for the injuries\n   <em>\n    not resulting\n   </em>\n   in Mr. Harris's death reflected survival damages, while damages for the injuries that\n   <em>\n    did result\n   </em>\n   in Mr. Harris's death reflected wrongful death damages. With respect to oral cavity cancer, the jury awarded $ 1,326,650.00 in survival damages (Doc. 143 at 12 \u00b6 17), assigning 60% of the fault to Mr. Harris, 15% each to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, and 10% to Lorillard (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to Mr. Harris's lung cancer, the jury awarded $ 400,000.00 in wrongful death in damages (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 \u00b6 16), assigning 70% of the fault to Mr. Harris and 10% each to Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Lorillard (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither of the damage verdicts distinguished between economic damages (such as medical bills) and non-economic damages (such as pain and suffering). The jury determined that punitive damages were not warranted, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Two weeks after the trial ended, Defendants filed a \"Motion for Judgment in Accordance with the Jury's Verdict.\" (Doc. 157). Defendants argued that based on the verdict, Mr. Harris was not an\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class member because of the lack of unity between the disease that met the cutoff date requirement and the disease that was caused by the addiction to cigarettes. As noted above, the jury found that the tobacco-related illness that manifested by the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class cutoff date (CHD) was not caused by Mr. Harris's addiction to cigarettes, but that the tobacco-related illness that\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   caused by Mr. Harris's addiction to cigarettes (oral cavity cancer ) had not manifested by the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class cutoff date. The Court determined that Mr. Harris was an\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class member nonetheless. (Doc. 174). The Court explained that in deciding class membership, it was bound by\n   <em>\n    Engle III's\n   </em>\n   treatment of class representative Angie Delia Vecchia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. In\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the Florida Supreme Court held that Delia Vecchia was properly included as a class member \"despite a mismatch between the disease mat timely manifested (COPD) and the disease for which legal cause was found (lung cancer ).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , 945 So. 2d at 1256, 1276 ). This Court reasoned that because Plaintiff stood in Delia Vecchia's shoes,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, Mr. Harris also qualified as an\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class member even if the tobacco-related disease that manifested by the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   cutoff date was different from the tobacco-related disease for which the jury found causation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Thus, the Court denied Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount of $ 1,726,650.00. (Doc. 175). The original judgment reflected the total amount of damages found by the jury but did not reflect the degree of Mr. Harris's comparative fault. Shortly thereafter, Defendants filed the two instant motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Whether Mr. Harris Is a Member of the\n    <em>\n     Engle\n    </em>\n    Class\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants' first argument is that Mr. Harris was not a member of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class because the tobacco-related disease that manifested by the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   cutoff date (CHD) and the tobacco-related disease for which the jury found causation (oral cavity cancer ) were not one and the same. (Doc. 178 at 3-5). As recounted earlier, this is the same argument that Defendants raised in their Motion for Judgment in Accordance with the Jury's Verdict (Doc. 157), and which the Court denied in a written order (Doc. 174). The Court remains unmoved. For the reasons set forth in the Court's previous opinion, the Court finds that Mr. Harris satisfied the requirements for\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class membership by showing that a tobacco-related disease (CHD) manifested by the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   cutoff date and that his addiction to smoking cigarettes was the cause of another tobacco-related disease (oral cavity cancer ). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 174). That is so because in\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   the Florida Supreme Court held that class representative Angie Delia Vecchia was a class member despite a mismatch between the diseases that met the cutoff date requirement (COPD and hypertension ) and the disease that was caused by her addiction to cigarettes (lung cancer ).\n   <em>\n    Engle III,\n   </em>\n   945 So. 2d at 1255-56, 1276.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court briefly writes to address two further points. First, Defendants argue that the Court erred in relying on\n   <em>\n    Engle III's\n   </em>\n   treatment of Delia Vecchia because \"the defendants never objected to ... Delia Vecchia as a proper member of the class.\" (Doc. 178 at 4) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   , 945 So. 2d at 1256 n.2 ). Thus, Defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    Engle III's\n   </em>\n   decision to count Delia Vecchia as a class member is not controlling because the issue was uncontested. But Defendants ignore that later in the opinion, notwithstanding Footnote 2, the Florida Supreme Court engaged the very question of whether Delia Vecchia was a class member, including with respect to the issue of the cutoff date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1274-76. The Florida Supreme Court reversed a lower appellate court's decision that Delia Vecchia was not a class member.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1276. In doing so, the Florida Supreme Court held that Delia Vecchia was a class member because there was evidence that COPD and hypertension had manifested by the cutoff date,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1276, even though those were not the diseases for which the jury found causation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1255-56. Contrary to Defendants' argument, both Florida courts and federal courts presiding over\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   -progeny cases have regarded\n   <em>\n    Engle III\n   </em>\n   's decision about Delia Vecchia's class membership to be instructive, if not controlling.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

Whether Plaintiff Can Recover Both Wrongful Death and Survival Damages Based on Separate Injuries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants' second argument is that the Court erred in determining that Plaintiff could recover damages under both Florida's Wrongful Death Act, \u00a7\u00a7 768.16 - 768.27, Fla. Stat., as well as under Florida's survival statute, \u00a7 46.021, Fla. Stat. (Doc. 178 at 5-7). As noted earlier, the Court determined that Plaintiff could recover survival damages with respect to the diseases that did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   cause Mr. Harris's death, i.e., oral cavity cancer, as well as wrongful death damages with respect to the diseases that\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   cause Mr. Harris's death, i.e., lung cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants recognize that the Court has already ruled Plaintiff may recover both survival damages and wrongful death damages, but they raise the argument to preserve it for appellate review. (Doc. 178 at 5 n.2). During trial, the Court had two dialogues with the parties about the issue. (Doc. 182-1; Plaintiffs Ex. A); (Doc. 182-2; Plaintiff's Ex. B). Both sides acknowledged at the time that there was no Florida case directly on point. (Doc. 182-1 at 7, 9-10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 116 at 2). After reviewing the case law, the Court orally ruled that Plaintiff could recover both types of damages where there were discrete injuries and one injury resulted in death but the others did not. (Doc. 182-2 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While it is a close question, the Court remains persuaded that where a tortfeasor's conduct causes multiple injuries, one of which results in death and at least one of which does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   result in death, a plaintiff can recover wrongful death damages with respect to the fatal injury as well as survival damages with respect to the non-fatal injury. But the Court believes its decision warrants further explanation. In reaching this decision, the Court is informed not only by the parties' post-trial briefs, but also by the parties' bench briefs concerning the issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 103; Doc. 116).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court begins with the relevant statutes. Florida's survival statute states: \"No cause of action dies with the person. All causes of action survive and may be commenced, prosecuted, and defended in the name of the person prescribed by law.\" \u00a7 46.021, Fla. Stat. A survival action allows a survivor to stand in the decedent's shoes and recover compensation for the damages that accrued while the decedent was still alive, such as the decedent's pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost earnings.\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

A survival action is appropriate where \"a personal injury caused by another's tortious conduct does not result in death, and the injured person later dies due to other causes.\" 4 Fla.

Notably, however, the Wrongful Death Act allows the estate and survivors to recover only those damages \"caused by the injury resulting in death.\" \u00a7 768.20, Fla. Stat. (emphasis added).

Where the dispute arises is when a tortfeasor's single course of conduct causes multiple injuries, one of which results in death and at least one of which does not result in death. Here, the Defendants engaged in a single course of conduct of manufacturing and selling unreasonably dangerous cigarettes. However, that course of conduct produced several injuries in Mr. Harris: lung cancer, which resulted in his death, and oral cavity cancer, which did not result in his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants argue that if a single course of conduct causes multiple injuries and one results in death, then a survivor's exclusive remedy is to recover damages under the Wrongful Death Act (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 103 at 4; Doc. 179 at 4 n.3) - even though a wrongful death action only encompasses damages caused by the injury that resulted in death, \u00a7 768.20, Fla. Stat. Under Defendants' interpretation of the law, the survivor would be precluded from recovering damages caused by any injury not resulting in death. To frame the argument differently, Defendants contend that the analysis should focus on whether the overall\n   <em>\n    course of conduct\n   </em>\n   resulted in death, and if so, the abatement clause precludes a survival action for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   injury caused by that course of conduct. By contrast, Plaintiff contends the analysis should focus on whether the\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   that is the subject of the action resulted in death. Plaintiff argues that the abatement clause precludes a survival action only with respect to the death-resulting injury. Under Plaintiffs interpretation, a survivor could recover wrongful death damages with respect to the injury that resulted in death as well as survival damages with respect to any injury that did not result in death. Both parties can marshal language from the case law that seemingly supports their positions. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 178 at 5) (Defendants citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7642765\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/445/1010/#p1012\">\n    445 So. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1011 ) (holding \"that the judgment for personal injuries rendered in favor of the injured party while living barred the subsequent wrongful death action based on the same tortious conduct.\"); (\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 116 at 3) (Plaintiff citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7606032\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/471/626/#p629\">\n    471 So. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   629 ) (the Wrongful Death Act \"does not preclude a survival action for 'non-death-resulting injuries.' \"). However, as both parties acknowledge, there is no Florida Supreme Court or appellate court decision directly on point, leaving this Court to make its best guess as to how the Florida Supreme Court would answer the question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that in determining when the abatement clause precludes a a survival action, the proper focus is on the\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   that is the subject of the action and whether that injury resulted in death. The abatement clause does not preclude all survival claims any time the defendant's \"course of conduct\" caused the decedent's death. That is so, first and foremost, because Defendants' \"course of conduct\" approach finds no support in the text of the statute. The abatement clause provides: \"When\n   <em>\n    a personal injury to the decedent results in death\n   </em>\n   , no action/or\n   <em>\n    the personal injury\n   </em>\n   shall survive, and any such action pending at the time of death shall abate.\" (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The abatement clause makes no reference to whether the defendant's\n   <em>\n    course of conduct\n   </em>\n   resulted in death. The most natural reading of the statute is that when an injury results in the decedent's death, no action for the injury\n   <em>\n    that resulted in the decedent's death\n   </em>\n   shall survive. The clause does not mean that a survival action for an injury\n   <em>\n    that did not result in death\n   </em>\n   is extinguished.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7606032\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/471/626/#p629\">\n    471 So. 2d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the Wrongful Death Act \"does not preclude a survival action for 'non-death-resulting injuries.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The sentence that precedes the abatement clause buttresses this interpretation. The sentence states that in a wrongful death action, the decedent's personal representative \"shall recover for the benefit of the decedent's survivors and estate all damages, as specified in this act,\n   <em>\n    caused by the injury resulting in death.\"\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 768.20, Fla. Stat. (emphasis added). This statement means that a wrongful death action, by its nature, is an action for damages caused by the particular injury resulting in death, not an action for all damages caused by the tortfeasor's \"course of conduct.\" If one purpose of the abatement clause is to prevent double-recovery, that purpose is not served by precluding a survivor from pursuing survival damages caused by non-death-resulting injuries, which are not covered by the Wrongful Death Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   What is more, the Florida Supreme Court has said \"the survival statute is still applicable to preserve other actions which the decedent may have brought or was bringing prior to his death,\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9662531\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/314/765/#p767\">\n    314 So. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   770 n.18. \"Obviously, in\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court wished to continue one's right to maintain an action for damages where death was not the result of the injuries sustained.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

If Mr. Harris had not died at all, he could have maintained a personal injury action against Defendants for the medical bills and pain and suffering caused by his non-fatal oral cavity cancer. If Mr. Harris had died of some cause other than lung cancer, such as a car accident, his survivors could have maintained a survival action to recover the damages caused by the oral cavity cancer. Yet, paradoxically, Defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   Mr. Harris died from lung cancer due to his addiction to cigarettes, his survivors must be precluded from recovering the damages caused by his non-fatal oral cavity cancer. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 179 at 4 n.3). Defendants' reading of the abatement clause is irreconcilable with the notion that\n   \"the survival statute is still applicable to preserve other actions which the decedent may have brought or was bringing prior to his death.\"\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9662531\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/314/765/#p767\">\n    314 So. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   770 n. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[T]he paramount purpose of the Florida Wrongful Death Act is to prevent a tortfeasor from evading liability for his misconduct when such misconduct results in death.\"\n   <em>\n    Perkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7642765\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/445/1010/#p1012\">\n    445 So. 2d at 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Defendants' reading of the abatement clause has the opposite effect. Under Defendants' interpretation, if a tortfeasor's single course of conduct causes multiple injuries, one of which results in death, the survivor would be precluded from recovering damages caused by any number of non-fatal injuries; the survivor's recovery would be limited to those damages caused by the injury resulting in death. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 179 at 4 n.3) (arguing that the Court must eliminate the award of damages related to Mr. Harris's oral cavity cancer ). Perversely, under Defendants' interpretation, the tortfeasor could\n   <em>\n    profit\n   </em>\n   from the fact that its conduct was so egregious that it caused the decedent's death. This case illustrates that perverse result. According to the jury, the damages caused by the non-fatal injury to Mr. Harris - oral cavity cancer - were $ 1,326,650.00, while the damages caused by the fatal injury - lung cancer - were only $ 400,000.00. Under Defendants' reading of the abatement clause, the fact that Mr. Harris died from lung cancer extinguishes Plaintiff's right to recover any portion of the $ 1,326,650.00 related to oral cavity cancer ; Plaintiff's recovery is limited to the $ 400,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   After accounting for comparative fault, Defendants would\n   <em>\n    profit\n   </em>\n   by $ 530,660.00\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   their conduct caused Mr. Harris to die of lung cancer. That cannot be so, especially under a statutory scheme whose purpose is remedial and is to be construed liberally. \u00a7 768.17, Fla. Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the Court remains persuaded that Plaintiff may recover both wrongful death damages caused by Mr. Harris's fatal lung cancer as well as survival damages caused by Mr. Harris's non-fatal oral cavity cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

(Doc. 178 at 13-14). With respect to strict liability, Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to offer sufficient evidence identifying a defect in their cigarettes or proving that such defects proximately caused her injuries.

(\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 151 at 142; Doc. 152 at 5-12, 20-21, 100-01). Dr. Burns also explained that he was able to rule out alternative explanations for Mr. Harris's lung cancer.

The Eleventh Circuit explained that because the defendant failed to obtain a special verdict, the interest in avoiding speculation justified the district court's refusal to apply a collateral source offset.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20F.%20App%27x%20848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170120,11170073\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/760/\">\n    774 So. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761 ). As the Fourth District Court of Appeal held, \"[t]he two-issue rule bars a party from contending that the undifferentiated award of total damages represents all or any part of plaintiff's economic damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170120,11170073\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/774/760/\">\n    774 So. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761 (citing\n   <em>\n    Odom v.

During trial, Plaintiff sought to prove Mr. Harris's medical expenses by admitting a chart summarizing his billing records. Defendants objected on the ground that the chart inflated Mr. Harris's medical expenses by listing the amounts\n   <em>\n    billed\n   </em>\n   to Mr. Harris, not the amounts he actually paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2) (citing Doc. 154 at 4-14). Plaintiff countered that \"[a]dmitting only the reduced or contractual amount of Mr. Harris's medical bills is tantamount to admitting impermissible collateral source evidence,\" and that \"[a]ny set-off for the discounted or contractual amount of a bill is within the province of the Court, not the jury, and is properly calculated post-trial.\" (Doc. 122 at 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subject to the understanding that after trial the Court would reduce any award for medical expenses by the amount of collateral source payments, the parties agreed on the amount of medical expenses to be included in Plaintiff's chart. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 179 at 3). Defendants argue that because the parties agreed that the Court would address collateral source offsets post-trial, Plaintiff is essentially estopped from opposing Defendants' motion for an offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants' argument is a red herring. The fact that Plaintiff argued, and the Court ruled, that the issue of collateral-source offsets should be handled after the trial did nothing to prevent Defendants from requesting an itemized verdict form. Defendants were still free to request an itemized verdict form, which would have\n   enabled the Court to identify which portions of the compensatory damages, if any, were subject to an offset. But Defendants did not make such a request. As a result, the Court is unable to differentiate, without speculating, which portion of the verdict is for medical expenses and which portion is for pain and suffering. To borrow Plaintiff's words, \"it is simply too late to unscramble these eggs.\" (Doc. 183 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that, just like in\n   <em>\n    Griffin,\n   </em>\n   the jury's general damages verdict prevents the Court from being able to apply any reduction for collateral source payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   To this extent, Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the Judgment Must Be Amended to Reflect Mr. Harris' Comparative Fault\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the Court must amend the judgment to reflect the degree of comparative fault that the jury attributed to each party. (Doc. 179 at 10-12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, the jury found for Plaintiff on her negligence and strict liability claims, but not on her fraudulent concealment and conspiracy-to-conceal claims. The jury awarded $ 1,326,650.00 in survival damages related to Mr. Harris's oral cavity cancer (Doc. 143 at 12 \u00b6 17), apportioning 60% of the fault to Mr. Harris, 15% each to Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds, and 10% to Lorillard (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6 5). The jury awarded $ 400,000.00 in wrongful death damages related to Mr. Harris's lung cancer (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 \u00b616, apportioning 70% of the fault to Mr. Harris and 10% each to Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and Lorillard (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b67. The original judgment reflected the total amount of compensatory damages - $ 1,726,650.00 - which did not account for the degree of Mr. Harris's comparative fault pursuant to \u00a7 768.81(3), Fla. Stat. Plaintiff agrees that the judgment must be amended to reflect Mr. Harris's comparative fault. (Doc. 183 at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court agrees as well. The judgment is due to be amended to reflect each Defendant's liability to Mr. Harris as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    R.J. Reynolds: $ 238,997.50\n   </strong>\n   = ($ 1,326,650 \u00d7 0.15) + ($ 400,000 \u00d7 0.10)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    Philip Morris: $238.50\n   </strong>\n   = ($ 1,326,650 \u00d7 0.15) + ($ 400,000 \u00d7 0.10)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    Lorillard: $ 172,665.00\n   </strong>\n   = ($ 1,326,650 \u00d7 0.10) + ($ 400,000 \u00d7 0.10)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The total judgment for Mr. Harris is thus $ 650,660.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court affirms its prior rulings that Mr. Harris qualifies as a member of the\n   <em>\n    Engle\n   </em>\n   class and that Plaintiff may recover both wrongful death and survival damages under the circumstances of this case. Defendants are not entitled to the application of collateral source offsets, but the judgment is due to be amended to reflect each parry's degree of comparative fault. Accordingly, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   1.
