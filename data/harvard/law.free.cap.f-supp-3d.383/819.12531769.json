Ms. Keiper's application was denied initially, on reconsideration, and following an administrative hearing in March 2017 at which she was represented by counsel. At that hearing, the ALJ heard testimony from Ms. Keiper and vocational expert Tobey Andre. The ALJ found that Ms. Keiper had several severe impairments but that she was not disabled since May 14, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A claimant is disabled if he or she is unable \"to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).

However, if a listing is not met or equaled, the ALJ must assess the claimant's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") between steps three and four.

First, she maintains the ALJ erred in determining that her alleged limitations were not consistent with the record evidence. Second, Ms. Keiper argues that the hypothetical questions posed by the ALJ to the vocational expert did not properly account for all of Ms. Keiper's credible limitations, which infected the ALJ's analysis at step five. And third, Ms. Keiper challenges whether the ALJ was constitutionally appointed, which calls into question the validity of the Commissioner's action in this case. But the Court need only consider the first of these arguments, because the ALJ insufficiently supported his rationale for discounting Ms. Keiper's subjective complaints. This necessitates remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subjective Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In crafting Ms. Keiper's RFC, the ALJ found that Ms. Keiper's \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects\" of her alleged symptoms \"are not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other evidence in the record[.]\" (R. 33). \"So long as an ALJ gives specific reasons supported by the record,\" the Court will not overturn his credibility determination unless it is \"patently wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Curvin v.

The ALJ's decision must, however, provide specific reasons for the weight given to the individual's symptoms, be consistent with and supported by the evidence, and must be sufficiently specific or clearly articulated so the individual and any subsequent reviewers can assess how the adjudicator evaluated the symptoms.

An ALJ's failure to give specific reasons for a credibility finding, supported by substantial evidence, is grounds for remand.\n   <em>\n    Myles v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061823\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/672/#p676\">\n    582 F.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (7th Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. Keiper argues that the ALJ inadequately supported the bases for this conclusion, and the Court agrees. The ALJ critically erred here by: (1) failing to weigh Ms. Keiper's conservative treatment against her financial situation; (2) succumbing to the temptation to \"play doctor\"; and (3) \"cherry-picking\" facts from the record to support his conclusions while ignoring evidence to the contrary. Notably, the Commissioner's response [DE 26] does not address\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of these issues even though Ms. Keiper's own brief placed them squarely at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    1. Conservative Treatment and Financial Barriers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, the ALJ based his analysis in significant part on his observation that Ms. Keiper has pursued a conservative course of treatment for her various impairments. For example, the ALJ noted that Ms. Keiper has sought no more than \"routine treatment\" for the osteoarthritis in her hips and for the carpal tunnel symptoms in her hands following surgical intervention in April 2013. (R. 33). Regarding Ms. Keiper's physical impairments as a whole, the\n   ALJ equated the lack of emergency room visits to an indication that her pain is not as severe as alleged. (R. 34). And as to Ms. Keiper's severe depression, anxiety, and attention deficit disorder (\"ADD\"), the ALJ relied on his observation that she has \"predominantly relied on medication alone to treat her mental health symptoms\" to discredit the alleged limiting effects associated with those impairments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061823\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/672/#p676\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The record, however, is replete with references to Ms. Keiper's lack of health insurance coverage and her corresponding inability (or difficulty, at least) to afford medication and treatment. In July 2014, the medical record indicates that Ms. Keiper \"[was] not taking any of her medications as she was let go from work and does not have insurance or an income.\" (R. 417, 419). Consultative examiner Dr. R. Gupta noted the same thing in October 2014: \"[Ms. Keiper] is prescribed medication at this time, but is unable to afford them due to lack of insurance.... Patient was given a cheaper medication to take for her depression and ADD.\" (R. 457). That same month, psychological consultant Dr. Chad Edwards observed that Ms. Keiper's depression indeed had \"worsened recently secondary to lack of money for medication and loss of employment. She reported feeling mostly sad for the past two years with the deepest part of her depression lasting 'a month or two' when she ran out of medication.\" (R. 463). The reviewing psychologists echoed this observation. (R. 104, 117). In November 2014, Ms. Keiper presented to nurse practitioner Gina Moore, who observed that Ms. Keiper \"has not been able to afford her medications, but feels she really needs it back.\" (R. 467). Ms. Keiper's struggles continued until at least June 2015, when nurse practitioner Moore again noted that Ms. Keiper could not afford her medication and discussed plans to switch Ms. Keiper to an alternative prescription for her anxiety. (R. 495). Furthermore, Ms. Keiper explained to the ALJ at the hearing that she had to stop taking Adderall for her ADD in 2014 because she \"didn't have the money to pay for it, because it was expensive without, without insurance.\" (R. 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At no point in his analysis did the ALJ consider whether Ms. Keiper's documented inability to afford medication contributed to her conservative treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A claimant's inability to afford treatment can excuse the failure to seek such treatment, and by failing to explore this possibility as an explanation for Ms. Keiper's \"routine\" care, the ALJ committed error.\n   <em>\n    Myles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061823\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/672/#p676\">\n    582 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   677 ;\n   <em>\n    Roddy v.

The ALJ ignored these considerations in the face of Ms. Keiper's severe depression, anxiety, and ADD, and did not take into account the possibility that Ms. Keiper's symptoms associated with her mental diagnoses prevented her from augmenting her medication with more advanced treatment options, such as therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    2. Playing Doctor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, and in connection with his reliance on Ms. Keiper's conservative treatment, the ALJ improperly substituted his own, non-professional opinion for that of Ms. Keiper's treating physicians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

As stated above, the ALJ assumed that Ms. Keiper's symptoms were not disabling because they never resulted in a trip to the emergency room. Not only does this conclusion ignore Ms. Keiper's financial barriers to treatment as detailed above, but it is also premised on the ALJ's own independent medical determination-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   that of an expert-that Ms. Keiper must seek emergency treatment in order for her symptoms to be disabling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

The same can be said of the ALJ's implicit conclusion that Ms. Keiper should have pursued more aggressive post-surgery treatment for her hands if her symptoms continued to limit her to the extent alleged. Here, the ALJ assumed, based on his lay opinion, that Ms. Keiper would have benefited from such treatment; but this overlooks the assessment of her hand surgeon Dr. Patrick Viscardi, dated seven months after her carpal tunnel operation, that despite physical therapy and other treatment, Ms. Keiper's hand pain had reached maximum improvement: \"I see no intervention at this point that will make a difference.\" (R. 354). Without citing to another medical source that contradicts Dr. Viscardi's opinion or otherwise explains\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   any additional treatment would have alleviated Ms. Keiper's symptoms, the ALJ failed to provide a logical bridge where one belongs.\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057849\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/471/#p475\">\n    580 F.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    3. Failure to Consider Entire Record\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, the ALJ erred by \"cherry-picking\" facts from the medical record to support his conclusions while ignoring evidence from the same record that supports Ms. Keiper's allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denton v.

In particular, the ALJ inferred from Ms. Keiper's interests in beadwork and cross-stitching that her carpal tunnel symptoms are not as debilitating as alleged. (R. 33). But in drawing this conclusion, the ALJ failed to consider Ms. Keiper's multiple statements that her symptoms\n   <em>\n    limit\n   </em>\n   her ability to do beadwork and cross-stitching: \"I like to cross stitch and do bead work, but I can only do so much at a time, you know, because I can't sit long ... but with my hands, you know, I can only do so much of that little stuff\" (R. 70); \"my hands bother me too much to hang on to needles/anything to sew\" (R. 222); \"hands hurt too much to sew for long periods of time\" (R. 249). Although the ALJ acknowledged that Ms. Keiper \"limits how much she does cross-stitching and beadwork,\" he did so only in summarizing the record and\n   provided no explanation as to\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   Ms. Keiper limits herself in this regard. (R. 30). Nor did the ALJ articulate whether or how Ms. Keiper's limitations had any bearing on the conclusions he drew from her interest in these hobbies, leaving the Court unable to trace his logic or meaningfully review his determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Herron v. Shalala,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10505778\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/329/#p333\">\n    19 F.3d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333-34 (7th Cir. 1994) (indicating that an ALJ must explain his analysis of the evidence with enough detail and clarity to permit meaningful review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The ALJ additionally discounted Ms. Keiper's complaints of hip pain because \"[s]he has not received more than routine treatment for her hips and surgery has not been recommended.\" (R. 33). Notwithstanding the ALJ's errors regarding Ms. Keiper's conservative treatment, the record does not support his explanation. Instead, it appears the ALJ misinterpreted the purpose of Ms. Keiper's June 2016 spinal surgery, which led him to downplay the severity of her alleged limitations. When Ms. Keiper presented to neurosurgeon Dr. Andrew Losiniecki in May 2016, he noted that she had been referred for \"evaluation of pain that beings in her back\n   <em>\n    and radiates down her right greater than left hip.\n   </em>\n   \" (R. 630) (emphasis added). Thus, the procedure Dr. Losiniecki subsequently performed was not just for the sake of relieving Ms. Keiper's degenerative disc disease-as the ALJ believes-but to provide pain relief to her lower extremities as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10505778\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/329/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, Ms. Keiper's treating physician, Dr. Jasveer Grewal, referred her for surgery after medication, physical therapy, and injections failed to ameliorate the constant, severe pain in her lower back\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   bilateral hips. (R. 547-49). Here, the ALJ overlooked record evidence that calls his rationale into question while \"cherry picking\" facts that support his overall conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Denton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218713\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/419/#p425\">\n    596 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   425 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myles\n   </em>\n   , 582 at 678 (\"It is not enough for the ALJ to address mere portions of a doctor's report.\"). This, too, requires remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Additional Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On remand, the Court invites the ALJ to revisit how much weight Dr. Viscardi's medical opinions should receive. The ALJ gave \"little weight\" to Dr. Viscardi's opinions about Ms. Keiper's physical limitations in part because they predated the alleged onset date. (R. 35). But the ALJ must consider\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   evidence in the administrative record; indeed, \"pre-onset evidence may be particularly relevant to assessing a claimant's degenerative condition post-onset.\"\n   <em>\n    Doherty v.
