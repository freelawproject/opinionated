Plaintiff Bombardier Inc. (\"Bombardier\") opposes both motions (Pl. MITACA Resp. (Dkt. # 91); Pl. AeroTEC Resp. (Dkt. # 92)), and MITAC America and AeroTEC Defendants filed replies (MITACA Reply (Dkt. # 96); AeroTEC Reply (Dkt. # 95)). The court has considered the motions, the parties' submissions concerning the motions, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. Being fully advised,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court GRANTS MITAC America's motion, GRANTS in part and DENIES in part AeroTEC Defendants' motion, and GRANTS Bombardier leave to file an amended complaint within 15 days of the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action concerns alleged trade secret misappropriation and related claims for breach of contract and tortious interference\n   with business expectancies and/or contracts. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt. # 1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties and Aircraft Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bombardier is a Canadian corporation and one of the world's leading plane manufacturers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 21.) Bombardier employs more than 29,000 people in its Aerospace division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) As part of its operations, Bombardier developed the C-Series, which is a \"clean-sheet\" aircraft in a family of \"medium-range jet airliners that marks a dramatic improvement over older competing aircrafts in terms of efficiency and dependability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) The C-Series can accommodate between 110 and 135 passengers over 3,200 nautical miles and does so \"at measurably lower operating costs than existing aircraft of that class.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bombardier began investigating the feasibility of the C-Series in 2004, with efforts picking up \"in earnest\" in January 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) Bombardier then committed \"full-scale resources to the C-Series program over the next six-and-a-half years,\" at which point it received government approval for the first C-Series aircraft test flight. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) After another three years and further government approvals, the first C-Series entered service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A clean-sheet aircraft is difficult and costly to certify. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-32.) Since 2000, only four companies worldwide have developed a commercial clean-sheet aircraft that meets the requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") and the FAA's counterparts in Canada and Europe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition to the many steps involved in certifying an aircraft, the certification processes have time limits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) For example, one certification process-the \"type certification\"-must be completed within five years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) If an applicant fails to achieve certification within this time limit, it must certify the aircraft to updated FAA standards, \"thereby incurring significant and redundant costs in the process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bombardier has certified 10 clean-sheet design and derivative programs since 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) According to Bombardier, \"[t]his whole process-design, certification, production-is the heart of each company's competitive advantage, its own special secret sauce.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Denkenberger Decl. (Dkt. # 1-10) \u00b6 15, Ex. 14 at 64\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around the same time that Bombardier began investigating the C-Series, \"the Japanese government in conjunction with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. ('MHI') initiated its own investigation into the feasibility of a similar aircraft project-the Mitsubishi Regional Jet ('MRJ').\" (Compl. \u00b6 34.) MHI then established Defendant Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation (\"MITAC\"), a Japanese corporation, to \"conduct MRJ business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 35.) The MRJ program was officially launched in 2008, with a 2013 target date for the MRJ to enter service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) The MRJ, however, experienced numerous delays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-43.) As a result, on June 4, 2014, MITAC formed MITAC America to help with the MRJ's design, development, and certification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) MITAC America is a subsidiary of MITAC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Further, by July 14, 2014, MITAC enlisted AeroTEC, \"a small engineering company that provides flight-testing and aircraft certification services, [to] provide technical support for MITAC's MRJ project.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).) On August 3, 2015, MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC created and jointly staffed the Seattle Engineering Center to manage the MRJ's flight testing, development, and\n   certification in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite these efforts, the MRJ incurred further delays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-48.) In January 2017, MITAC announced the fifth delay, changing the delivery date to sometime around 2020. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) In explaining this fifth delay, MITAC stated that it made design changes to the MRJ's avionics bay and electrical wire routing in December 2016, which required additional certification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) MITAC further explained that, because of this delay, it \"would be forced to return to the first stages of preliminary design review for the design change area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47 (internal quotations omitted).) In sum, MITAC claimed that the fifth delay was needed to mitigate the \"risk of not meeting certification criteria, or having to make changes even further down the aircraft's development.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Bombardier Employee Recruitment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly before MITAC announced the MRJ's fourth delay in December 2015, MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC began to recruit Bombardier personnel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) As part of this effort, MITAC and MITAC America organized a job fair in Montr\u00e9al, Canada for July 15-16, 2016, at a venue located less than one kilometer from Bombardier's principal place of business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In promoting this job fair, MITAC and MITAC America advertised that they were \"looking to hire over 200 Aircraft System Engineers who can work on Certification activities of MRJ aircraft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Denkenberger Decl. \u00b6 29, Ex. 28 at 135).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bombardier claims that these recruitment efforts quickly paid off for MITAC and MITAC America. For example, on August 18, 2016, MITAC hired Keith Ayre to join the MRJ project. (Compl. \u00b6 49.) Mr. Ayre had been a Design Approval Designee for Bombardier and \"was critical to Bombardier's own certification efforts regarding the C-Series and Global 7000/8000 Aircraft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bombardier asserts that, although Mr. Ayre did not terminate his Bombardier employment until August 26, 2016, \"MITAC was actively soliciting, and Mr. Ayre was actively providing, MRJ certification guidance during Bombardier business hours.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In addition to the Montr\u00e9al job fair, AeroTEC organized a job fair for October 23-24, 2015, in Wichita, Kansas, which is the home of Bombardier's Flight Test Center in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) AeroTEC held this job fair \"to interview candidates to work on MRJ flight testing in Seattle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) AeroTEC arranged for billboards advertising the job fair to be displayed immediately outside Bombardier's Flight Test Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Denkenberger Decl. \u00b6 30, Ex. 29 at 137-41).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC also retained a recruiting service, contacted Bombardier personnel via email, and used successfully-recruited former Bombardier personnel to entice former colleagues to join MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) For example, Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski of AeroTEC-who had worked at Bombardier for approximately 15 years-sent an email on October 20, 2015, to 247 Bombardier email accounts stating that positions were open immediately to work on \"the development and certification\" of the MRJ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bombardier took numerous steps to stop AeroTEC's targeted recruitment of its employees, including: informing AeroTEC and Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski of the ongoing confidentiality duties Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski owed to Bombardier; explaining that the recruitment efforts were occurring at a critical time in Bombardier's development of the C-Series, as well as the\n   Global 7000 and Global 8000 Aircraft, and therefore may harm Bombardier's affairs; and providing a copy of Bombardier's Code of Ethics that contained employees' confidentiality agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, Ex. D (\"Code of Ethics\") at 17-18.) Bombardier also repeatedly reached out to MHI and MITAC to address similar concerns with recruiting, specifically expressing that Bombardier has \"reasons to believe that the employees recruited by MHI will use intellectual property owned by Bombardier to assist MHI in developing the MRJ aircraft which will compete against Bombardier aircraft.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-58, Ex. H at 2.) According to Bombardier, its attempts to stop the recruitment of its employees was unsuccessful: MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC now employ \"at least 92 former Bombardier personnel whose current job responsibilities relate directly to the development, certification, and/or commercialization of the MRJ.\" (Compl. \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bombardier further claims that many of the employees who left \"absconded with highly sensitive Bombardier trade secret information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For example, on Mr. Basson's last day at Bombardier before joining AeroTEC to work on the MRJ, Mr. Basson sent two \"proprietary PowerPoint slide decks\" from his Bombardier email account to his personal email account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. J.) Bombardier claims that these slide decks \"contain highly sensitive proprietary Bombardier trade secret information concerning Bombardier's Global 7000/8000 Skew Detection System and related confidential communications Bombardier made ... for certification purposes.\" (Compl. \u00b6 60.) These slide decks also contain \"particularized information concerning Bombardier's design, development, testing, and certification approach of the Global 7000/8000 Aircraft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Basson signed Bombardier's Code of Ethics, though it is unclear on what date. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. K (\"Basson Code\") at 2 (\"DATE: 4 MA\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. Dorn\u00e9val is another former Bombardier employee who is currently working on the MRJ at AeroTEC. (Compl. \u00b6 62.) According to Bombardier, \"in the weeks, days, and even hours before her departure, [Ms. Dorn\u00e9val] sent several documents containing highly sensitive Bombardier trade secret information to her personal email account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-64;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62, Ex. O.) These documents \"constitute Production Test Flight Profiles for Bombardier's CSeries [sic] Aircraft,\" which include \"specific details concerning the flight test profiles developed throughout previous certification which Bombardier employed in gathering necessary data to obtain certificates of airworthiness for the C-Series aircraft prior to being able to commercially deliver them.\" (Compl. \u00b6 62.) Further, on her last day at Bombardier, Ms. Dorn\u00e9val repeatedly tried to send additional Bombardier trade secrets to her personal email. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63, Ex. Q.) These files contained \"standards and requirements regarding aircraft accident and incident investigations meeting regulatory certification requirements.\" (Compl. \u00b6 63 (internal quotations omitted).) However, the files Ms. Dorn\u00e9val tried to send were too large, causing the emails to fail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bombardier claims that Ms. Dorn\u00e9val did successfully transmit one of these documents over email. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Bombardier believes that Ms. Dorn\u00e9val \"absconded with this information in either hard copy form or through portable storage device means.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Dorn\u00e9val signed the Code of Ethics on July 3, 2007, around the time she was hired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62, Ex. P (\"Dorn\u00e9val Code\") at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Bombardier also claims that Defendants Keith Ayre and Marc-Antoine Delarche similarly took Bombardier trade secrets that relate to the C-Series' certification in\n   the days and weeks before leaving Bombardier to work for MITAC and AeroTEC, respectively. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61, 65-67.) Mr. Ayre and Mr. Delarche both signed the Code of Ethics. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 65, Ex. N (\"Delarche Code\"), Ex. R (\"Ayre Code\").) Bombardier also names Defendants John and/or Jane Does 1-88 on the belief that the other former Bombardier employees who joined MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC seized Bombardier trade secrets. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Present Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on the foregoing facts, Bombardier brings suit against MITAC, MITAC America, AeroTEC, Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski, Mr. Basson, Mr. Delarche, Ms. Dorn\u00e9val, Mr. Ayre, and John and/or Jane Does 1-88. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ) MITAC America and AeroTEC Defendants now move to dismiss the claims that pertain to them pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   MITACA MTD; AeroTEC MTD); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Specifically, MITAC America moves to dismiss counts III and IV of the complaint, which allege federal and state law trade secret misappropriation; and count VIII, which alleges tortious interference with a contractual relationship and/or business expectancy. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   MITACA MTD;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-114, 146-54.) AeroTEC Defendants move to dismiss counts V, VI, X, XI, XVI, XVII, XIX, and XX, which allege federal and state law trade secret misappropriation against all AeroTEC Defendants; counts XII and XVIII, which allege breach of contract against Ms. Dorn\u00e9val and Mr. Basson; and counts IX and XXI, which allege tortious interference with a contractual relationship and/or business expectancy against AeroTEC and Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski.

Acquisition or Use of the Trade Secrets\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   According to MITAC America, Bombardier fails to allege that MITAC America acquired or used the trade secrets for two reasons. (MITACA MTD at 16). First, none of the people that Bombardier alleges to have taken its trade secrets are MITAC America employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, they are employed by MITAC or AeroTEC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, according to MITAC America, Bombardier's trade secret misappropriation claims necessarily infer that individuals stole Bombardier's trade secrets, then brought those trade secrets to MITAC or AeroTEC, who then relayed the trade secrets to MITAC America. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) MITAC America argues that this chain of inferences is too speculative to state a claim that it acquired or used the trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court disagrees. The DTSA and the UTSA do not rest liability on MITAC America acquiring the trade secrets from an employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) ; RCW 19.108.010(2). It is enough under the statutes that MITAC America acquired Bombardier's trade secrets by improper means or used the trade secrets after they were acquired by improper means.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A)-(B) ; RCW 19.108.010(2)(a)-(b). Moreover, the inferential chain pleaded by Bombardier is not too speculative to support the claim that MITAC America acquired or used the trade secrets. MITAC was established to \"conduct MRJ business.\" (Compl. \u00b6 35.) MITAC then formed MITAC America to help design, develop, and certify the MRJ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) MITAC also enlisted AeroTEC to help on the MRJ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Together, these three entities \"formed\" and \"jointly staffed\" the Seattle Engineering Center to work on the MRJ's \"flight testing, development, and certification in the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) In short, these entities worked closely with each other on the MRJ project. On these facts, it is plausible that, if any of the alleged trade secrets were acquired or used by MITAC or AeroTEC, these companies would have relayed the trade secrets to MITAC America. In short, the court does not find that Bombardier's failure to name a MITAC America employee defeats Bombardier's allegation that MITAC America acquired or used the trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, MITAC America argues that the \"timeline\" Bombardier alleges does not support MITAC America's acquisition or use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In short, Bombardier relies on the fact that \"MITAC announced design\n   changes to the MRJ to facilitate certification in 2017, after a 'critical mass' of former Bombardier employees joined MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 99).) According to MITAC America, Bombardier cites this timeline as evidence that the MRJ's design changes were influenced by MITAC America's acquisition or use of the trade secrets. (MITACA MTD at 18-20; MITACA Reply at 10.) Yet, MITAC America claims that design changes and delays routinely occur during the certification process, especially for new airplane manufacturers like MITAC. (MITACA MTD at 18-19.) Moreover, the MRJ's design changes to its avionics bay and electrical wire routing are not connected to the trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Rather, the trade secrets relate to skew detection, air speed monitoring, and flight data for different aircraft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, MITAC America asserts, there can be no inference that the MRJ's design changes were caused by the trade secrets in dispute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In sum, MITAC America argues that the timeline supports an innocent alternative explanation: \"that the general skills and experience of the entire MRJ team (not just the former Bombardier employees on that team) advanced the project toward completion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Lastly, MITAC America points out that Bombardier does not allege that MITAC America or any of its employees were responsible for the redesign decision, further negating the inference that MITAC America acquired or used the trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   MITAC America seeks to undermine the timeline allegations by focusing on the fact that the alleged trade secrets do not relate to the MRJ design changes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) But MITAC America misstates Bombardier's claim. Bombardier alleges that MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC struggled to certify the MRJ, causing MITAC to push back the MRJ's target date from 2013 to sometime around 2020. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-48, 99, 110.) Further, Bombardier details that numerous former employees took trade secrets in the days before leaving Bombardier, and that these trade secrets relate to aircraft certification, including certification of Bombardier's C-Series. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-63, 65-67, 99, 110.) Bombardier also alleges that, in conducting their targeted recruitment of Bombardier employees, MITAC and MITAC America advertised that they were \"looking to hire over 200 Aircraft System Engineers who can work on Certification activities of MRJ aircraft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49 (emphasis omitted).) In addition, Bombardier points out that, after a \"critical mass\" of former Bombardier personnel began working for MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC, MITAC announced the design changes \"even though that would require MITAC to begin its certification process anew.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99, 110 (emphasis omitted).) Lastly, Bombardier claims that MITAC America acquired and/or used Bombardier's trade secrets \"to assist in the new design's certification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In short, Bombardier asserts that MITAC America acquired and/or used Bombardier's trade secrets to aid the MRJ's certification process-a process that had already experienced numerous delays, a process that MITAC America specifically recruited Bombardier employees to help with, and a process which began \"anew\" because of the design changes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 99, 110.) Therefore, whether the alleged trade secrets \"influenced\" the design changes or whether a MITAC America employee was responsible for the design changes are beside the point.

In other words, the bid solicitation required Wellspring to create its own software rather than use Inteum's trade secrets. On these facts, the court determined that Inteum's complaint indicated \"motive, opportunity, and a possibility of improper disclosure or transfer of protected software,\" but did not amount to plausible allegations of misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The facts alleged here are more substantial, in part because Bombardier alleges the specific trade secrets that were taken by former Bombardier employees in the days and weeks before they joined MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-63, 65-67, 99, 110.) These trade secrets also relate to the exact reason that MITAC, MITAC America, and AeroTEC recruited these employees: to help certify the MRJ after a decade-long struggle to achieve certification. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) In short, not only does Bombardier indicate motive and opportunity, but Bombardier alleges that its former employees improperly acquired specific trade secrets in the days and weeks before joining the Defendant companies to aid the MRJ project. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court understands that there are innocent alternative explanations for the facts alleged, namely that design changes and delays are routine when certifying an aircraft and that \"that the general skills and experience of the entire MRJ team (not just the former Bombardier employees on that team) advanced the project toward completion.\" (MITACA MTD at 18-19.) But \"[i]f there are two alternative explanations, one advanced by defendant and the other advanced by plaintiff, both of which are plausible, plaintiff's complaint survives a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Starr v.

Requisite Knowledge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   MITAC America also argues that Bombardier's trade secret misappropriation claims fail because Bombardier does not plausibly allege that MITAC America \"knew or had reason to know\" that the trade secrets were improperly acquired. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MITACA MTD at 20-22);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A)-(B) ; RCW 19.108.010(2)(a)-(b). MITAC America claims that Bombardier's only factual allegations pertaining to this element are \"that the disputed documents were marked as confidential and proprietary.\" (MITACA MTD at 20.) Moreover, MITAC America argues, as it did above, that it cannot be culpable because Bombardier fails to identify any MITAC America employee who saw the trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Lastly, MITAC America asserts that, even if Bombardier plausibly alleges that somebody at MITAC, MITAC America, or AeroTEC saw that the trade secrets were marked confidential and proprietary, it is improper to impute an employee's knowledge to MITAC America. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Bombardier responds that it plausibly alleges MITAC America's knowledge in\n   numerous ways. (Pl. MITACA Resp. at 13.) First, Bombardier alleges that MITAC America specifically targeted Bombardier employees with access to trade secrets and then \"announced significant changes to the MRJ certification efforts\" after it acquired a critical mass of Bombardier employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 98-99, 110.) Bombardier also points out that it contacted MHI and MITAC, as well as AeroTEC, a number of times to express concerns about the targeted recruitment of Bombardier employees and the potential for trade secret misappropriation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 52-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Here, Bombardier's failure to identify any MITAC America employee or executive who took or viewed a trade secret is crucial. The most Bombardier alleges regarding MITAC America's knowledge of the trade secrets is that MITAC America recruited Bombardier employees to work on the MRJ's certification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51, 99, 110.)

Further, Bombardier's communications with corporate executives to halt the recruitment were sent to people at MHI, MITAC, and AeroTEC-not MITAC America. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-58.)

Thus, even if Bombardier is correct that some of the Does 1-88 work for MITAC America, Bombardier fails to plausibly allege that these Does 1-88 are linked in any way to \"the trade secret[s]\" identified in the complaint, which are the only trade secrets the court can consider.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.

Here, in contrast, Bombardier alleges that Mr. Basson sent two \"proprietary PowerPoint slide decks\" to his personal email account the day before he left Bombardier and began working for AeroTEC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60, 165-66.) Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    JustMed\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Basson did not already possess these documents\n   <em>\n    as an\n   </em>\n   employee. On the contrary, he came into possession of the documents on his personal email precisely because he was no longer going to be a Bombardier employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   More compelling, Mr. Basson argues that he cannot be liable under the DTSA for acquiring the trade secrets because Bombardier alleges that he sent the documents to his personal email on March 4, 2016. (AeroTEC MTD at 20; Compl. \u00b6 60.) The DTSA \"applies to the 'misappropriation of a trade secret ... for which any act occurs on or after the date of [its] enactment,' specifically, May 11, 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202298500\">\n    2018 WL 2298500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citing Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Pub.

Therefore, Mr. Basson argues, his pre-May 11, 2016, acquisition cannot form the basis of a DTSA claim. (AeroTEC MTD at 20.) Here, the court agrees with Mr. Basson.

As discussed, Bombardier details that Mr. Basson sent himself trade secrets shortly before starting work at AeroTEC on the MRJ. (Compl. \u00b6 60.) Bombardier also explains the \"tremendous value\" of these trade secrets in certifying the MRJ. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168.) A plausible reading of the facts alleged is that Mr. Basson sent himself the certification-related trade secrets in order to disclose them to his future employer-who was looking for people to help with the MRJ's certification-as well as to use the trade secrets while working on the MRJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Further, the court concludes that Bombardier plausibly alleges that Mr. Basson achieved this conduct by \"improper means.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6) ; RCW 19.108.010(1). Bombardier alleges that Mr. Basson sent himself the trade secrets in the hours before leaving Bombardier in order to divulge the information to AeroTEC and use the information in his AeroTEC employment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60, 165-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   ) All of this was done, according to Bombardier, to aid in the certification of the MRJ, an aircraft in competition with Bombardier's C-Series. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) These allegations sufficiently allege improper means. Thus, the court concludes that Bombardier adequately alleges that Mr. Basson used improper means to acquire, disclose, and use the trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Lastly, Bombardier plausibly alleges that Mr. Basson acted with the requisite knowledge. The documents that Mr. Basson sent to himself \"were marked private and confidential\" and access to them \"was restricted by Bombardier.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) In addition, Bombardier alleges that Mr. Basson emailed these documents to himself on his last day at Bombardier (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )-at which point he could not reasonably be taking the documents home in order to perform work for Bombardier. Thus, the court concludes that Bombardier plausibly alleges that Mr. Basson knowingly and improperly acquired, used, and disclosed the trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In sum, the court finds that Bombardier plausibly alleges trade secret misappropriation under the DTSA and the UTSA against Mr. Basson. The court therefore DENIES Mr. Basson's motion to dismiss counts X and XI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    b. Cindy Dorn\u00e9val\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the reasons articulated above with respect to Mr. Basson's motion, the court also DENIES Ms. Dorn\u00e9val's motion to dismiss the trade secret misappropriation claims against her.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.2.a. There are, however, two differences between Mr. Basson's motion and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val's motion that require clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   First, Ms. Dorn\u00e9val's last day at Bombardier was February 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 62.) Bombardier alleges that she sent trade secrets to her personal email account \"in the weeks, days, and even hours before her departure\" to work on the MRJ project with AeroTEC. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.) Thus, the DTSA's May 11, 2016, effective date is not implicated by Bombardier's claims against Ms. Dorn\u00e9val.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.2.a. The court therefore finds that Bombardier plausibly alleges that, under both the DTSA and the UTSA, Ms. Dorn\u00e9val acquired, used, and disclosed trade secrets with the requisite knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, Bombardier alleges that, in addition to the trade secrets she previously sent to herself, Ms. Dorn\u00e9val transmitted only one document over email on her last day at Bombardier because the other files were too large. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Instead, \"[u]pon information and belief,\" Bombardier claims that Ms. Dorn\u00e9val took the un-transmitted information \"in either hard copy form or through portable storage device means.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Dorn\u00e9val argues that these claims do not raise a plausible inference that she in fact acquired the un-transmitted information. (AeroTEC MTD at 19.) The court, however, does not need to reach this question. It is undisputed that Ms. Dorn\u00e9val successfully transmitted some trade secrets to herself. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-64.) Bombardier identifies those trade secrets in sufficient detail so as to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SMS Signature Cars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012893935\">\n    2012 WL 12893935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Thus, regardless of whether Ms. Dorn\u00e9val took the un-transmitted documents in hard copy, on a portable storage device, or through other means, Bombardier alleges a plausible trade secret misappropriation claim against her. The court DENIES Ms. Dorn\u00e9val's motion to dismiss counts XVI and XVII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    c. Michel Korwin-Szymanowski\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski moves to dismiss the trade secret misappropriation claims against him. (AeroTEC MTD at 20-21.) Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski argues that Bombardier fails to assert specific facts that he acquired, used, or disclosed any trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, Bombardier\n   points to its allegations that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski sent emails to 247 Bombardier email accounts stating that AeroTEC had open positions to work on \"the development and certification\" of the MRJ. (Pl. AeroTEC Resp. at 11 (citing Compl. \u00b6 51).) Bombardier claims that \"[t]hese allegations alone indicate that the recruitment was directed at employees who would have access to-and therefore would abscond with-Bombardier trade secrets.\" (Pl. AeroTEC Resp. at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski's recruitment emails were allegedly sent to Mr. Basson, Mr. Delarche, and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val, among other people, in the days before the October 23-24, 2015, recruitment event in Wichita. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 238, 247.) Further, Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski attended a \"hiring event\" in Montr\u00e9al on October 28, 2015, where he solicited Bombardier personnel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Bombardier claims that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski continued recruiting its employees even after Bombardier directly asked him to stop in part because of \"his ongoing duties of confidentiality owed to Bombardier.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) On these facts, Bombardier claims that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski \"misappropriated Bombardier trade secrets by inducing or knowingly permitting Defendants Basson, Delarche, and Dorn\u00e9val to misappropriate, divulge, and/or use trade secrets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 238, 247.) Alternatively, Bombardier alleges that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski \"disclosed and/or used Bombardier trade secrets without permission knowing or having reason to know that the information constituted trade secrets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The court concludes that Bombardier does not plausibly allege that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski misappropriated the trade secrets. Regardless of whether Bombardier sufficiently pleads that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski acquired, disclosed, or used the trade secrets, Bombardier fails to plead that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski acted with the requisite knowledge. For similar reasons as discussed with MITAC America, recruiting Bombardier employees to work on the MRJ does not satisfy the knowledge requirement for trade secret misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.1. Although Bombardier directly asked Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski to stop recruiting Bombardier employees-a request he disregarded-the complaint nevertheless fails to link Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski with any of the trade secrets at issue such that it is plausible that he knew or had reason to know that the trade secrets at issue were improperly acquired, disclosed, or used.

Mr. Karmouta allegedly denied possession of the customer information and took no steps to prevent the company from continuing to use this information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. On these facts, the court determined that the plaintiff had stated a trade secret misappropriation claim against Mr. Karmouta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court explained that the \"Plaintiff's allegations sufficiently establish that after Plaintiff approached [Mr.] Karmouta about the alleged trade secret misappropriation, [Mr.] Karmouta 'had reason to know' that [the company] was possibly using misappropriated trade secrets that had been obtained unlawfully and that he failed to take any actions to prevent continued misappropriation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, after the plaintiff informed Mr. Karmouta about the trade secrets at issue, Mr. Karmouta continued to use the trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Here, however, Bombardier did not inform Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski about the specific trade secrets in this case. Nor could it have. Bombardier asked Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski to stop recruiting employees in October 2015 and only alleges that he engaged in recruitment activities around this time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.) But the earliest date that Bombardier alleges that one of the trade secrets at issue was acquired was on March 4, 2016, by Mr. Basson. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) In other words, Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski could not have known about the trade secrets while he was recruiting employees because these trade secrets were not acquired until, at the earliest, six months later. Bombardier also does not plausibly allege that an individual Defendant provided a trade secret to Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski such that he would have knowledge of its improper origin or acquisition. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Bombardier fails to allege that Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski had the requisite knowledge regarding any purported acquisition, use, or disclosure of the trade secrets at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly the court GRANTS Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski's motion to dismiss counts XIX and XX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    d. AeroTEC\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the reasons articulated above with respect to MITAC America's motion, the court also finds that AeroTEC acquired and/or used Bombardier's trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.1.a. In short, the court finds that Bombardier's \"timeline\" allegations sufficiently allege that AeroTEC acquired or used the trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, AeroTEC cannot avail itself of MITAC America's other unsuccessful argument because Bombardier sufficiently alleges that AeroTEC employees-Mr. Basson and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val-acquired, used, and disclosed the trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 III.B.2.b-.c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The court therefore turns to whether Bombardier properly alleges that AeroTEC had the requisite knowledge regarding acquisition or use. AeroTEC argues that it does not for two main reasons. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AeroTEC MTD at 21-22.) First, AeroTEC says that Bombardier does not make any factual allegation that AeroTEC knew or had reason to know that anyone improperly used, disclosed, or acquired a Bombardier trade secret. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Second, AeroTEC argues that, even if one of its employee was liable for trade secret misappropriation, \"this would not be sufficient to impute any wrongdoing\" to AeroTEC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Mellberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338130\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/96/953/#p981\">\n    96 F. Supp. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   982 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Similar to Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski, the court finds that Bombardier does not plausibly allege that AeroTEC had knowledge regarding the trade secret misappropriation because none of Bombardier's alleged requests to stop recruitment identified a specific trade secret.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.2.c; (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.) At most, the requests explained that the Bombardier Code of Ethics prohibited former Bombardier employees from disclosing trade secrets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But this is not enough to show that AeroTEC knew or had reason to know that former Bombardier employees were, in fact, misappropriating trade secrets and then using or disclosing them to AeroTEC. Moreover, \"[i]n light of the emphasis in trade-secret law on unfair use, it is generally not appropriate to ... impute an agent's knowledge of a secret to the principal.\"\n   <em>\n    Droeger v.

Therefore, the court will not impute Mr. Basson's and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val's knowledge to AeroTEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   However, as Bombardier argues, \"[t]here is no need to 'impute' any knowledge to AeroTEC because, as the employer, AeroTEC is already vicariously liable for its employees' misappropriation.\" (Pl. AeroTEC Resp. at 29.) The court agrees. Under the\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   doctrine, an employer can be held liable for the intentional torts that its employees committed within the scope of employment even if the employer did not authorize the employee to commit the tort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SolarCity Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2011019989\">\n    2016 WL 11019989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MITACA Resp. at 21.) And the court finds that it does not. The confidentiality agreement regulates how employees should act during and after their Bombardier employment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code of Ethics at 17-18.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 147, 150.) At this point, the court assumes without deciding that the Code of Ethics that the individual Defendants signed are valid contracts for purposes of a tortious interference claim; there is undoubtedly a \"pecuniary value\" in safeguarding trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20P.3d%2030\">\n    52 P.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bombardier asserts that it sufficiently alleges this element by claiming that \"MITAC America targeted specific Bombardier employees with expertise in and access to Bombardier's certification-related trade secrets.\" (Pl. MITACA Resp. at 19.) Bombardier further claims that it alleges this element by showing that \"the employees targeted by MITAC and MITAC America began providing information in support of the MRJ certification efforts while they were still employed by Bombardier.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Compl. \u00b6 49) (emphasis omitted).) The court concludes that these allegations do not plausibly show that MITAC America induced or caused a breach of the Code of Ethics or Bombardier's certification schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   At most, Bombardier plausibly alleges that MITAC America recruited Bombardier employees to work on the MRJ project. As explained above, recruiting a competitor's employees is not unlawful on its own.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.1. Moreover, an employee does not breach his or her Bombardier Code of Ethics simply by joining a competitor. Rather, an employee would need to breach a specific aspect of the Code of Ethics, such as \"divulg[ing] confidential information to anyone other than the person or persons for whom it is intended.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code of Ethics at 18.) But Bombardier does not plausibly allege that MITAC America caused any breach of the Code of Ethics. Although Bombardier\n   claims that Mr. Basson, Ms. Dorn\u00e9val, Mr. Delarche, and Mr. Ayre breached their Code of Ethics agreements by misappropriating trade secrets, none of these individual Defendants work for MITAC America. The court finds that, on the facts pleaded, it is not plausible that MITAC America induced another company's employees to breach their Bombardier Code of Ethics. That leaves Does 1-88, but there are even fewer allegations that relate to their purported breach of the Code of Ethics. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.) For instance, there is no information regarding what trade secrets, if any, Does 1-88 \"divulge[d]\" to MITAC America such that they would be in breach of their Code of Ethics.

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 238, 247.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48, 60-62.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-64.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AeroTEC MTD at 10-11, 13.) Specifically, Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski notes that the Code of Ethics cited by Bombardier has a copyright date of January 2012 for the English version and June 2011 for the French version. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20P.3d%20791\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 11 (citing Code of Ethics at 29, 57).) In addition, Bombardier fails to allege that Mr. Basson, Ms. Dorn\u00e9val, and Mr. Delarche signed this version of the Code of Ethics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski argues, the Code of Ethics that Bombardier relies upon as the contractual relationship for its tortious interference claim is, in fact, a modification of the Code of Ethics that the individual Defendants signed and is therefore invalid for lack of consideration. The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Mr. Delarche began working at Bombardier in January 2005. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 8; Denkenberger Decl. \u00b6 4, Ex. 3 at 18-19.) Ms. Dorn\u00e9val began working at Bombardier in July 2007. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 8-9; Denkenberger Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. 4 at 22.) Mr. Delarche and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val both signed the Code of Ethics at the beginning of their respective employments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Delarche Code at 2-3; Dorn\u00e9val Code at 2-3.) These employees were bound by the Code of Ethics that they signed. However, the Code of Ethics before the court is copyrighted to 2011 and 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Code of Ethics at 29, 57.) Therefore, in order for Mr. Delarche and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val to be bound by this Code of Ethics, Bombardier needs to allege either that this Code of Ethics is an unmodified version of the one that Mr. Delarche and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val signed, or that any modifications were supported by independent consideration. Bombardier does not attempt to make the first allegation. Regarding the second, Bombardier appears to concede that it did not give anything in exchange for modifying the Code of Ethics beyond continued employment or a promise to pay the employee's salary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. AeroTEC Resp. at 13 (\"Each continued to work for Bombardier after receiving the Code of Ethics, and accordingly continued to receive a salary.\").) Likewise, Bombardier's complaint does not include facts alleging that the relationship between Bombardier, on the one hand, and Mr. Delarche and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val, on the other, changed as a result of any modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fry's Elecs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20666328\">\n    2011 WL 666328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. In short, Bombardier fails to allege that the Code of Ethics before the court was not materially modified from the 2005 and 2007 version(s) that Mr. Delarche and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val signed or, alternatively, that any modifications were supported by valid consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20666328\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Labriola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20P.3d%20791\">\n    100 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   794 ). Thus, the court concludes that Bombardier fails to allege a valid contractual relationship with Mr. Delarche and Ms. Dorn\u00e9val that supports its tortious interference claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The court also holds that Bombardier fails to adequately plead that Mr. Basson's Code of Ethics is valid, but for slightly different reasons. Mr. Basson began working at Bombardier in approximately March 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Denkenberger Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. 2 at 14.) Thus, it is possible that Mr. Basson signed the version of the Code of Ethics that is before the court when he first started his employment. If that were the case, then Mr. Basson's Code of Ethics would be a valid contract because confidentiality agreements signed when an employee is first hired are supported by consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fry's Elecs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20666328\">\n    2011 WL 666328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Labriola\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20P.3d%20791\">\n    100 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   794 ). However, Bombardier fails to allege that Mr. Basson signed the version of the Code of Ethics that is before the court as opposed to a different version that was available when he was hired. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Moreover, even if Bombardier alleged that Mr. Basson signed the Code of Ethics that is before the court, it is impossible to determine if Mr. Basson signed his Code of Ethics at the beginning of his employment because the date beneath his signature is incomplete. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Basson Code at 2 (\"DATE: 4 MA\").) In other words, the court cannot determine whether Mr. Basson signed at the beginning of his employment-which alone provides sufficient consideration-or whether he signed after he started working, which would require additional consideration for the Code of Ethics to be a valid contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that Bombardier fails to plausibly allege a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy of which Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski induced its breach. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 252-55.) Bombardier thus fails to state a claim for tortious interference with a contractual relationship or business expectancy against Mr. Korwin-Szymanowski.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evergreen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20P.3d%20375\">\n    274 P.3d at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For purposes of future proceedings, the court briefly discusses MITAC America's and AeroTEC's argument that Bombardier's breach of contract and tortious interference claims are preempted by the UTSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MITACA MTD at 27-28; AeroTEC MTD at 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The UTSA \"displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law of this state pertaining to civil liability for misappropriation of a trade secret.\" RCW 19.108.900(1). Conversely, the UTSA does not displace \"[c]ontractual or other civil liability or relief that is not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret.\" RCW 19.108.900(2)(a). Thus, when a plaintiff raises a civil claim alongside a UTSA claim, the court must determine if the UTSA preempts the civil claim. MITAC America and AeroTEC both ask the court to analyze preemption under the approach articulated in\n   <em>\n    Thola v. Henschell\n   </em>\n   , 164 P.3d at 530.
