C. FELDMAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court are the defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss the plaintiff's first amended complaint. For the reasons that follow, the motions are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit concerns allegations that a mortgage servicing company and a homeowners' insurance carrier conspired to issue a force-placed insurance policy with inflated premiums and then failed to pursue and arbitrarily withheld policy proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Marc Barbe and his wife, Renada, are the mortgagors of a home located in Metairie, Louisiana. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC services their mortgage. The mortgage agreement requires the Barbes to insure their property against any hazards \"for which Lender requires insurance;\" it further provides that, if they fail to maintain appropriate coverage, \"Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By letter dated December 31, 2015, Ocwen advised Mr. Barbe that it had not received proof of coverage, as required by the terms of the mortgage, and therefore had renewed a lender-placed policy at his expense. Ocwen explained that the policy's annual premium of $ 3,927 would be billed to Mr. Barbe's escrow account and that he could cancel the coverage at any time, and earn a corresponding refund of any unearned premium, by providing Ocwen with evidence of other acceptable coverage. Ocwen also strongly recommended that Barbe obtain his own policy and warned that the cost of the lender-placed coverage \"may be much higher than the amount [he] would normally pay.\" Finally, Ocwen attached to that letter a copy of the policy it had obtained from American Modern Home Insurance Company, which named Ocwen as the \"insured\" and listed the Barbes as \"borrowers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 5, 2016, high velocity winds damaged the Barbes' roof and exterior elevations, which allowed water to infiltrate the interior of the home and damage the ceilings, walls, floors, and fixtures. The Barbes promptly notified American Modern and filed a claim under the policy. According to the Barbes, American Modern's adjusters provided grossly inadequate estimates and failed to fully and properly pay the property damage claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 3, 2018, Marc Barbe and Renada Barbe sued American Modern Home Insurance Company and Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC in Louisiana state court, alleging that American Modern breached the insurance contract and engaged in bad faith claims adjusting practices under Louisiana law, that Ocwen breached the mortgage agreement by overcharging plaintiffs for the insurance policy and failing to assist them in pursuing insurance proceeds, and that the defendants negligently coordinated their efforts to overcharge plaintiffs for the policy. After timely removing the lawsuit to this Court, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition for failure to state a claim. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint on February 19, 2019, after which Renada Barbe voluntarily dismissed her claims with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his first amended complaint, Mr. Barbe asserts that he is an \"insured\" under the American Modern policy, or at the very least, a third-party beneficiary of the policy. He then alleges that American Modern breached the insurance contract by failing to properly investigate and pay his claim and is also liable for bad faith statutory penalties under Louisiana law. With respect to Ocwen, Mr. Barbe alleges that his mortgage servicer breached the mortgage agreement by overcharging for the insurance policy and by failing to assist him in obtaining sufficient insurance proceeds to repair his property. Barbe also alleges that American Modern and Ocwen participated in a conspiracy, in which Ocwen would pass along an inflated premium to the Barbes and receive \"commissions and/or kickbacks\" from American Modern; he asserts a claim of unjust enrichment against each defendant for the alleged unearned benefits they received at his expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants now move to dismiss the plaintiff's first amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party to move\n   for dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Such a motion is rarely granted because it is viewed with disfavor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowrey v. Tex. A &amp; M Univ.

To the contrary, the mortgage agreement expressly provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage.

With respect to the insurance claims process, the mortgage provides that \"Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender\" of loss; however, it places no obligation on Ocwen to independently pursue or even assist the Barbes in pursuing insurance proceeds from the insurer. Moreover, the permissive provision that allows Ocwen to \"make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower\" also does not impose upon Ocwen a duty to submit proof of loss or otherwise pursue a claim. Rather, it vests Ocwen with the right to submit proof of loss to the insurer in the event the Barbes fail to do so. Accordingly, the terms of the mortgage do not give rise to a duty on the part of Ocwen to pursue insurance proceeds from American Modern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the alternative, Barbe alleges that \"Ocwen assumed the duty to pursue insurance proceeds.\" However, he also admits in his complaint that Ocwen did not submit a claim to American Modern: \"The Barbes, not Ocwen, initiated the claim with AMHIC, though Ocwen sought to participate in the claims process, and thus triggered Ocwen's duty to pursue AMHIC for necessary and proper insurance proceeds inuring to the benefit of the Property.\" The bare factual allegation that \"Ocwen sought to participate in the claims process,\" without more, does not support a finding that Ocwen assumed a duty to pursue insurance proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Because the plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that Ocwen owed a duty under the mortgage or otherwise assumed a duty to pursue insurance proceeds, he fails to state a claim against Ocwen for breach of the mortgage agreement or negligent failure to obtain sufficient payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Obioha v.

Pa. Sept. 10, 1998).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, setting aside the disclosures in Standard Mortgage's letters, Robinson's \"kickback\" allegations are facially implausible....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Standard Mortgage was not subject to divided loyalties when it force-placed insurance on Robinson's property. The mortgage agreement makes clear that the insurance requirement exists to protect\n   <em>\n    the lender's\n   </em>\n   interest in the mortgaged property: \"Borrower shall insure all improvements on the property ... against any hazards, casualties, and contingencies, including fire,\n   <em>\n    for which Lender requires insurance\n   </em>\n   . This insurance shall be maintained in the amounts and for the periods\n   <em>\n    that Lender requires\n   </em>\n   .\" ... Nothing in these terms requires the lender to purchase the cheapest insurance or the insurance that provides the most value for the borrower. Thus, Standard Mortgage did not act on Robinson's behalf when it force-placed insurance coverage; it acted to protect its\n   <em>\n    own interest\n   </em>\n   in the mortgaged property--an interest that Robinson threatened by breaching her own contractual duty to maintain insurance coverage ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 641-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although the\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   court addressed allegations of a fraud-based conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Court finds its reasoning persuasive. Mr. Barbe alleges that Ocwen and American Modern engaged in a scheme to defraud him by passing on inflated insurance premium prices, without disclosing that Ocwen would receive commissions, discounted services, and/or kickbacks from American Modern. But, like the\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   plaintiff, he attaches documents to his complaint confirming that Ocwen warned him about the price of the premiums, urged him to obtain his own coverage, and explained that the force-placed coverage was \"primarily for the benefit of the owner on [his] mortgage loan.\" Mr. Barbe fails to state a claim for fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the alternative, Barbe asserts a claim of unjust enrichment against both defendants concerning their role in the purported insurance premium kickback scheme. He alleges that American Modern would charge him an inflated premium and then provide Ocwen with kickbacks and commissions to maintain the right to force place policies on other properties in which Ocwen has a security interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Louisiana Civil Code Article 2298 codifies Louisiana's doctrine of unjust enrichment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A person who has been enriched without cause at the expense of another person is bound to compensate that person. The term \"without cause\" is used in this context to exclude cases in which the enrichment results from a valid juridical act or the law. The remedy declared here is subsidiary and shall not be available if the law provides another remedy for the impoverishment or declares a contrary rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   La. Civ. Code art. 2298. Thus, to maintain a claim for unjust enrichment under Louisiana law, a plaintiff must show: (1) an enrichment, (2) an impoverishment, (3) \"a connection between the enrichment and the resulting impoverishment,\" (4) \"an absence of 'justification' or 'cause' for the enrichment and impoverishment,\" and (5) that there is \"no other remedy at law available to plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Laborde v.

App. 4 Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, the defendants contend that the no-other-remedy-at-law element cannot be satisfied. They submit that the availability of other remedies at law (here, a breach of contract claim against Ocwen) precludes a claim of unjust enrichment. They also challenge Barbe's ability to satisfy the enrichment and impoverishment elements of his claim, contending that he received insurance coverage and policy proceeds in return for the insurance premiums he paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court agrees with the defendants that Louisiana law precludes Barbe's unjust enrichment claim. \"Louisiana law provides that no unjust enrichment claim shall lie when the claim is based on a relationship that is controlled by an enforceable contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Drs.

Because the mortgage agreement is a valid contract defining Ocwen and Barbe's rights and duties concerning insurance coverage, Louisiana law bars Barbe's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The mortgage agreement required the Barbes to maintain insurance coverage on their property and permitted Ocwen to obtain insurance on the property in the event they failed to do so. The mortgage also warned about the potential high cost of force-placed coverage, explicitly stating that the cost might significantly exceed the cost of insurance that the Barbes could have obtained on their own. Mr. Barbe does not dispute that he failed to maintain insurance coverage as required by the mortgage or that Ocwen had the right to force place coverage on the property pursuant to the terms of their agreement. To the extent Barbe submits that the mortgage does not expressly address Ocwen's receipt of \"kickbacks,\" the Court has already determined that such payments are properly characterized as \"commissions,\" and that the mortgage does not prohibit Ocwen from receiving them. Because Ocwen acted within its contractual rights under the mortgage, Mr. Barbe fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, IT IS ORDERED: that the defendants' motions to dismiss are GRANTED; the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claims are hereby dismissed WITH PREJUDICE, and his breach of contract and tort claims are dismissed WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
