While the issue of the duration of the restrictive covenant remains unsettled, the court may progress to the next consideration: whether the restraints in the restrictive covenant are consistent with Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     Reasonableness of Restrictions\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   A non-compete covenant is in restraint of trade and therefore unenforceable on public policy grounds unless it is reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   Texas Business and Commerce Code \u00a7 15.51 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   If the covenant is found to be ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement but contains limitations as to time, geographical area, or scope of activity to be restrained that are not reasonable and impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee, the court shall reform the covenant to the extent necessary to cause the limitations contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area, and scope of activity to be restrained to be reasonable and to impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee and enforce the covenant as reformed ....\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The restraint \"must not be greater than necessary to protect the promissee's legitimate interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the restrictions in a non-compete covenant-geographic restrictions, duration, and scope-must all be reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff requests the court \"enjoin Defendants from competing with Miner in the exact regions where Anguiano regularly used Miner pricing information and strategy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Plaintiff proposes a geographic region covering most of New Mexico and a substantial amount of counties in Western Texas, as well as the country of Mexico.\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants propose that Anguiano be restricted from \"[e]ngaging in the business of selling and providing loading dock and material handling equipment parts and services within 25 miles of El Paso, Texas, measured from the intersection of Kansas Street and Texas Avenue, El Paso, Texas 79901.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   After consideration of the multiple competing agreements, the expedited discovery period, and the remaining unsettled issues of law, the court believes a cautious approach is most appropriate until a later judgment on the merits. Accordingly, the court restricts the geographic scope of the non-compete covenant to El Paso County, Texas and the country of Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    b. Enforceability of Non-Solicitation Covenants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Like the non-compete covenant, the non-solicitation covenants are only valid if they are ancillary to or part of an otherwise enforceable agreement. As determined above, the restrictive covenants are ancillary to an otherwise enforceable agreement. With respect to the reasonableness of the non-solicitation covenant, the court finds it reasonable to the extent it prohibits PDN from soliciting clients Anguiano served while an employee of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Trade Secrets\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiff further seeks to restrain Defendants from using its trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims Anguiano misappropriated a sales quote sheet, an Excel calculator, a client list, and know-how acquired while employed by Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends that, absent injunctive relief, Defendants will continue to cause it irreparable harm through the prolonged use of trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue the aforementioned documents and information are not trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   TUTSA defines trade secrets and misappropriation of trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n   These definitions are identical to those in TUTSA's federal counterpart-the DTSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   To show a party misappropriated a trade secret, the plaintiff must establish: (1) the information is a trade secret; (2) the defendant acquired the secret through improper means; and (3) the defendant's use of the secret resulted in harm to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   The owner must take \"reasonable measures to keep such information secret\" and the information must \"derive[ ] independent economic value\" from remaining secret.\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once these two criteria are met, \"all forms and types of information,\" including any \"program ... method ... technique ... financial data, or list of actual or potential customers\" are classified as trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   A party can misappropriate a trade secret in two ways. Under one avenue, a party misappropriates a trade secret if she knows or has reason to know the trade secret was acquired through improper means.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n   Improper means include \"theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, to limit use, or to prohibit discovery of a trade secret.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    143\n   </footnotemark>\n   A party also misappropriates a trade secret if she discloses information without the owner's consent and either \"used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret\" or \"knew or had reason to know\" that her\n   knowledge of the trade secret derived from someone who misappropriated the trade secret.\n   <footnotemark>\n    144\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    a. Whether the Information is a Trade Secret\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Once a court determines the information existed, the court must evaluate whether the information is a trade secret.\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Texas Supreme Court enumerated six factors that bear on whether information constitutes a trade secret:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (1) the extent to which the information is known outside of his business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (2) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in his business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (3) the extent of the measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (4) the value of the information to him and to his competitors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (5) the amount of effort or money expended by him in developing the information; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   A party need not satisfy all six factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    i.\n    <em>\n     Excel Calculator\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff alleges Anguiano misappropriated an Excel calculator containing formulas used to calculate profit margins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants contend the Excel calculator is merely an Excel spreadsheet that does not contain any additional information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, Defendants elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   [T]he margins aren't calculated by the calculator until the data is put in.

Plaintiff merely offers conclusory statements. The court will not infer an existence of confidential information within the Excel calculator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff has not shown it expended considerable money and effort developing the information. Although Plaintiff contends it took sufficient security precautions and the alleged information was not readily accessible, it has not persuaded this court that the Excel calculator\n   actually contained any protected information. Without the existence of information worthy of trade-secret protection, security measures and lack of accessibility are inapposite. Moreover, Plaintiff's representative concedes the price quotes could be computed by pencil and paper.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   After a consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Bass\n   </em>\n   factors, the court finds Plaintiff has failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that the Excel calculator qualifies as a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Sales Quote Sheet\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff has not persuaded this court that the sales quote sheet constitutes a trade secret. First, the quote sheet is reasonably well-known, as it is available in the public domain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   A quote sheet \"with nearly identical information fields\" could be downloaded from the internet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the record is devoid of evidence showing the quote sheet contains any information not publicly available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Secondly, the sales quote sheet was widely accessible. Plaintiff's employees used the quote sheet to provide cost information to customers. As it was widely accessed by Plaintiff's employees and clients, there were no limitations on who could obtain the information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   Likewise, Plaintiff took no precautions to safeguard its price quote sheets. Indeed, it routinely handed the sheets to customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff never required the recipients to keep the sales quote sheets confidential.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Nor has Plaintiff shown the sales quote sheet contains any valuable information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was merely a generic template used to inform clients about their purchase. In fact, PDN eventually created its own to replace Plaintiff's quote sheet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Plaintiff has not shown it expended substantial resources in creating the quote sheet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   After careful consideration, the court finds Plaintiff has not established the sales quote sheet qualifies as a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     General Know-How and Customer List\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Plaintiff contends Anguiano misappropriated a customer list and \"know[-]how\" he acquired during his employment with Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the client list nor Anguiano's know-how is a trade secret. First and foremost, Plaintiff has not produced a customer list, and it is not clear the list ever existed. Plaintiff also admits that Anguiano could have compiled a list of his clients from memory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the\n   client list ever existed, much less that it constituted a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Second, \"[m]atters of general knowledge in an industry\" are not trade secrets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has not described the know-how Anguiano allegedly misappropriated in sufficient detail to differentiate it from \"\n   <em>\n    general\n   </em>\n   knowledge, skill, and experience acquired in former employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Anguiano's general know-how is not a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As Plaintiff has not pointed to any information entitled to trade-secret protection, the court need not address whether Anguiano acquired the secret through improper means and whether the use of the secret resulted in harm. In sum, Plaintiff has failed to show the documents, if any, contained information entitled to trade-secret protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the enforceability of the restrictive covenants in the Amended LLC Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    B. Irreparable Harm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   A plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must demonstrate irreparable injury is likely in absence of an injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   To demonstrate threat of an irreparable injury, the plaintiff must show \"a significant threat of injury from the impending action, that the injury is imminent, and that money damages would not fully repair the harm.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In Texas, injury resulting from the breach of non-compete is the epitome of irreparable injury, so enforcement appears to be the rule rather than the exception.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sister courts have concluded that the use of an employer's confidential information and possible loss of customers is sufficient to show irreparable harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Anguiano testified that PDN \"basically\" does \"the same type of service\" as Miner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    171\n   </footnotemark>\n   Anguiano also stated he sold to Miner customers on behalf of PDN.\n   <footnotemark>\n    172\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miner contends it \"has seen a decrease in projected revenue for 2019\" for 20 out of 38 Miner clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    173\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The court finds Miner has shown sufficient potential for irreparable injury at this preliminary stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    C. Balancing of Harms\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Next, the court must balance the potential harm to Plaintiff with the hardship to Defendants if an injunction is not\n   issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n   Permitting a former employee to compete in the relevant geographic area and solicit the former employer's customers would result in Plaintiff \"facing a substantial risk of losing customers it otherwise would have had and an erosion of its goodwill, losses that are difficult or impossible to quantify by monetary damages.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Anguiano were to continue to compete in the relevant geographic area and solicit Plaintiff's customers, there is potential risk of reputational harm to Plaintiff's business interests and financial harm. Accordingly, this factor is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    D. Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Finally, the court considers whether granting the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit and Texas courts regularly uphold restrictive covenants and grant injunctions in certain settings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Anguiano signed the Amended LLC Agreement, thereby agreeing to non-compete and non-solicitation covenants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, a preliminary injunction enforcing these restrictive covenants in the Amended LLC Agreement is in the public interest. The fourth factor is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION &amp; ORDERS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff has established the four factors required to issue a preliminary injunction.
