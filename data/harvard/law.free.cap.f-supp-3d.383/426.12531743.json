He is entitled to this stacking unless he signs a form waiving this right. Avoiding the form waiver, insurers introduced \"household exclusions\" precluding stacking underinsured coverage when the vehicle involved in the accident is not listed on every insurance policy issued to family members in the same house. For over twenty-eight years, Pennsylvania courts wrestled with the insurers' household exclusion compared to section 1738. In August 2017, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal on whether the household exclusion violated Pennsylvania Law. On January 23, 2019, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held this household exclusion violated section 1738 at least when the same insurer agreed to stacking on different vehicles operated by family members in the same house. An injured insured now seeks a declaratory judgment and damages after his insurer declined stacking under the identical household exclusion language. The insurer moves to dismiss arguing the\n   January 23, 2019 decision does not apply to the insured's earlier-issued policies. After careful analysis of the varied caselaw, we hold the decision did not announce a new rule but interpreted the law for the first time in a retroactive precedential decision. We deny the insurer's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Plead facts.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pennsylvanian Francis J.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Butta sued GEICO on January 23, 2019 seeking we declare he is entitled to recover stacked underinsured motorist coverage under his parents' policy and compensatory damages for a breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   He alleges the \"household exclusion\" is not enforceable under the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's January 23, 2019 holding in\n   <em>\n    Gallagher v. GEICO Indemnity Co.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held the same household exclusion relied upon by GEICO today in denying coverage violates Pennsylvania's Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (\"MVFRL\"). Mr. Butta argues the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision applies retroactively to his policy in effect before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's January 2019 decision. GEICO moves to dismiss seeking to uphold its denial of coverage arguing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court January 23, 2019 holding is not retroactive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 1, 1990, the General Assembly amended the MVFRL to provide, \"[w]hen more than one vehicle is insured under one or more policies providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, the stated limit for uninsured or underinsured coverage shall apply separately to each vehicle so insured.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   This policy, called \"stacking,\" applies unless an insured affirmatively waives it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MVFRL contains a form insureds must sign to properly waive stacking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under policies with a \"household exclusion,\" however, stacking does not cover people living in the same household as the insured but not included in the insured's policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 23, 2019, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held the household exclusion violates the MVFRL \"under the facts\n   of this case insomuch as it acts as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   waiver of stacked UIM coverage provided for in the MVFRL.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   GEICO argues it legally denied Mr. Butta's claim under the household exclusion, as the household exclusion constituted an enforceable exception when Mr. Butta's policy applied and when he made his claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Butta does not dispute the language of his parents' policy, if enforceable, excluded coverage. He instead argues the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   decision bars the application of the household exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. How do we decide if\n    <em>\n     Gallagher\n    </em>\n    is retroactive?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not decide whether\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   applies to the same language in pre-policies issued to other persons, we \"must predict how Pennsylvania's highest court would decide this case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In predicting how the highest court of the state would resolve the issue, [we] must consider relevant state precedents, analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"To determine whether a decision should have retroactive effect, a court should first determine whether the decision announced a new rule of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A decision announces a new rule of law if it overrules prior law, expresses a fundamental break from precedent that litigants may have relied on, or decides an issue of first impression not clearly foreshadowed by precedent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"One of the hallmarks of whether [the Pennsylvania Supreme Court] has issued a new rule of law is if the decision overrules, modifies, or limits any previous opinions of [the Pennsylvania Supreme] Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to statutory law like the MVFRL, when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has \"not yet answered a specific question about the meaning of a statute, [its] initial interpretation does not announce a new rule of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its \"first pronouncement on the substance of a statutory provision is purely a clarification of an existing law,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   In such cases, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's interpretation of the statute \"constitutes its meaning from its inception.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   And is retroactive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But if a case announces a new rule, Pennsylvania courts generally give the rule retroactive application only to \"cases that are pending at the time the new rule is announced.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, whether to apply a decision retroactively is a matter of \"judicial discretion which must be exercised on a case by case basis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   We should consider whether: \"(1) retroactive effect\n   will further or hinder the purpose of the new rule; (2) the parties will be unfairly prejudiced because they relied on the old rule; and (3) giving the new rule retroactive effect will detrimentally affect the administration of justice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Butta argues\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   did not announce a new rule of law, instead announcing only a judicial construction of the MVFRL which is now part of the MVFRL from its inception. GEICO argues\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   overruled Pennsylvania law, meaning it is a new rule which should not be applied retroactively to policies in place before\n   <em>\n    Gallagher.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The case law before\n    <em>\n     Gallagher.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the validity of \"household exclusion\" clauses on several occasions with facts like Mr. Butta's case.

All three Superior Court judges noted the \"divided nature\" of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on the issue, and explicitly counseled an appeal of their own ruling.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   holding did not establish a \"new rule.\" Its interpretation of the MVFRL vis-a-vis household exclusions is part of the MVFRL from its inception. As GEICO's only argument in its motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   does not apply to this case, we deny GEICO's motion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 36.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    ECF Doc.
