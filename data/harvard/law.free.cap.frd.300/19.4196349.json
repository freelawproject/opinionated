FRIEDMAN, United States District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">This matter is before the Court on a number of motions seeking access to material that has been filed under seal in this case. Several putative class members\u2014Dow Chemical Company (\u201cDow\u201d), Rayonier, Inc. (\u201cRayonier\u201d), and the Southern Company (\u201cSouthern\u201d)\u2014as well as plaintiffs in a related case\u2014the Oxbow companies\u2014seek access to assertedly confidential information filed under seal pursuant to a protective order. These third parties have moved to intervene for the purposes of amending the protective order, as appropriate; signing on to that amended order and committing to abide by it; and then being given access to the information now under seal. To be clear, these motions do not seek general access to discovery materials in this case, but only to the sealed portions of court records already on the public docket. To the extent that some discovery materials and all of the expert reports are sought by these motions, that is because they were exhibits to or submitted under seal with the class certification motion and opposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The Court heard oral argument on the motions to intervene and for access on September 13, 2012, on the same date that it heard argument on defendants\u2019 motion to stay proceedings pending a decision by the court of appeals on the defendants\u2019 appeal of this Court\u2019s class certification decision. Following that hearing, the Court stayed notice to the class and took the motions for access under advisement pending the court of appeals\u2019 decision on class certification. On August 9, 2013, the court of appeals vacated the class certification order and remanded the case to this Court for reconsideration. <em>See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig.</em>\u2014MDL <em>No. 1869, </em>725 F.3d 244 (D.C.Cir.2013). At a status conference on October 15, 2013, the Court elicited the parties\u2019 views on how to proceed on remand. At the request of those putative class members with pending motions seeking to intervene, it also held a status conference on the same day with respect to those pending motions. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the petitioners\u2019 motions to intervene, but will deny the motions for access without prejudice to their being refiled at a later date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Under Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court may permit anyone to intervene who \u201chas a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B). The decision to grant such a motion is left to the discretion of the Court. <em>EEOC v. Nat'l Children\u2019s Center, </em>146 F.3d 1042, 1045 (D.C.Cir.1998). In exercising its discretion the Court must consider \u201cwhether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties\u2019 rights.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Rule 24(b) has been broadly interpreted as a proper vehicle for a third party to seek access to sealed judicial records or discovery. <em>See EEOC v. Nat\u2019l Children\u2019s Center, </em>146 F.3d at 1045-46. The D.C. Circuit has concluded that \u201cthird parties may be allowed to permissively intervene under Rule 24(b) for the limited purpose of seeking access to materials that have been shielded from public view either by seal or by a protective order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1046. Permissive intervention to seek access to court records or discovery has been allowed in a variety of types of cases, including class actions and antitrust actions. <em>See, e.g., Wilk v. American Medical Ass\u2019n, </em>635 F.2d 1295, 1299 (7th Cir.1980) (granting third party\u2019s motion for access to sealed pretrial discovery in antitrust action), <em>superseded in part by statute; In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, </em>333 F.Supp.2d 333, 335 (E.D.Penn.2004) (granting collateral litigants\u2019 motion for permissive intervention in antitrust class action and granting access to all discovery); <em>In re Vitamins Antitrust Litigation, </em>No. 99-MC-197, 2001 WL 34088808, at *7 (D.D.C. Mar. 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>2001) (granting Canadian litigants\u2019 motion to intervene in related U.S. class action).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Under Rule 24(b)(2), a movant typically must show (1) an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction; (2) that the motion to intervene is timely; and (3) a claim or defense that shares a common question of law or fact with the main action. <em>See EEOC v. Nat\u2019l Children\u2019s Center, </em>146 F.3d at 1046. The D.C. Circuit has found that the jurisdictional prong is already met when the movant seeks modification of a protective order still in place, as the district court already has jurisdiction over the protective order. <em>Id. </em>at 1047 (finding that \u201csuch intervenors do not ask the district court to exercise jurisdiction over .an additional claim on the merits, but rather to exercise a power that it already has\u201d). The timeliness prong presents no barrier: this requirement is intended to ensure that the main action is not disrupted by the entry of a delinquent newcomer, and it has been viewed flexibly in the context of interventions to amend protective orders. <em>Id. </em>The requirement of a common question of law or fact also is easily met here by all parties. <em>See id. </em>(noting that courts \u201chave afforded this requirement considerable breadth when the movant seeks to intervene for the collateral purpose of challenging a confidentiality order\u201d). Oxbow\u2019s claims in the related litigation are very similar to the claims at issue in the present case, and the claims of the potential class members are, by definition, identical to those presented here. The Court therefore finds that the three requisites for intervention under Rule 24(b)(2) have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The putative class members\u2014Dow, Rayonier, and Southern\u2014seek access to the sealed portions of the record in this ease primarily, they say, in order for their counsel to \u201cprovide meaningful, informed advice about whether [they] should opt out and pursue [their] own individual action[s].\u201d Dow Supp. Mem. 2; <em>see also </em>Rayonier Supp. Mem. 2-3; Southern Mot. 1. This argument has lost some force in light of the court of appeals\u2019 remand, since the decision whether to certify the class is now delayed. Indeed, in view of the stipulated Scheduling Order issued by the Court on October 31, 2013, a decision on certification likely will not take place until the summer or fall of 2014. <em>See </em>Stipulation and Scheduling Order at 1-2. The putative class members nevertheless argue that there is no reason to deny them immediate access to the sealed portions of the record because early disclosure will facilitate their ultimate decision whether or not to opt out and proceed individually; it will allow them to make that decision, at the appropriate time, \u201con an expeditious basis.\u201d Dow Supp. Mem. 2. Rayonier goes even further, suggesting the possibility that it may not wait \u201csome indeterminate period of time to learn if a class will be certified,\u201d but, rather, after receiving access to the sealed portions of the record, it may decide \u201cwhether to proceed with its own action now.\u201d Rayonier Supp. Mem. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Plaintiffs and defendants have numerous responses to these arguments. First, they say, there is little relevant material still under seal. Since the fall of 2012, in response to directions from this Court and from Magistrate Judge Facciola, they say they have complied with the terms of the protective order, as modified, requiring them to file on the public docket redacted versions of materials that have been filed under seal; they represent that they continue to do so. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Supp. Mem. 1; Defs.\u2019 Opp. Rayonier Mot. 3, n.l; October 15, 2013 Tr. at 85-87. Whether the parties have strictly complied with the terms of the protective order has recently been called into question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Court therefore places minimal weight on the parties\u2019 representations that the redactions have been undertaken with scrupulous care. The risk that substantial material is improperly withheld, however, has been mitigated by the careful attention of Magistrate Judge Facciola, and most documents filed in this ease are available on the public record. Moreover, the Court finds the other reasons put forth by the parties to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Plaintiffs and defendants\u2019 second argument is that if the movants are seeking access to the sealed materials primarily in order to aid them in determining whether to opt out of the class or remain a class member, there is no longer any urgency because a decision on certification is nearly a year away. <em>See </em>Stipulation and Scheduling Order at 1-2. Third, counsel for the plaintiffs are concerned that giving access to sealed material to the movants likely will create an incentive for many other putative class members to intervene, attempt to gain access to sealed records, and then, possibly, file then-own opt out suits. All of this, they argue, would undermine judicial economy and, if taken to an extreme, would threaten the viability of the class action mechanism. Fourth, plaintiffs argue that normally limited access to sealed materials in a class action is provided only <em>after </em>notice has been issued, not <em>before </em>the issuance of notice, because only then must putative class members decide whether to opt out. <em>See In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litigation, </em>182 F.R.D. 69, 72 (S.D.N.Y.1998) (permitting access after notice was disseminated to class members); <em>J.B.D.L. Corp v. Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Inc., </em>C-1-01-704, at 3-6 (S.D.Ohio July 15, 2003) (same). Fifth, the parties\u2014particularly the defendants\u2014maintain that they have a strong interest in not having their sensitive, confidential business information widely circulated. Finally, the parties note that if the Court ultimately decides <em>not </em>to certify a class, the decision about whether to opt out will have been made for the movants, and they would have no need for or right to the materials they seek. And regardless of the ultimate outcome on the certification decision, the only prejudice they possibly will suffer is delay in their individual cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court is persuaded by these arguments that the request for access to the sealed material is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">As for Oxbow, the Court also finds that its request for access is premature, but for different reasons. This Court dismissed Oxbow\u2019s initial complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals, LLC v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., </em>926 F.Supp.2d 36 (D.D.C.2013). Oxbow then filed an amended complaint. The defendants have once again moved to dismiss, and that motion is now ripe. The Court was advised at the October 15, 2013 status conference that discovery has not yet begun in the <em>Oxbow </em>ease and, presumably, it will not begin until after the motion to dismiss is resolved. <em>See </em>October 15, 2013 Tr. at 79-80, 97-98. While Oxbow asserts that it nevertheless has an immediate interest in obtaining access to the materials under seal in this case, its interest in those materials will become considerably weaker, if not nonexistent, if its claims do not survive the motion to dismiss. As the relevant authorities make plain, the appropriate time for this Court to determine whether the protective order should be amended so as to make relevant documents available to Oxbow is after the motion to dismiss has been resolved and discovery in the related ease is underway. <em>See </em>Manual for Complex Litigation \u00a7 11.432 (4th ed. 2004) (\u201cGenerally, the [non-party] seeking discovery should first establish its right to discovery in the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>which it will be used\u201d). <em>See also Foltz v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>331 F.3d 1122, 1132 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cAs an initial matter, the collateral litigant must demonstrate the relevance of the protected discovery to the collateral proceedings and its general discovery therein.\u201d); <em>Wilk v. American Medical Ass\u2019n, </em>635 F.2d at 1299-1300 (permitting access by a \u201cbona fide litigant\u201d who would otherwise be entitled to discover sealed materials through duplicative discovery in related proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">There is no prejudice to denying Oxbow access\u2014and nothing to be gained by providing access\u2014until after the motion to dismiss is decided in the related ease, and Oxbow and the defendants know whether the litigation and attendant discovery will proceed. None of the cases cited by Oxbow supports access to protected court documents for use in a related case that has not yet reached the discovery stage. Oxbow\u2019s request for access will be denied without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">For all of these reasons, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">ORDERED that [Dkt. No. 553], [Dkt. No. 554], [Dkt.

No. 554] the motion of Oxbow to modify the protective order is DENIED as premature, and without prejudice to its being refiled upon a showing that Oxbow is entitled to discovery in <em>Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC v.
