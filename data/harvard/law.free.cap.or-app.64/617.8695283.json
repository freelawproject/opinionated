On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted Colonial\u2019s motion and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion. Judgment was entered for Colonial, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">On October 24, 1980, while Colonial\u2019s insured, Barron, was driving Andrews\u2019 automobile, with Andrews as a passenger, a collision occurred between the Andrews vehicle and an uninsured motorist. Andrews was injured in the collision. Utah paid Andrews PIP and uninsured motorist benefits (UIM). Utah then sued Colonial for reimbursement of those benefits. Andrews joined as plaintiff, seeking recovery \u2014 under the PIP and UIM provisions of Colonial\u2019s policy with Barron \u2014 for medical expenses, wage loss and general damages. On defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court struck from the complaint plaintiffs\u2019 claims for UIM benefits. That ruling has not been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">At the time of the accident, and for several weeks preceding it, Barron\u2019s vehicle had been inoperable. During that time, Barron, on occasion, had borrowed Andrews\u2019 automobile for his personal use. The Colonial policy defines \u201cinsured car\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u201c(8) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">&lt;&lt;*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\u201c (d) any car or utility trailer you use, that is not owned by you or regularly or frequently used by you or any resident of your household, if such use is with the permission of the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">\u201c(e) any substitute car means any car or utility trailer not owned by you, a relative, or resident, being temporarily used as a substitute for any other car covered under this Part, because of its withdrawal from normal use due to breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Under the terms of the Colonial policy, Andrews\u2019 automobile, while driven by Barron, was a \u201csubstitute car\u201d and therefore an \u201cinsured vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Colonial concedes that, by the terms of its policy, Andrews\u2019 automobile, while driven by Barron, was an \u201cinsured vehicle\u201d with respect to Barron\u2019s liability. Colonial asserts, however, that a PIP endorsement in its policy defines \u201cinjured persons\u201d as persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying or using \u201cthe insured motor vehicle\u201d with the permission of the named insured. \u201c[T]he insured motor vehicle\u201d is defined in Colonial\u2019s PIP endorsement as a vehicle \u201cof which the named insured is the owner.\u201d Barron did not own the Andrews vehicle; therefore, argues Colonial, Andrews was not an \u201cinjured person\u201d under the terms of its policy, and so she was not covered by its PIP provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-3\">Utah contends that, although Colonial\u2019s PIP endorsement attempts to exclude Andrews from coverage, she is nevertheless covered because Colonial\u2019s PIP limitation violates the Oregon PIP statute, ORS 743.800 <em>et seq. </em>In support of that argument, Utah suggests that, if there were no Utah policy involved in the present case, because the Colonial coverage applies only to \u201cowned\u201d vehicles, Andrews would have no PIP coverage. Accordingly, Utah argues, Colonial\u2019s PIP limitation could lead to gaps in coverage and thus impermissibly thwart the purpose of ORS 743.800 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Andrews\u2019 Utah policy contained a \u201cBroad Form - Named Operator\u201d endorsement. That endorsement limits Utah\u2019s liability to only the \u201cnamed insured * * * while driving any four wheel private passenger automobile whether owned or not * * The policy excludes coverage of any kind on any automobile \u201cwhile driven by any other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Colonial contends that Utah\u2019s policy is incompatible with the PIP Law, ORS 743.800 <em>et seq, </em>because Utah is unlawfully attempting to avoid, through the use of the broad form named operator endorsement, its PIP coverage on its own insured\u2019s vehicle. Colonial asserts that Utah\u2019s interpretation of its policy would deprive occupants of the Andrews vehicle of PIP benefits anytime someone other than Andrews was driving and that, in the event of a single car accident, there would be no other source of PIP coverage for those occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In essence, both insurers contend that each other\u2019s PIP endorsement violates the PIP law, and they each assert that if their opponent\u2019s policy was the same as their policy, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>question of PIP coverage would have arisen. We note, however, that Oregon\u2019s Financial Responsibility law, ORS 486.506(1), expressly approves both \u201cdescribed vehicle\u201d and \u201cnamed operator\u201d policies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>ORS 486.411(1). Nevertheless, we conclude, under the facts of this case, that the language of ORS 743.800(1) and 743.810 precludes both insurers\u2019 attempts to limit their PIP coverage, and we hold those limitations to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The PIP scheme of ORS 743.800 <em>et seq, </em>initially submitted as HB 1300, was enacted by Or Laws 1971, ch 523. Legislative history of the bill is sparse, particularly with respect to ORS 743.800 (Or Laws 1971, ch 523, \u00a7 2) and ORS 743.810 (Or Laws 1971, ch 523, \u00a7 4). The bill\u2019s legislative history does show that the statute was primarily intended to assure early payment of medical costs and lost wages that resulted from personal injuries sustained in automobile accidents. <em>Statement Regarding Proposals of Insurance Automobile Accidents, </em>Commissioner\u2019s Special Advisory Committee on Auto Insurance, by Cornelius Bateson, Subcommittee on Financial Affairs, House State and Federal Affairs Committee, exhibit 4, February 24,1971. It further shows that ORS 743.800 was intended to mandate PIP coverage \u201cin each policy covering private passenger motor vehicles.\u201d Presentation of HB 1300 to Subcommittee on Financial Affairs, House State and Federal Affairs Committee, Exhibit C, February, 1974. Unfortunately, these broad guidelines afford little help in resolving the convoluted issues that have arisen in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">ORS 743.800(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201c(1) Every motor vehicle liability policy issued for delivery in this state that covers any private passenger motor vehicle shall provide personal injury protection benefits to the person insured thereunder, members of that person\u2019s family residing in the same household, passengers occupying the insured motor vehicle and pedestrians struck by the insured motor vehicle. \u2018Personal injury protection benefits\u2019 means the benefits described in this section and ORS 743.805 and 743.815.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Under this section, the Colonial policy: (1) was \u201cissued for delivery in this state\u201d; (2) \u201ccoverfs] any private passenger motor vehicle,\u201d (i.ethe Andrews vehicle was a \u201csubstitute car\u201d and therefore an \u201cinsured vehicle\u201d under the Colonial policy); and (3) insured Andrews as a \u201cpassenger occupying the insured motor vehicle.\u201d ORS 743.800 therefore mandates PIP coverage for Andrews under the Colonial policy, and Colonial\u2019s PIP limitation is invalid. Similarly, we reject Utah\u2019s attempt to limit its PIP coverage for its insured. Under the terms of ORS 743.800 and the Utah policy, Andrews is \u201cthe person insured\u201d and has PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The remaining issue is how to distribute the liability for the PIP payments made by Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">ORS 743.810 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u201c (1) The personal injury protection benefits with respect to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201c(a) The insured and members of his family residing in the same household injured while occupying the insured motor vehicle shall be primary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\u201c(b) Passengers injured while occupying the insured motor vehicle shall be primary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">&lt;&lt;* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">\u201c(d) The insured and members of his family residing in the same household injured while occupying motor vehicle not insured under the policy shall be excess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">\u201c(e) Pedestrians injured by the insured motor vehicle, other than the insured and members of his family residing in the same household, shall be excess over any other collateral benefits to which the injured person is entitled, including but not limited to insurance benefits, governmental benefits or gratuitous benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Both Utah\u2019s and Colonial\u2019s limitations on PIP coverage being invalid, Andrews is properly viewed as \u201c[t]he insured * * * injured while occupying the insured motor vehicle * * therefore, under ORS 743.810(1) (a), the Utah policy is primary. However, Andrews was also a \u201c[p]assenger injured while occupying the insured motor vehicle * * *\u201d under the Colonial policy, and her coverage is therefore also primary under the Colonial policy. ORS 743.810(l)(b). Having concluded that both policies are primary with respect to Andrews\u2019 injuries, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>think it appropriate to apply the rule of <em>Lamb-Weston v. Ore. Auto Ins. Co., </em>219 Or 110, 341 P2d 110, 346 P2d 643 (1959). In that case, the court required the insurance companies to prorate the loss in accordance with the ratio of the loss to their applicable policy limits. Here, as in <em>Lamb-Weston, </em>the ratio of the loss may be easily established by determining each insurer\u2019s PIP liability limits. If, for instance, both insurers provide the statutory PIP benefits, the ratio of the loss of each insurer is equal, and hence the liability is also equal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Reversed and remanded with instructions that the trial court determine the limits of the PIP coverage of each insurer and pro-rate the $11,390.50 benefits paid accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> ORS 486.506(l)(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">\u201cEvery certificate of insurance shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201c(c) Describe all vehicles covered by the policy, unless such policy is issued with respect to all vehicles operated by the assured.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
