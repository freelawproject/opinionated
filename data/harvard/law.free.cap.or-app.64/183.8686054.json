He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denying his motion to withdraw his plea of no contest to the assault charge and his plea of guilty to the theft charge, contending that the factual basis for the no contest plea ceased to exist as of the time of sentencing and that the guilty plea was rendered involuntary because of certain misrepresentations made by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">This court is not authorized to consider on direct appeal defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his pleas.
