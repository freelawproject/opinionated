J.</author>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Defendant seeks reversal of his convictions for driving while suspended (ORS 487.560(1)) and driving under the influence of intoxicants (ORS 487.540), contending that the trial court erred by withdrawing his affirmative defense of necessity from the jury. Because defendant offered no evidence to support one of the two elements of that defense, the trial court\u2019s ruling was not reversible error. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Prior to trial, defendant stipulated that he was driving a motor vehicle on the night of his arrest, that his driver\u2019s license was suspended and that he was under the influence of intoxicants. Despite these stipulations, defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge of driving while suspended and raised a \u201cnecessity\u201d defense under ORS 487.560(2)(a). That statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201c(2) In a prosecution [for the crime of \u2018driving while suspended\u2019] * * * it is an affirmative defense that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201c(a) An injury or immediate threat of injury to human or animal life and the urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for the defendant to drive a motor vehicle at the time and place in question; * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In support of his defense, defendant introduced evidence that his father had fallen from a bar stool and broken his ankle and that he, defendant, was driving his father to the hospital when the police officer stopped their car. The state asked the court to withdraw the necessity defense from the jury; the court granted the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Defendant first asserts that the trial court lacked the statutory authority to withdraw his defense from the jury. The relevant statute, ORS 161.055, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201c(1) When a \u2018defense,\u2019 other than an \u2018affirmative defense\u2019 as defined in subsection (2) of this section, is raised at a trial, the state has the burden of disproving the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201c(2) When a defense, declared to be an \u2018affirmative defense\u2019 by chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971,1[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] is raised at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>trial, the defendant has the burden of proving the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">&lt;&lt;* * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Defendant argues that because the legislature did not adopt the necessity defense until <em>1975,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that defense is not \u201cdeclared to be an affirmative defense by chapter 743, Oregon Laws <em>1971.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Consequently, according to defendant, he had only to present some evidence of necessity in order to shift the burden to the state to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt and, because the burden had shifted to the state by the time the state made its motion, the trial court could not properly withdraw the defense from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s analysis. ORS 161.035(2) provides that defenses adopted by the legislature after 1971 should be construed and applied in the same manner as defenses adopted as a part of Chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201c(2) Except as otherwise expressly provided, or unless the context requires otherwise, <em>the provisions of chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, shall govern </em>the construction of and punishment for any offense defined outside chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, * * * as well as <em>the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Because defendants bear the burden of proof with respect to all affirmative defenses created by chapter 743, the emphasized language of ORS 161.035(2) means that, absent some express direction or contextual requirement to the contrary, defendants bear the burden of proof with respect to <em>all </em>affirmative defenses. Neither the language nor the context of ORS 487.560(2)(a), nor any other statute, aids defendant under this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">We hold that defendant, having raised a necessity defense, had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that there was an injury or threat of injury to human or animal life and (2) that the urgency of the circumstances made it necessary for him to drive at the time and place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in question. It follows from this holding that, if either element of the defense lacked evidentiary support, the trial judge had the authority to withdraw the defense from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>State v. Peters, </em>49 Or App 653, 619 P2d 1360 (1980); <em>see also State v. Matthews, </em>30 Or App 1133, 1135, 569 P2d 662 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erroneously interpreted ORS 487.560(2) (a) by requiring defendant to show that his father\u2019s injury was \u201clife-threatening.\u201d The trial court\u2019s oral ruling on the state\u2019s withdrawal motion demonstrates that the court interpreted the statutory phrase \u201cinjury or threat of injury to human or animal life\u201d to mean \u201clife-threatening injury\u201d and granted the motion in part because defendant had failed to produce evidence of a \u201clife-threatening\u201d injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state agrees with the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>interpretation. Defendant, on the other hand, contends that the statute does not require such evidence. We are thus called on to decide for the first time whether ORS 487.560(2)(a) requires proof of an injury of \u201clife-threatening\u201d severity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">As noted, the statute requires a defendant to show \u201can injury or threat of injury to human or animal life.\u201d This phrase could mean either: (1) actual or threatened harm to a human being or an animal, as opposed to other, inanimate property, or (2) actual or threatened harm severe enough to cause the death of a human being or an animal. Neither the remainder of the statute nor its commentary resolves this ambiguity. We are convinced, however, that the legislature intended the statute to have the former meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">First, a comparison of the \u201cnecessity\u201d defense at issue here and the more general \u201cchoice of evils\u201d defense in ORS 161.200 suggests that the reference to \u201chuman or animal life\u201d in ORS 487.560(2) (a) is simply intended to make the \u201cnecessity\u201d defense unavailable when the \u201cinjury or threat of injury\u201d is to real or personal <em>property </em>rather than a living creature. By contrast, the \u201cchoice of evils\u201d statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201c(1) Unless inconsistent with * * * some other provision of law, conduct which would otherwise constitute an offense is justifiable and not criminal when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201c (a) That conduct is necessary as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201c(b) The threatened injury is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the desirability and urgency of avoiding the injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">* * * *99</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">This language and the Official Commentary to the 1971 Oregon Criminal Code, at 20, demonstrate that the choice of evils defense may be invoked by a defendant who has acted unlawfully in order to prevent the destruction of inanimate property. The necessity defense is similar in nature to the choice of evils defense but narrower: it will only shelter a defendant whose illegal action was intended to remedy or prevent injury to human or animal <em>life. </em>This difference in the scope of the two defenses was achieved by the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201chuman or animal life\u201d in ORS 487.560(2) (a). We think it is fair to assume that the creation of that distinction was the only purpose of the phrase \u201chuman or animal life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Second, the imposition of a \u201clife-threatening\u201d standard could have unreasonably harsh effects in certain circumstances. For example, suppose that a suspended driver and another person travel 30 miles by motor vehicle to a remote area in order to camp and hike. In the course of a hike, the suspended driver\u2019s companion breaks his leg. It is clear to the suspended driver that his companion is not in danger of dying, although he is in pain. The driver is faced with a choice: he can violate ORS 487.560(1) and drive 30 miles for help, or he can <em>hike </em>that distance. The state\u2019s construction of subsection (2) (a) would compel the latter decision, but we think it unlikely that the legislature intended such a harsh result. We have often held that we \u201cpresume the legislature did not intend harsh results that literal application of statutory terms would cause.\u201d <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Gates, </em>56 Or App 694, 699, 642 P2d 1200 (1982); <em>Mallon v. Emp. Div., </em>41 Or App 479, 484, 599 P2d 1164 (1979). <em>A fortiori, </em>we are not inclined to read into <em>ambiguous </em>language a meaning with the potential to produce such results.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Third, there is no harm in omitting a \u201clife-threatening\u201d requirement from the defense. If the state is concerned that, absent such a requirement, suspended drivers will use passengers\u2019 minor cuts and pulled muscles to establish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>defense, the state\u2019s fear is unfounded. In addition to proving the existence or threat of an injury, a defendant must demonstrate that the \u201curgency of the circumstances\u201d compelled him to drive. The circumstances attending most minor injuries will not be \u201curgent\u201d enough to aid in the establishment of a necessity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Finally, we note that, as a general rule of statutory construction, we are to resolve doubts about legislative intent in favor of criminal defendants. <em>State v. Linthwaite, </em>52 Or App 511, 523 n 12, 628 P2d 1250 (1981), <em>rev\u2019d and rem\u2019d on other grounds, </em>295 Or 162, 665 P2d 863 (1983); <em>see State v. Cloutier, </em>286 Or 579, 587-88, 596 P2d 1278 (1979). In the absence of clear legislative intent or other reasons why we should read a requirement of \u201clife-threatening\u201d injury into the ambiguous language of ORS 487.560(2) (a), we decline to do so. To the extent that the trial court imposed such a requirement on defendant, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"> Our refusal to apply a \u201clife-threatening\u201d standard does not, however, require reversal. As the findings quoted, <em>supra </em>n 4, demonstrate, the trial court found no evidence that \u201cthe urgency [of] the circumstances made it necessary\u201d for defendant to drive his father to the hospital. This finding was based on evidence that defendant made no attempt to telephone an ambulance, the police or other emergency services, although he knew such services existed in the vicinity, and did not request the driving assistance of other individuals at the bar who were both sober<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and licensed. Defendant offered no explanation for his failure to secure an alternative form of transportation for his father, and he points to no other evidence which could support an inference that the \u201curgency of the circumstances\u201d compelled <em>him </em>to drive his injured parent to the hospital. The language of ORS 487.560(2) (a) makes it clear that a defendant seeking to establish a necessity defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>must prove <em>both </em>injury and urgent circumstances. Defendant\u2019s failure to offer evidence to establish the latter element justified the trial court\u2019s decision to withdraw the necessity defense from the jury. <em>State v. Peters, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Oregon Laws 1971, Chapter 743, was the \u201cOregon Criminal Code of 1971,\u201d a major overhaul of the state\u2019s criminal statutes. Affirmative defenses to crimes defined in that act were set forth, and labelled as affirmative defenses, in the sections defining the pertinent offenses.

The severity of the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s illness was not in issue, but we noted in passing that \u201cthe jury could have found [from the evidence] that the situation appeared to defendant to be life-threatening.\u201d The state argues that this language establishes a requirement that defendants prove \u201clife-threatening\u201d injury in order to establish a necessity defense. The state is mistaken. As noted above, a defendant asserting a necessity defense must prove two elements: (1) actual or threatened injury and (2) urgent circumstances. The issue in <em>Peters </em>involved the second element. Our brief discussion of the \u201cinjury\u201d element was therefore dictum rather than a considered interpretation of the pertinent statutory language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> When a court or jury makes its assessment of the \u201curgency of the circumstances,\u201d it is appropriate to consider the fact that the defendant was intoxicated at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
