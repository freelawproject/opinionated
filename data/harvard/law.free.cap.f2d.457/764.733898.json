The Arizona Supreme Court held the evidence sufficient. Drury v. Burr, 107 Ariz. 124, 483 P.2d 539 (1971). The district court, after an independent review of the record, agreed and denied Drury\u2019s petition for habeas corpus without a hearing. Drury appeals, claiming that his detention for trial amounted to a denial of due process because of lack of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-24\">We affirm on different grounds. Our reading of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669, convinces us that only in the most unusual circumstances is a defendant entitled to have federal interposition by way of injunction or habeas corpus until after the jury comes in, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>judgment has been appealed from and the case concluded in the state courts. Apparent finality of one issue is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The order denying relief is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AZb\">The mandate will issue now.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
