In chronological order, the first is an appeal (Docket No. 71-1460) by Commerce Tankers Corporation (Commerce) and Vantage Steamship Corporation (Vantage) from a preliminary injunction granted in a decision filed on March 2, 1971 (opinion reported at 325 F.Supp. 360) and an order entered on March 4, 1971 by Judge Frankel which confirmed an arbitration award in favor of the National Maritime Union (NMU). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1129\">*1129</page-number>The second appeal (Docket No. 71-1831) is by Ivan C. McLeod, Regional Director of the Second Region of the National Labor Relations Board, from a lower court refusal to grant a temporary injunction pursuant to Section 10 (l) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(l)) which had been sought by the Acting Regional Director in May 1971. Judge Croake ruled as of July 15, 1971 in that action (opinion reported at 329 F.Supp. 151 (SDNY 1971)) that the Regional Director did not have reasonable cause to believe that NMU and Commerce had violated Section 8(e) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">We reverse and remand with instructions in both of the appeals. In conformity with the following opinion we order that the district court vacate the injunction issued in Docket No. 71-1460; and we order that, inasmuch as we hold that the Regional Director did have reasonable cause to believe that NMU and Commerce had violated Section 8(e), a just and proper injunction be issued in Docket No. 71-1831.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-14\">The facts involved in this most complicated combination of appeals have been amply and adequately developed in the decisions below. The following summary of those facts will suffice for the purpose of this appeal. In July 1969, NMU and Commerce entered into a collective bargaining agreement covering all unlicensed personnel employed by Commerce on its vessels. That agreement contained the customary NMU clause requiring Commerce to recognize NMU as the sole bargaining agent for all unlicensed seamen aboard all the ships that Commerce then owned or that Commerce might thereafter acquire during the life of the agreement. There was also a provision, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provided that, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>event that Commerce should sell either of its two vessels while the bargaining agreement was in force, Commerce would give NMU timely written notice thereof prior to the sale, and would obtain for the benefit of the NMU an undertaking by the transferee of the vessel that the transferee would recognize NMU as the sole bargaining agent for the ship\u2019s complement of unlicensed seamen and would accept the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to those seamen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">Late in 1970 Vernitron, Commerce\u2019s parent company, determined to sell Commerce\u2019s two vessels, the <em>Barbara </em>and the <em>Thalia. </em>Without requiring the aforementioned undertaking from its transferee, Commerce attempted in December to sell the tanker <em>Barbara </em>to Vantage, a company which recognizes the Seafarers International Union (SIU) as its exclusive certified collective bargaining agent for all unlicensed seamen on all of the \u201cVantage group\u201d fleet. That attempt has been followed by an enormous amount of activity by the lawyers for the two rival unions, for the two contracting companies, and for the National Labor Relations Board. That activity is in marked contrast to the inactivity of the subject of the contract, the tanker <em>Barbara, </em>which sits idly in a shipyard in Mobile for the lack of unlicensed seamen to man her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-10\">In view of the underlying commitments affecting the situation Commerce might well have expected events to develop as they did, for there is an intense rivalry between the two major unions representing unlicensed seamen on American flag vessels: NMU and SIU. That rivalry is so acute that it provoked a remark by NMU Secretary-Treasurer Wall to Vernitron\u2019s counsel to the effect that he would rather that the Commerce ships \u201cbe lost foreign than be lost to the rival union SIU.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Croake, at 329 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>F.Supp. 154, outlined the practice that fleet owners had been following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-4\">To preserve some labor-management stability in the maritime industry, the practice has evolved and has been sanctioned that collective bargaining agreements should usually cover the crew members of all vessels in a fleet owned by a single employer and its related companies. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 139 NLRB 769 (No. 70), 51 LRRM 1361 (1962). A corollary of this principle is that newly-acquired vessels are generally considered as \u201caccretions\u201d to a fleet, with union representation of the crew passing to the union representing the newly augmented fleet. National Maritime Union of America [NMU] (Overseas Carrier Corp.), 174 NLRB No. 36, [p. 216] 70 LRRM 1153. (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">Additionally, as demonstrated in the provisions of the Commerce agreement, NMU has introduced its clause which requires that, under threat of strike, signatories to its collective bargaining agreement must obtain an undertaking by any transferee of any of its vessels that the transferee recognize NMU as the bargaining agent for the unlicensed seamen aboard the ship after the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">The contract to sell the <em>Barbara </em>was signed on December 23,1970 with ownership to be transferred on or before March 31, 1971. Ownership has not yet been transferred, for NMU learned in January 1971 of the contract to sell and took immediate steps to see that Article I, Section 2 of its collective bargaining agreement was complied with. Negotiations between the union and the two companies were unsuccessful and NMU initiated arbitration proceedings. On February 8, 1971 the arbitrator entered an award in favor of NMU without passing on the legality of the clause in question. The award restrained the transfer of the <em>Barbara </em>except pursuant to the provision in the collective bargaining agreement. After an initial skirmish before Judge Wyatt,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NMU sought and obtained confirmation of that award in the form of a preliminary injunction issued by Judge Frankel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">In the meantime, on February 11, Vantage filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the transfer clause which NMU was seeking to enforce was a \u201chot cargo\u201d agreement in violation of Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (e)). Acting upon these charges, the Regional Director of the NLRB determined that there was \u201creasonable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>to believe\u201d that Commerce and NMU by agreeing to the clause had engaged in and were engaging in an unfair labor practice and he petitioned the district court for a temporary injunction against the enforcement and maintenance of the transfer clause pending final disposition of the charge before the Board. After an evidentiary hearing upon this petition before Judge Croake on June 4, the court determined, McLeod v. NMU and Commerce Tankers, 329 F.Supp. 151 (1971), that the Regional Director did not have reasonable cause to believe that the clause violated Section 8(e) and the injunctive relief the petition had sought was denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Regional Director\u2019s appeal from that denial has been consolidated with the appeal by Commerce and Vantage from Judge Frankel\u2019s order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As our disposition of the appeal from the preliminary injunction granted by Judge Frankel turns to some extent on our disposition of the Regional Director\u2019s appeal, the latter is discussed and considered first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">\n<em>The Appeal in Docket No. 71-1831</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">\n<em>The McLeod v. National Maritime Union Appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">As has been pointed out above, the charges filed by Vantage with the Board alleged that the transfer agreement between Commerce and NMU was an unfair labor practice within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e) and therefore unenforceable. That section reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1194-10\">(e) It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such extent unenforei-ble and void:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1194-11\">The purposes and scope of this section have been fully explored in numerous cases. See, <em>i.e., </em>National Woodwork Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v. N. L. R. B., 386 U.S. 612, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967); Meat and Highway Drivers, Dockmen, etc. v. N. L. R. B., 118 U.S. App.D.C. 287, 335 F.2d 709 (1964). It was intended through its enactment to close certain loopholes in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (b) (4) (A) which was the predecessor to the present 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (B).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As stated by the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>in Local 1976, United Brotherhood of Carpenters, etc., v. N. L. R. B., 357 U.S. 93, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186 (1958), its purpose was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1195-4\">to restrict the area of industrial conflict insofar as this could be achieved by prohibiting the most obvious, widespread, and, as Congress evidently judged, dangerous practice of unions to widen that conflict: the coercion of neutral employers, themselves not concerned with a primary labor dispute, through the inducement of their employees to engage in strikes or concerted refusals to handle goods. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 78 S.Ct. at 1016.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">In that decision, however, the Court took the position that the execution of a contract not to handle non-union material and the subsequent voluntary observance of the contract\u2019s terms were not unlawful under then Section 8(b) (4) (A), now Section 8(b) (4) (B). In 1959 Congress responded to that decision by enacting Section 8(e) so that a \u201chot cargo\u201d clause in a collective bargaining agreement is itself illegal;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and see <em>National Woodwork, supra </em>at 634 of 386 U.S., 87 S.Ct. 1250. For that reason the construction and interpretation of Section 8(e) has closely paralleled those of Section 8(b) (4) (B). In light of this history the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that the NMU transfer agreement was in violation of Section 8(e) and, as we have stated <em>supra, </em>petitioned the court below for a temporary injunction pursuant to Section 10 <em>(l) </em>of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(l)) to preserve the <em>status quo </em>pending final determination of the unfair labor practice charge before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">We begin our review of the lower court\u2019s disposition of the Regional Director\u2019s petition by observing, as did Judge Croake, that the role of the district court in a 10(l) case is not to determine whether there has in fact been a violation of the Act but rather to determine whether the Regional Director could have <em>reasonable cause to believe </em>that the unfair labor practice charged had been committed and that its continuation ought to be enjoined. Douds v. Milk Drivers and Dairy Employees Union, 248 F.2d 534 (2 Cir. 1957); Kennedy for and on Behalf of N. L. R. B. v. Sheet Metal Workers Int. Ass\u2019n Local 108, 289 F.Supp. 65 (D.C.C.D.Cal.1968). We have interpreted that requirement to mean that there must be a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the unfair labor practice charge will be sustained by the Board. McLeod for and on Behalf of N. L. R. B. v. Business Machine &amp; Office Appliance Mechanics Conf. Bd., 300 F.2d 237 (2 Cir. 1962). While the responsibility of the district court is well defined, our own role upon appeal is less clear. Were this an appeal from the <em>grant </em>after an evidentiary hearing of a \u00a7 <em>10(l) </em>injunction our scope of inquiry could be limited by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d test. However, when the appeal is from the <em>denial </em>of a petition for a \u00a7 10(l) injunction, it seems that, in light of the congressional policy favoring the grant of such injunctions in appropriate circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>stances, our scope of review ought not to be so limited. Local No. 83 Construction, etc. Drivers Union v. Jenkins, 308 F.2d 516, 517 n. 1 (9 Cir. 1962); Brown for and on Behalf of N. L. R. B. v. Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, 218 F.2d 542 at 544, and concurring opinion of Judge Pope (9 Cir. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">Disposition of the issue of whether the petitioning Regional Director has reasonable cause to believe that an unfair labor practice has been committed does not always turn upon whether the restraints placed upon the employer by the collective bargaining agreement come within the literal wording of Section 8(e), for the comprehensive language of the section has been tempered by a judicially created exception for \u201cwork preservation\u201d agreements. In the court below NMU successfully contended that no unfair labor practice had been committed by it and Commerce because their agreement is a \u201cwork preservation\u201d one. The work preservation defense to charges of Section 8(e) violations was first authoritatively defined by the Supreme Court in 1967 in <em>National Woodwork, supra. </em>It did so in fairly unequivocal terms at pages 644-645 of 386 U.S., at page 1268 of 87 S.Ct. To quote the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-5\">The determination whether the [clause] . . . violated \u00a7 8(e) . cannot be made without an inquiry into whether, under all the surrounding circumstances, the Union\u2019s objective was preservation of work for [the contracting employer\u2019s] employees, or whether the agreements and boycott were tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere. Were the latter the ease, Frouge, the boycotting employer, would be a neutral bystander, and the agreement or boycott would, within the intent of Congress, become secondary. There need not be an actual dispute with the boycotted employer, here the door manufacturer, for the activity to fall within this category, so long as the tactical object of the agreement and its maintenance is that employer, or benefits to other than the boycotting employees or other employees of the primary employer thus making the agreement or boycott secondary in its aim. The touchstone is whether the agreement or its maintenance is addressed to the labor relations of the contracting employer <em>vis-a-vis </em>his own employees, [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">Since that decision another formulation of that test has been widely accepted and applied. Judge Skelly Wright phrased this formulation in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1196-9\">Resolution of the difficult issue of primary <em>versus </em>secondary activity, as it relates to this case, involves consideration of two factors: (1) jobs fairly claimable by the bargaining unit, and (2) preservation of those jobs for the bargaining unit. If the jobs are fairly claimable by the unit, they may, without violating either \u00a7 8(e) or \u00a7 8 (b) (4) (A) or (B), be protected by provision for, and implementation of, no-subcontracting or union standards clauses in the bargaining agreements. Activity and agreement which directly protect fairly claimable jobs are primary under the Act. Incidental secondary effects of such activity and agreement do not render them illegal, [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1196-10\">Meat and Highway Drivers, Dockmen, etc., v. N. L. R. B., <em>supra, </em>335 F.2d at 713; accord, Retail Clerks International Ass\u2019n, Local Union No. 1288 v. N. L. R. B., 129 U.S.App.D.C. 92, 390 F.2d 858 (1968); cf. N. L. R. B. v. Local Union No. 141 of Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 International Ass\u2019n, 425 F.2d 730 (6 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-11\">Judge Wright\u2019s test was used by the parties as the basis of their arguments below, and the court below framed its decision with that test in mind. Judge Croake concluded that the appropriate employer bargaining unit \u201cappears to be that segment of the tanker industry which recognizes NMU,\u201d 329 F.Supp. at 158, and because the purpose of the clause by protecting the NMU \u201cjob pool\u201d \u201cwas to preserve as many of the declin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>ing number of jobs as possible for NMU seamen,\u201d 329 F.Supp. 157, NMU\u2019s clause conditioning vessel transfer was not a clause proscribed by \u00a7 10(e) but a \u201cwork preservation\u201d one. The core issue on appeal, therefore, is whether the district court\u2019s determination that Commerce was one of the tanker operators within the multiemployer bargaining unit the judge discovered is a justifiable determination in the light of National Labor Relations Board rulings in this area, an area fraught with opportunity for the disruption of economic peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\">The district court explained its discovery that there was a tanker operator multiemployer bargaining unit by discovering it \u201cin the nature of the industry, as viewed by the union, rather than in the nature of the formalities of contract signature.\u201d 329 F.Supp. at 159. Judge Croake eschewed the more traditional criterion for finding multiem-ployer bargaining units, and, instead, rested his determination on the fact that NMU had a central hiring hall and that provision for pension plans and seniority systems must have been arrived at after industry-wide consultations. He summarizes: \u201cTo view one vessel or one fleet as an appropriate unit for bargaining purposes, from the NMU viewpoint, would be to acquiesce in a dangerous fiction.\u201d 329 F.Supp. at 159. NMU, on this appeal, strongly urges us to adopt the same approach. We, however, are unpersuaded, for we agree with National Labor Relations Board Trial Examiner Thomas A. Ricci in his determination that \u201c[t]he position ignores too much Board law and too many basic principles underlying the Statute as a whole, to be persuasive.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">It was recognized by the court below that while the actual negotiations leading to the union contract were between NMU and the Tankers Service Committee, a committee representing about half of the operating companies with which NMU had agreements, Commerce had never authorized that Committee to negotiate for it, had never been a member of that or of any other multiemployer association, and had never participated in the Committee\u2019s collective bargaining with NMU. Moreover, Commerce never in any way ratified the work of that committee.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The collective bargaining agreement containing Art. I, section 2, between NMU and Commerce was signed on an individual basis and the wording of the agreement reflects that fact. \u201cAs written, the contract is between \u2018the Company\u2019 and \u2018the Union. . . . \u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And so it would appear from these undisputed and found facts that, even if, as the NMU research director, Spector, testified, NMU presented the agreement to Commerce on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis, NMU was dealing with Commerce alone and acquiesced in the right of Commerce to deal with the union representing its employees as an individual employer of those employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">The factors relied upon by the court below, and by NMU on appeal, have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>previously considered by the Board in analogous cases, and have been held not to be controlling where the collective bargaining history, as here, does not indicate that the employer participated as part of an employer association. In Association of Motion Picture Producers, Inc. and Its Members, 88 NLRB 521, 524 (1950) the petitioner pointed \u201cto the fact that the Employers herein have, in the past, drawn carpenters from a common labor pool; that such carpenters are employed under similar working conditions and on occasion are rotated from one employer to another.\u201d There the Board ruled that \u201cthe factors upon which the Petitioner relies in support of its contention for an industry-wide unit are not relevant in determining the appropriateness of such a unit,\u201d and ruled that where evidence is lacking as to any history of joint collective bargaining by all the employers on an industry-wide basis, a finding that there is an industry-wide employer bargaining unit would be inappropriate. 88 NLRB at 524. Again, in Shipowners Association of the Pacific Coast, 100 NLRB 1250 (1952), NMU advanced a similar argument to the argument it makes here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Board, at 1254, followed its established position \u201cthat interchangeability of employees due to a common labor pool and similarity of working conditions are, by themselves, insufficient to justify a unit coextensive with the existence of such factors.\u201d In contradistinction, the collective bargaining history of the industry is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Indeed, the law laid down by the Board as to whether an employer is within a multiemployer bargaining unit seems to require from an analysis of the pertinent facts a diametrically opposite result from that reached by the district court. We find the holding in Raymond O. Lewis, et al., Agents UMW, 148 NLRB 249, 254 (1964) extremely persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-8\">An essential element for establishing a multiemployer unit is the participation by a group of employees [sic, employers], whether members or nonmembers of a single association, either personally or through an authorized representative, in joint bargaining negotiations unequivocally manifesting the intent to be bound by group, rather than by individual, action. The facts stipulated herein fall far short of furnishing the necessary basis for finding the multisignatory unit urged upon us by UMW. The fact that the various Signatory Associations and individual Signatory Operators, since 1950, have signed identical, though separately negotiated, contracts is an insufficient basis for concluding that an industrywide contract unit has been created by the parties here, as there is an absence of evidence to indicate that the various Signatory Associations negotiated on other than an individual Association basis. Accordingly, we find, under the normal tests applied by the Board in making bargaining-unit determinations, that an industrywide unit has not been established by the parties, [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">And in 1969 the Board in Moveable Partitions, Inc., 175 NLRB 915 (1969) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1198-10\">At no time did the Employer join the Master Painters Association. At no time did it participate in negotiations or authorize the Master Painters to negotiate on its behalf. Under these circumstances, we find that this Employer has no history of bargaining in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1137\">*1137</page-number>a multiemployer unit. While it has adopted contracts negotiated by the Master Painters Association, this alone is not a sufficient basis for including it in a multiemployer unit. We therefore find that the bargaining history establishes that the Employer\u2019s employees petitioned for constitute a separate appropriate unit. <em>Id. </em>at 916. [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">see also Texas Cartage Co., 122 NLRB 999, 1000 (1959); cf. Chester County Beer Distributors Association, 133 NLRB 771 (1961).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">We agree with Trial Examiner Ricci that basic to those decisions is the Board\u2019s belief that \u201cEvery employer has a right to bargain with respect to its employees and only its employees . ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> unless he manifests an intent to the contrary. Indeed, as stated by the Examiner, the Statute speaks first and foremost of the \u201cemployer\u201d unit as appropriate. But we recognize, of course, that the process of collective bargaining is conducted by employees as well as by employers and that we should look not only to the intent of the employer while bargaining, but also to whether here the union in dealing with Commerce had treated with it as an employer member of a group unit. See NLRB v. Bagel Bakers Council of Greater New York, 434 <em>F.2d </em>884, 886 (2 Cir. 1970). It is undisputed, as we have pointed out above, that NMU dealt directly with Commerce and acquiesced when Commerce chose to sign the agreement NMU submitted to it as an individual employer bargaining as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Thus it appears that any bargaining unit for whom the union could justifiably preserve work would be composed solely of Commerce\u2019s employees and could not justifiably include all NMU members, wherever dispersed, who await work assignments at a central hiring hall. As it was found by the court below and was conceded by NMU on appeal that the purpose of the relevant clause in the agreement was to preserve work for all unlicensed seamen using its hiring hall and not merely for those employed by Commerce within the bargaining unit we agree with the appellant Regional Director that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the Board also will so interpret the clause. So understood, the agreement was designed to preserve work not only for the members within the bargaining unit but also was intended to acquire work for members of the union as a whole. As such it constitutes an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8(e) of the Act, and the Regional Director had reasonable cause to believe that NMU\u2019s restrictive transfer clauses constitute secondary activity prohibited by that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">Of course, we recognize, as the court below recognized, that ours is only a preliminary decision and that the final decision will be made by the National Labor Relations Board and the courts to whom the Board\u2019s decision may be appealed. No doubt when the Board makes that decision it will give careful consideration to the factors relied upon by the court below and may ultimately agree with that court\u2019s treatment of them. However, on the basis of prior Board pronouncements the Regional <em>Director </em>has satisfied his burden of showing \u201creasonable cause\u201d to justify the issuance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1138\">*1138</page-number>10(l) injunction pending the Board decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">The statute (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(l) requires that in 10(0 cases a twofold determination be made: First, as we have pointed out, it must be determined whether the Regional Director has reasonable cause to believe that the unfair labor charges filed with the Board are true; and, second, that the issuance of any injunction would be \u201cjust and proper\u201d under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">We hold that the issuance of an injunction would be just and proper here and therefore we remand for its issuance after a determination below of the extent of the relief required to preserve the <em>status quo </em>until adjudication of the \u00a7 8(e) issue by the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\"><em>The Appeal in NMU v. Commerce Tanker </em>\u2014 Docket <em>No. 71-1160</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Disposition of this appeal does not require any extended discussion, for we have above indicated our approach to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">Subsequent to the time that Judge Frankel, at the request of NMU, issued his injunction restraining Commerce from selling or transferring the <em>Barbara </em>unless Article I, Section 2, of their collective bargaining agreement were complied with, the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board brought his complaint in Docket No. 71-1831. We have above agreed with him that, pending final resolution of whether NMU and Commerce have committed unfair labor practices, any attempt by NMU to enforce the restrictions contained in the clauses of Art. I, Section 2 should be enjoined.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">The positions taken by the Union and the Employer at the time of their arbitration proceeding have been affected first, by the contemporaneous filing of the unfair labor practice charge with the Board by Vantage which was followed by the later commencement of the Regional Director\u2019s action in the district court; and, second, by our adjudication herein upon that action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The effect of the filing of the Regional Director\u2019s complaint was recognized by Judge Croake when he first ruled upon whether this injunction should be vacated and before he decided that he should not take this changed condition into account, 329 F. Supp. at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-12\">As was pointed out by Judge Croake in his June 22, 1971 decision prior to the amendment of July 15, 1971:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-13\">After March 4, when the injunction was issued, the determination of the Regional Director of NLRB that a complaint should issue against NMU and Commerce for attempted implementation of the clause (which Commerce and Vantage are presently enjoined from violating) did in fact significantly alter the parties\u2019 situation. A new \u201cparty\u201d \u2014 the NLRB, has in effect intervened in the dispute, and has raised a new and preeminent issue: the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-14\">Moreover, (see footnote 1) we agree with Judge Croake\u2019s June 22 assessment of how the equities should be balanced, <em>i. e., </em>by vacating the Frankel injunction. Although he subsequently determined in the exercise of sound judicial discretion that he should not consider modifying Judge Frankel\u2019s order while this appeal was pending, his reasoning behind his original order was sound. As he stated then, while the potential for hardship to the two unions \u201cfrom an erroneous determination of the propriety of maintenance of this injunction is approximately equal, from the point of view of the companies, the severity of the present economic hardship being incurred because of the injunction is severe and avoidable.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>believe that to allow the <em>Barbara </em>to remain idle in a Mobile shipyard would be a tragic waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">The preliminary injunction issued by Judge Frankel on March 2, 1971 is ordered vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">. At this time there was also a motion before Judge Croake brought by Commerce to dissolve the injunction issued by Judge Frankel against it, enforcing the arbitration award. This motion was based upon the fact that Vantage had filed an unfair labor practice charge against NMU and Commerce on the ground that compliance with the terms of their bargaining contract (which Commerce was enjoined from breaking) violated the \u201chot cargo\u201d provisions of Section 8(e) and that in May the Regional Director of the NLRB had followed up the matter by filing his petition in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">At first, on June 22, Judge Croake filed an opinion and order granting the Commerce petition. He held that the parties\u2019 situation had changed since March and that, as the injunction was more severe on the Companies than on NMU, the equities of the changed situation favored a <em>vaca-tur. </em>After a rehearing, however, he exercised his discretion not to consider this new evidence while the preliminary injunction was on appeal and denied the motion. See 329 F.Supp. at 159-160. And see text p. 1138 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">. Art. I, Section 2.

At the June 4 hearing before Judge Croake, David Cohen, corporate counsel for Vernitron and assistant secretary of Vernitron\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Commerce Tankers, testified to this. He stated that he and another representative of Commerce met near the end of March 1971 with Attorney Sovel, the secretary treasurer of NMU Shannon Wall, and a Mr. Barisic. His testimony elicited by counsel for the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-8\">Q. Would you tell us then the conversation that took place between Commerce and NMU on that date? A. We were asking for special dispensation again under the clause. We pointed out to them our contractual relationship with Vantage. We stated that we intended to sell the vessel as soon as we were free to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-11\">Q. Was this upon your assumption at that time that the purchaser might exercise the option to cancel by April 4th? A. It was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-13\">Q. Continue, sir. A. We stated that we had been inquiring in the market and that the possibility of a domestic sale of the vessel was virtually impossible because of the deteriorating <em>conditions; </em>that there was one or two interested purchasers and they were foreign flag operators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-14\">We said that there was no reason for them to insist on this any more in our view because in either event, whether we sold to Vantage, or whether we sold to foreign flags, they would lose the jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-15\">Mr. Bennett (Counsel for the Regional Director) : I would like to call to the Court\u2019s attention that the collective bargaining agreement that is under attack by us provides that sales may be made to foreign flag operators without obtaining the undertaking that NMU continue in its representative status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-16\">Q. Continue, Mr. Cohen. A. They were trying to ascertain whether or not they could give us this dispensation. Mr. Barisic and Mr. Wall recognized the peculiar economic circumstances of Commerce and Vernitron and they were discussing among themselves the pros and cons of granting the dispensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-17\">Q. When you pointed out to the NMU that the jobs would be lost in either event, if you sold foreign or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>they permitted the sale to be made to Vantage, did Mr. Wall make any comment? A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-9\">Q. What did Mr. Wall say? A. He said they would rather be lost\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-10\">Q. Speak up, sir. A. He said he would rather they be lost foreign than be lost to the rival union SIU. He was talking in the context of this being a principle, an important principle to the NMU which they were seeking to uphold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-11\">Mr. Sovel made the comment that the granting of this dispensation wouldn\u2019t look very good in the proceedings that were then pending.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-12\">Q. There is no doubt in your mind, sir, that Mr. Wall made the statement, in words or in substance, that you have just attributed to him, that he would sooner the sale went foreign than see it go to a rival union? A. Yes, he said Mr. Nathanson and I didn\u2019t understand the intense rivalry between the SIU and NMU.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1193-14\">Mr. Bennett: No further questions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1193-15\">. On February 9, NMU, on the basis of having received the arbitrator\u2019s award, sought a temporary restraining order from the district court pending application for a preliminary injunction. The ensuing history, prior to the issuance of a final preliminary injunction, appears at 325 F.Supp. 363. During these proceedings, Vantage, which had not been a party to the arbitration, intervened and became a party in the district court. Judge Wyatt was of the opinion that the transfer of the <em>Barbara </em>should not be prevented, and proposed that a substantial bond be put up by the companies to protect the union in the event it turned out that the transfer should have remained enjoined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">. And also determined that the injunction issued on March <em>4, </em>1971 should not be vacated. See footnote 1, <em>supra, </em>and text, <em>infra, </em>at p. 1138. Because there had been a motion to vacate the March 4 injunction, Vantage, as an intervenor in that proceeding, was before Judge Croake, as well as the union and Commerce, which latter two parties were before him both as respondents in the injunction proceeding brought by the. Regional Director and as plaintiff and defendant, respectively, in the proceeding to vacate the March 4 injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">. After the consolidated appeal was set for argument the U.S. Maritime Administration sought leave to be heard as the government agency having the responsibility of maintaining the nation\u2019s merchant marine in the development and promotion of foreign and domestic commerce by means of water-borne transportation. It was granted leave to file a brief <em>amicus-curiae. </em>The administration, in a most valuable brief, supported the position of the Regional Director appellant, stating that enforcement of Art. I, Section 2, of the collective bargaining contract would be \u201cclearly at odds with the stated National Maritime policy\u201d contained in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1194-14\">.

The Board\u2019s General Counsel filed an unfair labor practice complaint, based upon Vantage\u2019s charges, with the Board. Hearings were held before Thomas A. Ricci, the Board\u2019s trial examiner. See National Maritime Union of America et al. (2-CE-44). Ricci on September 2, 1971 filed his findings and his recommended order. A typewritten copy of these findings and this order were furnished us by NMU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Ricci recommended that the complaint be dismissed, for he ruled that there liad been no violation of Section <em>8(e). </em>Nevertheless, following well-defined Board precedents, he determined that the relevant bargaining unit was limited to the employees of Commerce. He arrived at his result by reasoning that the employees within Commerce\u2019s <em>single employer unit </em>included all seamen using the NMU central hiring hall, irrespective of whether they bad ever received wages from Commerce or had ever been employed by that corporation. We do not rule on the validity of this novel approach to the employer-employee relationship because the validity of this novel concept has not been briefed or argued to us.

Quoting from the Board\u2019s decision: The NMU contends that the petition should be dismissed on the ground that the only appropriate unit is an overall unit, which would include employees in the steam schooner trade as defined in the contracts covering that trade together with employees in the offshore, intercoastal, and Alaska trades (which trades are commonly referred to collectively as the offshore trade) as defined in the contracts covering those trades. Such a unit would, in effect, comprise all stewards department employees on all ships operated by the members of both the SAPO and the Pacific Maritime Association. 100 N.L.R.B. 1252, 1253.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">.

To quote the Board :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1199-8\">An essential element for establishing a multi-employer unit is the participation by a group of employers, whether members or nonmembers of an association, either personally or through an authorized representative, in joint bargaining negotiations unequivocally manifesting the intent to be bound by a group, rather than by individual, action. . . . The fact that the other associations in the area signed contracts identical to those which the Union separately negotiated with the Employer is insufficient to establish a multi-association bargaining unit as the only appropriate unit. 133 N.L.R.B. 773.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1199-13\">The Board cited <em>Terns Cartage Company.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1199-14\">.
