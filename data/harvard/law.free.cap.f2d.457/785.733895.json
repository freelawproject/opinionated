App. \u00a7 462. He challenges the validity of his conviction on several grounds. We find it necessary to consider only one of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The Government\u2019s case was based entirely on Beckett\u2019s Selective Service file. After the Government rested, Beckett moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a finding that he was medically qualified for. service. The Selective Service file contained a certificate of medical acceptability. It also contains medical records showing that he had a history of allergic reaction to insect bites or stings, and a notation by the Army\u2019s examining physician that Beckett had a \u201cgeneralized dermal reaction to bee sting \u2014 ND.\u201d Beckett testified to a conversation with the examining physician in which Beckett\u2019s allergy was discussed. He said that the physician told him that an allergic reaction was irrelevant under the draft law unless it was a localized reaction; a generalized reaction was not exempting.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">Among the causes for rejection for appointment, enlistment, and induction listed by Army Regulation 40-501, paragraph 2-39.a.(5), are: \u201c(5) Bona fide history of moderate or severe generalized (as opposed to local) allergic reaction to insect bites or stings. Bona fide history of severe generalized reaction to common foods, e. g., milk, eggs, beef, and pork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">Beckett\u2019s testimony about the physician\u2019s mistaken standard of medical disqualification for allergies was not contradicted or rebutted. If we assume that the notation \u201cND\u201d meant \u201cnot disqualifying,\u201d as the Government argued to the district court, that notation is consistent with Beckett\u2019s testimony about the nature of the physician\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-18\">The Government contends that the physician may not have accepted Beckett\u2019s history as bona fide. The contention rests entirely on conjecture. Indeed, acceptance of the history is arguably implicit in the notation, and it is consistent with the physician\u2019s misapprehension of the controlling medical standard. The physician would have had no occasion to probe the bona fides of the history if he were convinced that such history was irrelevant. The Government also argues that Beckett\u2019s aller<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>gy may have been minor rather than \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201csevere.\u201d There is no evidence that the examining physician ever inquired about the degree of reaction ; he had no reason to do so if he believed that the condition was not disqualifying under the regulations. On cross-examination, Beckett testified to several incidents of severe reactions to insect bites and to the advice that he had had from his treating physician that \u201cif three bees had stung me at once, it would be the equivalent of a rattlesnake bite to a normal person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">We think that the uncontradicted evidence amply proved that the examining physician applied an erroneous standard of medical qualification and that the error deprived Beckett of the opportunity for medical disqualification under 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 454(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
