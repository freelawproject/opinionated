Moore, 1964, 375 U.S. 335, 342, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed. 2d 370. If the union has a duty to represent a member up to the point that it could show it was unreasonable, viewed simply from his standpoint, to go further, as plaintiff seemingly contends, liability might possibly be found here. This is not, however, the proper test. The only burden upon a union is to act fairly and in good faith, something considerably less than a duty of support measured solely with reference to the member. Vaca v. Sipes, 1967, 386 U.S. 171, 190-193, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842; De Arroyo v. Sindicato de Trabajadores Packinghouse, AFL-CIO, 1 Cir., 1970, 425 F.2d 281, cert. denied sub nom. Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. Figueroa de Arroyo, 400 U.S. 877, 91 S.Ct. 117, 27 L.Ed.2d 114; Bazarte v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>United Transp. Union, 3 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 868, 872. While the processing of a meritorious grievance in a perfunctory fashion may be a violation of the duty of fair representation, Vaca v. Sipes, ante 386 at 191, 87 S.Ct. 903, the court found, on the evidence, that the union\u2019s actions were adequate and reasonable. The court, 333 F.Supp. 228, applied the proper standard. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
