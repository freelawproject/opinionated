While other matters were covered by this earlier order, including the termination of WHDH\u2019s operating authority, effective March 19, 1972, WHDH deems itself, for purposes of this appeal, restricted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to attacking only that part of the order which granted program test authority (PTA) to Boston Broadcasters, Inc. (BBI), owner of station WCVB-TV. Its present position is that the FCC acted arbitrarily and without authority in authorizing PTA without first fully considering certain affidavits and documentary evidence allegedly demonstrating that BBI lacks the qualifications to be a television station licensee and without finding that the public interest would be served by permitting BBI to operate under PTA pending determination of its qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Our jurisdiction to deal with this challenge depends on what part of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 applies. Since \u00a7 402(a) is a residual category, we have jurisdiction only if \u00a7 402(b) does <em>not </em>apply, such matters having been exclusively assigned to the Court of Appeals for the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>of Columbia Circuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FCC and BBI contend that this is an appeal by a \u201cperson . . . whose interests are adversely affected by [an] order of the Commission granting . . . [an application]\u201d [\u00a7 402(b) (6)] \u201cfor a station license . . . [\u00a7 402(b) (1)]. The legal question posed is whether program test authority, if not a license itself,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is nevertheless \u201cancillary\u201d to the exercise of FCC licensing power, <em>cf. </em>Tomah-Mauston Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 113 U.S.App.D.C. 204, 306 F.2d 811, 812 (1962), or \u201cin aid of and within the exercise of the Commission\u2019s licensing power\u201d. Cook, Inc. v. United States, 394 F.2d 84, 87 (7th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Program test authority is a step short of the granting of a station license. It follows \u201ccompletion of construction of a television broadcast station in accordance with the terms of the construction permit\u201d; it is issued only \u201cwhen an application for station license has been filed showing the station to be in satisfactory operating condition\u201d; it continues, subject to suspension or revocation, \u201cduring Commission consideration of the application for license\u201d and is \u201cautomatically terminated by final determination upon the application for station license\u201d. 47 CFR 73.629. It is difficult for us to conceive of any FCC action more intimately associated with the exercise of its licensing powers than this penultimate stage. It is even more difficult for us to countenance the plight of the FCC and private parties, if review of an order granting or denying a station license were to lodge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals while another court were, at the same time, to be reviewing a grant or denial of program test authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">WHDH relies on Columbia Broadcasting Sys. of California v. F.C.C., 93 U.S. App.D.C. 399, 211 F.2d 644 (1954), for the proposition that an appeal challenging a grant of PTA is cognizable only under \u00a7 402(a). While that case did involve an effort to revoke program test authority which had been in effect for some six months, the relevant holding was <em>not </em>that anything dealing with PTA was a \u00a7 402(a) matter but that CBS could not make a \u00a7 402(b) claim as a person aggrieved by a modification of its license. This is made manifest by the court\u2019s citation of Radio Station WOW v. F.C.C., 87 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 184 F.2d 257 (1950), involving an attempt to modify a long standing license of Star Broadcasting Company by WOW, which claimed objectionable interference. The court said, \u201cQuite clearly, we think, the \u2018applicant . for modification of an existing radio station license\u2019 referred to in the statute is the owner of the license.\u201d 184 F.2d at 259. In other words, the issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>CBS </em>(and <em>WOW) </em>was not the type of authority exercised by FCC, but whether CBS could bring itself within the \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d language of \u00a7 402(b) (6), in circumstances where there was \u201can attempt to modify the authorization of a station already operating and on the air.\u201d Tomah-Mauston Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., <em>supra, </em>306 F.2d at 812. Or to put it differently, a station upset by operations under a prior-issued PTA or license cannot create jurisdiction under \u00a7 402(b) simply by asking the FCC for a ruling apart from a licensing hearing. Here, WHDH has not been a stranger; it is not seeking to revise a long standing order in which it originally manifested no interest. It has fully participated in all these lengthy proceedings. They have culminated in an order which contemporaneously grants PTA to its rival and divests it of broadcast authority. It is incontestably aggrieved by favorable FCC action accorded an applicant and falls squarely within the description of a \u00a7 402(b) (6) litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and the petition for stay pending review is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\">. A comparative hearing resulted in the granting of BBI\u2019s application and the denial of WHDH\u2019s renewal application for Channel 5 in 1969, affirmed in Greater Boston Television Corp. v. F.C.C., 143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 444 F.2d 841, cert. denied, 403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). A construction permit was then issued to BBI, but, charges of securities law violations having been brought against a principal of BBI, the FCC requested the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to recall its mandate to permit the FCC to consider whether to reopen the comparative proceeding. This was denied in Greater Boston Television Corp. v. F.C.C., Nos. 17,785; 17,788; 23,154 ; 23,159, 23,172 (D.C.Cir., Dec. 29, 1971). Interim separation of the principal from BBI\u2019s management is required, pending final action on BBI\u2019s application for license. WHDH has conceded, for purposes of this proceeding, that it is not seeking a reopening of the comparative proceeding nor a \u201crectification\u201d of FCC action in granting BBI\u2019s application for a construction permit and denying WHDH\u2019s application for renewal of license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Section 402 provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">2. \u201c(a) Any proceeding to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission under this chapter (except those appealable under subsection (b) of this section) shall be brought as provided by and in the manner prescribed in [the Administrative Procedure Act].</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">(b) Appeals may be taken from decisions and orders of the Commission to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in any of the following cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">(1) By any applicant for a construction permit or station license whose application is denied by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">\u00a1i\u00bb \u00ed'l\u00a1 ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">(6) By any other person who is aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected by any order of the Commission granting or denying any applica-tiou described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) hereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-21\">.
