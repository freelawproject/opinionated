The complaint states that Lavoie, an active member of a tenants\u2019 association, has complained to public officials about defendants\u2019 management of the park. For that reason, Lavoie contends, he was given notice, on May 25, 1971, to quit the premises on June 28, 1971. When he did not comply, defendants sought to evict him by filing a Landlord and Tenant writ of summons in municipal court on or about June 29, 1971. In response, plaintiff instituted the present action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. By agreement of the parties, the eviction proceeding has been stayed pending the outcome of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Defendant takes the position that, as plaintiff is merely a tenant at will, his tenancy can be terminated for any reason by giving thirty days\u2019 notice. Plaintiff argues that the otherwise \u201cpurely private\u201d relationship between landlord and tenant is transformed by the New Hampshire landlord and tenant and zoning laws, that these laws so infuse the landlord\u2019s action that it becomes \u201cstate action\u201d. Assuming the truth of the claim that eviction was sought in retaliation) for the exercise of his rights of speech and association, the district court nevertheless dismissed for failure to state a cause of action, finding simply that defendants\u2019 action was not \u201cstate action\u201d and therefore did not violate plaintiff\u2019s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"> Preliminarily, a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 is stated only if the plaintiff alleges both that a defendant\u2019s action is \u201cunder color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\u201d and that the action subjects the plaintiff \u201cto the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution . . . .\u201d Where as here, the rights allegedly infringed are the rights of free speech and association guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment as it incorporates the First Amendment, the deprivation must take the form of \u201cstate action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">In addressing the question whether plaintiff has adequately alleged state action, we turn first to the landlord and tenant statute, under which eviction may be sought in three steps. \u201cAny lessor or owner of lands or tenements may at any time determine any lease at will or tenancy at sufferance, by giving to the tenant or occupant a notice in writing to quit the same at a day named therein.\u201d N.H.R.S.A. c. 540, \u00a7 2. After notice to quit, the landlord may bring a possessory action, N.H.R.S.A. c. 540, \u00a7 12, by obtaining a writ of summons, N.H.R.S.A. c. 540, \u00a7 13, and then a writ of possession, N.H. R.S.A. c. 540, \u00a7 14. On its face the statute thus appears to permit eviction without limitation as to motive, an appearance confirmed by the decisions of the New Hampshire courts, most notably Wormood v. Alton Bay Camp Meeting Association, 87 N.H. 136, 175 A. 233 (1934). In that case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court responded to a claim that the tenant was being evicted for having brought a damage suit against the landlord by declaring that \u201c[t]he motives of the [landlord] in seeking to terminate the tenancy are immaterial . . \u201d 87 N.H. at 138, 175 A. at 234. Nor does either party in the present case suggest that a motive to evict Lavoie in retaliation for his exercise of his rights of speech and association would be a defense under New Hampshire law in an action for a writ of possession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">New Hampshire delegates its zoning power to the cities and towns of the state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\">\u201cFor the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community, the legislative body of any city or town is empowered to regulate and restrict the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, lot sizes, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of population and the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes.\u201d N.H.R.S.A. c. 31, \u00a7 60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">The Town of Merrimack has exercised its authority over mobile homes in three quite different ways. It has first imposed ordinary residential restrictions as to lot size, setbacks, and adequacy of sanitary facilities. Another restriction is peculiar to mobile homes: the prohibition \u201cno mobile home shall be located other than in a mobile home park\u201d (Art. VIII, \u00a7 2) is coupled with the further prohibition \u201c[n]o mobile home park shall be established or operated without a permit from the Board of Selectmen\u201d (Art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>VIII, \u00a7 3, \u00b6 A). In consequence of this restriction, the mobile home owner may not purchase land on which to place his mobile home but must rent space on another\u2019s land. Finally, and most strikingly, the ordinance states that \u201c[b]efore any permit for a mobile home park shall be issued, the Town Planning Board shall have certified to the Board of Selectmen that the proposed mobile home park will not be injurious or detrimental to the neighborhood in which it is to be situated\u201d (Art. VIII, \u00a7 3, \u00b6 D). The ordinance obviously reflects a concern with the special problems created by mobile homes. Realistically construed, in conjunction with the provision that \u201c[n]o mobile home shall be placed closer than 150 feet to an existing residence\u201d (Art. VIII, \u00a7 3, \u00b6 C(2)), it demonstrates the town\u2019s determination that there be metaphorical tracks for a mobile home park to be on the other side of.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"> As for the implementation of the statute, the record is limited. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney did offer to amend the complaint to allege that \u201cthere is at least in fact a monopoly created by the town by the way of zoning codes have been enforced so far as mobile home parks, so that in the Town of Merrimack, Mr. Big-wood\u2019s park is the only major mobile home park which has been allowed to be put in there . . . .\u201d The court did not rule on this offer, but simply granted permission for Mrs. Lavoie to take the stand. Since she was then permitted to testify concerning her unsuccessful efforts to find a substitute location within thirty-five miles of Merrimack, we will treat the court\u2019s action as an implicit acceptance of the amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Liberally construed, as is appropriate on a motion to dismiss, the amendment alleges both that the defendants\u2019 park is the sole mobile home park in Merrimack and that the town has denied permits to others who wished to open additional parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">The critical issue, whether the confluence of court-enforced eviction and monopoly power created by zoning sufficiently implicates the state to be termed state action, must be resolved by reference to unsynthesized lines of cases. The chaotic state of the doctrine is particularly unfortunate where, as here, the state is involved in more than one way in the challenged action, and it is unclear whether we ought to measure the voltage as if the actions were in series or as if in parallel.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Conventionally, there is thought to be a line somewhere between two \u201cpolar propositions\u201d: that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a state may not deprive a person of his constitutional rights; and that a person may for any reason discriminate against other persons in his private affairs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The notion that these are polar propositions has led courts, in cases involving nominally private actions, to explore from each pole in order better to locate the equator. With the \u201cstate action\u201d pole are associated such phrases as \u201cstate compulsion or involvement\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and with the opposite pole, state \u201cneutrality\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cpurely private\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or \u201cmerely private\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conduct. In attempting to sort out the uses of these phrases, we recognize that in the broadest senses of the words, the states are always involved in private actions, are never pristinely neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Viewing the problem, for the moment, as one of defining \u201cneutrality\u201d in a less strict sense, we turn to Shelley v. Krae-mer, 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>1161 (1948), where the Court found \u201cstate action\u201d in the enforcing by a state court of a racially restrictive covenant. <em>Shelley </em>and its implications have been the subject of extensive discussion, which we do not propose to recapitulate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In arriving at our own interpretation, we are aided by the discussion in Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 130, 84 S.Ct. 1770, 12 L.Ed.2d 754 (1964). In that case a deputy sheriff had ordered certain black patrons to leave a privately-owned amusement park, had arrested them when they refused to do so, and had brought a prosecution for criminal trespass. The Court recounted Maryland\u2019s argument that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ach\">\u201cmay . . . constitutionally enforce an owner\u2019s desire to exclude particular persons from his premises even if the owner\u2019s desire is in turn motivated by a discriminatory purpose. The State, it is said, is not really enforcing a policy of segregation since the owner\u2019s ultimate purpose is immaterial to the State.\u201d 378 U.S. at 136, 84 S.Ct. at 1773.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The Court responded that such were not the facts of the case before it, in that \u201cThe president of the corporation which owned and managed the park testified that he had instructed [the deputy sheriff] to enforce the park\u2019s policy of racial segregation.\u201d 378 U.S. at 136-137, 84 S. Ct. at 1773. A state, then, must be more strictly neutral than to permit any of its officers to identify the subjects of the discrimination in the first instance.. Although it was not cited in <em>Griffin, </em>we take <em>Shelley </em>to be an earlier application of the same principle. To enforce the covenant and thereby disrupt a transaction between a willing seller and a willing buyer, the state court had necessarily to take evidence that the prospective buyer was black and to take notice that the clause being enforced was a racially restrictive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">But while, on the facts of <em>Shelley </em>and <em>Griffin, </em>the Court had no occasion to announce a narrower theory indicating when a state police officer or court is \u201cneutral\u201d for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, we think that, apart from cases involving racial discrimination,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Maryland\u2019s argument suggests a workable theory. That is, a state may at the behest of private persons apply sanctions pursuant to general rules of law which have discriminatory as well as non-discriminatory application if it does not accept the responsibility of employing a discriminatory classification. Such responsibility would exist when, in resorting to a state sanction, a private party must necessarily make the state privy to his discriminatory purpose. Similarly, in such a case as this, the state would retain a neutral posture unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>was necessarily apprised of the landlord\u2019s purpose to violate rights of free speech and association. While not entirely satisfactory, this approach at least recognizes conscious state involvement without insisting upon an unattainable purity.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">On our analysis of \u201cneutrality\u201d, then, an ejectment in retaliation for the exercise of First Amendment rights is, without more, \u201cpurely private\u201d action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state simply affords the landlord a method of vindicating his property rights without inquiring as to the landlord\u2019s motive in doing so, indeed without accepting evidence of his motive if offered. The matter does not end here, however. The state, through its instrumentality the Town of Merrimack, has restricted the placement of mobile homes through a zoning ordinance. Viewed in light of the foregoing discussion of neutrality, of course, the zoning ordinance changes nothing. In restricting mobile homes to mobile home parks, the state and the town know nothing of the reasons for which a park owner will flex his propertied muscles. Nonetheless, the neutrality perspective is not a comprehensive one, as is clear from the \u201cstate involvement\u201d and community replica cases to which plaintiff also calls our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Plaintiff argues from Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), and McQueen v. Druker, 438 F.2d 781 (1st Cir. 1971), that Merrimack\u2019s regulation of mobile homes betokens a measure of state involvement adequate to constitute \u201cstate action\u201d. So stated, the argument would apply to all zoning. As a matter purely of detailed specifications, the requirements imposed on other sorts of buildings in other zones are substantially as complicated as those imposed on the owners of mobile home parks. What was critical in <em>Burton </em>and <em>McQueen, </em>and is lacking here, is a continuing interrelatedness on both the financial and operational levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">In making a slightly different argument, plaintiff cites Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946), and Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Val. Plaza, 391 U.S. 308, 88 S.Ct. 1601, 20 L.Ed.2d 603 (1968).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At base his contention is that since the owner of a complete town (including business and residential sections) was held subject to the Fourteenth Amendment in <em>Marsh, </em>and the owner of \u201cthe community business block\u201d was similarly charged in <em>Logan Plaza, </em>the owner of a residential section should be held to the same standard. Despite the attractive symmetry of the argument, we do not understand <em>Marsh </em>and <em>Logan Valley </em>to go so far.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court emphasized in <em>Marsh </em>that the area in question was \u201cfreely accessible and open to the people in the area and those passing through\u201d, 326 U.S. at 508, 66 S.Ct. at 279, and quoted this passage in <em>Logan Plaza, </em>391 U.S. at 319, 88 S.Ct. 1601. Defendants here do not seek to attract persons to their property or to make it the center of activity or communication in Merrimack. At least so far as the record reveals, their trailer park is in this respect no different from an ordinary apartment building.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>We find more to the point than the cases pressed upon us by the plaintiff, a line of cases which began with Railway Employes\u2019 Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225, 76 S.Ct. 714, 100 L.Ed. 1112 (1956). <em>Hanson </em>upheld over a First Amendment challenge \u00a7 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act, which authorizes railroads and labor organizations to enter union shop agreements, under which employees must join the union within sixty days of commencing employment. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11). The Court reached the First Amendment question only after finding \u201cgovernmental action\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cThe enactment of the federal statute authorizing union shop agreements is the governmental action on which the Constitution operates, though it takes a private agreement to invoke the federal sanction.\" 351 U.S. at 232, 76 S.Ct. at 718.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>Hanson </em>was reaffirmed in International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961), in which the Railway Labor Act was construed, \u201cto avoid serious doubt of [its] constitutionality\u201d, 367 U.S. at 749, 81 S. Ct. at 1790, as forbidding unions to spend dues for political purposes over the objection of individual members. And in what the plurality opinion characterized as a case presenting \u201ca claim of impingement upon freedom of association no different from that which we decided in <em>[Hanson]\", </em>367 U.S. at 842, 81 S.Ct. at 1837, the Court held that the Wisconsin Supreme Court\u2019s requirement that an attorney must be a member of the integrated state bar association if he wished to practice law was not unconstitutional. Lath-rop v. Donahue, 367 U.S. 820, 81 S.Ct. 1826, 6 L.Ed.2d 1191 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">The possible relevance of <em>Hanson </em>and its progeny to the present case is that here, as in those cases, the government has allegedly placed monopoly power in private hands in order to implement other policies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Much as federal legislation supporting a private agreement made it a condition of employment with a particular employer to join a certain union, and the Wisconsin rule made it a condition of practicing law in that state that a lawyer join the integrated bar association, Merrimack has, according to plaintiff\u2019s allegation, made it a condition of living in a mobile home there that the plaintiff .locate his mobile home in defendants\u2019 mobile home park.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">In none of the cases, of course, is there demonstrated a state purpose to restrain speech by limiting alternatives, but neither is the private power entirely fortuitous. In authorizing union shops, Congress apparently sought \u201cindustrial peace and stabilized labor-management relations\u201d, Railway Employes\u2019 Dept. v. Hanson, <em>supra, </em>351 U.S. at 234, 76 S.Ct. at 719; in requiring membership in an integrated bar association, Wisconsin hoped to \u201c[raise] the quality of professional services\u201d, Lathrop v. Donahue, <em>supra, </em>367 U.S. at 843, 81 S.Ct. at 1838. Here, the ordinances themselves amply demonstrate that Merrimack restricts mobile home owners, apparently for esthetic, and perhaps for tax, reasons, in ways which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>does not restrict those who prefer to live in conventional houses. As in the labor and bar cases, the possible inhibition of speech is entirely collateral to the primary purpose for which restrictions are imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">This similarity of purpose is coupled with a similarity of effect not eroded by the obvious factual distinctions. The opportunity for families of modest means to live in a mobile home near the breadwinner\u2019s place of work in a particular town is not demonstrably less important than the opportunity to work for a particular employer. Mobile home sites may be available at great remove, but so may other jobs of similar description be available with other employers. Nor would the conferring of power on a single individual seem to differ in any relevant respect from the conferring of power on an organization such as the integrated bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">A distinction of arguably greater significance is that the labor and bar cases involved forced association with the attendant danger that membership dues would be used to support political candidates or programs despite opposition from particular members, while the forced tenancy here is more likely to chill a tenant\u2019s speech than to augment the landlord\u2019s. But to note that the constitutional dangers are different is not to negate the similarity of the cases for state action purposes \u2014 in each case one private party, who may act with impunity, is granted the power to put another private party to a choice between his rights of speech or association and his job or home.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\"> The juxtaposition of our conclusions that the state is neutral within the meaning of one line of cases and implicated within the meaning, of another line leads us to focus again on the applicability of the \u201cpolar\u201d analysis. In <em>Burton, </em>in <em>Hanson, </em>and in each of the cases which followed them, the state or federal government was neutral in the sense that the law it enforced was not unconstitutional on its face. A simple, and for present purposes, at least, an adequate generalization to be drawn from these cases is that a neutrality test is in-apposite where the state gives special support to a nominally private party or, for other purposes, markedly restricts alternatives to dominion by a private party. Accordingly, we find that appellant has adequately alleged \u201cstate action\u201d in asserting a town purpose to restrict sites for mobile homes and a concomitant private monopoly over the allocation of those sites.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">We make two further observations. In finding that plaintiff has alleged state action on a <em>Hanson </em>theory, we necessarily hold that, at least for this plaintiff, who has no practicable alternative, other sorts of housing are not interchangeable with mobile homes.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Beyond this we decline to generalize, but simply note the similarity of the problem to that of defining a product market in antitrust law. More importantly, we do not prejudge the case, because the allegations before us do not warrant it, where, although a town has granted several permits, demand is so strong that, with a restrictive purpose, the town \u00bfrants permits for a limited number of substantial parks, but more than one, which are together inadequate to meet the demand. We think it beyond question, on the other hand, that where no such purpose is shown or can fairly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>inferred, a mere showing that housing of a particular description is in short supply does not establish \u201cstate action\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The perplexing question which remains to be addressed is whether the facts which constitute \u201cstate action\u201d also satisfy the \u201cunder color of\u201d law clause of \u00a7 1983. The Supreme Court, in summarizing, seemed to answer the question affirmatively in United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966): \u201cIn cases under \u00a7 1983, \u2018under color\u2019 of law has consistently been treated as the same thing as the \u2018state action\u2019 required under the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d, 383 U.S. at 794 n. 7, 86 S. Ct. at 1157. But subsequently, in Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., <em>supra,, </em>both Justice Harlan for the majority, 398 U.S. at 171, 90 S.Ct. 1598 (by implication), and Justice Brennan in dissent, 398 U.S. at 210, 90 S.Ct. 1598, indicated that, at least in some cases, \u201cunder color of\u201d law requires more than \u201cstate action\u201d. The question has not been considered by the Supreme Court in the context of speech or association, because the cases have arisen in other postures, as appeals from state court injunctions, <em>e. g., </em>Railway Employes\u2019 Dept. v. Hanson, <em>supra,, </em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Val. Plaza, <em>supra, </em>or as appeals from state court trespass convictions, <em>e. g., </em>Marsh v. Alabama, <em>supra. </em>That is, in resisting an injunction or conviction, a,, defendant relies on the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires only a showing of \u201cstate action\u201d. It is only when one seeks to take the initiative as a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff that he must show not only \u201cstate action\u201d but also \u201ccolor of law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">A partial explanation for the Court\u2019s treatment of \u201cunder color\u201d in <em>Adickes </em>was that it faced a novel question concerning the proper meaning to be accorded \u201cunder color of custom\u201d. The restaurant had simply refused to serve Miss Adickes, but had not called upon the state to arrest her or to prosecute her under the state\u2019s trespass law. Justice Harlan noted that \u201c [a]lthough such a trespass statute might well have invalid applications if used to compel segregation of the races through state trespass convictions, see Robinson v. Florida, 378 U.S. 153, [84 S.Ct. 1693, 12 L.Ed.2d 771 (1964)], the statute here was not so used in this case\u201d, 398 U.S. at 161 n. 23, 90 S.Ct. at 1610, and declined to decide whether mere knowledgte of the statute without invocation of its sanctions would amount to action \u201cunder color of . statute\u201d. The \u201ccolor of . statute\u201d is hardly so faint here; we think that an ejectment action instituted to punish the exercise of a tenant\u2019s rights of speech and association by a mobile home park owner whose monopoly has been created by zoning is an \u201cinvalid application\u201d of the New Hampshire landlord and tenant statute. <em>Cf. </em>McQueen v. Druker, <em>supra; see also, </em>Tanner v. Lloyd Corporation, <em>supra, </em>308 F.Supp. at 131. That the plaintiff has not yet been evicted, proceedings having been stayed pending the outcome of this case, is no bar where the tenant concededly has no defense in the ejectment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-14\">.

In his dissenting opinion in Adickes v. Kress, <em>supra, </em>398 U.S. at 188, 90 S.Ct. 1598, Justice Brennan argued that several cases, Peterson v. City of Greenville, 373 U.S. 244, 83 S.Ct. 1119, 10 L.Ed.2d 323 (1963), Lombard v Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 10 L.Ed.2d 338 (1963), and Robinson v. Florida, 378 U.S. 153, 84 S.Ct. 1693, 12 L.Ed.2d 771 (1964), \u201ctogether hold that a state policy of discouraging privately chosen integration or encouraging privately chosen segregation, even though the policy is expressed in a form nondiscriminatory on its face, is unconstitutional and taints the privately chosen segregation it seeks to bring about.\u201d 398 U.S. at 194-195, 90 S.Ct. at 1622. Of course, the <em>Adickes </em>majority did not adopt Justice Brennan\u2019s view \u2014 the historical dimension of \u201cencouragement\u201d, upon which he relied, may not signify a departure from neutrality. If it does, however, such historical or structural encouragement as a component of state action may indicate one sense in which the Fourteenth Amendment, as an enactment directed against racial discrimination, should be accorded broader scope in extirpating that discrimination. Pilate may wash his hands of some stains more convincingly than of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. <em>Accord, </em>Mullarkey v. Borglum, 323 F.

The Court\u2019s disclaimer of reliance on the transit company\u2019s monopoly position, 343 U.S. at 462, 72 S.Ct. 813, is adequately explained by the existence of a clear and narrower ground, specific government consideration and approval of the challenged programming. <em>Cf. </em>Justice Harlan\u2019s interpretation, Evans v.
