Byrne, Sr., United States District Judge, Cenrtal District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b677-26\">WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b677-27\">This case is before us on a petition to review and a cross-application for enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board. The Board found that Shell Oil Company refused to bargain with the Oil, Chemical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Atomic Workers International Union. We decline to enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">For more than thirty years the Union has been the certified representative of a bargaining unit embracing the Company\u2019s production, pipe-line, and refinery personnel in California. The employees work at several facilities within the state: two refineries at Martinez and Dominguez, a gas plant at Molino, a drilling and production operation at Ventura, and production facilities at Signal Hill, Bakersfield, Fellows-Taft, and Coalinga. There are 1,421 employees in the unit, of whom 858 or approximately 60% are members of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">From January 4, 1969, until March 17, 1969, the Union engaged in a strike against the Company. According to a stipulation of the parties, some of the striking employees (though not Union officials or Union representatives) engaged in violence in the form of mass picketing and harassment of employees who had returned to work, both at the gates of the Company\u2019s struck facilities and at individual employees\u2019 homes. State court temporary restraining orders were issued <em>ex parte </em>against continued violence and picketing in Contra Costa and Kern Counties. A preliminary injunction was issued in Los Ange-les County after a hearing at which the Union appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The parties stipulated that violence occurred not only during the course of the strike but also for an indeterminate period thereafter. The trial examiner rejected an offer to prove that it continued right up to the date of the examiner\u2019s hearing in July, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">On December 29, 1969, nine and a half months after the conclusion of the strike, the acting district director of the Union, V. L. McKendree, wrote to the industrial relations manager of the Company, F. W. Albers, requesting the names and mailing addresses of all unit employees, both Union and non-Union. The Union stated that this request was made because the employees were scattered throughout the state and \u201cthere is no alternative method for direct contact on an individual basis to properly discharge the legal and moral responsibilities this Union has to the total of the employees that are affected.\u201d It was stipulated that the Union\u2019s existing means of communicating with unit employees \u2014 handbilling, Union meetings, bulletin boards, etc. \u2014 were \u201cineffective to reach all unit employees because of the scattered location of Respondent\u2019s facilities in the unit and the residential dispersion of unit employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">The Company responded, at a meeting with a Union representative, that it was hesitant to provide the names of the non-Union employees in the bargaining unit because it was concerned about the \u201charassment of employees that had occurred and the possibility that more harassment would occur if the Union had the names and addresses.\u201d The Company did not allege that Union officials or representatives were involved in the violence in any way. The Company\u2019s concern was that the names and addresses would fall into hands which the Union could not control.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Because of its concern, the Company asked for a meeting with the district director of the Union, W. J. Forrester. At this meeting Albers again expressed the Company\u2019s fear that the list of names and addresses might be misused, saying that \u201cthere had been harassment of employees who had returned to work during the strike.\u201d Director Forrester stated that he \u201cwas aware . . . that some of this harassment had occurred,\u201d including one incident involving an employee who had crossed the picket line at the Martinez refinery and who, after transferring to the Anacortes, Washington, refinery in July 1969, had finally quit in August 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">After a request that it state its position in writing the Company wrote a letter giving reasons for its reluctance and its belief that it should provide only the names and addresses of those employees who consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The Union then filed unfair labor practice charges with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In an attempt to settle the charges, Albers requested another meeting with Forrester. The two met in June 1970 in Forrester\u2019s office. The Company reiterated its concern, referring specifically to \u201cthe unrest and the relationships that existed between the Company and the employees and the Union.\u201d Forrester said that he was \u201caware that we were having considerable problems\u201d and that there were \u201cmany complaints [which were] unresolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Albers then proposed two alternatives to the Company\u2019s providing all the names and addresses to the Union, each of which he thought sufficient for the Union\u2019s purposes. The first was that the Company provide names and addresses of those employees who consented. The second was that the Company furnish all names and addresses to an independent mailing service which, without disclosing the names and addresses to the Union, would mail all material which the Union wanted to submit and certify this mailing to the Union. Al-bers also solicited any proposals the Union might wish to put forward, and Union comments on the Company\u2019s offers. He indicated a willingness to work out a \u201cmutually agreeable\u201d compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Although invited, Forrester offered no alternative proposals, nor did he seek details of the Company\u2019s suggestions. Instead, he informed Albers that the Union wanted the names and addresses of every employee \u2014 including non-Union members \u2014 and that it was \u201ca matter of principle\u201d for the Union to get them.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">At the trial examiner\u2019s hearing the next month the Company\u2019s proposals were amplified. Albers testified that he knew of responsible commercial mailing services which would assure adequate and confidential mailing access to all employees. The Union could submit material to the mailing bureau in sealed envelopes; Union mailings could be made without limitation as to number; and the Company would pay the extra cost of the mailing service.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">The Union responded with testimony to the effect that only a complete disclosure of the names and home addresses would enable it to perform its function of representing all the employees in the unit, including non-Union members. Forrester testified that it was essential for the Union to be able not only to mail communications to the employees but also to have \u201cits leadership\u201d make personal visits to employees\u2019 homes in order to organize them, \u201cclose to the ranks,\u201d canvass their views and opinions on collective bargaining positions and working conditions, and represent them on grievance and industrial accident claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The Union also provided testimony that its intent was to limit the disclosure of the names and addresses to its \u201cleadership\u201d and not to permit the list to fall into the hands of the \u201cso-called goons and others to go out and break windows.\u201d However, Forrester admitted that not only regional officials would have access to the names and addresses. Presidents and other officers of each of six locals, committees formed \u201cfor proper purposes,\u201d and, of necessity, clerical personnel who processed the mailings would have access as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">The General Counsel conceded that <em>no assurances </em>had ever been given to the Company by the Union concerning the confidential usage and safeguarding of the names and addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">The trial examiner found that the Company\u2019s fear of a leakage and abuse of the name and address list through rank and file harassment of non-Union employees justified the refusal to supply the list to the Union. He reached this conclusion because of the admitted recent violence by \u201cstriking employees whom the Union apparently could not control,\u201d the absence of any Union assurances of confidentiality and safeguarding, and the fact that, even if such assurances had been given, \u201cthe effectiveness of any such procedure to safeguard the name-and-address list from improper disclosure and possible abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>would be doubtful in view of the number of people to whom it would be available in each of the six locals according to Forrester\u2019s testimony.\u201d The trial examiner dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The Board disagreed. It found that the Company had refused to bargain with the Union and had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing to provide the names and addresses of all unit employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In reaching its conclusion the Board relied on two points: first, the Company did not contend that the Union leadership was involved in the violence; second, \u201cany Union receiving a list of union employees is under an obligation to take reasonable steps to see that the list is not improperly disclosed or used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We observe at the outset of the discussion of the legal issues involved that the Company has behaved in a reasonable and conciliatory manner throughout while the Union has been demanding, arrogant, and intransigent. It would be most anomalous if, under these circumstances, we were to ratify the Board\u2019s determination that the Company, rather than the Union, refused to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The Board asserts that once information is shown to be relevant to the Union\u2019s performance of its role as bargaining representative, this fixes the duty of the Company to produce and any failure to produce is <em>per se </em>an unlawful refusal to bargain. However, this is not the law. Rather:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">\u201cEach case must turn upon its particular facts. The inquiry must always be whether or not under the circumstances of the particular case the statutory obligation to bargain in good faith has been met.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Truitt Manufacturing Co., 351 U.S. 149, 153-154, 76 S.Ct. 753, 756, 100 L.Ed. 1027 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-10\"><em>Cf. </em>Emeryville Research Center v. N.L.R.B., 441 F.2d 880 (9th Cir. 1971.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Several recent cases have compelled employers to furnish names and addresses of all unit employees when the employees were scattered over a wide geographical area and no practical alternative, other than mailing, existed by which the Union could communicate with the employees. <em>See, e. g., </em>United Aircraft Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 434 F.2d 1198 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 993, 91 S.Ct. 1232, 28 L.Ed.2d 531 (1971); Prudential Insurance Co. v. N. L.R.B., 412 F.2d 77 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 928, 90 S.Ct. 263, 24 L.Ed.2d 226 (1969); Standard Oil v. N.L. R.B., 399 F.2d 639 (9th Cir. 1968). <em>Cf. </em>Excelsior Underwear, Inc., 156 NLRB 1236 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">We note, as urged by the Company, that all of these cases have involved either (1) representation elections or (2) the Union\u2019s need for contact by mail with the employees. Since no representation electon is present in this case, the Company argues that its second alternative, the offer of independent mailing service, provides all the information the Union can legitimately demand. However, because of our analysis of the other issues involved in this case, it is not necessary for us to reach this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Bearing in mind the admonition from <em>Truitt, </em>quoted above, we focus on whether in the circumstances of this case the Company failed to meet its statutory obligation to bargain in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-16\">Only two cases cited to us deal with an employer\u2019s refusal or reluctance to provide a list of names and addresses, or equivalent information, out of concern that harassment of employees would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-17\">In <em>United Aircraft, supra, </em>the Company resisted providing a list of names and addresses for fear that the privacy of some of its employees would be jeopardized and that violence and harassment would occur. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-18\">\u201cIn determining whether the disclosure of addresses to a union violates the employees\u2019 right to privacy, the crucial factor appears to be the likeli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>hood, of a dear and present danger to the employees involved.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) 434 F.2d at p. 1207.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We agree that this is the proper standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The employer\u2019s defense in <em>United Aircraft </em>was not sustained because the violence there had occurred ten years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">On the other hand, the employer prevailed in Sign and Pictorial Union v. N. L.R.B., 136 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 419 F.2d 726 (1969). There the Union alleged that strike-breakers were being paid higher wages than regular employees had been paid before the strike. It demanded to see the company\u2019s payroll records. The company was reluctant to furnish such information (which would necessarily include a list of the replacement workers) without some assurance that the information would not be used \u201cto further facilitate harassment of replacements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">In <em>Sign and Pictorial </em>there was a clear and present danger of violence against the replacements. An uncontested Board decision had ruled that replacements had been harassed, threatened and assaulted by some of the striking employees. One of the strikers was later convicted of assaulting a replacement with a gun. In view of the indisputable danger of violence it was found that the Company\u2019s refusal to permit the Union to examine its records was not a refusal to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">The stipulation of the parties in the case before us and the testimony of Forrester as to the extent of intended distribution of the list of names and addresses within the Union organization, taken together, establish beyond cavil that there was a clear and present danger of harassment and violence in this case. Hence we read both <em>United Aircraft </em>and <em>Sign and Pictorial </em>as supporting the Company\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">We believe that the proper disposition of the instant case is pointed up in our recent decision in Emeryville Research Center v. N.L.R.B., 441 F.2d 880 (9th Cir. 1971). There the Union requested salary grade curves and merit ratings for 430 professional scientists and engineers in the bargaining unit. The Company expressed its concern over the amount of effort that would be required to compile the requested data and the danger that some of the information sought would destroy the anonymity of material already being supplied. The Company nevertheless offered to meet with the Union to discuss the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">The Company asked the Union to state specifically why it needed the information so that the parties could work together to put it into a form which would satisfy the Union\u2019s needs and at the same time meet the Company\u2019s objections. The Union responded only that it needed the information in order to bargain intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">The Union made another demand; the Company tendered another reasonable and conciliatory response; and the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">We held that the Union is not necessarily entitled to information in the precise form demanded, even when the information is relevant to the performance of the Union\u2019s functions as bargaining agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">Three factors, all present in the case before us, moved the court to decline enforcement of the Board\u2019s order in <em>Emeryville. </em>First, the Company stated specific objections to furnishing the information in the form requested, and there was no suggestion of bad faith or that the reasons given were disingenuous or put forward for delay. Second, the Company did not flatly refuse to comply. Rather the Company offered to discuss the request in the light of the Union\u2019s needs and the Company\u2019s legitimate interests. Finally, the Union did not take up the offer to discuss a mutually satisfactory form for the information sought. Instead, it went immediately to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Of course each case must turn on its facts, and this case is not identical with <em>Emeryville. </em>But the principle is the same: Presentation of <em>bona fide </em>concerns by the Company, coupled with reasonable proposals designed to satisfy the needs of the Union and to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution of the Union request, is simply not a refusal to bargain. On the contrary this is precisely the conduct the Labor Act is designed to foster. <em>Cf. </em>Kroger Co. v. N. L. R. B., 399 F.2d 455 (6th Cir. 1968); Fruit and Vegetable Packers v. N. L. R. B., 114 U.S.App.D.C. 388, 316 F.2d 389, 390-391 (1963); American Cyanimid, 129 NLRB 683 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Moreover, this is especially true when the Company\u2019s concern is a desire to protect employees from harassment and violence by Union sympathizers. Harassment and violence are strongly condemned by national labor policy. We have regularly upheld broad orders designed to prevent, limit, and counteract such activities. N. L. R. B. v. Local 85, 454 F.2d 875 (9th Cir. 1972); N. L. R. B. v. Teamsters Local 85, 448 F.2d 789 (9th Cir. 1971); Sonoco Products Company v. N. L. R. B., 443 F.2d 1334 (9th Cir. 1971). We also favor all reasonable steps to protect those who are victims or potential victims of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The Supreme Court stated in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U. S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">\u201c[A] reviewing court is not barred from setting aside a Board decision when it cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board's view.\u201d at p. 488, 71 S.Ct. at p. 465.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\"><em>Cf. </em>Arizona Public Service Company v. N. L. R. B., 453 F.2d 228, 230 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">To the extent that the Board\u2019s decision reflects a determination that there was not a clear and present danger of violence and harassment, it is not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. As noted above, the stipulation of the parties and Forres-ter\u2019s uncontradicted testimony establish that there was such danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">We do not think that a Union duty to safeguard Union membership lists, even when expressed in the Union constitution and even assuming that sanctions would be applied to a failure to safeguard lists of non-Union members, is sufficient to rescue the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">On this record it would be unreasonable to conclude that the Company was not voicing good faith concern, or that its proposals were not reasonable and serious. It is sufficient to sustain the Company\u2019s position that its concern be <em>bona fide </em>and its proposals reasonable and serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">We note specifically that there is nothing in the record to substantiate the Board\u2019s assertion in its brief that the company was engaged in an avowed attempt to prevent the Union from increasing its membership. Nor is this assertion consistent with the Company\u2019s second alternative proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">We hold that the Company did not refuse to bargain. Enforcement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b682-15\">WILLIAM M. BYRNE</author>\n<p id=\"alv-dedup-1\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">Although an employer has the \u201cgeneral obligation\u201d of providing the Union relevant information in order that it may effectively represent the unit employees, N. L. R. B. v. Acme Industrial Co., 385 U.S. 432, 435-436, 87 S.Ct. 565, 17 L.Ed.2d 495 (1967), each case rests upon its own facts, \u201cwhether or not under the circumstances * * * the statutory obligation to bargain in good faith has been met.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Truitt Manufacturing Co., 351 U.S. 149, 153-154, 76 S.Ct. 753, 756, 100 L.Ed. 1027 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-18\">I agree with the Trial Examiner that, under the circumstances as shown by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>evidence in this case, including the General Counsel\u2019s admission that the Union had not offered any assurance that confidentiality of the list would or could be maintained, the Company\u2019s fear of harassment of non-union employees, reasonably justified its refusal to supply the list requested by the Union.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
