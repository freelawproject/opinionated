Petitioner Seaman Thomas William Robinson filed the petition in the district court challenging the validity of the United States Navy\u2019s denial of his application for discharge as a conscientious objector. The district court affirmed that denial, holding that the Navy had a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for rejecting the petitioner\u2019s application. We do not agree with that holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-17\">Robinson enlisted in the Navy on July 1, 1968, serving first as a student and then as a staff member at the Basic Electricity/Electronics School of the Naval Training Center at Great Lakes, Illinois. On September 9, 1970, pursuant to Bureau of Naval Personnel Manual \u00a7 1860120 and Department of Defense Directive No. 1300.6,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he submitted a request for discharge on the grounds of conscientious objection. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-18\">Few of us honestly wish to be involved in war, it is opposed to the religious and idealistic doctrines we have set up for ourselves. War propagates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>little of value, and certainly may lead to our ultimate destruction. In short, few men would preach the benefits of war.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-6\">As an American I am responsible to function against those who would promote war, especially for reasons of an immoral nature. For war is and has been the bane of mankind; kindled by a minority who thwart reality in turn allowing the existence of this conflict to be perpetuated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-7\">\u2022X* X* X* X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">I do intend my claim as a conscientious objector to be considered not only on a moral basis, but also in a religious context. For there is a superi- or power as yet, I cannot, nor wish to define its nature. It has made its desires evident; this power has given us a code with which to live. Our responsibility is to follow this code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">His application was accompanied by the letters of five friends and relatives, the account of a Navy psychiatrist stating that his beliefs appeared to be \u201cdeeply rooted,\u201d a letter from a Navy chaplain reporting that he believed the plaintiff to be \u201creligiously inclined,\u201d and a letter written by his immediate superior officer which contended that he was \u201cvery sincere\u201d and recommended that his request for discharge be approved. On December 16, 1970, Robinson\u2019s application was denied by the Bureau of Naval Personnel on two grounds: The Bureau stated first that \u201c. . . it is clear that your objections spring from logical and philosophical objection to the present war.\u201d Secondly, it found that \u201cwhile it appears that you are sincere in your beliefs, it is equally clear that they are essentially philosophical and not the deeply held moral, ethical or religious beliefs required for qualifications as a conscientious objector.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\"> The standard for judicial review of the Bureau\u2019s determination is a strict one. Our inquiry may focus only on the information before the Bureau of Naval Personnel at the time it was considering petitioner's application. United States ex rel. Kellogg v. McBee, 452 F.2d 134 (7th Cir., 1971). Under Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946), review is limited to a determination of whether there was a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for the Bureau\u2019s characterization. <em>See </em>United States ex rel. Trainin v. Cain, 144 F.2d 944 (2d Cir. 1944). We find no factual support for the Bureau\u2019s conclusions in the case before us. Moreover, the justifications of the Bureau\u2019s findings advanced by the Government on appeal are at best tortured. Interpretation of belief is a complex task. The Government cannot glean a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d from sentences taken out of context, or an in-depth content analysis of Robinson\u2019s application which singularly distorts the plain meaning of his words. It cannot suggest that this kind of analysis offers a reasonable basis for disregarding the testimony of a Navy psychiatrist, a Navy chaplain, and Robinson\u2019s immediate superior officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-13\">We find that Robinson\u2019s beliefs clearly qualify as \u201creligious\u201d under the test of United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), and Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308 (1970). Both <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh </em>concerned plaintiffs who were admitted to be sincere but whose claims could not be characterized as \u201creligious\u201d under traditional religious standards. <em>Seeger </em>extended the definition of \u201creligious\u201d to include those for whom the claimed belief \u201coccupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly qualifying for the exemption. . . .\u201d 380 U.S. at 176, 85 S.Ct. at 859. In <em>Welsh, </em>the registrant\u2019s beliefs were claimed by the Government to be even more unorthodox. As in the instant case, the Government sought to distinguish <em>Seeger </em>on the grounds that Welsh\u2019s views, unlike those of Seeger, were \u201cessentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>moral code.\u201d The Court rejected this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">We certainly do not think that \u00a7 6(j)\u2019s [50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j) ] exclusion of those persons with \u201cessentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code\u201d should be read to exclude those who hold strong beliefs about our domestic and foreign affairs or even those whose conscientious objection to participation in all wars is founded to a substantial extent upon consideration of public policy. . [I] t should be remembered that these exclusions are definitional and do not therefore restrict the category of persons who are conscientious objectors by \u201creligious training and belief.\u201d Once the Selective Service System has taken the first step and determined under the standards set out here and in <em>Seeger </em>that the registrant is a \u201creligious\u201d conscientious objector, it follows that his views cannot be \u201cessentially political, sociological, or philosophical.\u201d 398 U.S. at 342-343, 90 S.Ct. at 1798.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The initial determination is whether the plaintiff\u2019s beliefs \u2014 whatever their source or however classified in ordinary parlance \u2014 function as religious beliefs under <em>Seeger </em>and <em>Welsh. </em>The only claimants whose applications would be automatically excluded under <em>Welsh </em>would be those whose beliefs are not \u201cdeeply held\u201d or whose claim rests solely on considerations of \u201cpolicy, pragmatism, or expediency.\u201d 398 U.S. at 343, 90 S.Ct. 1792; <em>see </em>Bresette v. Knutson, 443 F.2d 179, 182 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The Bureau held that Robinson\u2019s beliefs were sincere and made no attempt to characterize them as based solely on considerations of \u201cpolicy, pragmatism, or expediency.\u201d Labeling them \u201cphilosophical\u201d is insufficient since, under <em>Welsh, </em>\u201cphilosophical\u201d is not a talismanic word. Thus, the Government argued that Robinson\u2019s beliefs do not go beyond the level of concern expressed by all responsible individuals about war so as to suggest a personal commitment to avoid participation in war. But Robinson\u2019s words belie that interpretation. The Government\u2019s conclusions are supportable only if we choose not to believe Robinson\u2019s petition, though the Bureau of Naval Personnel specifically found Robinson to be sincere. Nor can we accept the Government\u2019s suggestion that the <em>Seeger </em>standard should be more strictly applied here because the applicant has received an education. The suggested test requires a detailed analysis that would exclude nearly all but a Tillich or a Buber from conscientious objector status. Robinson satisfied his chaplain and commanding officer that his beliefs were \u201cdeeply held\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d under the definition of <em>Seeger. </em>His words readily comport with that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">We find no factual support for the Bureau\u2019s second finding, that Robinson\u2019s beliefs constitute selective objection to war. The Government points to the following statement made by the petitioner in his application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-10\">At present I see no harm in the proper use of a non-violent type of force. It may have unlimited potential in the struggle for peace. However, an armed force used for annihilation or subjugation or as the tool of short-sighted or immoral individuals I cannot accept.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">The Government interprets this statement to suggest that Robinson is opposed only to certain kinds of wars, namely, those \u201cused for annihilation or subjugation,\u201d and is not opposed to other kinds of wars. They find that Robinson\u2019s claim is analogous to one which distinguishes between \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cunjust\u201d wars and is thus insufficient under Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168 (1971). This interpretation ignores the apparent thrust of Robinson\u2019s application. Though his language is awkward, we have no difficulty determining its import. The selective objection charge can only be based on distinctions Robinson makes within the category of \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>armed force.\u201d The category of \u201ca nonviolent type of force\u201d does not qualify as \u201cwar\u201d under Sicurella v. United States, 348 U.S. 385, 75 S.Ct. 403, 99 L.Ed. 436 (1955). Moreover, for the petitioner, the description of an \u201carmed force\u201d which is used for the purposes of \u201cannihilation or subjugation or as a tool of short-sighted or immoral individuals\u201d completely exhausts the category of war as indicated by his statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">For war is and has been the bane of mankind; kindled by a minority who thwart reality in turn allowing the existence of this conflict to be perpetuated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">I only wonder what our world would be like today if we had resolved this problem centuries ago, and I fear the form our world will take in the future if we fail to end this needless waste of human resource, WAR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In addition, the Government tries to characterize Robinson\u2019s concern as solely directed towards the Vietnam war, rather than towards war in general. It underscores phrases in Robinson\u2019s application such as \u201cour present plight\u201d or references to the \u201cdissent occurring in this country\u201d and Americans\u2019 difficulty \u201cin admitting we have made a mistake.\u201d These phrases are at best ambiguous. They suggest only that Robinson\u2019s beliefs may have been crystallized by opposition to the present war. Under <em>Welsh, </em>however, the fact that a claimant\u2019s beliefs are grounded in part on his perceptions of world politics does not vitiate his claim. 398 U.S. at 342, 90 S.Ct. 1792. The critical question is only whether these beliefs have now matured into an objection to participation in all wars. We find that Robinson\u2019s beliefs must be so characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The judgment of the district court is reversed with the direction that the writ of habeas corpus issue discharging the petitioner from the custody of the respondents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\">. Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 456(j), <em>formerly </em>ch. 625, \u00a7 6(j), 62 Stat. 612 (1948) exempts from \u201ccombatant training and service\u201d any registrant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7l\">who, by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. As used in this subsection, the term religious \u201ctraining and belief\u201d does not in-elude essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-20\">Department of Defense Directive No. 1300.6 (dated May 10, 1968) requires that legitimate in-service claims to conscientious objector status be honored by the various branches of the armed forces.
