Gilmore,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was expected to answer the identical question posed by this case, namely, \u201cDoes the State have an affirmative federal constitutional duty to furnish prison inmates with expensive law libraries or, alternatively to provide inmates with professional or quasi professional legal assistance?\u201d (39 L.W. 3169), but incorrectly, though hedgingly, predicting the Supreme Court decision in <em>Gilmore, </em>the District Court dismissed the petition without prejudice to the petitioner to refile his suit should the Supreme Court decision in <em>Gilmore </em>be contrary to the District Court\u2019s expectations. It was, and accordingly, we summarily vacate the dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 petition and remand the case for reconsideration in light of Younger v. Gilmore, <em>supra, </em>affirming Gilmore v. Lynch, N.D.Cal. (Three-Judge), 1970, 319 F.Supp. 105; Cruz v. Hauck, 1971, 404 U.S. 59, 92 S.Ct. 313, 30 L.Ed.2d 217; Johnson v. Avery, 1969, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718; and Novak v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1971, 453 F.2d 661, rehearing en banc denied, 1972, 456 F.2d 1303 [1972],</p>\n<p id=\"b564-22\">Part of the relief sought by petitioner was denied by the District Court on the authority of Cruz v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1971, 445 F.2d 801. That decision has since been reversed by the Supreme Court, Cruz v. Beto, 1972, 405 U.S. 319, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 [1972], and a companion case was likewise reversed by the Supreme Court, Cruz v. Hauck, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-23\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-16\">. This case comes to us on petitioner-appellant\u2019s motion for summary remand. We dispose of this case summarily. See Groendyke Transport, Inc. v. Davis, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 1158.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-34\">. Younger v.
