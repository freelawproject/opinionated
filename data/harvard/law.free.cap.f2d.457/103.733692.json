The Trustee petitioned for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court from our decision, which was denied sub nom., Kirkland v. Protective Committee for TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc., 402 U.S. 907, 91 S.Ct. 1378, 28 L.Ed.2d 648 (1971). The attorney for the Trustee asserts that the subject matter of this appeal is moot. We agree. However, we vacate the decision below and direct that it be dismissed for mootness, so that it will spawn no legal consequences. See Allen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>v. Johnson, 5 Cir. 1969 en banc, 413 F. 2d 1218, 1220.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-17\">. Had this case not become moot, however, we would have reversed the finding below because of our firm conviction that the evidence showed timely filing of the Notice of Appeal by counsel for the Protective Committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b166-4\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
