There was attached to the motion for summary judgment the Warden\u2019s Affidavit in which he recited that <em>on </em>February 1, 1970, the plaintiff, along with 18 fellow prisoners, engaged in a mass assault upon prison guards severely injuring eight of their number; as a necessary precaution, the plaintiff and the other rioters, were first segregated and then placed in single cells; in the initial stages of the foregoing procedure the plaintiff and his fellow rioters were served food trays which included pork and/or pork products, but since April 19, 1970, Muslims in the group were served only food items which were pork free. The Affidavit further stated that the plaintiff \u201chas been denied the privilege of returning to the genera] population of the institution because, in my opinion and in the opinion of the Adjustment Committee, a return to the general population at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>time would constitute a serious hazard to the plaintiff, to other inmates and to the staff,\u201d and \u201c[t]he plaintiffs conduct in engaging in a major riot, in the striking down of eight officers causes him, in my opinion, to be a very serious security risk.\u201d The Affidavit further stated that the visiting, privileges of the plaintiff were suspended only for a brief period.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The defendant later filed as a \u201cSupplement to his Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d the Affidavit of John T. Willingham, Acting Director, Bureau of Prisons, United States Department of Justice, certifying the Warden\u2019s authority to act with respect to \u201ctreatment, instruction, control and discipline\u201d of the Penitentiary\u2019s inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Copies of the defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, and the latter\u2019s accompanying Affidavits, were served by the defendant on the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not file any response to the motions and the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The District Court elected to treat the Complaint \u201cas though filed under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680,\u201d and then held \u201cthat the motion to dismiss must be granted because (1) the plaintiff had failed to exhaust administrative remedies prerequisite to filing or maintaining a civil action under the Federal Tort Claims Act; and, (2) even if this plaintiff had exhausted his administrative remedies, the instant action would be barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a) which provides that the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act shall <em>not </em>apply to \u2014 \u2018any claim . . . based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The District Court further stated in its Memorandum Opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cIn Barr v. Matteo, 360 U.S. 564, 575 [79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434] (1959), the Court indicated that government officials were completely immune from suit if the acts complained of were within the outer perimeter of their line of duty. Certainly, as the affidavits filed with the motion to dismiss indicate, Warden Parker\u2019s decisions with regard to the segregation and treatment of this plaintiff were well within the limits of his duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A26L\">The foregoing indicates that the District Court considered, and relied on, the materials appearing in the unchallenged Affidavit of the defendant Warden and that since it considered matters beyond the Complaint that it was in substance granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12(b), F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">On review of the record we are of the opinion that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment on its finding that the defendant Warden\u2019s conduct with respect to the plaintiff was within the outer perimeter of his authority and duties thus rendering him immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">As earlier noted, the plaintiff made no response to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its accompanying affidavits. In light of the assertion in the Affidavits that the defendant Warden was acting within the outer perimeter of his authority and duties, it was incumbent on the plaintiff, by affidavit or otherwise, as provided in Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P., to set forth specific facts showing that there was a genuine issue for trial as to whether the defendant was acting within the line and scope of his official duties. Norton v. McShane, 332 F.2d 855, 861 (5 Cir. 1964). cert. denied 380 U.S. 981, 85 S.Ct. 1345, 14 L.Ed.2d 274 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">For the reasons stated the Order of the District Court, treated as the granting of summary judgment, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-14\">. It may be noted parenthetically that there is now pending in the court below plaintiffs habeas corpus petition in which he seeks relief other than monetary damages, <em>vie., </em>outright release from custody, on the alleged ground *liat his solitary confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
