BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1464-23\">As a last gasp in the struggle against desegregation in the Flagler County (Florida) School District, Superintendent James O. Craig, now alone and unaided by the school board, appeals <em>pro se </em>from the District Court\u2019s order enjoining the operation of racially segregated public educational facilities and requiring the immediate implementation of a unitary school system, including compliance with the semi-annual reporting provision of Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 1364.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-24\">In the long march from Mansfield<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this Court has seen, heard, or heard of everything <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 everything, that is, until today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-25\">Here the District Court, after finding that Flagler County was operating a dual school system, ordered the immediate implementation of a unitary school system on August 7, 1970. The School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>District resisted, arguing that it did not know what the term \u201crace\u201d or \u201cethnic origin\u201d contemplated. It contended that it could not assure that Negro students were not being discriminated against because it did not have a Congressional definition of the term \u201cNegro.\u201d What began as an ingenius quandry soon became disingenuous when HEW offered these definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-5\">\n<em>Negro:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-6\">persons considered by themselves, by the school or by the community to be of African or Negro origin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-7\">\n<em>Oriental:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-8\">persons considered by themselves, by the school or by the community to be of Asian origin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">Similar guidelines were announced for identifying American Indians, Spanish Surnamed Americans and All Others. Thereupon, the School District blithely filed a Supplemental Report identifying all teachers and students in the District as \u201cOrientals,\u201d since they were so \u201cconsidered by the school.\u201d Therefore, it reasoned, there was no discrimination, since there was only one race in the entire school district (i. e., \u201cOrientals\u201d) and it could not be found to be in noncompliance with Constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-10\">With no surprise to anyone the District Court summarily rejected this absurdity and to the credit of the School District and the good sense of its members, the Board consented to a decree, avoiding any further embarrassment by urging that contention in this Court. The School Superintendent, who was named as a party-defendant in the suit below as a matter of form, appeals singly <em>pro se </em>from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">His argument is that he cannot enforce the District Court\u2019s order because it contains no definition of what is a Negro and therefore, he contends, the order is vague and uncertain. Justice Douglas\u2019s statement in Tijerina v. Henry, 1970, 398 U.S. 922, 90 S.Ct. 1718, 26 L.Ed.2d 86, sufficiently answers that argument \u2014 \u201cOne thing is not vague or uncertain, however, and that is that those who discriminate against members of this and other minority groups have little difficulty in isolating the objects of their discrimination.\u201d The record indicates that in the past the School District has apparently had no difficulty identifying Negroes for the purposes of segregating them. For desegregation they can be identified with similar ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-13\">Appellant\u2019s other argument, that he does not know how to implement the District Court\u2019s mandate that discrimination in the system be rooted out completely by use of non-discriminatory assignment of students (as the Trial Court suggests, on the basis of alphabetical order) is without any redeeming merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-14\">Whether viewed as frivolous under our Rule 20, which it clearly is, or on the merits \u2014 or more accurately, the total lack of merits \u2014 the appeal utterly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1464-15\">. The United States instituted the present action nearly six months after the entry of a consent decree providing a desegregation plan for the county, because the first semi-annual report required by. that decree failed to include statistical data relating to the racial composition of student bodies and faculties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1464-16\">. Jackson v. Rawdon, 5 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 93, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 925, 77 S.Ct. 221, 1 L.Ed.2d 160.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1464-18\">. See, e. g., Hernandez v. Driscoll Consolidated Independent School District, 2 Race Rel.L.R. 329 (S.D.Tex., January 11, 1957). There, the school district tried to circumvent an order of the State Super-tendent of Public Instruction, promulgated as a result of a court order in Delgado v. Bastrop Ind. School Dist., Civil No. 388 (W.D.Tex., June 15, 1948). The Superintendent\u2019s order had permitted segregation of Mexican Americans in the first grade <em>only </em>\u2014 as a means of combatting a prevalent language deficiency. Driscoll Independent School District\u2019s coup was to keep Mexican American students in the first grade for the first four years of their educational careers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
