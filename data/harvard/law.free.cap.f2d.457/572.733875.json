The jobs were held by members of the Operating Engineers\u2019 union. The Longshoremen\u2019s union struck, demanding the work for its members. The employers replaced the operating engineers with longshoremen. The Operating Engineers\u2019 union then picketed the employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The Operating Engineers\u2019 union filed charges under section 8(b) (4) (D) against the Longshoremen\u2019s union. The employers filed section 8(b) (4) (D) charges against the Operating Engineers\u2019 union. The Board instituted section 10(k) proceedings to resolve the jurisdictional dispute between the two unions. The Board also sought injunctive relief under section 10(l) against both unions, and such relief was granted. The Operating Engineers\u2019 union appealed. We affirmed. Henderson for and on Behalf of National Labor Relations Board v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 701, 420 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The section 10 (k) proceeding resulted in a Board decision awarding the disputed work to employees represented by the Operating Engineers\u2019 union. The Board held that the Longshoremen\u2019s union was \u201cnot entitled by means proscribed by Section 8(b) (4) (D) of the Act to force or require the Employers to assign the above work to longshoremen represented by it.\u201d 181 N.L.R.B. 315, 317 (1970). The Longshoremen\u2019s union was given ten days to notify the Board whether it would comply. The Longshoremen\u2019s union and the employers petitioned the Board for a stay of its decision. The application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The Longshoremen\u2019s union and the employers filed petitions in this court under section 10(f) seeking review of the Board\u2019s section 10 (k) determination. In an unreported order we dismissed the petitions for lack of jurisdiction, citing NLRB v. International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, 378 F.2d 33, 35-36 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">In the meantime, following the Board\u2019s section 10(k) award of the work to members of the Operating Engineers\u2019 union, the Regional Director dismissed the section 8(b) (4) (D) charges against the Operating Engineers\u2019 union, and advised the employers that no complaint would be filed on those charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Armed with this dismissal, the Operating Engineers\u2019 union moved for dissolution of the section 10(l) injunction as to it. The district court denied the motion, and the Operating Engineers\u2019 union appeals in No. 26,468. An amicus brief was filed on behalf of the employers by the Pacific Maritime Association, an employer association.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">The employers also filed a petition (No. 26,529) seeking review of the Regional Director\u2019s dismissal of the section 8(b) (4) (D) charges against the Operating Engineers\u2019 union, and the Board\u2019s refusal to stay its section 10(k) determination awarding the work to members of the Operating Engineers\u2019 union. The Board has moved to dismiss the employers\u2019 petition on the ground that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>of these administrative actions is subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">The basic issue we are asked to decide is whether a union whose members are awarded disputed work in a section 10 (k) proceeding remains subject to a section 10 (1) injunction unless and until the opposing union has voluntarily acceded to the Board's award or the award has been confirmed by judicial review. The Operating Engineers\u2019 union insists that when the section 10 (k) award is made and section 8(b) (4) (D) charges against the prevailing union are dismissed, the section 10l) injunction against that union terminates and it may use economic pressure to enforce the section 10 (k) award. The employers argue that voluntary compliance or judicial review must precede economic sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We resolve this central issue in favor of the Operating Engineers\u2019 union in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union, 397 U.S. 655, 90 S.Ct. 1299, 25 L.Ed.2d 637 (1970), and NLRB v. Plasterers\u2019 Local Union, 404 U.S. 116, 92 S.Ct. 360, 30 L.Ed.2d 312 (1971) \u2014 the latter announced after the submission of these cases for decision in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In <em>Sears </em>the Supreme Court held that a section 10(l) injunction terminates when the Board decides the underlying unfair labor practice charge. The Court rejected the argument that such an injunction \u201cwould remain in effect until the Board\u2019s order [was] either enforced or denied enforcement by the Court of Appeals.\" 397 U.S. at 658, 90 S.Ct. at 1301. With respect to a situation like that in this case, the Court said, \u201c[w]here the Board ultimately finds no unfair labor practice, it would clearly be contrary to the policies of the Act to permit a district court injunction to remain in effect pending Court of Appeals review of the District Court\u2019s action\u201d (659, 90 S.Ct. at 1301).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The employers argue that <em>Sears </em>is inapplicable to this case. They point out that the charge in <em>Sears </em>was secondary picketing in violation of section 8(b) (4) (B) rather than a jurisdictional strike in violation of section 8(b) (4) (D), and therefore there was no section 10 (k) proceeding in <em>Sears. </em>They contend that where the charge is under section 8(b) (4) (D) and section 10(k) is invoked, as here, the \u201cfinal adjudication of the Board\u201d under section 10(1) is defined by the last sentence of section 10 (k). <em>See </em>note 2. Admittedly, there has been neither a voluntary adjustment of the dispute nor compliance with the section 10(k) award in this ease. Accordingly, the employers argue, their unfair labor practice charge against the Operating Engineers\u2019 union should not have been dismissed, and there has been no lawful \u201cfinal adjudication by the Board\u201d within the meaning of section 10(l). They conclude that the district court properly refused to vacate the section 10(l) injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The Supreme Court rejected the premises of this argument in NLRB v. Plasterers\u2019 Local Union, <em>supra. </em>The Court stated that when the striking union \u201cwins the \u00a7 10 (k) decision and the employer does not comply, the employer\u2019s \u00a7 8(b) (4) (D) case evaporates and the charges he filed against the picketing union will be dismissed.\u201d 404 U.S. at 127, 92 S.Ct. at 367. This dismissal, the Court noted, \u201cwill not be pursuant to the language of \u00a7 10 (k) directing dismissal upon \u2018compliance by the parties to the dispute with the decision of the Board\u2019 but rather under \u00a7 8(b) (4) (D) because the \u2018employer is failing to conform to an order or certification of the Board determining the bargaining representative for employees performing such work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127 n. 19, 92 S.Ct. at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Thus, dismissal of the section 8(b) (4) (D) charge against the Operating Engineers\u2019 union was not contingent upon voluntary adjustment of the underlying dispute or compliance with the Board\u2019s section 10 (k) decision, as the employers contend. Rather, dismissal was required because the employers\u2019 dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>regard of the section 10 (k) determination was within the exception to section 8(b) (4) (D), and therefore a strike against the employers was no longer a violation of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Section 10(l) was not mentioned in <em>Plasterers\u2019 Local Union, </em>but the Court\u2019s logic and language convinces us that dismissal of the section 8(b) (4) (D) claim against the union prevailing in the section 10(k) proceeding requires termination of any section 10(l) injunction against that union, leaving it free to engage in economic coercion to obtain the jobs for its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">\u201cNeither the employer nor the employees to whom he has assigned the work are legally bound to observe the \u00a7 10 (k) decision, but both will lose their \u00a7 8(b) (4) (D) protection against the picketing which may, as it did here, shut down the job. The employer will be under intense pressure, practically, to conform to the Board\u2019s decision. This is the design of the Act; Congress provided no other way to implement the Board's \u00a7 10 (k) decision.\u201d 404 U.S. at 127, 92 S.Ct. at 367.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">This language contemplates that the union prevailing in the section 10(k) proceeding shall have the immediate right to picket a noncomplying employer. To preclude such self-help by continuing a section 10(l) injunction against the union awarded the disputed work would be inconsistent with the \u201cdesign of the Act.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Conversely, the section 8(b) (4) (D) charge against the Longshoremen\u2019s union remained alive because of their refusal to comply with the work assignment award. The section 10(l) injunction therefore continued against the Longshoremen\u2019s union until the Board\u2019s final adjudication of the charges against it. <em>See </em>note 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">This result is also consistent with the statutory purpose of the Act. The principal object of section 10(k) was to settle jurisdictional disputes quickly and permanently by encouraging voluntary settlement or compliance. NLRB v. Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers (CBS), 364 U.S. 573, 576-577, 81 S.Ct. 330, 5 L.Ed.2d 302 (1961); <em>see </em>Plasterers Local Union No. 79, Operative Plasterers\u2019 and Cement Masons\u2019 International Association, A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. NLRB, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 146, 440 F.2d 174, 182-184 (D.C. Cir. 1970), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 404 U.S. 116, 92 S.Ct. 360, 30 L.Ed.2d 312 (1971); NLRB v. United Association of Journeymen, 242 F.2d 722, 725-726 (3d Cir. 1957). <em>See </em>2 Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, at 983 (1948). There would be little incentive for the Longshoremen\u2019s union either to agree to a settlement or comply with the Board\u2019s order if its refusal would leave its members in possession of the jobs and the rival union barred from picketing. Under the employers\u2019 argument, this delay would continue until the Board completed the section 8(b) (4) (D) proceedings against the Longshoremen\u2019s union, a Court of Appeals reviewed the record and entered an enforcement order, and, perhaps, until a contempt proceeding was instituted and completed in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">On the other hand, permitting the prevailing Operating Engineers\u2019 union to bring economic pressure on the employers while at the same time protect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ing the employers from similar pressure from the Longshoremen\u2019s union would encourage the latter to seek an early accommodation. Failing that, it would at least allow the employers to assign the jobs to the employees presumptively entitled to those jobs, free of the threat of coercive section 8(b) (4) (D) reprisals from the Longshoremen\u2019s union.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">This would serve one of the principal purposes of these provisions, namely, protection of a neutral employer from loss due to conflicting demands by competing unions that the employer is powerless to satisfy. NLRB v. Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers (CBS), <em>supra, </em>364 U.S. at 580-581, 81 S.Ct. 330; Plasterers\u2019 Local Union No. 79, Operative Plasterers\u2019 and Cement Masons\u2019 International Association A.F.L.-C.I.O. v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>440 F.2d at 183; NLRB v. Local 1291, International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, 345 F.2d 4, 10 (3d Cir. 1965). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 23-24 (1947); 1 Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, at 314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">To recapitulate, the \u201cfinal adjudication\u201d of the dispute as to the Operating Engineers\u2019 union occurred when the work was awarded to its members in the section 10(k) proceeding; dismissal of the unfair labor practice charges then followed as a matter of course. NLRB v. Plasterers\u2019 Union, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 116, 92 S.Ct. 360. The section 10(l) injunction ceased to be effective as to that union by the terms of the statute, since there was a \u201cfinal adjudication <em>of the Board </em>with respect to [the] matter.\u201d Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union, <em>supra, </em>397 U. S. at 658-659, 90 S.Ct. at 1301. Court of Appeals review was not necessary since the statute refers to final adjudication \u201cof the Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 90 S. Ct. 1299. The Operating Engineers\u2019 union was free to enforce the section 10 (k) award by economic coercion because such pressure would be pursuant to an \u201corder or certification of the Board\u201d and thus not in violation of section 8(b) (4) (D). NLRB v. Plasterers\u2019 Local Union, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 127 n. 19, 92 S.Ct. at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The district court therefore erred in denying the motion of the Operating Engineers\u2019 union to eliminate that union from the section 10(l) injunction. The Board has since decided the section 8(b) (4) (D) proceedings against the Longshoremen\u2019s union <em>(see </em>note 4). By the terms of the statute, the injunction has expired as to that union as well. <em>See </em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Carpet, Linoleum, Soft Tile and Resilient Floor Covering Layers, Local Union, <em>supra, </em>397 U. S. at 657, 90 S.Ct. 1299, 25 L.Ed.2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Turning to No. 26,529, we conclude that we are without jurisdiction to review either the refusal of the Board to stay its section 10(k) determination, or the dismissal of the employers\u2019 charges against the Operating Engineers\u2019 union.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">As noted earlier, this court has dismissed the petition of the employers to review the section 10 (k) award for want of jurisdiction on the authority of NLRB v. International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, 378 F.2d 33, 35-36 (9th Cir. 1967). <em>See also </em>NLRB v. Local 991, International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, 332 F.2d 66, 70-71 (5th Cir. 1964). Under these authorities the section 10(k) award is an interlocutory order reviewable only in the course of review of any subsequent final order under section 8(b) (4) (D). Thus, to countenance immediate review of an order denying a stay of such a section 10 (k) award would doubly offend the deeply entrenched policy against premature and piecemeal appellate proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">The employers urge countervailing considerations in favor of requiring ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>dicial confirmation of the Board\u2019s section 10(k) award before it becomes binding, emphasizing that the Board should not rely on economic sanctions by the prevailing union in the section 10(k) proceeding to enforce the Board\u2019s order. Their position, however, cannot withstand the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Sears </em>and <em>Plasterers\u2019 Union, </em>discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The employers\u2019 effort to obtain review of the dismissal of charges against the Operating Engineers\u2019 union must also be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We held in NLRB v. Lewis, 249 F.2d 832, 838 (9th Cir. 1957), aff\u2019d 357 U.S. 10, 15-16, 78 S.Ct. 1029, 2 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1958), that \u201c[b]y virtue of \u00a7 3(d) . . . the General Counsel [\u2019s] . . . decision on whether to issue a complaint charging an unfair labor practice is final and is not reviewable by either the Board or the courts.\u201d <em>See also </em>Department &amp; Specialty Store Employees Union, Local 1265, R.C.I.A., A.F.L.-C.I.O. v.

Other Courts of Appeals have adhered to this view. <em>See, e. g., </em>Lincourt v. NLRB, 170 F.2d 306, 307 (1st Cir. 1948) ; United Elec. Contractors\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Ord-man, 366 F.2d 776 (2d Cir. 1966) ; Contractors\u2019 Ass\u2019n of Philadelphia &amp; Eastern Pennsylvania v. NLRB, 295 F.2d 526 (3d Cir. 1961) ; Wellington Mill Div., West Point Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, 330 F.2d 579, 591 (4th Cir. 1964) ; NLRB v. Bar-Brook Mfg. Co., 220 F.2d 832, 834 (5th Cir. 1955) ; Mayer v. Ordman, 391 F.2d 889, 892 (6th Cir. 1968) ; Balanyi v.

The principle of nonreviewability of the General Counsel\u2019s dismissal of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (D) charges applies whether or not the Board has commenced proceedings under \u00a7 10 (k). <em>See generally </em>Manhattan Constr.
