The Tax Court found that fraudulent returns had been filed and that there was joint liability. Clarke v. Commissioner, 54 T.C. 1149 (1970). No appeal was taken from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">Following the decision of the Tax Court the Internal Revenue Service \u201cadministratively refunded\u201d the amounts claimed by the plaintiff, Hilda Clarke, as over-payments for the years 1956-1958 in the amount of approximately $25,000, by crediting that amount against the sum awarded to the Commissioner by the judgment of the Tax Court. The suit for refund of taxes for the years 1956-1958, which was instituted in 1964 (the amount of which had been administratively refunded by the Service as stated above), was still pending when the Internal Revenue Service levied against Mrs. Clarke\u2019s earnings and recovered $66.00. After the levy against her earnings, Mrs. Clarke moved for the injunctive relief which was granted as outlined previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The record in the court below does not demonstrate that the trial judge fully considered the application of the statutory provisions prohibiting suits to restrain the collection of taxes. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7421.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">It is, therefore, ordered that the case be remanded to the United States District Court for further consideration in the light of the provisions of Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7421.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
