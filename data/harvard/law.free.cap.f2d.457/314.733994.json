Before trial the parties stipulated that the earlier mechanical patent (\u2019699) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not infringed. With respect to the later mechanical patent (\u2019612),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the questions are whether the district court, 307 F.Supp. 822, properly construed 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) in holding that the invention was in public use more than a year before the patent application was filed, and if so, whether he properly rejected plaintiff\u2019s alternative contention that the \u2019612 patent was entitled to \u2019699\u2019s earlier filing date. With respect to the design patent (Des. \u2019094),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the questions are whether it satisfied the requirements for patentability set forth in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 171, and if so, whether the finding of infringement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">On June 19, 1959, plaintiff made its first shipment of a fiberglass overhead garage door which was thereafter manufactured and sold in large quantities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The door was mounted on tracks for movement from a closed vertical position to an open horizontal position within the garage. The door included four rectangular sections arranged (when the door was closed) one above the other, and hinged together to facilitate movement around the curved portion of the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-18\">Each section included a metal frame enclosing a plastic panel. Each frame performed the dual function of securing the enclosed panel and also forming a hinging joint with the frame of the adjacent section. The joining function is not pertinent here; our attention is directed to the relationship between the metal frame and its enclosed plastic panel. More narrowly, we are specifically concerned with the horizontal rails at the top and bottom of each section.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-19\">In the lower three sections of the door, the top rail contained two horizontal flanges, extending from one end of the door to the other, which, if viewed from a cross section, might be likened to an inverted letter \u201cJ.\u201d The panel was placed between the two flanges and secured by rivets which pierced the longer rear flange. The shorter front flange was pressed snugly against the panel. The pressure thus applied was intended to effect a waterproof closure, but was not sufficient to embed the aluminum flange into the compressible plastic panel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-20\">The door which was sold on June 19, 1959, included various novel features which we need not explain. They were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>described in the application, filed on August 17, 1959, which led to the issuance of patent \u2019699 some four years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">On July 5, 1960, plaintiff\u2019s assignors filed the application which matured into patent \u2019612. That application related particularly to the construction of the door sections and, more narrowly, to the method of securing the plastic panel in the aluminum frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Shortly after plaintiff\u2019s first shipment on June 19, 1959, it began to use a power driven roller instead of the hand cranked machine to press the short front flange against the plastic panel. Plaintiff later realized that when the short front flange was embedded in the compressible plastic panel by using the power roller, it was held so securely that it was no longer necessary to use rivets to attach the panel to the rear horizontal flange. This discovery led to the development of an improved door model and to the filing of the July 5,1960, application and the issuance of patent \u2019612.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The district court held that the public sale on June 19, 1959, more than a year before the filing date of the \u2019612 application, invalidated the patent under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a matter of law he concluded that the test under \u00a7 102(b) is not identity, but whether the difference between the prior sale item and the subject matter of the claims is itself patentable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a matter of fact, he found that the only genuine difference between the sale door and the patent did not constitute invention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Plaintiff thereafter was granted leave to supplement the record by filing a copy of the \u2019699 patent, but the court, 314 F.Supp. 99, rejected the contention that the \u00a7 102(b) defense could be avoided by giving the \u2019612 patent the benefit of \u2019699\u2019s filing date. The design patent was found valid and infringed. Both parties have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">We first consider the test of invalidity under \u00a7 102(b) and whether that test was correctly applied in this case. We shall then discuss the contention that the \u2019612 patent should have the benefit of an earlier filing date. Finally, we shall review the design patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">There were several differences between the door sold on June 19, 1959, and the improved model described in the \u2019612 patent. In the sale door the front flange was rolled in only on the top rail of the lower three sections; the \u2019612 patent contemplated such rolling on the top and bottom rails of all four sections. The district court found that the flange on the sale door was not actually embedded into the plastic panel; the \u2019612 patent unequivocally describes such embedment. The sale door, although intended to be watertight, actually was subject to leakage between the frame and the panel as a result of capillary action; the \u2019612 pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ent describes a waterproof closure. In the sale door rivets secured the panel to the rear horizontal flange; the \u2019612 specifications refer to the elimination of such rivets. Thus, it is clear that there was not complete identity between the sale door and the \u2019612 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Plaintiff contends that \u00a7 102(b) is inapplicable because defendant failed to prove that the \u2019612 invention was \u201cidentically disclosed\u201d by the sale door. Moreover, if a test of nonobviousness rather than complete anticipation is proper, plaintiff contends that the district court erroneously failed to make findings required by Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">A. Interpretation of \u00a7 102(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s position is supported by the language of \u00a7 103 which implies that no prior reference is within \u00a7 102 if \u201cthe invention is not identically disclosed or described\u201d therein,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by comments in several opinions written after 1952, and by one holding which, though subsequently overruled by a divided court, was regarded as a correct statement of the law by a member of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are nevertheless persuaded that the enactment of \u00a7 103 was not intended by Congress to incorporate a \u201cstrict identity\u201d test into \u00a7 102(b). In brief, the reasons for our conclusions are the state of the law prior to the 1952 codification, the fact that the 1952 enactment was primarily intended to restate the law, and the fact that the addition of \u00a7 103 was directed to a wholly different problem. We first put to one side the authorities on which plaintiff relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Plaintiff\u2019s principal reliance is upon this court\u2019s description of \u201cthe defense of anticipation\u201d in Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Sweetheart Plastics, Inc., 436 F.2d 1180, 1182-1183 (1971). We there reiterated a dictum from a Tenth Circuit opinion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which quoted from two earlier decisions of the Ninth Circuit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Neither our opinion, nor any of the earlier references, involved the \u00a7 102(b) issue which is now before us. As we expressly noted, we were there considering the defense of anticipation predicated on \u00a7 102(a);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> such anticipation \u201cspeaks only to the novelty of an invention.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that case, as in each of the other cases upon which plaintiff relies, decision actually turned on acceptance or rejection of the defense of obviousness.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Section 102(a), like \u00a7 103, focuses upon the state of the art at the date of invention. Section 102(b), however, is not concerned with prior art which anticipated the invention date; it is concerned with the filing of the patent application. Prior to 1952 it was perfectly clear that an invention had to embody a significant conceptual advance over the state of the art existing (a) when the invention was discovered or made and also (b) one year prior to the filing date of the application. Both time requirements were included in the same statutory provision defining the conditions of patentability<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The test of \u201cinvention\u201d now reflected in \u00a7 103 was then applicable equally to the prior art which is now described in \u00a7 102(b) as well as to the art described in \u00a7 102 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">A quotation from Hall v. Macneale is appropriate, not because of the similarity between an improvement intended to make safe doors burglarproof and an improvement intended to make garage doors waterproof, but rather because both improvements were discovered after the basic conception had been disclosed and, although novel, neither amounted to invention :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201cIt clearly appears, from the testimony of the appellant himself, that the idea of making a claim to the invention covered by claim 3 of the patent sued on arose from the introduction into safes, in 1866 or early in 1867, of plates of steel and iron welded together. This enabled the value of the screw-threaded conical bolt to be more fully developed because the screw-thread could be made more effective the whole length of the bolt. But the whole invention existed in the bolt of the patent of 1860. There was no invention in adding to the solid conical bolt the screw-thread of the cored conical bolt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-11\">\u201cMoreover, the use and sale of the solid conical bolts in the Lafayette and Loraine County safes, even though those bolts had no screw-threads on them, constituted a use and sale of the invention covered by claim 3 of the patent in suit. The application for that patent was made in March, 1867, and the patent was granted under the provisions of the act of July 4, 1936, c. 357, and of the act of March 3, 1839, c. 88. Within the meaning of sections 7 and 15 of the act of 1836, as modified by section 7 of the act of 1839, the invention covered by claim 3 of the patent in suit was in use and on sale more than two years before the appellant applied for that patent, and such use and sale were, also, with the consent and allowance of the appellant, and the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>was a public use.\u201d 107 U.S. 90, 96, 2 S.Ct. 73, 78, 27 L.Ed. 367.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">See also 2 Walker, Patents, 684-685 (Deller\u2019s 2d ed. 1964) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">A mechanical improvement, such as the addition of screw-threads to a solid conical bolt, may give a later device \u201cnovelty\u201d even though it does not embody \u201cinvention.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Mere novelty, however, does not qualify an improvement for patent protection. The question here is whether the limitation prescribed by \u00a7 102(b) begins to run from the date of disclosure of the basic invention or of the novel improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">If we ignore 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 for the moment and confine our attention to the language of \u00a7 102(b) and its statutory antecedents, we find solid support for the conclusion that public disclosure of an invention more than a year before a patent application is filed forecloses patentability, not only of the precise embodiment disclosed, but also of subsequent novel improvements unless such an improvement is itself patentable as an invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Section 102(b), like its predecessors, refers to disclosure of the \u201cinvention.\u201d The purpose of the statute is to require the inventor to exercise diligence in filing his patent application,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and to prevent him from extending the period of his limited patent grant by means of successive minor improvements, each arguably supporting a new claim on the original invention.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In addition, it provides a fixed date, often more readily ascertainable than the date of the invention, for evaluating the significance of prior art and resolving issues of priority. The purposes of the statute would be largely frustrated if the limitation bar could be tolled by the development of improvements which, though novel, represent no advance over the basic conception.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Presumably for that reason, the courts which have actually had to decide cases arising under \u00a7 102(b) have uniformly rejected the \u201cstrict identity\u201d test implicitly suggested by the language of \u00a7 103. The leading case is the decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in Application of Foster, 343 F.2d 980, 52 CCPA 1808 (1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 966, 86 S.Ct. 1270, 16 L.Ed.2d 307, which has been followed by the Third Circuit in Package Devices, Inc. v. Sunray Drug Co., 432 F.2d 272 (1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 956, 91 S.Ct. 977, 28 L.Ed.2d 239. The Ninth Circuit reached a comparable result in Tool Research and Engineering Corp. v. Honcor Corp., 367 F.2d 449 (1966), cert. denied, 387 U.S. 919, 87 S.Ct. 2032, 18 L.Ed.2d 972; that case is of particular significance because the court expressly noted, and considered inapplicable, its earlier <em>dicta, </em>concerning \u00a7 102(a).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Finally, we cite with approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>al the analysis of the issue in Dix-Seal Corp. v. New Haven Trap Rock Co., 236 F.Supp. 914, 916-920 (D.Conn. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In his recent opinion for this court analyzing the effect of \u00a7 102(a) and \u00a7 102 (b) on the inventor\u2019s own prior art, Judge Duffy quoted the following statement from <em>Dix-Seal:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201c \u2018Once the year in which to prepare and file his application has passed, the employment of a standard of patenta-bility less stringent against the first inventor than against . . . others would seem to impair, if not defeat Congressional policy. There should be no distinction between prior art of the inventor\u2019s own making and that of others.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">See Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Solo Cup Company, Inc. (7th Cir. Jan. 26, 1972, No. 18960 p. 5.) Later in his opinion Judge Duffy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201cThe balancing process between the encouragement of technological advancement by the granting of legal monopolies and permitting a one-year grace period for application, and the interest of the public in having new advances readily accessible, has been considered by Congress in Section 102 (b). The policy to expedite free public use and public disclosure by inventors was the overriding consideration of Congress in passing Section 102(b), which expressly bars an inventor who does not file an application within one year after his invention has been in public use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\u201cOnce in public use, that invention becomes prior art and as to all later discoveries in that field <em>anyone else </em>must show some \u201cpatentable\u201d change to obtain the legal monopoly. Once the year in which to prepare and file this application has passed, the employment of a standard of patentability less stringent against the first inventor than against these others would seem to impair, if not defeat, congressional policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">If the language of \u00a7 103 were read to incorporate a strict identity test into \u00a7 102(b), it would tear a significant hole in the fabric of pre-1952 patent law. No intent to create such a loophole is evident from the legislative history of the 1952 Code. Neither the purpose of the codification as a whole,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> nor the specific reasons for the inclusion of \u00a7 103,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> have any application to the issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Section 103 was intended to articulate a standard of invention somewhat less strict than that implied by reference to an inventor\u2019s \u201cflash of creative genius\u201d and also to remind us to judge patentability against the state of the art at the time the invention was made without benefit of hindsight predicated on subsequent art. The section, however, made no basic change in preexisting law. See Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 12-17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">Nevertheless, \u00a7 103 does shed this much light on \u00a7 102(b). Its use of the concept of \u201cnonobviousness\u201d to identify the level of invention which qualifies for patent protection should also govern the interpretation of the word \u201cinvention\u201d in \u00a7 102(b). And its admonition to judge the issue in the correct temporal context requires us to determine whether the subsequent developments should have been obvious at the time the disclosure was made, rather than at the later date when the improvement was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>covered.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The factual issue under \u00a7 102 (b) presented to the district court in this case was, therefore, whether the subject matter of the \u2019612 claims should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art on June 19, 1959.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">B. Sufficiency of the Findings.</p>\n<p id=\"AAY\">Plaintiff contends that the district court\u2019s analysis of the obviousness question failed to follow the procedure mandated by the Supreme Court in Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The first step, a determination of the relevant prior art, merely required attention to the sale door itself and contemporaneous documents which were received in evidence. The relevant prior art was adequately identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The district court next considered the differences between the sale door and the \u2019612 claims. He attached no significance, and neither do we, to the fact that the \u201cJ\u201d configuration of flanges was found in only three horizontal rails in the sale door. Even if the concept had been disclosed in only one, that would have sufficed. Similarly, the fact that the configuration of flanges, followed by the insertion of the plastic panel and the application of pressure to the shorter flange, was intended' both to secure the panel in the frame and also to make the door watertight was evident from the door itself.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Of course, the application of greater pressure would better achieve these purposes : it would reduce the possibility of leakage and the need for rivets.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">The district court specifically found that the shorter flange in the sale door was not embedded in the plastic panel. He found that \u201cthe only genuine difference between the door sold on June 19, 1959, and the mechanical patent here in issue is the degree of rolling force utilized.\u201d A. 412. Although it might have been more precise to state the difference in terms of the consequence of the application of greater force, we believe this finding was clearly correct and adequately identified the differences between the \u201cprior art\u201d and the claims at issue as required by the second step of the <em>John Deere </em>procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">The district court made no findings which expressly discuss \u201cthe level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art,\u201d but he did unambiguously find that the attainment of embedment was merely the result of \u201cmechanical skill.\u201d We are therefore satisfied that his ultimate find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>ing that the attainment of embedment \u201cdid not constitute invention\u201d adequately complied with the requirements of <em>John Deere, </em>and that his findings are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Plaintiff contends that if the improvement claimed in the \u2019612 patent was obvious from the sale door, it is entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the \u2019699 application which allegedly described that door \u201cexactly and accurately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">If a later patent application satisfies the four conditions specified in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120, it is entitled to the benefit of an earlier filing date.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The \u2019612 application appears to satisfy three of these conditions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The question is whether the invention claimed in the \u2019612 patent was disclosed in the \u2019699 application \u201cin the manner provided by the first paragraph of [35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The \u2019699 application disclosed the basic invention, including the \u201cJ\u201d configuration of the flanges on the horizontal rail. It did not include any drawings illustrating the effect of applying sufficient force to embed the shorter flange into the plastic panel \u2014 that is, to change the configuration from a \u201cJ\u201d into a fishhook. But as the district court found, that modification should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. It is therefore not unreasonable for plaintiff to argue that its earlier application should have satisfied the disclosure condition in \u00a7 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">That section, however, requires the prior disclosure to satisfy the first paragraph of \u00a7 112. That paragraph prescribes the kind of disclosure which shall be contained in the specification in a patent application.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It says nothing about the device itself, or what might be obvious from its inspection, use or manufacture. For that reason, notwithstanding the superficial plausibility of plaintiff\u2019s argument, it actually confuses two quite different issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">Under \u00a7 102(b) the defendant had the burden of proving that the subject matter of the \u2019612 claims was obvious from the sale door itself, together with the evidence respecting the state of the art on June 19, 1959. Under \u00a7 120, however, the plaintiff had the burden of proving that the \u2019699 specification adequately disclosed the best mode contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention claimed in the \u2019612 patent. Important evidence supporting the find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ing of obviousness, and therefore the \u00a7 102(b) defense, sheds no light whatsoever on the \u00a7 120 issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The \u2019699 specification contains no reference to the portion of the aluminum flange which is actually embedded into the compressible panel. This part of the flange was carefully described in the \u2019612 specification<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and identified as the \u201cgripping member\u201d on the \u2019612 drawings.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The gripping member is one of the elements of the combination claimed in the '612 patent.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Certain evidence relating to the gripping member supported the district court\u2019s finding .that the embedment concept was obvious on June 19, 1959. That evidence, though apparently available to the plaintiff before the \u2019699 application was filed, finds no counterpart in the \u2019699 specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The evidence included a memorandum indicating that on June 1, 1959, plaintiff had started work on a new machine to roll the flanges into the fiberglass panels <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and an apparently contemporaneous pair of drawings closely resembling the actual configuration of the flanges in the frame of the sale door before and after the application of pressure.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> These drawings strongly suggest, and may actually disclose, the concept of embedment.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It was entirely proper for the district court to determine the issue of obviousness under \u00a7 102(b) on the basis of his study of not only the sale door itself but also the contemporaneous evidence indicating that embedment would result from the application of additional pressure to the front flange.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">There is no inconsistency between his finding of obviousness based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>on that evidence and his rejection of plaintiff\u2019s untimely contention that the invention claimed in the \u2019612 patent had been disclosed in the \u2019699 specification in the manner prescribed by the first paragraph of \u00a7 112. It is conceivable that elements such as the gripping member, the importance of a relatively hard flange on the horizontal rail,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and actual em-bedment, which were painstakingly described in the \u2019612 specification, were inherently disclosed by the \u2019699 application, but that conclusion is by no means obvious. <em>Cf. </em>Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., 305 U.S. 47, 57-59, 59 S. Ct. 8, 83 L.Ed. 34. In view of the omission from the \u2019699 application of drawings which had previously been prepared,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and which disclosed the invention in substantially the same manner as drawings used in the \u2019612 specification, it is extremely doubtful that plaintiff made the full disclosure \u2014 including \u201cthe best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention\u201d \u2014 required by the first paragraph of \u00a7 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Even if there might be merit in plaintiff\u2019s post-trial assertion that the \u2019612 patent should have the benefit of the \u2019699\u2019s filing date, it is clear that the issue presented by the belated argument could not have been resolved summarily in plaintiff\u2019s favor. It is equally clear that plaintiff could have advanced this argument as an alternative contention as soon as defendant pleaded \u00a7 102(b) as a defense. The district court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to reopen the case to give plaintiff a second chance to try to establish the validity of its patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">We doubt that plaintiff\u2019s \u2019699 specification disclosed the invention claimed in the \u2019612 patent in the manner required by \u00a7 112. This doubt buttresses our holding that plaintiff\u2019s election to try the case on the theory that the differences between the sale door and the \u2019612 claims provided an adequate response to the \u00a7 102(b) defense, without relying on \u00a7 120 as an alternative contention, forecloses any challenge to the district court\u2019s summary rejection of plaintiff\u2019s post-decision attempt to inject new issues into the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">The patented design is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> There is no novelty in the fact that the door is comprised of four sections composed of a corrugation of alternate broad planes and narrow grooves. Three other features were stressed in supporting allowance of a patent: (1) the entire garage door is surrounded by a narrow border; (2) the broad plane surfaces in the corrugation are substantially equally spaced; and (3) every third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>plane is bisected by the horizontal bars which hinge two sections together.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The prior art submitted to the Patent Office Examiner included catalog references and mechanical patents, but no design patents. He rejected the application on the ground that the design lacked invention.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In response to a request for reconsideration, the Examiner again concluded that the design did not present \u201canything patentably ornamental\u201d and finally rejected the claim as lacking invention.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The Board of Appeals reversed the Examiner\u2019s rejection. It held that the three features identified above produced \u201ca design which is not similar to or suggested by the references.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Its opinion adequately explained why plaintiff\u2019s design was novel, but does not expressly consider the requirement of \u201cinvention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The district court found the design patent valid and infringed. The court expressed the opinion that the design satisfied the test of \u201ccreative originality in artistry.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion the court expressly relied on the presumption of validity<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and the appearance of the exposed aluminum at the hinges.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Defendant\u2019s denial of infringement was predicated on the fact that the sections of its door are hinged in the narrow grooves which separate the broader planes instead of bisecting every third broad surface. The district court concluded, however, that the overall appearance of the two doors was substantially identical because on both doors the hinges were almost entirely concealed. The court also stated, erroneously, that the Patent Office Board of Appeals placed no reliance on the location of the hinges.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">In order to support its claim of infringement, plaintiff construed the scope of its monopoly grant as broadly encompassing doors with substantially equally spaced grooves surrounded by a narrow border, regardless of whether the hinging horizontal framing members bisect a broad surface or a narrow groove. As so construed, we hold that the patent is not supported by a presumption of validity because we do not think the Board of Appeals\u2019 decision can be read as giving the plaintiff the monopoly it asserts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Without that support we think the Examiner was clearly correct in finding that the design was lacking in invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">There are several reasons for our conclusion that the monopoly claimed by plaintiff is not presumptively valid. We first note that a patented design, like the subject matter of a mechanical patent, must embody invention. The purpose of the statute is to reward, and thereby to encourage, creative artistic activity rather than mere changes of detail which may produce \u201cnovelty\u201d but do not reflect \u201cinvention.\u201d The inventor must make a \u201ccontribution to the public which the law deems worthy of recompense.\u201d Gorham Company v. White, 14 Wall 511, 81 U.S. 511, 525, 20 L.Ed. 731.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In this case the Examiner plainly and repeatedly expressed his judgment that the claimed design was lacking in invention. The Board of Appeals\u2019 opinion carefully articulated differences between plaintiff\u2019s design and the specific prior art references to support its conclusion that the design was novel, but the opinion contains no comment on the separate and important requirement of invention.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">If we read into the opinion a finding that the design reflects creativity, significance must be attached to the Board\u2019s express reference to the hinging horizontal framing members which bisect every third broad surface. Since a more normal location for the hinges would be in the narrow grooves, greater originality is reflected in this feature than in either the narrow border or the roughly equal spacing of grooves. A construction of the patent which eliminates this feature, therefore, removes any basis for presuming that the Board of Appeals <em>sub silentio </em>found that plaintiff\u2019s otherwise commonplace design did attain the status of invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">We therefore conclude that the design patent, as construed by plaintiff, is clearly lacking in invention, as the Examiner found.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed insofar as it holds Patent No. 3,169,612 invalid; insofar as it holds Design Patent No. 194,094 valid and infringed, it is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-12\">.

Under a narrower construction of the patent emphasizing, as the \u201cinventive\u201d concept, the hinge location and appearance, defendant\u2019s door clearly would not infringe. We thus need not squarely decide if the design patent as narrowly construed would be valid. That this conclusion is doubtful given the standards necessary in order to meet the \u201cinvention\u201d criterion of design patents can be seen from examining the design patent cases decided by this court, which are conveniently collected in Judge Hastings\u2019 comprehensive footnote in Amerock Corp. v. Aubrey Hardware Mfg., Inc., 275 F.2d 346, 349 n. 1 (7th Cir. I960). See also two subsequent cases, Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Sandee Mfg.
