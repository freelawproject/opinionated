In his motion to vacate sentence, he alleged that the arrest warrant and its supporting complaint were invalid in that they were not issued upon sufficient evidence to create probable cause. The record reveals that appellant\u2019s arrest was not based upon an arrest warrant, but was based upon probable cause at the time of a search of his premises under authority of a valid search warrant. The validity of the search warrant was upheld in Dryden v. United States, 5 Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 786. The search disclosed distilling apparatus and accessories in appellant\u2019s barn. Obviously the officers had sufficient probable cause to make the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-22\">The record showing conclusively, that there is no merit to appellant\u2019s contention, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
