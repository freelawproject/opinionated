MacMahon, J., on two counts of possession of the contents of stolen mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court should have granted appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss both counts of the indictment on the ground that the Government\u2019s evidence failed to establish that the letters, whose contents defendant allegedly had in his possession, were stolen from the mails. We find that the district judge properly denied the motion and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">The Government\u2019s proof on the first count established that on April 21, 1971 Eutimio Vitullo mailed a cheek, drawn payable to \u201cTravel Agenda\u201d for the sum of $120, to Travel Agenda, 119 West 57 Street, Suite 1008, New York City. On the morning of April 23, 1971, a letter carrier brought a bundle of between 10 to 15 pieces of mail to that address. When he found the door to Suite 1008 locked, he left the bundle of mail on the floor of the hallway in front of the door. Travel Agenda, however, received no mail that morning and never received the letter from Vitullo. On April 28, 1971, defendant cashed the Vitullo check at a bank in New York City where he had previously opened an account under an assumed name.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">On the second count the Government submitted evidence that on May 11, 1971, Mary Grace placed a letter in a \u201cmail receptable\u201d or a \u201cbin\u201d in the lobby of 116 John Street, New York City. The letter, containing a check payable to Luis Anthony Levine for $90, was addressed to Laurie Levine, c/o Leonard Goldberg, 853 Seventh Avenue, New York City. The addressee, however, never received the letter. On May 19, 1971, defendant was arrested while attempting to cash the Levine check at another bank in New York City where he had also opened an account under an assumed name.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">Appellant argues that the Government\u2019s evidence failed to establish that either the Vitullo or the Levine check was the contents of stolen mail within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. Under that statute such a showing was necessary before defendant could be convicted of illegal possession of the two checks. We consider below appellant\u2019s arguments with respect to each check.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-20\">A. <em>The Vitullo check</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">Appellant\u2019s argument as to the first count presents an issue of statutory construction \u2014 whether a letter stolen after a postman has left it in front of the addressee\u2019s door is stolen mail under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>section 1708. The Government contends that section 1708 does reach such conduct, but it also argues that we need not decide that statutory question in this case. It claims that on the evidence submitted the district judge could properly have concluded that the Vitullo check was stolen before the letter carrier delivered the bundle of letters to Travel Agenda\u2019s front door. In support of this argument the Government relies on United States v. Hines, 256 F.2d 561 (2d Cir. 1958). There we held that a letter shown to have been \u201cproperly mailed and never received by the addressee, but found in quite improper and misusing hands, can be found to have been stolen from the mails in the absence of any other explanation being proffered.\u201d 256 F.2d at 564. When such facts are established it is reasonable to assume that the letter was stolen rather than inadvertently lost or misplaced by postal officials. But the Government\u2019s proof here, unlike that in <em>Hines, </em>showed not only that the letter was stolen but also that it might have been taken along with the other pieces of mail left outside Travel Agenda\u2019s door on April 23. Thus, while it might be possible to affirm on the basis of <em>Hines, </em>we have enough doubt about the correctness of doing so to go on to consider whether a letter left at the door would still be under the protection of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">To resolve that question we must turn to the statute itself, which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Whoever steals . . . from or out of any mail, post office, or station thereof, letter box, mail receptacle, or any mail route or other authorized depository for mail matter, or from a letter or mail carrier, any letter . . or .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">Whoever . . . unlawfully has in his possession, any letter ... or any article or thing contained therein, which has been so stolen . . . knowing the same to have been stolen</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">Shall be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. Defendant argues that section 1708 applies only to letters which are stolen from an \u201cauthorized depository for mail matter\u201d or a mail carrier. The Government, on the other hand, contends that the section has broader application. It claims that the Vitullo letter was stolen while it was in a \u201cmail route\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">While the statutory language is not without difficulties, we think the Vitullo letter was still within the custody of the Government, and thus protected by the statute, when it was left in front of Travel Agenda\u2019s door. The variety of terms employed in the statute indicates that it was broadly conceived to assure the proper functioning of the postal system. And the cases have so construed the statute. See, <em>e. g., </em>Rosen v. United States, 245 U.S. 467, 38 S.Ct. 148, 62 L.Ed. 406 (1918) (interpreting the predecessor to section 1708); Smith v. United States, 343 F.2d 539 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 861, 86 S.Ct. 122, 15 L.Ed.2d 99 (1965). In <em>Rosen </em>the Supreme Court held that unlocked \u201cboxes placed by tenants for the receipt of mail in the halls of buildings in which they had their places of business\u201d were \u201cauthorized depositor [ies] for mail matter\u201d within the meaning of the statute. 245 U.S. at 469, 38 S.Ct. at 149. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">The letters which were stolen did not reach the manual possession of the persons to whom they were addressed, but were taken from an authorized depository over which the act of Congress, by its express terms, extended its protection until its function had been served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">245 U.S. at 473, 38 S.Ct. at 151. Similarly, in <em>Smith </em>the court held that stealing letters from an unlocked box placed just inside the front door of a hotel and used for general delivery of mail to all residents violated section 1708 because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the box was a \u201cletter box ... or other authorized depository for mail matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Decisions such as <em>Rosen </em>and <em>Smith </em>illustrate the breadth of protection afforded the mails by the statute now before us. A fair reading of those cases, we think, requires the conclusion that Congress intended to protect mail left at the addressee's front door as well as letters left in the addressee\u2019s mail box. The federal interest in assuring that mail is received by the proper hands is the same in either case. We have no doubt, therefore, that the theft of the Vitullo letter violated the purposes of section 1708. The difficulty in this case, as we have already suggested, stems from the statutory language itself. The statutory term \u201cauthorized depository for mail matter,\u201d relied on in <em>Rosen </em>and <em>Smith, </em>is inapplicable to the facts of this case. Section 1708, however, does contain broader language, which could cover the theft of the Vitullo letter. The section forbids anyone from stealing from or out of \u201cany mail\u201d or \u201cany mail route.\u201d Cases construing the former term have not been frequent. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Inabnet, 41 F. 130 (D.S.C.1890). As to the phrase \u201cany mail route,\u201d this court has previously relied on that language in section 1708 in affirming a conviction under the statute. United States v. Collins, 349 F.2d 863, 866 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 960, 86 S.Ct. 1228, 16 L.Ed.2d 303 (1966). We confess, however, that we have found no authority construing \u201cmail route\u201d in the context of the facts here, and the legislative history of the term does indicate that its genesis was descriptive of the location of mail boxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the term is in the statute and has a common meaning, the core of which is the path or places where mail is collected and delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Despite the absence of clear authority covering the precise statutory issue before us, we think section 1708, when read in the light of its obvious legislative purpose, prohibited the theft of the Vitullo letter. While construing \u201cmail route\u201d or \u201cmail\u201d in the broadest sense might render some of the remaining portions of the statute superfluous in whole or in part, we see no need to go that far here. All we hold is that \u201cmail route\u201d and \u201cmail\u201d have an independent significance apart from mail box or receptacle; the former term at least includes a place such as an addressee\u2019s doorstep where mail is left by the letter carrier, and the latter term includes the letter so stolen. We believe this construction is in accord with the wise admonition of the court in <em>Smith </em>that in interpreting section 1708 a \u201cjudicial appraisal of the realities of delivering and receiving mail in a modern urban environment\u201d is required. 343 F.2d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">B. <em>The Levine cheek</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Defendant\u2019s second argument is that the Government\u2019s evidence on count 2 was insufficient to show that the Levine check was actually mailed before it was stolen. Defendant contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>stipulated testimony of Mary Grace that she \u201cmailed\u201d the check in a \u201cmail receptacle\u201d or \u201cbin\u201d located in the lobby of a building in New York City was insufficient to show that the letter was placed in an \u201cauthorized depository\u201d for mail and thus was brought within the custody of the Government. We disagree. The terms \u201cmail receptacle\u201d or \u201cauthorized depository for mail matter\u201d in section 1708 have been broadly defined by postal regulations. See 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 151.1 (1971).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The stipulated testimony, though admittedly meager, was sufficient to allow the inference that the check was placed in such a receptacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-22\">. Appellant received concurrent three year sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">. Section 1708 was enacted in 1948 as part of the comprehensive revision of the federal criminal laws. The brief legislative history dealing with the section indicates that it was based on what were formerly \u00a7\u00a7 317 and 321 of Title 18. U.S.Code Cong. Service, 80th Cong.2d Sess. (1948) (5 Legislative History Title 18, 2576). The history further reveals that the words \u201cletter box, mail receptacle, or any mail route\u201d in \u00a7 1708 were taken from \u00a7 321. The latter section, however, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">Whoever shall willfully or maliciously injure, tear down, or destroy any letter box or other receptable intended or used for the receipt or delivery of mail <em>on any mail route, </em>... or steal such mail from or out of such letter box or other receptacle . . . shall for every such offense be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more than three years. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">One wonders, after tracing the origin of the phrase \u201cor any mail route\u201d in \u00a7 1708, whether the substitution of the connective \u201cor\u201d for the preposition \u201con\u201d before the words \u201cmail route\u201d was intentional or the result of a slip of the legislative pen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\">. The regulation provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">(a) <em>Designation ds aMtliorimed depository. </em>Every letterbox or other receptacle intended or used for the receipt or delivery of mail on any city delivery route, rural delivery route, star route, or other mail route is designated an authorized depository for mail within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. sections 1702, 1705, and 1708.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-24\">(b) <em>Use for mail only. </em>Receptacles described in \u00a7 151.1(a) shall be used exclusively for mail ....</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
