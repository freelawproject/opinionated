She seeks judicial review of the finding of deportability by the Board of Immigration Appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\"> Petitioner objected to the receipt into evidence of certain hearsay documents without foundation testimony from live witnesses. The strict rules of evidence governing the admissibility of hearsay in judicial proceedings are not applicable to administrative hearings. Richardson v. Perales, 1971, 402 U.S. 389, 400, 402, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842; Navarrette-Navarrette v. Landon, 9 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 234, 237, cert. denied, 351 U.S. 911, 76 S.Ct. 700, 100 L.Ed. 1444. The documents which were admitted \u2014 an Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration form filled out by petitioner when she entered the United States and a Report of Investigation containing petitioner\u2019s registration as a prostitute with the Ely, Nevada, Police Department \u2014 were probative and their use was not fundamentally unfair so as to deprive petitioner of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-10\">The evidence presented at the deportation hearing was reasonable, substantial and probative, and supported a finding by the Board of Immigration Appeals that petitioner had engaged in prostitution and so was deportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
