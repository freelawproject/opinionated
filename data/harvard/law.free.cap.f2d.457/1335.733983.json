The ease is in federal court based on the diversity of citizenship of the parties. In the District Court, defendants Allied Chemical Corp. and Industrial Chemical Co. moved to dismiss the complaint, which motion was construed by the District Court as one for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 F.R.Civ.P., and was granted. Plaintiff has appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1398-16\">On August 9, 1968, plaintiff, Winston Hartwell, was seriously injured during the course of his employment. He was hospitalized, totally disabled for a time, and then returned to work. He allegedly sustained contusions and abrasions, a spinal injury and extensive scars on his arms, back, abdomen, hip, leg and foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-17\">The workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier for Allied and Industrial entered into an agreement with Hartwell whereby the insurance carrier paid hospital and medical expenses resulting from Hartwell\u2019s injury and benefits for the period during which Hartwell was totally disabled. Apparently not satisfied with this settlement, plaintiff commenced an action to recover workmen\u2019s compensation for the disfiguring scars on his body. The referee disallowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>claim, and while the appeal was pending before the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, plaintiff brought the present suit in the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">The question presented on this appeal is the scope of the exclusivity clause of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 77, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. The relevant section of the Act provides that when both the employer and employee have accepted the terms of the Act, it operates \u201cas a surrender by the parties thereto of their rights to any form or amount of compensation or damages for any injury or death occurring in the course of the employment, or to any method of determination thereof, other than as provided in article 3 of [the] act.\u201d Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 77 \u00a7 481. Actions at common law, therefore, for injuries occurring in the course of employment are not permitted. Hyzy v. Pittsburgh Coal Co., 384 Pa. 316, 121 A.2d 85 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">The thrust of plaintiff\u2019s argument is that because the Act does not specifically make compensable permanent sears and disfigurement to areas of the body other than the face, Pa.Stat. Ann., tit. 77 \u00a7 513, the legislature must have intended an exception to the exclusivity clause cited above in situations where the Act does not provide compensation. In support of his contention, plaintiff relies on several cases decided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court pursuant to the Occupational Diseases Act, Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 77 \u00a7\u00a7 1201 et seq. One example should suffice to demonstrate the inapplicability of those cases to the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">In Perez v. Blumenthal Bros. Chocolate Co., 428 Pa. 225, 237 A.2d 227 (1968), plaintiff contracted pulmonary emphysema while employed by the defendant, and commenced a common law trespass action against it. From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, the employer appealed, asserting that the Occupational Diseases Act gave rise to plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy. The exclusivity clause of the Occupational Diseases Act, Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 77 \u00a7 1403, is identical with that of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in all respects except one. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act applies to <em>\u201cany injury </em>or death occurring <em>in the course of the employment,\u201d </em>whereas the Occupational Diseases Act applies to \u201cany disability or death <em>resulting from occupational disease.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The Occupational Diseases Act, in section 1208, lists a number of ailments which are to be included within the term, \u201coccupational disease.\u201d In addition to the enumerated diseases, section 1208 (n) includes \u201cAll other occupational diseases (1) to which the claimant is exposed by reason of his employment, and (2) which are peculiar to the industry or occupation, and (3) which are not common to the general population.\u201d The disease from which the plaintiff in <em>Perez </em>suffered was not listed, nor did it fall within the clause just quoted. Since it therefore was not an \u201coccupational disease\u201d within the meaning of the Act, the Supreme Court held that the exclusivity clause of the Occupational Diseases Act could not constitute a bar to the common law action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-9\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, on the other hand, contains no such limitations on the phrase \u201cany injury or death occurring in the course of employment.\u201d \u201cThe courts have been consistent in holding that the remedy provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is exclusive of all common-law actions.\u201d Hyzy v. Pittsburgh Coal Co., <em>supra, </em>121 A.2d at 87 (citing cases). Plaintiff seeks to avoid the bar against common law actions set forth in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, by contending that because the particular injury suffered by him is not compensated by the Act, the term \u201cany injury\u201d cannot mean what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-10\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Scott v. C. E. Powell Coal Co., 402 Pa. 73, 166 A.2d 31 (1960), made clear that \u201cany injury\u201d was to be given its plain</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>meaning. In <em>Scott, </em>as a result of blasting, the plaintiff had been struck on the back of the head by a rock. His skull was fractured and he permanently lost his senses of'taste and smell. After collecting compensation for the eight week period during which he could not work, plaintiff then sued his employer under the common law to recover damages resulting from his loss of the senses of taste and smell. As a preliminary observation, the Supreme Court noted that the Act could be construed to compensate for the loss of these two senses even though no specific section provides for such compensation. Section 306(b) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Pa.Stat.Ann., tit. 77 \u00a7 512, permits compensation for loss of earning power because of a partial disability. The Court concluded that the injury sustained by plaintiff was contemplated by the Act, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-4\">\u201c[I]f the duties of his occupation require the use of his senses of taste or smell, and an accidental injury deprived him of those senses, then, necessarily, he is disabled for the performance of the duties of his occupation, and he would be entitled to compensation under the Act for such disability as reflected in his earnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-5\">*\u2022\u00bb*\u2022\u00bb**</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-6\">\u201cWe have ruled that when an employee sustains injuries which bring him within the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the question as to what amount he is compensated depends on the provisions of the Act, and if that measure yields him nothing, the assumption is that he is nevertheless satisfied with his agreement.\u201d Scott v. C. E. Powell Coal Co., <em>supra, </em>166 A.2d at 34.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-7\">The order dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s common law action was, therefore, affirmed, and the Court made clear that any injury sustained in the course of employment gave rise only to the remedy provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">The present case is really no different from <em>Scott. </em>Here the plaintiff has been compensated by his employers\u2019 insurance carrier for his medical expenses and loss of earnings. He suffered permanent disfigurement to his body, an injury not specifically compensable under the Act. Were the plaintiff a male model, it seems fairly clear that he would be entitled to compensation within the terms of the Act. Because his permanent partial disability does not affect his earning power, \u201cthe assumption is that he is nevertheless satisfied with his agreement.\u201d Scott v. C. E. Powell Coal Co., <em>supra, </em>166 A.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-9\">To reach a result other than barring the plaintiff from proceeding with his common law action would subvert the policy of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. In discussing that policy, this Court recently observed in O\u2019Neill v. United States, 450 F.2d 1012, 1017 (3d Cir. 1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-10\">\u201cBecause of certain provisions in the Pennsylvania Constitution, a compulsory workmen\u2019s compensation act is not permissible. Thus, the legislature enacted a voluntary compensation program in which the employer and employee must elect to participate. Not only would the result reached in Fisher and in the instant case be contrary to the spirit of the Act, it obviously would encourage employers to reject the Act. That he may no longer be immune to law suits even though he participates in and contributes to the compensation program would be a consideration of great weight to an employer. In this industrial age, a viable workmen\u2019s compensation law is a necessity as a matter of public policy.\u201d (footnotes omiitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-11\">If we were to permit recovery in this action, we also might be encouraging Pennsylvania employers to reject the Act. Such would be contrary to the clear intention of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-12\">Accordingly, the order of the District Court granting the employers\u2019 motion for summary judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">. Because the order of the district court granting summary judgment applied only to two of the three defendants, this court remanded the case to the district court for a certification of finality concerning Allied Chemical Corp. and Industrial Chemical Co. \u2014 the present appellees\u2014 pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 54(b). By order dated February 19, 1972, the district court granted the certification nunc pro tunc thereby vesting this court with jurisdiction over the appeal. Plaintiff\u2019s suit against Aloyco, Inc., is still pending in the district court and is not a part of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1399-11\">.
