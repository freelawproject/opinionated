A third defense witness, Jordan, testified it was he who had met with Agent Ford but claimed his Fifth Amendment privilege when questioned about the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-20\">On cross-examination the Government confronted Jefferies with three state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>ments, consistent with the testimony of the narcotics agent, in which Jeffries positively identified Briggs as the seller. When asked by the Government if he remembered signing them, Jefferies said that Agents Milano and Teresi had given him papers to sign, that he was told to sign in the name of Jones, that he had not read the papers, and that the statements in them were not true. In rebuttal Agents Bush, Teresi and Ford testified that the agents had prepared the statements and that they were read to Jefferies before he signed them. The court allowed them to be introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The Government contends that these statements were admissible as affirmative proof, on the basis that by our decisions in United States v. Kahaner, 317 F.2d 459, 473-474 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 835, 84 S.Ct. 62, 11 L.Ed. 2d 65 (1963), and United States v. Desisto, 329 F.2d 929, 932-934 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 979, 84 S.Ct. 1885, 12 L.Ed.2d 747 (1964), \u201cthe rule limiting the use of prior inconsistent statements as affirmative evidence was abandoned insofar as such statements were signed and sworn to by the declarant, as was the situation at <em>present.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If the district court had preceded on any such theory, it would have been in error. We cannot understand how the Government can misread these cases so egregiously. <em>Kahaner </em>approved application of the \u201corthodox\u201d rule that prior inconsistent statements, even grand jury testimony as in that case, can be used only for impeachment, although indicating possible receptivity to a change. In <em>De Sisto </em>we departed from that rule to the limited extent of allowing prior inconsistent trial or grand jury testimony of a witness who was subject to cross-examination at the trial to be used as affirmative evidence. Three months before the instant trial we made the limited scope of <em>De Sisto </em>clear beyond peradventure in United States v. Cunningham, 446 F.2d 194, 197-198 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 950, 92 S.Ct. 302, 30 L.Ed.2d 266 (1971), rejecting the very argument here made by the Government.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">However, our rejection of the Government\u2019s argument does not carry the day for Briggs. Chief Judge Henderson did not proceed on the erroneous basis for which the Government contends. He told the jury that \u201cthe only reason these statements come in at all is under the rule of law that the jury is entitled to hear any alleged inconsistent statement, allegedly inconsistent to what the witness has testified on the stand here\u201d; that \u201c[i]f one of your neighbors told you one thing one day and the next day told a seriously changed story about the same subject matter, in the nature of things, you would question the believability of such a neighbor\u201d; and that this was \u201cthe only purpose\u201d for which the statements had been received. While this seems clear enough, the judge would doubtless have made the point even clearer if he had been asked.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\"> There is equally little merit in Briggs\u2019 objection to the court\u2019s allowing an agent to testify that, despite his denials on cross-examination, Jeffries had said on two occasions that Briggs had threatened his life if he did not testify in an exculpatory manner. Whether the receipt of such threats be characterized as showing \u201cbias,\u201d or \u201ccorruption,\u201d or \u201cinterest,\u201d their relevance as impeaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Jefferies\u2019 testimony is too apparent to require argument. It is plain that impeachment of this sort is not limited to cross-examination. See United States v. Lester, 248 F.2d 329, 334-335 (2 Cir. 1957); 3A Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 948 (Chadbourn rev. 1970); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 40 at 85-86 (1954). No doubt this evidence was \u201cprejudicial\u201d to Briggs in the sense that if the jury believed the agent, the evidence would tend strongly toward conviction. But it was also highly probative on the credit to be given the turncoat informer. This is not the kind of \u201cprejudice\u201d against which the law of evidence can or should protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Little need be said with respect to Briggs\u2019 claim that the two months delay between his sales to the agent and his arrest deprived him of a speedy trial. No specific prejudice was alleged, except a dimming of his own recollection exactly where he was on the two nights in question and the possible dimming of that of others who might have provided an alibi. Insofar as the argument is grounded on the provision in the Sixth Amendment that.\u201cin all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,\u201d it is set at rest by United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). As Mr. Justice White there made plain, the constitutional provision governing delay in arrest or indictment is rather the much broader standard of the due process clause. Recognizing that a decision whether the defendant has been denied due process \u201cwill necessarily involve a delicate judgment based on the circumstances of each ease,\u201d the Court sufficiently indicated the unlikelihood that it would be impressed with one like this;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-6\">Actual prejudice to the defense of a criminal case may result from the shortest and most necessary delay; and no one suggests that every delay-caused detriment to a defendant\u2019s case should abort a criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The Government tells us the relatively short delay in arrest was caused by a desire to catch other fish in its net, a legitimate consideration in law enforcement. Absent any contrary Supreme Court precedent, our decision in United States v. Capaldo, 402 F.2d 821, 823 (2 Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 989, 89 S.Ct. 1476, 22 L.Ed.2d 764 (1969), is <em>a fortiori </em>authority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Finally, appellant lists no less than eleven points in which the prosecutor\u2019s summation allegedly transgressed proper standards. Only two of these were the subject of objection. When the prosecutor speculated that perhaps the defense was giving Jefferies, an admitted addict, \u201csome free stuff to keep him going until after this trial,\u201d the judge admonished that there was \u201cno evidence whatever in this case about such a practice.\u201d The prosecutor also said Agent Teresi had testified to a statement by Briggs to him that if Jefferies testified against Briggs and Briggs was convicted, Jefferies was going to die. When defense counsel objected, the judge said he remembered no such testimony by Agent Teresi, told the jury to disregard the remark, and asked the prosecutor to correct it. The prosecutor stated that what he had meant was that Agent Milano had testified that Agent Teresi had recounted such a statement by Briggs. This was true; the otherwise inadmissible hearsay had been elicited on cross-examination of Milano. So far as these two items are concerned, we find no sufficient basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\"> We recognize that this is not the whole story. Although the general rule is that \u201cthe burden is on the defendant to take his objection at the earliest possible opportunity when, by so doing he can enable the trial judge to take the most efficacious action,\u201d Holden v. United States, 388 F.2d 240, 242-243 (1 Cir. 1968) cert. denied, 393 U.S. 864, 89 S.Ct. 146, 21 L.Ed.2d 132 (1968); United States v. Nasta, 398 F.2d 283, 285 (2 Cir. 1968) ; Crumpton v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>States, 138 U.S. 361, 363-364, 11 S.Ct. 355, 34 L.Ed. 958 (1891), a prosecutor\u2019s summation may be so permeated with impropx\u00faeties that defense counsel may legitimately consider constant objection during the summation to be useless and even detrimental. However, even in such extreme cases there would seem to be no reason why he should not be required to bring the matter to the judge\u2019s attention, outside the presence of the jury, at the end of the summation, so that the court can consider whether to attempt curative instructions or to declaim a mistrial, see United States v. Socony-Vaeuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 237-243, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940), rather than gamble on obtaining an acquittal. When defense counsel has failed even to do that, an appellate court will reverse only if the summation was so \u201cextremely inflammatory and prejudicial,\u201d United States v. DeAlesandro, 361 F.2d 694, 697 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 842, 87 S.Ct. 94, 17 L.Ed.2d 74 (1966), that allowing the verdict to stand would \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936). See also New York Central R.R. v. Johnson, 279 U.S. 310, 318-319, 49 S.Ct. 300, 73 L.Ed. 706 (1929); San Antonio v. Timko, 368 F.2d 983, 986 (2 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">While the summation may have approached this level, it did not reach it. We cannot indeed understand why, after the many admonitions from this court, see, e. g., United States v. Johnson, 331 F.2d 281, cert. denied, Pheribo v. United States, 379 U.S. 905, 85 S.Ct. 196, 13 L.Ed.2d 178 (1964); United States v. Hestie, 439 F.2d 131, 132 (2 Cir. 1971); United States v. Leeds, 457 F.2d 857, 860, 861 (2 Cir. 1972), and others, see ABA Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function \u00a7 5.8(b) and authorities cited at p. 128, a prosecutor should make such a remark as \u201cI believe these agents, I have no doubts in my mind.\u201d However, careful examination of the summation indicates that on many of the points listed by appellant as objectionable, the remarks wex'e legitimate argument and that, on others, the degree of departure from proper norms has been considerably exaggerated. On x'eading the summation as a whole in the light of that defense counsel and the court\u2019s instructions, we do not find such \u201cplain error\u201d as to warrant the grant of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Affix-med.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-12\">. Defense counsel had apprised the Government, after the indictment, of Jefferies\u2019 denial. By agreement Jefferies was produced for examination by the Assistant United States Attorney; later his exculpatory testimony was recorded before the grand jury. Also, by agreement of counsel, a lineup was conducted before a magistrate, with defense counsel producing all the participants. Narcotics Agent Ford identified defendant Briggs. Counsel are to be commended for this cooperation. The success of the lineup from the Government\u2019s standpoint underscores our recent observation that \u201cprosecutors <em>might </em>well consider whether they would not only better protect the rights of the defendant but save themselves much needless argument if, in a case like this, where the defendant was in custody and there was no time pressure, they would have a properly conducted lineup.\u201d United States v.
