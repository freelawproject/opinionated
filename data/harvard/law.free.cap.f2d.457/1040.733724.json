Railex sued Speed Check for the alleged infringement of Railex\u2019s patent on a conveyor used for the selective dispatching of garments. From the district court\u2019s decision holding the patent invalid and not infringed, this appeal results. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Railex holds Patent No. 3,118,531.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The patent describes a system for conveying and dispatching garments or laundry selectively to any one of several stations located throughout a plant. In a laundry or dry cleaning plant several distinct operations may be performed on a garment during the process of cleaning. Similarly, different fabrics may be cleaned by distinct methods or with various cleaning agents. Each operation will take place at a different location within a single plant. The patented system facilitates the transporting of garments to appropriate locations within the plant and the selective discharge of the garments at the appropriate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">The patented conveyor-dispatcher consists of a chain of links, all substantially identical in shape. Each link is flat and elongated. The links are connected to each other to form an endless moving belt. The lower part of the link consists of a series of hook-like fingers at graduated levels used for the carrying of garments. Each hook level represents a specific station within the plant. At each station there is a rod mounted at the precise level of the appropriate hook which dispatches the garments for that station. Each link is approximately one foot long and has hooks to serve six stations. A worker can place a garment on a hook and cause the garment to be conveyed to a particular station in the plant and automatically dispatched at that station. The operator always has a link in front of him, since the links are interconnected and form the conveyor belt, and can easily choose the correct hook which corresponds with the desired station.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">On October 7, 1964, Railex sued Speed Check for the alleged infringement by Speed Check of the conveyor-dispatcher patent. Speed Check denied infringement and asserted that the Railex patent was invalid in view of the prior art and because Speed Check\u2019s president was allegedly the inventor of the patented system. The action was tried from October 14 through October 17, 1969. On December 11, 1970, the district court issued an \u201cOrder\u201d, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, holding the patent invalid and the patent not infringed. Railex appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">At the outset, we meet Railex\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s finding should not be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard of Rule <em>52.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Railex points out that the district judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>waited until fourteen months after the conclusion of the trial to issue his ruling. The district judge\u2019s findings were adopted, almost verbatim, from proposed findings submitted by Speed Check at the request of the judge. Railex argues that in these circumstances the district court's findings \u201cshould not be accorded that respect normally accorded findings under Rule 52\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The clearly erroneous standard of review is applicable to findings of fact in a patent case. <em>See </em>Phillip\u2019s Petroleum Co. v. Sid Richardson Carbon &amp; Gasoline Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 10, 12; American Seating Co. v. Southeastern Metals Co., 5 Cir. 1969, 412 F.2d 756, 758. Although, as we have stated, \u201cfindings and conclusions which represent the independent judicial labors and study of the district judge are more helpful to this Court\u201d, Kinnear-Weed Corp. v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., 5 Cir. 1958, 259 F.2d 398, 401, \u201c[nevertheless, the same test is applied to findings, whether the court prepared them or adopted those submitted by counsel\u201d. Edward Valves v. Cameron Iron Works, 5 Cir. 1961, 289 F.2d 355, 356. In Louis Dreyfus &amp; C. I. E. v. Panama Canal Co., 5 Cir. 1962, 298 F.2d 733, we discussed, at length, the contention that findings adopted by the court from proposed findings submitted by the parties should not be reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. Noting that \u201cin analyzing the significance that should be attached to the adoption by the trial judge of findings drafted by one of the litigants, common sense may be a better guide than ideal decision-making\u201d, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-5\">We disapprove of the practice of a trial judge\u2019s uncritically accepting proposed findings, but this unfortunate practice does not erase the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule. , . . When substantial evidence supports a finding it will not be found clearly erroneous merely because the expression of the finding was adopted from a proposal by counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-11\"><em>See also </em>Lorenz v. General Steel Products Co., 5 Cir. 1964, 337 F.2d 726; 2B Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, Rules Ed., \u00a7 1124, p. 494; 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 52.06 [3], pp. 2664-2665. The Supreme Court is in accord. \u201c[Fjindings, though not the product of the workings of the district judge\u2019s mind, are formally his; they are not to be rejected out-of-hand, and they will stand if supported by evidence.\u201d United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 1964, 376 U.S. 651, 656, 84 S.Ct. 1044, 1047, 12 L.Ed.2d 12, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-12\">On this record, we find no reason to discredit the district judge\u2019s assertion that his ruling was made \u201cafter considering . . . [the] issues and the evidence\u201d and that he \u201cconsidered the pleadings, briefs, proposed findings of fact, proposed conclusions of law and arguments of both parties\u201d before issuing his order. Nor can we say that various errors in the rulings indicate a lack of understanding of the case on the part of the district judge. Although, as we stated in <em>Edward Valves, </em>we disapprove of the practice of unconditionally adopting findings submitted by one of the parties to the litigation, we affirm our holdings that the findings must be tested by the standard of review mandated by Rule 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-16\">Federal statutes delineate specific requirements for patentability. Relevant to the present case are the requirements that the patented invention be \u201cnew and useful\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201cnon-obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>ous\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, a statutory presumption governs this Court\u2019s review of patent validity. \u201cA patent shall be presumed valid. The burden of establishing invalidity of a patent shall rest on a party asserting it.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The presumption of patent validity is re-buttable. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282; Radio Corp. of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, 1934, 293 U.S. 1, 55 S.Ct. 928, 79 L.Ed. 163.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1105-15\">The courts, however, have not distinguished themselves for consistency in their determination of the quantum of proof necessary to rebut the presumption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> . . . We do not attempt to resolve this apparent inconsistency. Rather, we state that the presumption of patent validity may be rebutted only by a quantum of proof \u2014 whether it be called clear and convincing or beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>doubt \u2014 which is greater than a mere preponderance of the evidence. One who seeks to rebut the presumption bears a heavy burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Hobbs v. United States, 5 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 849, 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">The district court held that the Railex patent was invalid because (1) the patented system was anticipated by the prior art, <em>see </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-102, (2) the patented system did not result from \u201cinvention\u201d, <em>see </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, and (3) the patented system was not invented by the patent holder, <em>see </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">Railex argues that the conveyor-dispatcher system represents a significant improvement over the prior art and is, thus, patentable under the statutory standards. The most pertinent prior art is, according to Railex, the chain-hook dispatcher, a motor-driven chain carrying depending hooks spaced several feet apart. Railex contends that this device is noisy because of many moving parts, limited in its capacity because of the spacing between hooks, difficult to load because the relationship between hook and station is difficult to discern, and inefficient because of the wasted time inherent in the gaps between hooks. The system patented by Railex, because of alleged improvements on prior art, is not noisy, allows for increased capacity, is easily loaded, and is more efficient. This is so, Railex argues, because of the duality of function performed by the links \u2014 each link embodies a complete set of fingers and constitutes part of the chain \u2014 and the interconnection of the links. The noise is reduced because there are fewer moving parts; capacity is increased because there are more, closely-spaced hooks; loading is easy because the operator can easily discern the hook corresponding to the desired station ; and efficiency is increased because the operator always has one of the interconnected hooks before him. As appellant \u2014 correctly, we think \u2014 asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH9q\">The heart of the patented invention is in the configuration of the links and the interconnection between them. The links perform the dual function of constituting the chain, as there is no interconnecting member between them, nor are the links carried by any other member; the links also serve the function of carrying the garments on one .of the fingers to the particular station identified by the level of that finger. The link is free of any moving parts and is, therefore, noiseless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-8\">Further, by reason of its unique shape, each link includes a complete series of fingers which can be readily apprehended by the operator at a single glance. The operator is thus provided with a complete \u201cmap\u201d of the plant since each finger represents to her one of the several stations to which garments can be dispatched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-9\">Because the links are directly connected together so that there is no space between them, the operator <em>always </em>has a link in front of her. The significant advantage of this feature of the patented system is that the operator is never required to wait for the appropriate finger to arrive; it is always there before her on each link. Thus, placing a garment on the correct finger for dispatch to the appropriate operating station is reduced to utter simplicity, permitting the more efficient use of unskilled labor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-10\">The patented system is simple, relatively noiseless, relatively inexpensive to manufacture and maintain, and extremely efficient. Its capacity to dispatch to many widely separated stations is substantially greater than any of the prior systems, and, significantly, the patented system may be loaded at any station for dispatch to any other station. These singular advantages of the patented conveyor are responsible for its being the only commercially successful system on the market, and the standard of the industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-11\">The district court held: \u201cNone of the elements or principles revealed or employed in the patent were novel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>None of the elements or principles revealed or employed in the patent are employed or used in any novel manner, nor do they produce any novel or unexpected result.\u201d We agree. First, \u201ca conveyor comprising an endless rail, article carrying means mounted for movement longitudinally along said rail and comprising an endless series of rigid links disposed in end-to-end relation and pivotally connected to each other at their respective adjacent ends for pivotal movement in vertical and horizontal planes\u201d is not \u201cnew\u201d within the meaning of the patent statute. <em>See </em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101-102. The patent office cited No. 2,661,828 to Vogt,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No. 2,953,240 to Ni-grelli, No. 2,609,083 to Leach, and No. 2,899,072 to Weiss<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in rejecting this element of the patent. These patents reveal a conveyor comprising an endless rail with article carrying means mounted for movement longitudinally along the rail. The patent to Weiss (see foot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>note 8) and the patent to Nigrelli reveal a conveyor comprising an endless series of rigid links connected end-to-end and allowing for movement in vertical and horizontal planes. No. 865,263 to Moe,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No. 1,874,042 to Hoefen,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and No. 2,897,951 to Jonson<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> are also pertinent prior art revealing this element of the Railex patent. In addition, certain \u201ccall-office\u201d conveyors, not made known to the patent office examiner, were introduced at trial in the district court. These conveyors too anticipate this element of the Railex patent. The district court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1108-4\">A conveyor comprising an endless rail with article carrying means mounted for movement longitudinally along the rail and comprising an endless series of rigid links disposed in end-to-end relation and pivotally connected to each other at their respective adjacent ends for movement in vertical and horizontal planes, a plurality of said links being disposed in a vertical plane, as described in the patent was not a novel revelation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">This finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">Second, the next element of the patented system \u2014 \u201ca plurality of said links each having each link being disposed in a vertical plane, a similar series of article carrying hooks integral with the companion link and spaced from each other longitudinally of said rail, at least a pair of said hooks of each link being at different levels, respectively\u201d- \u2014 is not \u201cnew\u201d as is required by the patent stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>ute. Patent No. 2,834,475 to Reich,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No. 865,263 to Moe (see footnote 9), and the \u201ccall-office\u201d conveyors reveal article carrying hooks integral with the article carrying means. Also relevant are the patents to Vogt (see footnote 7), to Jonson (see footnote 11), and French Patent No. 1,131,860. The district court\u2019s finding that \u201c[i]t was not novel to provide that the links of the conveyor sould serve a dual function of providing a drive chain and of serving as article carrying means\u201d is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Finally, the article removal means\u2014 \u201c[a] series of longitudinally spaced operating means positioned along the path of movement of said hooks for article removal operation with selected ones only of said hooks for selective removal of the articles carried thereby, one of said operating means being at a level corresponding to the level of one of said hooks of each of said pairs of hooks of each series of hooks and in position for operation with respect to said one hook only, and another of said operating means being at a different level corresponding to the level of the other of said hooks of each of said pairs of hooks of each series of hooks and in position for operation with respect to said other hook only\u201d \u2014 is not novel. The principle of providing selective discharge from a conveyor by varying the heights of the carrying elements of the conveyor so as to correspond with the height of an independent article removal device is illustrated by No. 1,308,391 to Bell,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and No. 386,314 to Green.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor is the principle of ar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>tide removal novel. See No. 865,263 to Moe (footnote 9), No. 1,775,545 to Anderson,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and British Patent No. 791,-276. The district court correctly found that \u201c[t]he principle of Claim One for the obtaining of selective discharge from a conveyor by providing a carrying element with hooks at different levels to cooperate with article removal means at corresponding levels was not novel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Conceivably the Railex patent may have been allowed as a combination claim. The history of the patent application reveals that the claims of the patent were rejected on four occasions; each element was held to be anticipated by the prior art. Only when the applicant argued patentability of a \u201ccombination\u201d was the patent allowed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The allegedly patentable combination, however, as well as the allegedly novel result produced by that combination, are anticipated by the prior art, including No. 2,897,951 to Jonson (see footnote 11), No. 1,775,545 to Anderson (see footnote 15), and No. 2,872,057 to Wagner.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Machine Co. v. Murphy, 1878, 97 U.S. 120, 24 L.Ed. 935; United States v. Adams, 1965, 383 U.S. 39, 86 S.Ct. 708, 15 L.Ed.2d 572; Sterner Lighting Co. v. Allied Electrical Supply Co., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 539. We agree with the finding of the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1110-12\">The combination of old elements and principles employed in the patent does not employ such elements and principles in a novel or unusual manner nor do the elements perform a function different than theretofore performed, nor does the combination perform in a novel and unexpected manner to produce a novel and unexpected result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1110-13\"><em>See </em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Co., 1950, 340 U.S. 147, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-14\">The findings of the district court as to the lack of novelty in the elements of the Railex patent and the combination of those elements are not clearly erroneous. Substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that the conveyor-dispatcher was anticipated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>by the prior art.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion as to the invalidity of the Railex patent, we need not and do not reach the secondary tests of non-obviousness, (see Graham v. John Deere Co., 1966, 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545), the defense of prior inventorship, or the issue of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">.
