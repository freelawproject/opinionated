The tax deficiencies were based on the failure to report $54,835.00 in gain for the taxable year 1962. Plaintiffs maintain that the gain in question is covered by the nonrecognition provisions of Code Section 1033.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As pointed out below, we agree with the ruling of the Tax Court that \u00a7 703 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that the nonrecognition of gain election and replacement under \u00a7 1033 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>be made by Kin-Bro Realty, a partnership, and that the replacements by plaintiffs individually were thus ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The facts, as stipulated in the proceedings before the Tax Court, show that Anne and Mabel Demirjian<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> each owned 50% of the stock of Kin-Bro Realty Corporation, which had acquired title to a three-story office building in Newark, New Jersey, in October 1944. On November 3, 1960, the corporation was dissolved and its chief asset, the office building, was conveyed by deed to \u201cAnne Demirjian . . . and Mabel Demirjian . . . partners trading as Kin-Bro Real Estate Company.\u201d Although no formal partnership agreement was executed, Anne and Mabel did file a trade name certificate indicating that they intended to conduct a real estate investment business at the Newark office building under the name of Kin-Bro Real Estate Company. The office building, which constituted Kin-Bro\u2019s sole operating asset, was conveyed to the Newark Housing Authority on September 12, 1962, after an involuntary condemnation proceeding. In the deed of conveyance the grantors are listed as \u201cAnne De-mirjian and Mabel Demirjian, partners trading as Kin-Bro Real Estate Company.\u201d The net proceeds of the sale were distributed to Anne and Mabel in amounts equal to approximately 50% of the total sale price.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At this point, both Anne and Mabel apparently elected to replace the property with equivalent property in order to take advantage of the nonrecognition of gain provision contained in \u00a7 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code. Normally gain resulting from the sale or exchange of investment real property is taxable,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but \u00a7 1033 provides that if property is involuntarily converted and the proceeds are used to replace it with substantially equivalent property within one year, then gain is recognized only to the extent that the amount received due to the conversion exceeds the purchase price of the replacement property. The reinvestments, however, were made by Anne and Mabel as individuals and not through the partnership.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On April 15, 1963, Anne invested $40,934.05 of her share of the proceeds in property which was similar to the condemned property. Mabel was unable to find suitable replacement property within the one-year replacement period,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, by letter of October 17, 1963, she made a written application to the District Director of Internal Revenue, Newark, New Jersey, for an extenstion of time in which to make such a replacement. In a letter dated January 16, 1964, the District Director stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-13\">\u201cIn a letter dated October 17, 1963 received from Mr. Ralph Niebart and subsequent correspondence, an extension of time was requested for the purpose of replacing your share of the partnership property that was owned by Kin-Bro Real Estate Company (a partnership). The property was sold to the Housing Authority of the City of Newark on September 12, 1962 under threat of condemnation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-14\">\u201cYou have stated that although you have made a continued effort to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>place the converted property, you have not been successful to date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">* * * *- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">\u201cBased on the information submitted, together with the data already in our file, extension is hereby granted until December 31, 1964, within which to complete the replacement of the converted property.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On February 7, 1964, Mabel invested $45,711.17 in similar real estate. Neither Anne nor Mabel reported any portion of the gain realized on the condemnation sale in their initial returns for the 1962 tax year. In 1964 Anne and Mabel filed amended 1962 joint returns with their husbands, reporting the excess of their distributive share from the condemnation sale over the cost of their respective replacement property as long-term capital gains.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disagreed with these computations and assessed deficiencies <footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>reasoning that the \u00a7 1033 election for nonrecognition of gain and replacement with equivalent property could only be made by the partnership under the terms of \u00a7 703(b) of the Code.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Tax Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s finding of deficiencies and plaintiffs here appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">In reviewing a decision of the Tax Court, this court is normally limited in its scope of review by the clearly erroneous test of Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, in cases such as the instant action, where the facts have been fully stipulated and no testimony was taken,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals may, within certain limits, substitute its factual conclusions and inferences for those of the Tax Court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">Petitioners\u2019 first contention on this appeal is that the Newark office building was owned by Anne and Mabel as tenants in common, not as partners, and that, therefore, the \u00a7 1033 nonrecognition of gain election and replacement was properly made by them in their individual capacities as co-tenants. On the basis of the record before the Tax Court, we find that the property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>question was owned by Kin-Bro Realty, a partnership,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> composed of Anne and Mabel Demirjian.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is noted that several federal cases have ruled that taxpayers such as petitioners who represent, in their dealings with the Internal Revenue Service, that property is owned by a partnership are bound by such representations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">Petitioners next contend that even if the office building was owned by the partnership, the election and replacement with equivalent property under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1033(a) (3) were properly made by them in their capacity as individual partners. We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s determination that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 703(b) requires that the election and replacement under \u00a7 1033 be made by the partnership and that replacement by individual partners of property owned by the partnership does not qualify for nonrecognition of the gain.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>703(b) provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that any election which affects the computation of taxable income derived from a partnership must be made by the partnership.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The election for nonrecognition of gain on the involuntary conversion of property would affect such computation and is the type of election contemplated by \u00a7 703(b). The partnership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> treat a partnership as an aggregate of its members for purposes of taxing profits to the individual members and as an entity for purposes of computing and reporting income.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In light of this entity approach to reporting income, Congress included \u00a7 703(b) to avoid the possible confusion which might result if each partner were to determine partnership income separately only on his own return for his own purposes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To avoid the possible confusion which could result from separate elections under \u00a7 1033(a), the election must be made by the partnership as an entity, and the failure of the partnership to so act results in the recognition of the gain on the sale of partnership property.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"> Petitioners\u2019 final contention is that the Commissioner is estopped from denying that a valid election and replacement were made under \u00a7 1033. Two separate grounds for estoppel are alleged. The first ground, that the petitioners have conformed their conduct to existing interpretations of the law and the Commissioner may not \u201cinvoke a retroactive interpretation to the taxpayer\u2019s detriment,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> is clearly without merit. The second alleged ground is that the Commissioner is estopped by the implicit approval of the individual partner\u2019s election and replacement by the District Director for Newark in his letter of January 16, 1964.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even if we were to accept the letter as a justifiable basis for detrimental reliance, petitioners have demonstrated no such reliance<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and, furthermore, the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>trine of estoppel does not prevent the Commissioner from correcting errors of law.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the September 1, 1970, orders of the Tax Court, in accordance with its opinion of that date, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-9\">.

Mere co-ownership of property which is maintained, kept in repair, and rented or leased does not constitute a partnership. . . . Tenants in common, however, may be partners if they actively carry on a trade, business, financial operation, or venture and divide the profits thereof. For example, a partnership exists if co-owners of an apartment building lease space and in addition provides services to the occupants either directly or through an agent.\u201d Applying the facts as outlined in footnote 17, supra, we find that a partnership existed. <em>See </em>Rothenberg v.

The facts, when taken together, establish the intent of Anne and Mabel to conduct their real estate business as a partnership. <em>See </em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

We believe that the various amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, cited by the amicus curiae (brief at 7-13), designed to expand the scope of nonrecognition of gain on involuntarily converted property culminating in P.L. 91-646, 84 Stat. 1894 (1971), require the conclusion that Congress is able and desirous of giving relief to taxpayers in such situations by its own statutory enactments and the courts should not usurp the function of Congress in this field. Furthermore, nonrecognition could have been achieved in this situation under the applicable congressional provisions of the Tax Code if the partnership had made the replacement contemplated by \u00a7. 1033(a).
