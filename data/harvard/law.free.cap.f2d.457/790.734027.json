The date is important, because it was more than one year after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision setting out guidelines for the acceptance of guilty pleas per Rule 11, Fed.R.Crim.P. McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">We believe it is our duty to review the record for compliance with Rule 11, although petitioner did not specifically raise the McCarthy issue in his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 petition (nor did the U.S. Attorney call it to our attention). United States v. Briscoe, 428 F.2d 954 (8th Cir. 1970); <em>cf. </em>Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). <em>Contra, </em>Fields v. United States, 438 F.2d 205 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 907, 91 S.Ct. 2214, 29 L.Ed.2d 684 (1971). This duty is a corollary to the \u201cplain-error\u201d rule enunciated in Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 107, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945), that a reviewing court must take note of fundamental errors on its own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">At the plea hearing, the district judge questioned the petitioner on the following topics: whether he understood that he was choosing between entering a guilty plea in Indiana and standing trial in California, where the information and indictment had been returned; whether he had read the information and indictment ; and whether he had discussed the nature of the offenses and the maximum penalties with his appointed lawyer. The judge told petitioner what his rights would be if he stood trial in California, informed him of the maximum penalties, and explained that a guilty plea would be an admission of what was stated in the charges against him. The judge then accepted petitioner\u2019s pleas of guilty to all 12 counts against him and pronounced an executed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\"> The judge made no inquiry as to petitioner\u2019s understanding of the nature of the charges, as <em>McCarthy </em>requires. Nor did he meet a second <em>McCarthy </em>requirement, investigating the factual basis of the plea. Reading the indictment and asking whether a defendant has discussed the charge with his attorney does not satisfy <em>McCarthy. </em>United States v. Cody, 438 F.2d 287 (8th Cir. 1971). The judge also failed to question petitioner as to the voluntariness of his plea, whether it was the result of threats or promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">Petitioner in his \u00a7 2255 petition attacked his guilty plea on the basis that his attorney promised he would get probation, and that a probation officer told him most defendants in situations like his got probation if they pleaded guilty. We need not consider this somewhat dubious claim, however, because the transcript of the hearing reveals that the dictates of <em>McCarthy </em>were not followed and that petitioner must have a second opportunity to plead to these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>We therefore reverse the dismissal of the \u00a7 2255 petition and set aside petitioner\u2019s guilty pleas. Following the <em>McCarthy </em>procedure, we remand the case for a hearing at which petitioner may plead anew.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
