Young\u2019s attack on his conviction and sentence is one of many 2255 motions we have considered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-30\">The trial court in this case determined that petitioner\u2019s claims were based essentially on the same grounds previously raised and denied by this Court. His claim that the convicting court did not comply with Rule 11 in accepting his guilty plea was refuted by this Court in Young v. United States, 423 F.2d 677 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 915, 90 S.Ct. 2221, 26 L.Ed.2d 574 (1970); and his claim that he was not properly advised of his right to counsel was fully answered in Young v. United States, 228 F.2d 693 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 351 U.S. 913, 76 S.Ct. 704, 100 L.Ed. 1447 (1956). The trial court then denied the motion on the basis of that part of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 which provides: \u201cThe sentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We have carefully considered the allegations of the petitioner in light of the earlier cases and agree with Judge Davies that the points raised in this ease are essentially the same as those raised and decided by us on earlier motions. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-23\">. Young v.
