Mrs. High testified for the government, and two witnesses corroborated portions of her story. There was nothing inherently improbable about her testimony. There was an adequate showing of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-27\">Morgan asserts here that the search of Mrs. High which produced the heroin was improper because he says the customs man lacked \u201ca real suspicion.\u201d Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the search of Mrs. High was illegal, Morgan made no motion to suppress the evidence produced by the search, and he voiced no adequate objection at the time the heroin was received in evidence. The objection made here for the first time, under the circumstances of this case, comes too late.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
