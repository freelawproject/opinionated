The NHSB order, dated November 4, 1970, directed GM to notify all current owners of certain model pickup trucks that the wheels thereon supplied by GM contained a \u201cdefect which relates to motor vehicle safety\u201d within the meaning of the National Traffic &amp; Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq. GM instituted this action within 5 days after receipt of the NHSB order. Thereafter, the NHSB instituted an enforcement action in the District of Columbia district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">GM\u2019s complaint invoked the following jurisdictional grounds: (1) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 and the Declaratory Judgment Act,. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201; and (2) the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. And in the order dismissing the complaint the sole ground recited therefor was \u201clack of jurisdiction.\u201d In its opinion the district court first discussed the jurisdictional requirements of the Declaratory Judgment Act and the APA separately in relation to the facts of this litigation. It then merged consideration of both jurisdictional bases in discussing the broad issue of \u201cthe adequacy of the enforcement proceeding for protection of GM\u2019s rights . . .\u201d 321 F.Supp. at 1124. The necessity for such an analysis stemmed both \u201cfrom the language of \u00a7 704 [of the APA and] from general equitable principles applicable to the granting of injunctive relief and declaratory judgments]. . . .\u201d Id. at 1124-1125. The district court labeled this discussion \u201cRipeness.\u201d However, we do not view this case as involving a consideration of that concept in the jurisdictional sense suggested by Abbott Lab. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). See also United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192, 197, 76 S.Ct. 763, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956). Rather we think the court had jurisdiction and the issue was whether it chose to exercise jurisdiction under either Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Indeed, early in its opinion the court concluded that \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 [was] a proper jurisdictional basis for this action.\u201d Id. at 1122. The court thus realized that it had \u201cbare\u201d jurisdiction to entertain GM\u2019s request for declaratory relief. This did not end the matter, though, since any decision by the court to exercise jurisdiction remained subject to its discretion. That the court ultimately exercised this discretion adversely to GM is implicit in its refusal to consider the request for declaratory relief. As the court observed it was \u201chard put to understand how this action could possibly be adequate for the protection of GM\u2019s statutory rights and yet the [pending] enforcement action be inadequate.\u201d Id. at 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Of course, we must consider whether the court abused its discretion in declining to assume jurisdiction over GM\u2019s cause of action for declaratory relief. In this regard, we note that GM has not presented us with any arguments demonstrating that it will be unduly prejudiced if its challenge to the NHSB order is confined to the enforcement proceeding pending in the District of Columbia. We do not think that GM\u2019s business image will be significantly affected because GM will be obligated to present its position as a defendant in the enforcement action rather than as the plaintiff in this proceeding. Nor do we feel that GM\u2019s rights in the pending class action suits will be impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">These same considerations lead us to sustain the district court\u2019s decision declining to exercise jurisdiction under the APA. Section 704 of that Act in part authorizes judicial review of an agency action if \u201cthere is no other adequate remedy in a court. . . . \u201d In this regard the district court concluded that \u201cbased on the facts before it\u201d the enforcement action pending as of the date of its order provided GM with an adequate judicial remedy. Given the purpose of the National Traffic &amp; Motor Vehicle Safety Act to foster voluntary compliance and the fact that the amount of penalties, if any, to be assessed was \u201cfrozen\u201d before GM filed its complaint, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion. It could very well be that the district court\u2019s de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>cisi\u00f3n would have been otherwise had NHSB not commenced the enforcement action within a reasonable time after the NHSB became aware of GM\u2019s intention to challenge the notification order. However, in the existing factual context we conclude that the district court was justified in declining to exercise its jurisdiction under both the Declaratory Judgment Act and the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">We direct that the district court\u2019s order be modified to indicate that dismissal of GM\u2019s complaint was based on a proper refusal to exercise its jurisdiction rather than a \u201clack of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The order will be affirmed as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
