Since Waddell did not enter a plea of not guilty, nor has he intimated that his guilty plea is in any way invalid, he is clearly not entitled to the relief he seeks. Barber v. United States, 10th Cir. 1970, 427 F.2d 70, cert. denied 1970, 400 U.S. 867, 91 S.Ct. 108, 27 L.Ed.2d 106; Baker v. United States, 10th Cir. 1968, 404 F.2d 787; Boyes v. United States, 5th Cir. 1965, 354 F.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-25\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief -within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
