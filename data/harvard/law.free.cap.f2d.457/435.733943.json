We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s husband, a self-employed dairy distributor, died September 3, 1965, at age 62. Plaintiff filed a timely application for the widow\u2019s insurance benefits on November 10, 1965. The application was denied January 20, 1966. In order to sustain her claim, plaintiff was required to show that when her husband died he had accumulated one quarter of coverage for each calendar year after 1950 and before 1965, the date of his death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, because decedent had failed to file federal self-employment tax returns for the years in question, plaintiff's claim showed coverage for less than the requisite fourteen quarters needed for her claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Plaintiff filed a second application June 14, 1967, together with the delinquent federal income tax returns, and the previously filed Wisconsin income tax returns. These returns showed decedent\u2019s income for the years 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965 not included in the HEW records. This application was also denied. Plaintiff thereupon requested and was granted a hearing by an Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">The Examiner found \u201cgood cause,\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.957,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to reopen the first application because of \u201cnew and material evidence,\u201d 20 C.F.R. 404.958:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> an affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, filed in February, 1967, explaining the delay in filing decedent\u2019s delinquent tax returns<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for 1962-1965 showing his self-employment income. The Examiner credited plaintiff with the 1962 and subsequent quarters, and found decedent \u201cfully insured\u201d and plaintiff entitled to the widow\u2019s benefits. But the Appeals Council decided that the denial of the first application January 20, 1966, was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d barring \u2014 under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (5) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 20 C.F.R. 404.959 \u2014 the inclusion of decedent\u2019s 1962 self-employment income in the HEW records. The district court confirmed the Appeals Council\u2019s decision by entering the summary judgment before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Plaintiff contends that both the Appeals Council and the district court misinterpreted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 of the Act; that they should have applied 20 C.F.R. 404.957,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> instead of 404.959 ;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that, as a result of the misinterpretation and misapplication, the summary judgment in favor of the Secretary must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We see no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s contention. We hold that the Appeals Council\u2019s decision was not erroneous and that the district court did not err in entering the summary judgment before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-16\">When items of self-employment income are missing from HEW records, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (5) (A) permits the Secretary to include the items after expiration of the \u201ctime limitation\u201d period<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of 3 years, 3 months and 15 days from the year for which the records are missing. However, the late changes may be made <em>only </em>if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> first, an application for benefits must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>have been filed within the specified time limitation; and second, there has been no \u201cfinal decision\u201d upon the application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s original application for benefits was filed November 10, 1965, and was within the time limitation affecting the 1962 income, and accordingly satisfied the first condition. Plaintiff argues that she also satisfied the second condition because under 20 C.F.R. 404.957 the Agency\u2019s January 20, 1966 determination denying her first application was correctly reopened, since within the four year period after the notice of the disallowance of her application she showed good cause. The reopening, plaintiff argues, removed \u201cthe impediment\u201d of a \u201cfinal decision\u201d barring inclusion, in the records, of the 1962 earnings of decedent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">20 C.F.R. 404.957 provides that an initial or reconsidered determination of the Secretary or a decision of a Hearing Examiner or of the Appeals Council which is otherwise final may be reopened \u201cwithin 4 years\u201d upon good cause shown by \u201cnew and material evidence.\u201d But 20 C.F.R. 404.959 specifically covers \u201crevision of earnings records\u201d and provides that \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions in 404.957\u201d a decision on such revision may be reopened only within the \u201ctime period in [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (4) or (5)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Plaintiff insists, however, that the term \u201ctime period\u201d of 404.959 refers to the four year \u201cperiod\u201d in 404.957. She argues that 20 C.F.R. 404.804, 404.805 and 404.806 use the term \u201ctime limitation\u201d while 404.957 uses the term \u201ctime period,\u201d and that 404.956, providing for \u201crevision for error or other reason\u201d permits revision within the \u201ctime period\u201d prescribed in 404.957. The interpretation of the Appeals Council and district court, therefore, plaintiff contends, neglects \u201cthe uniformity\u201d of subject matter in 20 C.F.R. 404.956, 404.957 and 404.958 as well \u2014 in all of which the term \u201ctime period\u201d is used instead of \u201ctime limitation.\u201d Plaintiff however cites no definition of \u201ctime period\u201d in the regulatory scheme which gives a constant meaning to that term, as used in the regulations, and which requires us to take the term as meaning the 4 year period in 20 C.F.R. 404.957.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">We think the district court was correct in interpreting the term \u201ctime period\u201d employed in 404.959 as referring to \u201ctime limitation\u201d as used in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (4) and (5). That regulation\u2019s specific coverage of \u201crevisions of earnings records\u201d and its provision that a \u201cdetermination . . . may be reopened only within the \u2018time period\u2019 and subject to the conditions provided in [42 U.S.C. 405(c) (4) or (5)]\u201d are in our view conclusive. Regulation 404.959 by its own terms brings into play \u201cthe time period and . . . conditions\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (4) or (5), and its language expressly excludes the 4 year reopening \u201ctime period\u201d of 404.957 from incorporation into 404.959.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">We conclude that the term \u201ctime period\u201d in 404.959 refers to the \u201ctime limitation\u201d specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (4) or (5). Consequently, since the January 20, 1966 disallowance of plaintiff\u2019s first application was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d which could not be reopened, that decision, by virtue of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (5) and 20 C.F.R. 404.959, operates as a bar to reopening of plaintiff\u2019s second application.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-18\">Plaintiff contends that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 is unconstitutional because the \u201ctime limitation\u201d does not operate equally on all individuals. A decedent\u2019s \u201cfully insured\u201d status depends on the date of death, whereas the \u201ctime limitation\u201d for changing records runs from the particular year subject of the change. Plaintiff argues that the widows of self-employed persons who died toward the end of the \u201ctime limitation\u201d have less time to establish eligibility for benefits than the widows of self-employed persons who died at the beginning of the \u201ctime limitation.\u201d In her case, plaintiff says she had only a period from September 1965, when her husband died, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>April 1966, when the \u201ctime limitation\u201d for making changes in the 1962 records expired, to do what was required. She claims that all survivors should have an equal amount of time within which to \u201cdiscover,\u201d gather and provide information to make them eligible. The result in her case, she contends, denied her due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The benefits sought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 are not founded on a right, but rest upon a \u201cnon-contractual interest\u201d basis. Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 610, 612, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960). <em>See also </em>Price v. Flemming, 280 F.2d 956, 959 (3rd Cir. 1960), cert. denied 365 U.S. 817, 81 S.Ct. 698, 5 L.Ed.2d 695 (1961). And not every denial of benefits violates due process, although a \u201ccovered employee\u201d is protected by the due process clause from arbitrary governmental action. <em>Id. </em>363 U.S. at 611, 80 S.Ct. at 1373. But the bar of due process is to be interposed only if there is a \u201cpatently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification.\u201d ' <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We are not persuaded by plaintiff that there has been a clearly arbitrary treatment of her request. We hold that the \u201ctime limitation\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) applied in denial of her request for benefits does not offend the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">It is unfortunate that plaintiff must go without the insurance benefits. But the immensity of the problem of providing Social Security \u201ccalled forth a highly complex and interrelated statutory structure.\u201d The mandate to the Secretary in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c) (2) to maintain HEW records of self-employment income was necessary for the determination in an orderly manner of the innumerable requests for insurance benefits. Congress recognized that a beginning and end of time for establishing eligibility was an essential part of that need by prescribing a \u201ctime limitation\u201d within which changes and revisions in the Secretary\u2019s records might be made. <em>See </em>Crawford v. Cohen, 295 F.Supp. 624 (D. S.C.1969). One need only be reasonable to foresee the disaster in HEW if there were not a reasonable time limitation for ending disputes about eligibility benefits. This being so, the question is only whether the 3 year, 3 month, 15 day period is reasonable in relation to the purposes of the Act. There is no showing made by plaintiff why the \u201ctime limitation\u201d was not reasonable in her case. We hold that the \u201ctime limitation\u201d has a valid legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">True, the uncertainty of time of a person\u2019s death may result in some survivors having more time than others to request revision of the Secretary\u2019s records. But that does not render the \u201ctime limitation\u201d arbitrary. It is not the uncertainty of time of plaintiff\u2019s husband\u2019s death, but rather his failure to file his returns before death, that reduced the time she had in which to make the necessary revisions in the Secretary\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The district court did not err in entering summary judgment for the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-13\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(e) (1) provides that \u201cthe widow . . . of an individual who died a fully insured individual . shall be entitled to a widow\u2019s insurance benefit. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-24\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) allows for judicial review of \u201cany final decision of the Secretary. . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 414(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The term \u2018fully insured individual\u2019 means an individual who had not less than \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">(1) one quarter of coverage for each calendar year elapsing after 1950 . . . and before \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">* * $ $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">(B) in the case of a man who has died, the year in which he died. .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-13\">.
