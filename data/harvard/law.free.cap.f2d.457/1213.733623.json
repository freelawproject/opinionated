The opinion of the district court is reported at 314 F.Supp. 640 (S.D.N.Y.1970), and the facts are set out more fully there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-16\">In May, 1933, Walt Disney Productions, Inc. released an animated cartoon film entitled \u201cThe Three Little Pigs.\u201d The film contained a musical score, portions of which agents of Disney and Irving Berlin, Inc., appellee\u2019s predecessor in interest, believed could be adapted as a popular song. With Disney\u2019s approval Berlin asked Ann Ronell, appellant\u2019s predecessor in interest, to assist in the adaptation; she did so, rearranging the musical themes in collaboration with an employee of Berlin, and arranging the existing lyrics and adding new ones of her own. The trial court found that the new song was revised somewhat by another employee of Berlin and approved by Disney. In exchange for an agreement to pay certain royalties, Disney assigned-all its rights in the new song to Berlin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 314 F.Supp. at 643. Disney later agreed that either one-third or one-fourth of its royalties should be paid to Miss Ronell for her services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-17\">In 1960, the twenty-eighth year of the copyright, when the right to apply for a renewal accrued, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (1970), Miss Ronell for the first time asserted a one-half ownership interest in the copyright as a joint author, and obtained registration in her name, while Bourne, Berlin\u2019s assignee, registered as \u201cproprietor.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the present action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>appellant, as Miss Ronell\u2019s assignee, seeks an adjudication that since 1960 it owned one-half interest in the copyright of the song, together with an accounting of one-half the profits from that date. Appellee has counterclaimed for infringement, alleging as a basis for its claim a new edition of the song published by appellant in 1961. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s claim of ownership and sustained appellee\u2019s claim of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">Bourne offered alternative theories in support of its claim to total ownership of the song: (1) that Miss Ronell\u2019s contribution was not substantial enough to constitute authorship, and (2) that her contribution was \u201cdone for hire,\u201d see 314 F.Supp. at 644, and that the \u201cproprietor\u201d was thus entitled to the renewal copyright under Section 24 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (1970) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In finding for the appellee, 314 F.Supp. at 647, the trial court appears to have re-</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">lied principally on the first theory, though it also suggests a theory of assignment in its finding that the conduct of the parties shows that Miss Ronell intended to convey all rights to the work in return for royalties and credits, <em>id. </em>at 652-653. Though the trial court discussed the work for hire doctrine, <em>id. </em>at 650-651, it did not explicitly rule on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-10\"> We affirm the judgment, but do so on the ground that the findings of the trial court establish the conclusion that Miss Ronell\u2019s contribution was work done for hire within the meaning of that term as it is used in the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In view of this result we need not reach the issue of whether Miss Ronell\u2019s efforts were sufficient to make her an author, or whether she assigned her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-11\">As this Court said in Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co. v. Bryan, 123 F.2d 697, 700 (2d Cir. 1941), \u201cwhen the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>has become the proprietor of the original copyright because it was made by an employee \u2018for hire,\u2019 the right of renewal goes with it, unlike an assignment.\u201d The rationale of this doctrine, which is embodied in Section 24, has been said to be \u201cthat the motivating factor in producing the work was the employer who induced the creation . . . .\u201d Note, Renewal of Copyright \u2014 Section 23 of the Copyright Act of 1909 [now Section 24], 44 Colum.L.Rev. 712, 716 (1944). See also Brattleboro Publishing Co. v. Winmill Publishing Corp., 369 F.2d 565, 567 (2d Cir. 1966) (\u201cthere is a presumption . that the copyright shall be in the person at whose instance and expense the work is done.\u201d). In the present case appellant itself says in its brief that \u201carrangements were made through [Berlin] for a copy of the entire musical score of the film cartoon to be forwarded by Disney with the express intention of having Ronell create a popular song inspired by the cartoon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-5\">The purpose of the statute is not to be frustrated by conceptualistic formulations of the employment relationship. In <em>Brattleboro Publishing Co., supra, </em>this Court held that advertisements designed and printed by a newspaper, obviously at the \u201cinstance\u201d of the advertiser, were done for hire.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court expressly applied the statutory work for hire doctrine to the case of an independent contractor, 369 F.2d at 568, relying in part on Yardley v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 108 F.2d 28 (2d Cir. 1939), cert. denied, 309 U.S. 686, 60 S.Ct. 891, 84 L.Ed. 1029 (1940), where it was held that one who commissions an artist to paint a mural owns all rights to its reproduction. See also Dielman v. White, 102 F. 892 (C.C.D.Mass.1900), which reached the same result, although the court expressly noted that the \u201csubject of the design [was] largely [the designer\u2019s] choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892. See Lin-Brook Builders Hardware v. Gertler, 352 F.2d 298 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">Appellant argues that we have held that \u201can essential element of the employer-employee relationship, [is] the right of the employer \u2018to direct and supervise the manner in which the writer performs his work,\u2019 \u201d <em>Donaldson Publishing Co., supra, </em>375 F.2d, at 643, quoting Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 62.31 (1964) [now \u00a7 62.2 (1971)], and that that \u201cright\u201d is not found in the present case. However, the trial court found that employees of Berlin did in fact make some revisions in Miss Ronell\u2019s work. Moreover since Disney had control of the original song on which Miss Ronell\u2019s work was based, Disney (and Berlin, with Disney\u2019s permission), at all times had the right to \u201cdirect and supervise\u201d Miss Ronell\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-10\">The Court in <em>Donaldson, supra, </em>375 F.2d at 643, listed as among the factors that show that there was no employment for hire, the absence of a fixed salary and the author\u2019s \u201cfreedom to engage in profitable outside activities without sharing the proceeds with\u201d the alleged employer. <em>Id. </em>The absence of a fixed salary, however, is never conclusive, see <em>Brattleboro Publishing Co., supra; </em>Nimmer, Copyright \u00a7 62.2 (1971), nor is the freedom to do other work, especially in an independent contractor situation, <em>Brattleboro Publishing Co., supra. Donaldson </em>was quite different from the present case since it involved an author who was the dominant person in the corporation alleged to be his employer. In such a situation it could not be said that his work was done at the \u201cinstance\u201d of the corporation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>In short, the \u201cmotivating factors\u201d in the composition of the new song, \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf,\u201d were Disney and Berlin. They controlled the original song, they took the initiative in engaging Miss Ronell to adapt it, and they had the power to accept, reject, or modify her work. She in turn accepted payment for it without protest, except as to the amount, for 27 years. That she acted in the capacity of an independent contractor does not preclude a finding that the song was done for hire. We so find, and therefore the right to renew the copyright in the song in 1960 accrued exclusively to appellee, the \u201cproprietor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">. Berlin obtained the copyright in the new song in its own name, crediting authorship to Miss Ronell and Frank E. Churchill, the Disney employee who had composed the original song.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1276-18\">. Miss Ronell claimed that the parties had agreed on one-third, but she eventually dropped the issue and accepted one-fourth of Disney\u2019s share from 1933 to 1960. 314 F.Supp. at 643.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1276-19\">. It is apparently customary for the Register of Copyrights to allow conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>claimants <em>to register, </em>without making any determination as to the validity of their claims. See Ringer, Renewal of Copyright, in 1 The Copyright Society of the U.S.\u00c1., Studies on Copyright 537 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">. \u00a7 24.

We may uphold the judgment on any theory which finds support in the record, regardless of the trial court\u2019s conclusions. Helvering v. Gowran, 302 U.S. 238, 245-246, 58 S.Ct. 154, 82 L.Ed. 224 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">In reviewing a determination that a work was or was not done for hire, we are not bound by the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. Donaldson Publishing Co. v. Bregman, Vocco &amp; Conn, Inc., 375 F.2d 639, 641 (2d Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1036, 88 S.Ct. 768, 19 L.Ed.2d 823 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1278-6\">. That case involved a construction of the phrase \u201cworks for hire\u201d in Section 26 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 26 (1970), but its reasoning is equally applicable to Section 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">. Miss Ronell had previously composed works for Disney and Berlin, including \u201cMickey Mouse and Minnie\u2019s in Town\u201d and \u201cSilly Symphony.\u201d Appellant claims that Miss Ronell assigned in writing all her interest in these compositions. The absence of a writing in the instant case, however, does not suggest an intent to retain any rights; rather, especially in view of Miss Ronell\u2019s 27-year silence, it indicates that she assumed that she had no claim that would need to be assigned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1279-6\">OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AgD\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"AITj\">I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
