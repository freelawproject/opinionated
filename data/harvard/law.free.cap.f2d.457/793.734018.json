Harrison\u2019s action was commenced February 24, 1971, but dismissed without prejudice for failure to cite a named defendant. The suit was refiled April 6, 1971, more than four years after the alleged assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-24\">The District Court granted the motion for summary judgment on the ground that Harrison\u2019s action was barred by the one-year statute of limitations provided by T.C.A. \u00a7 28-304. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-25\"> In Mulligan v. Schlachter, 389 F.2d 231, 233 (6th Cir. 1968) this court said: \u201cSince the Civil Rights Act itself contains no limitation period, the courts will look to the most analogous statute of limitations of the state where the cause of action arose.\u201d It has long been Tennessee law that the disability of imprisonment does not save the statutory bar. Bledsoe v. Stokes, 60 Tenn. 312 (1872). Harrison urges this court to adopt a rule of law for Tennessee which would toll the running of the statute of limitations while he was imprisoned. This request goes against the established law of Tennessee, which this court is bound to follow. Crawford v. Zeitler, 326 F.2d 119 (6th Cir. 1964). To like effect see Jones v. Bombeck, 375 F.2d 737 (3rd Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
