Rayfiel, Judge, for conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) to commit bribery as a United States Government employee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(c). Appellant\u2019s principal claim is that he was prejudiced by the Government\u2019s summation, which included numerous references to him as \u201cHonest Phil.\u201d At the close of the Government\u2019s case all eleven of the substantive counts charging receipt of bribes were dismissed for improper venue, since the bribes were paid in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">The heart of the case involved weighing the credibility of appellant, a longtime military contract specialist at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland, against that of four Government witnesses\u2014 Barry and Leo Tepfer, the principals of a Government contractor (S. Tepfer &amp; Sons, Inc.), Selig Chervin, the contract administrator for the Tepfer firm, and Jerome Migdal, a friend of appellant\u2019s and an acquaintance of Chervin. For testifying against Benter the Tepfers received formal immunity from prosecution; at the time of trial Chervin was still in business and Migdal was still a Post Office employee. The Government\u2019s proof \u2014 sufficiency isn\u2019t argued here \u2014 was that the Tepfers ultimately agreed to pay appellant $100,000, of which he received at least $44,500,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for his assistance in obtaining and meeting for S. Tepfer &amp; Sons the obligations of contracts worth several million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">In the Eastern District of New York the practice on closing argument is for the defense to open and the prosecution to close.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we have examined the final arguments of both counsel to determine the extent, if any, to which the prosecution was provoked by the defense into making shorthand characterizations and insinuations that \u2014 unprovoked \u2014 -would be improper and prejudicial. <em>See </em>Viereck v. United States, 318 U.S. 236, 247-248, 63 S.Ct. 561, 87 L.Ed. 734 (1943); Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88-89, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935); Hall v. United States, 419 F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1969) (2-1 decision); cf<em>. </em>United States v. Isaza, 453 F.2d 1259 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-11\">At the outset of defense counsel\u2019s summation, he referred to the Government witnesses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-12\">Were any of them prosecuted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-13\">No, of course not. They all got away and they decided that they would get together, and the real conspiracy was an agreement to throw Phil Benter to the wolves, these four crooks. This was the real agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amm\">Counsel also referred to them as \u201cthese evil people\u201d and said \u201c. . . these crooks who testified for the Government were not good liars and they tripped themselves up here and there.\u201d He went on to say that the Government was \u201cstuck with these four crooks and they have founded their case on the weak, shifting sands of these four.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-14\">The structure of his argument was to analyze the story of each Government witness. Chervin was said not to have remembered \u201cthe story that they cooked up\u201d and to be \u201c [a] man who admits that he is a crook.\u201d Leo and Barry Tepfer were said to be \u201cpoor liars.\u201d Leo was characterized as \u201cthis evil man [who] takes his young son and brings him into this conspiracy\u201d; Barry was depicted as \u201can admitted co-conspirator and a crook here.\u201d Again, \u201cthe crooks here are basically Chervin, the two Tepfers, and Mig-dal and nobody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-15\">Defense counsel emphasized that appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t have to testify,\u201d had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>spent 28 years in Government service with an \u201cunblemished record,\u201d and had \u201creceived awards.\u201d He suggested that the motives of the Government\u2019s witnesses were \u201cto protect themselves and at the same time pick on a man who made it tough for them.\u201d Finally, counsel argued: \u201cThese crooks \u2014 all these crooks got away with it, and Phil Benter has to stand the brunt of this trial . . The Government\u2019s case is based on the story of these four miserable crooks. You have heard the defense. You heard all these clean people on the defense side. You heard Phil Benter, who has an absolutely unblemished record.\u201d The record discloses an effective and well-structured argument. What it does not disclose to appellate eyes is its impact on the jury, but one can surmise that the impact was not inconsiderable. The \u201cart of advocacy\u201d was well displayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Government counsel replied in kind, doubtless in the view that defense counsel\u2019s argument had made significant inroads into a compelling mound of evidence against appellant. This evidence included not only direct testimony from the \u201cGovernment four\u201d but also inference-producing proof, <em>inter alia, </em>that shortly after the continuing series of payments to Benter was commenced, he and his wife opened a safe deposit box to which they made 13 trips in 18 months, the last of which was just after Migdal said he told Benter of a visit from an FBI agent; that during this time Benter and his wife purchased several luxury items including jewelry, a mink cape and a third car (for which Benter paid $2,500 cash); and that Ben-ter falsely stated to the jury that he had paid for the third car \u201cwith my son\u2019s money,\u201d a statement which was directly refuted at trial by his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">The Government replies \u2014 objected to after, but not during, the summation\u2014 consisted in the main of two lines of argument, neither put in such a way as to be unobjectionable. First, counsel stated that if the jury thought \u201cfor one minute that this is a frame, that the United States Attorney\u2019s office and the FBI got together with the so-called four crooks and paraded them in here to frame this defendant, you should acquit him.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Secondly, he mocked the defense argument that \u201chonest Phil Benter\u201d is \u201cthe only one who told the truth.\u201d In this respect, the prosecutor made at least nine separate references to \u201cHonest Phil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">The references to a \u201cframe,\u201d while hardly expressed in language appropriate to the proper exercise of the prosecutorial function \u2014 which it will be remembered is not to win a ease, but to see that justice is done \u2014 did serve to put, as appellant claims, the prestige of the United States Attorney\u2019s office and the FBI behind the Government\u2019s case. Ordinarily this is improper. <em>See </em>United States v. Puco, 436 F.2d 761, 762 (2d Cir. 1971) (2-1 decision). Here, however, the defense brought this line of argument on itself by the summation recounted above and particularly by the following unmistakable suggestion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aof-dedup-0\">What about the other two? Cher-vin and Migdal. Well, they denied they got immunity, but you saw them here and they admitted they had not been indicted; no charges have been filed against them. They have not been prosecuted. Nothing has happened. Chervin is still in business, Migdal is still working for the United States Government as a mailman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-14\">You can decide for yourselves whether or not there is an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-15\">They won\u2019t be prosecuted; they haven\u2019t been.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-16\"> The above defense point insinuated that there was an agreement between the Government and Chervin and Migdal for them to testify and, by implication, the plentiful references to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>Government\u2019s witnesses being \u201ccrooks\u201d and \u201cpoor liars\u201d constituted a charge that there was a \u201cframe\u201d of the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To this argument by inference the Government was entitled to reply and, as Judge Goodrich put it, \u201c. . . some latitude must be given to lawyers\u2019 language in a hard fought case.\u201d United States v. Kravitz, 281 F.2d 581, 586 (3rd Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 941, 81 S.Ct. 459, 5 L.Ed.2d 372 (1961) (footnote omitted). The form in which the reply is cast, if not objected to, generally is not plain error. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 238-239, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940); United States v. Isaza, <em>supra, </em>453 F.2d 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">But the numerous references to \u201cHonest Phil\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are a horse of a different col- or. To be sure, the defense was that appellant had told the truth, and appellant, the evidence showed, had lied in one clear instance. But a federal court prosecution does not call for the flinging of first-name epithets at a defendant that might be commonplace in a second-rate movie or television script. This is beneath the dignity of the United States Attorney\u2019s office and of the United States as a sovereign.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cCases brought on behalf of the United States should be conducted with a dignity worthy of the client.\u201d United States v. Sober, 281 F. 2d 244, 251 (3rd Cir.) (Biggs, C. J., and Hastie, J., concurring), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 879, 81 S.Ct. 167, 5 L.Ed.2d 101 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">We do not find justification for the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the case law. United States v. Nowak, 448 F.2d 134, 140-141 (7th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1039, 92 S.Ct. 714, 30 L.Ed.2d 731 (1972), cited to us by the Government, is authority only for the general proposition that \u201c[a]n advocate is permitted considerable latitude in replying to his opponent\u2019s arguments.\u201d United States v. Fortney, 399 F.2d 406, 408 (3rd Cir. 1968), upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling that the \u201cunfortunate\u201d remark of Government counsel in summation that \u201c[t]he defendant wants the jury to infer that some other thief took the money\u201d was a slip of the tongue. In United States v. Medlin, 353 F.2d 789, 795 (6th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 973, 86 S.Ct. 1860, 16 L.Ed.2d 683 (1966), Government counsel\u2019s references in closing to Judas Iscariot and Benedict Arnold were not construed by the court as references to the defendant. Calling defense witnesses liars, even though provoked by the claim that the prosecution had been instituted in bad faith, fell \u201cjust short\u201d of reversible error in United States v. Sigal, 341 F.2d 837, 845 (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 811, 86 S.Ct. 23, 15 L.Ed.2d 60 (1965), and should have prompted, according to the court, a \u201cstern\u201d rebuke by the trial judge who is, after all, responsible for seeing to it that a dignified and fair trial takes place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">True, references to defendants as \u201ccrooks,\u201d \u201cgerms\u201d and \u201cviruses\u201d were held not prejudicial in United States v. Wolfson, 322 F.Supp. 798, 827 (D.Del. 1971) (and see cases collected at 826-827). True also, this court has not reversed convictions on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s epithets in United States v. Guidarelli, 318 F.2d 523, 525 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 828, 84 S.Ct. 72, 11 L.Ed.2d 60 (1963) (\u201cleech\u201d), or United States v. Walker, 190 F.2d 481, 484 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 868, 72 S.Ct. 109, 96 L.Ed. 653 (1951) (\u201ca type of worm\u201d). However, none of those cases involved the repeated and persistent kind of prosecutorial misconduct that has been condemned in such cases as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>Hall v. United States, <em>supra, </em>419 F.2d at 587 (\u201choodlum\u201d), and Getchell v. United States, 282 F.2d 681, 690-691 (5th Cir. 1960) (16 references to \u201ccon man\u201d and other jargon). <em>See also </em>Volkmor v. United States, 13 F.2d 594, 595 (6th Cir. 1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">We think the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper but in the circumstances of this case it did not constitute reversible error because there was ample evidence to justify conviction and Benter had indeed lied in reference to the payment for his third car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">We are reminded in summation cases that repeated rebukes of the prosecution by an appellate court without reversal may ultimately become \u201can attitude of helpless piety,\u201d and our \u201cdeprecatory words . . . purely ceremonial.\u201d Frank, J., dissenting in United States v. Antonelli Fireworks Co., 155 F.2d 631, 661 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 742, 67 S.Ct. 49, 91 L.Ed. 640 (1946). We trust that the rebukes in United States v. Isaza, <em>supra, </em>and here, however will not go unheeded by the prosecutorial staff involved, for another time the evidence of guilt may be less convincing and the likelihood of prejudicial error correspondingly higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-6\">Appellant's other points are without merit. The cross-examination of a character witness as to his personal opinion of the character of the accused was not objected to at the trial and is not plain error. <em>Compare </em>Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948), and Annot., 47 A.L.R.2d 1258 (1956), <em>with </em>the proposed Federal Rules of Evidence, 51 F.R.D. 348 (1971), Rule 405(a). Cross-examination of the witnesses Chervin and Migdal was not unduly limited in reference to their so-called life style, since there was considerable evidence showing that they had participated in the scheme and profited materially by it. United States v. Smolin, 182 F.2d 782, 786 (2d Cir. 1950), is an effective answer to the argument that, since the substantive crime necessarily involves a concert of action, there can be no conspiracy charge, United States v. Sager, 49 F.2d 725, 727 (2d Cir. 1931), for here the agreement involved more participants than were necessary for the commission of the substantive offense. Moreover, the substantive counts were dismissed after jeopardy attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">. Chervin and Migdal also received some of the bribe money unbeknownst to the Tep-fers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">. Preliminarily, it should be noted that appellant did not object to the prosecution argument as it was being made. This is attributed by appellant to the trial judge\u2019s direction to counsel \u201cnot to interrupt the other\u2019s summation.\u201d What the court did ask, however, was that there be no interruption \u201cunless there is the clearest of provocation for it.\u201d Evidently trial counsel thought such provocation lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">. Again, \u201c . . .if they all got together with us, and I mean the United States Attorney, and with the FBI, to frame him, well, then go ahead and acquit him.\u201d Or, in a similar vein, \u201cEverybody is a liar and this is one big frame.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">. This is, of course, a proper but risky defense argument. For an example of a highly successful defense argument along this line, see Clarence Darrow\u2019s argument in the <em>Kidd </em>case (1898) in Somewhere There Is a Conspiracy, in Attorney for the Damned 267 (A. Weinberg ed. 1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1239-13\">. There was also a reference to \u201c[a]ward-winning Benter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1239-14\">. We are advised by the briefs that the particular prosecutor involved is no longer with the office of the United States Attorney and has returned to the local prosecution office from which he came.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
