Appellant and a codefendant Reed were convicted of violating the Federal Kidnaping Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201). The convictions were affirmed on appeal. (Reed v. United States (9th Cir. 1966) 364 F.2d 630, cert. denied, 386 U.S. 918, 87 S.Ct. 873, 17 L.Ed.2d 789.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-24\">Appellant\u2019s present petition averred that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel because his court-appointed lawyer was inexperienced in handling criminal cases and because the district court failed to appoint for him counsel separate from his codefendant. Appellant\u2019s allegations are entirely con-elusory. A reading of the transcript of the trial discloses noi conflict of interest in counsel\u2019s representation of appellant and his codefendant. No facts are alleged dehors the trial record to support appellant\u2019s conclusion that his defense was slighted by the joint representation. There is nothing in the record to indicate that counsel did an inadequate job in representing appellant. Our examination of the record convinces us that the district court was correct in rejecting appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-25\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
