BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1138-13\">In this appeal from a \u00a7 2255 proceeding Appellants claim that they were denied the rights afforded them under the then governing Rule 7(11) of the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because their counsel neither advised them of their right to seek Supreme Court review nor initiated a timely petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-14\">A review of the record leads us to conclude that Appellants have misplaced their reliance on our former Rule 7(11), as they were represented by their own retained counsel at their trial on the merits and during their appeal from the convictions therein, and Rule 7(11) specifically pertains only to \u201cCounsel who represent on appeal a defendant financially unable to pay counsel, * * <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless we believe that the record belies the Government\u2019s contention that Appellants received notice that there was available to them further review by the filing of a petition for certiorari, or for that matter, notice of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>remedy which might have been available to them at that time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\">Because the alleged inadequacy of the representation given Appellants has occurred in this Court, we consider it to be preferable for us to grant the limited relief necessary to overcome the remoteness, and the built-in obstacles in the way of obtaining the discretionary review by certiorari. Cf. Atlantis Development Corp. v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 379 F.2d 818. We have ample resources to do this under our supervisory powers. See Rabinowitz v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 366 F.2d 34 (en banc). Consequently, to enable Appellants to seek certiorari, we recall our former mandate affirming their convictions, see Fifth Circuit Rule 15, and we enter in its place a fresh order and mandate affirming the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Joseph Michael Lacaze, Charles William Acevedo, Douglas Arceneaux, and Virginia Cain were convicted by a jury of the unlawful sale of narcotic drugs <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of conspiracy to sell narcotic drugs in violation of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They then filed a direct appeal to this Court, and we affirmed in 1968.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Appellants did not file a petition for writ for certiorari within 30 days following the entry of our judgment, as is required by Supreme Court Rule 22(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-16\">Subsequently, in 1969 Appellants applied for relief in the trial Court under a \u201cPetition For Redress\u201d and a motion to \u201cVacate and Set Aside [their] Judgments and Conviction.\u201d They asserted eight grounds of error,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> including the failure of counsel to inform them of their right to initiate a writ of certiora-ri in accordance with the terms of the then governing Local Rule 7(11). In the \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the trial Judge declined to hold an evidentiary hearing and denied relief to Appellants on all eight grounds. However in considering the facts of the record he failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, as is required under F.R.Civ.P. 52(a). See also Welch v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1968, 400 F.2d 582; Waters v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 74. Consequently we remanded the case to enable the District Court to comply with Rule 52(a). Lacaze v. United States, 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-17\">Upon remand the trial Judge as a matter of fact found that \u201cfrom Exhibits B-l and B-2 of the petition * * * petitioners were aware of their right to review by certiorari,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and he once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>more overruled their petition and motion for relief. It is from this decision that Appellants Lacaze and Arceneaux prosecute this appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">II. The Merits \u2014 A Patent Lack of Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">Appellants\u2019 request, in effect, for redress on the merits of the direct appeal previously determined by us is not available in the \u00a7 2255 proceeding. See note 7, supra and Smith v. United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 14; Stein v. United States, 9 Cir., 1968, 390 F.2d 625; Sykes v. United States, 8 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 104. But the contention that they were not given advice concerning certiorari such as is prescribed by our local rule is open to \u00a7 2255 review as an aspect of the right to effective counsel mandated by the Rules,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the law,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and often the Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>Since this is a federal case and to some extent partakes of an effort to revive the last step in the direct appellate process, we need not, and <em>we </em>do <em>not, </em>either rest our action on constitutional factors, or touch upon the necessity for state action in state cases.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> By recalling our prior mandate and issuing a new one we do not upset Appellants\u2019 conviction or our prior affirmance of it. The procedure devised by us merely affords an opportunity to invoke review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">The Government claims that a \u201cright of review was of common knowledge to Appellants\u201d because letter B-l states: \u201cAs you know, this matter is now in the hands of the Appellate Court, and upon any change in status, I shall notify you immediately.\u201d Also, because letter B-2 states: \u201cA decision in this matter is expected within the near future and we shall determine what steps should be taken thereafter.\u201d We disagree with the Government, and although we do not here reach a constitutional apogee, nevertheless, to promote and to maintain an orderly administration of the judicial machinery of this Court, we are able through our supervisory powers to apply a standard which is a concomitant to that prescribed for court-appointed counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">II. Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-15\">It is by no means unusual for courts to grant out-of-time relief to a defendant in order that he may be allowed to use the appellate process previously denied him. One such instance has been counsel\u2019s failure to give formal, timely notice on a direct appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals following the defendant\u2019s conviction. The remedy utilized by the courts under that circumstance has been to vacate the judgment and to remand the case followed by a resentencing of the defendant. This restores him to \u201c[t]he status of one on whom sentence has just been imposed and who has 10 days to institute a direct appeal.\u201d Dillane v. United States, 1965, 121 U.S. App.D.C. 354, 350 F.2d 732, 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-16\">Another form of relief that has been given to defendants under special circumstances is an out-of-time appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See Fallen v. United States, 1964, 378 U.S. 139, 84 S.Ct. 1689, 12 L.Ed.2d 760; Kent v. United States, 5 Cir., 1970, 423 F.2d 1050; Atilus v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 694; Schwander v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 386 F.2d 20; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>Brewen v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d 285; Bray v. United States, 5 Cir., 1966, 370 F.2d 44; Camp v. United States, 5 Cir., 1965, 352 F.2d 800; Lyles v. United States, 5 Cir., 1965, 346 F.2d 789; Boruff v. United States, 5 Cir., 1962, 310 F.2d 918. This is precisely what was done for a Federal defendant in Gregory v. United States, 5 Cir., 1971, 446 F.2d 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Another apt analogy to the procedure that is to be implemented under our own facts, since the review now being sought is to the Supreme Court, is the pattern utilized by the Supreme Court in their frequent orders vacating judgments in one-Judge \u2014 three-Judge cases. See, e. g., Local Union No. 300, Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen of North America, AFL-CIO v. McCulloch, 5 Cir., 1970, 428 F.2d 396; Mayhue\u2019s Super Liquor Store, Inc. v. Meiklejohn, 5 Cir., 1970, 426 F.2d 142, 144; O\u2019Hair v. Paine, 5 Cir., 1970, 432 F.2d 66. This remedial procedure enables the parties, under circumstances warranting it, to have a fresh order entered from which they may prosecute an appeal to the proper Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Indeed, in almost the very context of this ease, the Supreme Court has done precisely what we now do in their recent actions in Doherty v. United States, 1971, 404 U.S. 28, 92 S.Ct. 175, 30 L.Ed.2d 149; and Schreiner v. United States, 1971, 404 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 326, 30 L.Ed.2d 222.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-6\">\u201cPer Curiam. The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings, including reentry of its judgment affirming petitioner\u2019s conviction and consideration of the appointment of counsel for petitioner in connection with seeking review in this Court of the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3006A(c), 3006A(d) (6), 3006A(g). See also H.R.Rep. No. 1709, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1964); Report of the Proceedings of a Special Session of the Judicial Conference of the United States, 36 F.R.D. 277, 291 (1965); Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 44(a); Doherty v. United States, [404 U.S. 28, 92 S.Ct. 175, 30 L.Ed.2d 149] November 9, 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-8\">\u201cMr. Justice Douglas, concurring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-9\">\u201cSchreiner has a statutory right to the assistance of a lawyer in drafting his petition for certiorari. As I indicated in Doherty v. United States, No. 71-5679, [404 U.S. 28, 92 S.Ct. 175, 30 L.Ed.2d 149] that right is not conditioned by counsel\u2019s appraisal of the merits of the petition. No conditions are attached to rights under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 44 and the Criminal Justice Act. This view was adopted by the Judicial Conference\u2019s Committee to Implement the Criminal Justice Act of 1964:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-10\">\u201c\u2018[C]ounsel appointed on appeal should advise the defendant of his right to initiate a further review by the filing of \u00e1 petition for certiorari, and to file such petition if requested by the defendant.\u2019 Report on Criminal Justice Act, 36 F.R.D. 285, 291 (1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-11\">\u201cMoreover, the Tenth Circuit has implemented this suggestion. See West\u2019s Federal Forms, Vol. I A, Supreme Court, \u00a7 488 (Boskey ed. 1969).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-12\">\u201cThere may well be instances where the remedy sought is inappropriate\u2014 e. g., an effort to obtain mandamus where the duty is only discretionary. The statute does not, however, permit an indigent\u2019s right to be conditioned upon the fortuity of whether a lawyer believes this Court will grant his petition. We ourselves often have difficulty making that prophecy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-13\">Schreiner v. United States, <em>supra. </em>The reasoning behind our action is primarily this. Since our then governing rule for indigents required advice and unless declined, the timely initiation of a petition for certiorari, we attested thereby to a value judgment that this was essential to effective representation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>counsel. This value judgment gains weight not only from the fact that in state cases such action is constitutionally mandated, but also from this Court\u2019s settled policy regarding retained counsel\u2019s failure to file or give advice concerning the notice of appeal necessary to institute proceedings in this Court. See <em>supra </em>note 12 and Arrastia v. United States, supra; Bray v. United States, <em>supra) </em>Camp v. United States, supra; Kennedy v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">While the State \u2014 here the National Government \u2014 may not be faulted for a governmental denial of the right since it was a default of retained, not appointed counsel, its importance as a part of the process of effective representation is not affected by the particular attorney-client relationship. This is amply demonstrated in Doherty v. United States, <em>supra, </em>where, \u2014 as here \u2014 the defendant had been represented on appeal by retained counsel who failed to file or give advice concerning a petition for certiorari. The fact that the defendant was represented by retained rather than appointed counsel did not keep the Court from ordering the Court of Appeals to reenter its judgment of conviction so the defendant\u2019s time for rifling a petition for certiorari could begin running anew.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">What is legislatively, if not Constitutionally, ordained for the poor in Federal Courts and mandated by Constitutional imperatives for the poor in State cases surely may be adopted in our supervisory powers as the mark of effective representation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But where the failure is established in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding the relief is to restore the unsuccessful Appellant to the point \u2014 but no further\u2014 where he was when he lost his direct appeal in the Court of Appeals and his counsel did nothing toward advising him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>of certiorari rights or an effective assertion of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Accordingly we direct the recall of our mandate, Fifth Circuit Rule 15, and we simultaneously issue a new mandate reaffirming our prior affirmance of the judgment of conviction and, by a copy of this opinion, which is to be sent to petitioners and their present appointed counsel, we advise them of their right to prosecute a petition for a writ of certio-rari. We expect present counsel to take whatever action is appropriate (see note 17, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">Original judgment vacated and new judgment entered reaffirming conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">. \u201cCounsel who represent on appeal a defendant financially unable to pay counsel, shall, in the event of affirmance or other decision adverse to the defendant, advise the defendant of his right to initiate a further review by the filing of a petition for certiorari, and shall file such petition, if requested by the defendant.\u201d Rule 7(11), Local Rules of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (1970). The new rule, as revised October 18, 1971, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-10\">\u201cAfter any adverse decision on the appeal appointed counsel shall notify the party represented in writing of his right to seek review of such decision by the filing of a petition for writ of certio-rari with the Supreme Court of the United States. If after consultation (by correspondence, or otherwise) with the party represented it appears advisable to seek such review, the appointed attorney shall, if requested to do so in writing, prepare and file such petition for writ of certiorari, and shall thereafter continue to represent the party unless or until relieved by the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-17\">Rule 7 (III) (4), Local Rules of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1138-18\">. Though the record contains no testimonial evidence of either their ability or inability to pay for legal services, this \u00a7 2255 proceeding has been filed pro se, and since the date of its submission to this Court, Appellants have requested the assistance of court-appointed counsel in any further proceedings which we may direct. This Court has since appointed counsel whose attack is directed at the merits of the initial conviction, not failure of counsel to exhaust Supreme Court review. We have made no assessment of the indigent status of Appellants as of the time certiorari was first available. Cf. Doherty v. United States, 1971, 404 U.S. 28, 92 S.Ct. 175, 30 L.Ed.2d 149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, * * * Doherty\u2019s retained counsel, who had represented him both at trial and on appeal, withdrew after the appellate decision because Doherty was without funds to pay for legal services. Without opinion the Court of Appeals denied Doherty\u2019s pro se motion for appointment of counsel to assist in preparing a petition for writ of certiorari. Doherty has now filed a motion in this Court seeking appointment of counsel for that purpose. We treat the motion for appointment of counsel as a petition for writ of certio-rari seeking review of the Court of Appeals order denying the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">The Court of Appeals has a rule that counsel appointed for indigent appellants must, after adverse decision in the Court of Appeals, inform his client of the right to seek review in this Court and, if the client so desires, prepare a petition for certiorari. In denying Do-herty\u2019s motion for counsel, the Court of Appeals apparently determined that its rule was of no help to Doherty, whose counsel had been retained rather than appointed. We defer to that court's construction of its own rule. However, it is not clear that the court also considered Doherty\u2019s motion in the light of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act insofar as they may be relevant to a federal prisoner\u2019s right to have counsel\u2019s help in seeking certiorari in this Court. 18 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(c), 3006A (d) (6), 3006A(g).

(44a). In order that the Court of Appeals may give further consideration to the request for counsel, Doherty\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming Doherty's conviction and its order denying appointment of counsel are vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including reentry of its judgment of affirmance and appropriate reconsideration of the motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">So ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">Doherty v.
