Without requiring the defendants to answer these charges or holding a hearing, Judge Foley dismissed the complaint \u201cfor failure to state a claim upon which any relief can be granted or of which this Court has jurisdiction.\u201d We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The jurisdictional basis for this action, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), (4), is clear. Though the plaintiff has not exhausted his state court remedies, claims of denial of constitutional rights under \u00a7 1983 are not subject to such requirements. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961); Houghton v. Shafer, 392 U.S. 639, 640, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319 (1968). Furthermore, inmates of state prisons \u201care not held to any stricter standards of exhaustion than any other civil rights plaintiffs.\u201d Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (Dec. 14, 1971).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We hold also that plaintiff\u2019s handwritten <em>pro se </em>complaint and amended complaint, \u201cwhich we hold to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,\u201d Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (Jan. 13, 1972), fairly state several claims cognizable under the federal Civil Rights Act. The heart of the complaint consists of allegations that the defendants have hindered plaintiff in his ability to prepare legal papers, such as by delaying his letters to courts and law book publishers, by refusing him access to the prison typewriter and law library, and by confiscating nine of his law books, and have placed him in segregated confinement under degrading conditions for his refusal to discontinue his legal activities. Plaintiff claims to have been told by the defendants \u201ceither directly or indirectly\u201d that the segregation would continue until his lawsuits ceased. Defendants urge that plaintiff\u2019s claims are baseless, a contention adopted in part by Judge Foley, who dismissed the claim of inability to communicate with the court on the ground that Rule 54(A) of the Inmate Rules and Regulations indicated that it was completely lacking in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">It may well turn out that plaintiff will be unable at trial to prove' any of his claims. However, we are required at this stage to accept his allegations as true, Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1964), and on that basis the complaint states a cause of action under \u00a7 1983. Prisoners no less than other persons have a constitutional right of access to the courts, see Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969); Gilmore v. Lynch, 319 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.Cal.1970), aff\u2019d. sub nom. Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971), and prison authorities may neither place burdens on that right, see Harris v. Pate, 440 F.2d 315, 317 (7th Cir. 1971), nor punish its exercise, see Sostre v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178, 189 (2d Cir. 1971) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom. Oswald v. Sostre, 405 U.S. 978, 92 S.Ct. 1190, 31 L.Ed.2d 254 (Mar. 6, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Corby also claims that he was \u201cdenied adequate medical attention in regards to a serious nasal problem which was brought to the attention of defendant Conboy.\u201d Allegations of mere negligence in the treatment of a prisoner's physical condition, or claims based on differences of opinion over matters of medical judgment, fail to rise to the level of a \u00a7 1983 violation. See United States ex rel. Hyde v. McGinnis, 429 F. 2d 864 (2d Cir. 1970); Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F.2d 449 (2d Cir. 1969). However, a charge of deliberate indifference by prison authorities to a prisoner\u2019s request for essential medical treatment is sufficient to state a claim. See Martinez v. Mancusi, 443 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 1970). The complaint, though devoid of details as to the nature of plaintiff\u2019s nasal disorder, does recite that the problem was serious and that no remedial action was taken by the authorities despite their awareness of it. Although the claim is border-line, particularly in view of plaintiff\u2019s admission in his amended complaint that subsequent to the filing of his original complaint he \u201cwas called out of his cell and told he was going to see the prison doctor,\u201d we believe that it is sufficient and that plaintiff should have been afforded an opportunity to substantiate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Finally, Corby contends that several letters to his family and his Congressman were not mailed by the defendants because they contained prison news or constituted \u201cbegging.\u201d Unlike correspondence with courts or counsel, a prisoner\u2019s right to mail letters to his family or friends is not absolute. See Sostre v. McGinnis, <em>supra, </em>442 F.2d at 200. In certain instances the prison officials\u2019 refusal to mail an inmate\u2019s letter may be clearly justified, such as where communication of its contents to persons beyond the prison walls would pose a threat to prison discipline or security, or would hinder efforts to rehabilitate the inmate. See Sostre v. McGinnis, <em>supra; </em>Carothers v. Follette, 314 F.Supp. 1014, 1024-1025 (S.D.N.Y.1970). The present allegations of censorship, however, which at this stage must be accepted as true, adequately state a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Bearing in mind the deference which federal courts should give to the discretion of state prison authorities, see Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519 (2d Cir. 1967), we hold that the remainder of the claims in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint fail to state a claim for which relief can be granted under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-12\">. We have recently held that this rule dispensing with the exhaustion requirement applies to suits by state prisoners in New York, even though inmates are jirovided with adequate state judicial remedies for the redress of intraprison grievances. United States ex rel. Rodriguez v. McGinnis, 456 F.2d 79 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 1972) (en banc). Even assuming that an application for a <em>writ of certiorari </em>will be filed by the Attorney General in that case, we are meanwhile bound by our <em>en banc </em>decision. Furthermore the dissent there did not urge dismissal, which was the disposition here, but a stay until the state court had passed upon the matters which were the subject of the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. E. g., insufficient warm clothing, inadequate diet, poor lighting, lack of personal hygiene supplies and hot water, harassment, and discipline for refusal to accept employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b316-11\">LUMBARD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aco-dedup-0\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">I dissent and vote to remand to the District Court with instructions to refrain from acting until Corby has presented his claim to the New York courts for their determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">The Supreme Court has not determined conclusively that section 1983 suits brought by state prisoners in <em>New York </em>must be heard by federal courts even though the prisoner\u2019s constitutional claims have not been presented to the state courts. Until such a determination is made, I will adhere to my dissent in Rodriguez v. McGinnis, decided Jan. 25, 1972, on the grounds that New York State allows prisoners an effective state remedy and that control over state prisoners is a matter peculiarly important to the state. I note that we have been advised that the New York Attorney General will seek certiorari in <em>Rodriguez.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
