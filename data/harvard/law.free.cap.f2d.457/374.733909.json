Welfare Board for certain emergency medical expenses incurred in the treatment of her child; the request was denied and the plaintiff then requested administrative review of the denial on November 12, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">The Complaint further alleged that the administrative review procedures deprived her of the equal protection of the laws in these respects: they called for a \u201cFair Hearing\u201d of her appeal by a Hearing Officer and in the event it was unsuccessful for a permissible appeal to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court; in order to prosecute such appeal it was necessary for her to present a record of the \u201cFair Hearing\u201d; while it was permissible for plaintiff to employ a court stenographer to report the \u201cFair Hearing\u201d she could not do so because of her poverty; an electronic recording is made of all \u201cFair Hearing\u201d testimony but a transcript must be paid for by one who desires it and she is unable to pay for such a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">The instant action was filed on March 24, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">It is undisputed that prior thereto a \u201cFair Hearing\u201d had been scheduled for April 2, 1970 and adjourned several times at the plaintiff\u2019s request to await the outcome of the instant action; after the District Court dismissed it on November 2, 1970, a \u201cFair Hearing\u201d was had on November 12, 1970 at which the proceedings were recorded by a court stenographer employed by the plaintiff; the \u201cFair Hearing\u201d Officer rendered a decision adverse to the plaintiff on March 17, 1971; on April 5, 1971, plaintiff appealed his ruling to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court; on July 29, 1971 plaintiff\u2019s counsel stipulated to the dismissal of the appeal to the New Jersey court, and that Court approved the Stipulation of Dismissal on August 12, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">The sum of the foregoing undisputed facts is that when the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was argued to this Court on January 6, 1972 (1) a court reporter employed by the plaintiff has recorded the testimony at her November 12, 1970 \u201cFair Hearing\u201d; and (2) she had abandoned her denied application for emergency medical allowance by stipulating to the dismissal of her appeal to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">It is further undisputed that at the time this appeal was argued the defendant had abandoned the practice of using electronic devices to record \u201cFair Hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ing\u201d proceedings, and had adopted a new practice under which a hearing officer prepares his own notes of the substance of such hearing testimony, as a record for use upon an appeal to the state courts, in cases where the party seeking administrative review has not exercised the privilege of employing a court stenographer to record the \u201cFair Hearing\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">It appears from the foregoing that the instant appeal is moot and it will be dismissed for that reason.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
