SOUTHERN FARM BUREAU CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANY, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b428-13\">No. 71-1495.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b428-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b428-15\">March 20, 1972.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Sam Laser and Ralph R. Wilson, Cock-rill, Laser, McGehee, Sharp &amp; Boswell, Little Rock, Ark., on brief for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-14\">Mike Huckabay, Gentry &amp; Huckabay, Little Rock, Ark., on brief for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b429-15\">Before MATTHES, Chief Judge, LAY and ROSS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b429-16\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">In this diversity action plaintiff recovered a judgment against the defendant under the uninsured motorist provision of an insurance policy. The policy concededly was in force and effect on the day plaintiff was injured while riding as a passenger in her husband\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">The jury\u2019s verdict for $50,000 was properly reduced by the district court to $10,000, the limit of liability under the policy. In its post-trial order reducing the amount of the award, the court stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-20\">\u201cDefendant did not have a case and was totally unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious in its failure to even offer to settle with plaintiff within the limits of the policy, and were it in this Court\u2019s power, under the laws of Arkansas, to affirm the jury\u2019s verdict of $50,000 it would. Sadly, it cannot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-21\">The court imposed a penalty of $1,200 and allowed a $2,500 attorney fee authorized by Arkansas Stat.Ann. \u00a7 66-3238. Judgment was entered for a total of $13,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-22\">On this appeal, the defendant submits two contentions of error: (1) submission of the issue of aggravation of a pre-existing physical condition; (2) failure to instruct the jury under Arkansas Model Instruction (AMI) 2203 in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-23\">We find both contentions void of any substance and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-24\">As to contention No. 1, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff fully warranted giving the instruction which permitted the jury to consider whether the injury sustained by plaintiff in the automobile collision activated a pre-existing disease from which plaintiff had been suffering. The second contention also must be rejected because the court was not duty bound to follow AMI 2203. The court was required to and did fully and properly instruct upon all elements of the case in light of the controlling Arkansas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-25\">Plaintiff has requested this court to allow an attorney fee for services rendered on appeal. Arkansas Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Ann. \u00a7 66-3238 authorizes taxation of an attorney fee under appropriate conditions, \u201cby the court where the same is heard on original action, <em>by appeal </em>or otherwise. . . . \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Inasmuch as we are convinced that this appeal borders on the frivolous, we conclude that plaintiff should be allowed an additional attorney fee of $500. The judgment is modified by adding $500 thereto, and as modified, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
