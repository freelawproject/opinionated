In two separate petitions, consolidated by the District Court, Armstrong raises four claims which he asserts entitle him to relief. He alleges that: (1) from 1964-1970 prison officials physically destroyed or mutilated his petitions seeking habeas corpus relief on the robbery conviction, and placed him in solitary confinement when he persisted in efforts to file such petitions, thus denying him access to the courts; (2) he was prevented from presenting his self-defense claim to the jury in connection with the riot charges; (3) the Ohio prison riot statute under which he was convicted, \u00a7 2921.18 Ohio Revised Code and a related procedural statute, \u00a7 2941.40 are unconstitutional because they classify persons in an arbitrary manner in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution ; (4) Petitioner was denied the right to obtain testimony from witnesses in his behalf at his riot trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">We believe that the decision of the District Court denying the petitions should be affirmed. We feel it necessary to comment, however, on one statement made in the Court\u2019s opinion, which we believe might otherwise prove misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">In treating the first ground for relief the District Court suggested that a claim based upon prison treatment is never cognizable in habeas corpus. This is not a correct statement of the law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-19\">A prisoner is entitled to the writ of habeas corpus when, though lawfully in custody, he is deprived of some right to which he is lawfully entitled even in his confinement, the deprivation of which serves to make his imprisonment more burdensome than the law allows or curtails his liberty to a greater extent than the law permits. Coffin v. Reichard, 143 F.2d 443, 445 (6th Cir., 1944).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-20\">The precise limits of habeas corpus review in the area are unclear. It can be said with certitude, however, that some claims relating to prison rules and discipline are cognizable in habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus the Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>approved of the issuance of the writ in a situation where prison rules effectively-limited access of illiterate inmates to the courts by forbidding their fellow prisoners from serving as jail house lawyers. Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969). <em>Cf. </em>Ex Parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Even those circuits which have disapproved of the broad rule set out in <em>Coffin, supra, </em>have acknowledged that habeas lies in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2014 as when the petitioner\u2019s claims suggest that he has been victim of cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See </em>Cates v. Ciccone, 422 F.2d 926, 927 (8th Cir. 1970), <em>cf. </em>Harris v. Settle, 322 F.2d 908, 910 (8th Cir., 1963), cert. den. 377 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 1171, 12 L.Ed.2d 179 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">While the theory was once current that the only relief which could be granted in habeas corpus cases was immediate physical release from all restraints, this notion seems unsupportable today in light of Peyton v. Rowe,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968), and the statutory injunction to dispose of matters \u201cas law and justice require.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, <em>see </em>Coffin v. Reichard, <em>supra, </em>143 F.2d at 445. <em>Cf. </em>Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (1971); Wainwright v. Coonts, 409 F.2d 1337 (5th Cir. 1969); Creek v. Stone, 126 U. S.App.D.C. 329, 379 F.2d 106, 109 (1967); Jacob Prison Discipline and Inmate Rights, 5 Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, 227, 254 (1970); Hollen, Emerging Prisoner\u2019s Rights, 46 Ohio State Law Review 1, 5 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">Although the remedies available in ha-beas corpus other than release from custody, may, to a substantial degree, duplicate those which a petitioner could seek under the civil rights statutes, the speed and ease with which even a <em>pro se </em>ha-beas petition may be brought on <em>(see, </em>Peyton v. Rowe, supra) suggest that there is a place for the Great Writ in dealing with difficult prison problems.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">In the present case issuance of the writ would not be appropriate, however, as to the claimed restriction of Petitioner\u2019s access to the courts. Petitioner acknowledges that the restrictions were lifted by 1970; nowhere does he suggest that there is a threat that they will be reimposed; nowhere does he suggest that the denial of access during the period 1964-70 has resulted in prejudice to his current efforts to seek judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">We have reviewed Petitioner\u2019s first claim at some length to avoid any confusion which might have been created by the broad generalization contained in the opinion of the District Court. No such problems are created by the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Court\u2019s treatment of the other three claims raised by Petitioner and we agree with its view that none of these contentions have merit. We note that we have not considered Petitioner\u2019s claim that the Ohio prison riot statute, \u00a7 2921.18 Ohio Revised Code is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in its reach. This claim was not raised below and is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The judgment of the District Court denying the petitions for habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-21\">. Recently, in Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (1971), the Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle. In reversing the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of the Court of Appeals the Supreme Court noted that complaints about prison conditions and discipline might be heard on a petition for habeas corpus, although it acknowledged that the action then before it might be viewed as an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 as well as under the habeas statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-9\">. Peyton v. Rowe held that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences might attack the constitutionality of the second sentence before he began to serve it. In thus overruling McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">\u201c[T]o the extent that McNally relied on the notion that immediate physical release was the only remedy under the federal writ of habeas corpus, it finds no support in the statute and has been rejected by this Court in subsequent decisions.\u201d 391 U.S. 54, 67, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 1556.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-18\">. The civil rights statutes, principally, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, of course have virtues of their own as a means of dealing with problems raised by the prison setting. Most notable of those attributes is the fact that exhaustion of state remedies, a prerequisite to habeas corpus challenge of state practices, is not required before a civil rights suit is begun. See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), McNeese v. Board of Education for Community Unit School Dist. 187, 373 U.S. 668, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963). In certain situations this remedy can thus prove even more speedy than habeas corpus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
