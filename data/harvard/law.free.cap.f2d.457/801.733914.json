He is appealing that decision. We find his arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-25\">Appellant argues that he was denied due process of law because the district court\u2019s Local Rule 42 was violated. Rule 42 requires the government attorney to furnish defense counsel, at least fifteen days before trial, with \u201call written or oral confessions, admissions, or statements of the defendant which the government intends to use during the course of the trial.\u201d Assuming, arguendo, that Rule 42 was violated, this is not cause for reversal since there is no evidence that that \u201cviolation\u201d in any way prejudiced the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-26\">Appellant also contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The heart of this claim is that he was improperly advised not to testify in his own behalf. This theory was first advanced in appellant\u2019s motion for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>trial; at that time it was rejected. We do not think the trial judge erred in rejecting this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b864-5\">EUGENE A. WRIGHT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aky\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">I concur, but would add that the claim of a violation of Local Rule 42 is disposed of by our opinion in United States v. Barnes, 431 F.2d 878 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied 400 U.S. 1024, 91 S.Ct. 582, 27 L.Ed. 637 (1971), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1x\">\u201c[A]nd (d) Rule 42 expressly provides the trial court may excuse compliance with the rule which it here did.\u201d Barnes, at p. 879.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
