The first count charged her with inciting an assault upon a police officer of the City of Linden, New Jersey, on September 19, 1968, contrary to the provisions of N.J.S. 2A:148-10(b). The second count alleged Ella Hopson committed an assault and battery upon the same police officer on the same occasion in violation of N.J.S. 2A:90-4(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">Appellant was convicted on the first count, N.J.S. 2A: 148-10 (b) and acquitted on the second count, N.J.S. 2A:90-4(a). Her appeal from the conviction is pending in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After she was convicted but prior to appeal, Ella Hopson filed a complaint in the district court seeking to permanently enjoin the enforcement of N.J.S. 2A:148-10 and a declaratory judgment determining that the statute is violative of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">In her complaint she alleges N.J.S. 2A: 148-10 is void and unconstitutional on its face in that the statute (a) violates the fundamental guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of thought and freedom of belief, and the freedom of citizens to petition their government for a redress of grievances, all of which are guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, (b) is overly broad and vague and its over-broad sweep has a chilling effect upon the exercise of rights guaranteed to all citizens by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and (c) violates the guarantees of due process contained in the Fourteenth Amendment in that its provisions are vague and indefinite and fail to meet the requirement of certainty in statutes which are enforced by criminal sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>The recent cases of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) and Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971) are dispositive of appellant\u2019s arguments. The national policy forbids federal courts to stay or enjoin <em>pending </em>state court proceedings except under special circumstances, <em>Younger. </em>Declaratory relief is also improper when a prosecution involving the challenged statute is pending in a state court at the time the federal suit is instituted, <em>Samuels. </em>We do not find any facts or circumstances which would remove this case from the general rule. The language in Fenner v. Boykin, 271 U.S. 240, 244, 46 S.Ct. 492, 493, 70 L.Ed. 927 (1926) cited in <em>Younger </em>is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">\u201cThe accused should first set up and rely upon his defense in the state courts, even though this involves a challenge of the validity of some statute, unless it <em>plainly </em>appears that this course would not afford protection.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"> We are satisfied that the complaint does not disclose a bad faith state prosecution or harassment by the prosecutor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The order of the district court dated December 11, 1970 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-10\">. On December 11, 1970 the district court judge dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 challenged the constitutionality of N.J.S. 2A :148-10 which, in pertinent part, reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">\u201cAny person who, in public or private, by speech, writing, printing or otherwise, advocates, encourages, justifies, praises or incites:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">b. Assaults upon any of the armed forces of the United States, the national guard, or the police force of this or any other state or of any municipality; . Is guilty of a high misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-16\">. Prior to trial Ella Hopson moved to dismiss the indictment for substantially the same reasons advanced on this appeal. The motion was denied. State v. Hopson, 109 N.J.Super. 382, 2&amp;3 A.2d 205 (Law Div. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-19\">See also State v. Cappon, 118 N.J.Super. 9, 285 A.2d 287 (Law Liv. 1971) where the court declined to dismiss an indictment for an alleged violation of N.J.S. 2A:148-10(b) where defendant contended that the staute violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments in that the said statute is vague and overbroad.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b142-21\">. State v. Hopson, Docket No. A-1672.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-17\">. On May 1, 1971 appellant sought to file an \u201coffer of proof\u201d of facts which she claims fall within the allegations of paragraph 10 of her complaint which alleges that \u201cthe existence of said statute [N.J.S. 2A:148-10] among the laws of New Jersey and the enforcement of it has the immediate purpose and effect of harassing and intimidating plaintiff and thousands of other citizens and of deterring and discouraging plaintiff and these thousands of others from the immediate exercise of rights, privileges, and immunities secured to them by the Federal Constitution and in particular the rights of freedom of speech and association.\u201d The offer involves charges of \u201charassment\u201d by the Mayor and members of the linden Police Department. The only \u201coffer of proof\u201d in-volving defendant Karl Asch is that \u201cThe prosecutor of Union County had sufficient records in his possession to be aware of the actions being taken by the police officers. Notwithstanding this knowledge, he proceeded through two prosecutions of the plaintiff under a patently unconstitutional statute.\u201d This so-called \u201coffer of proof\u201d is not verified and is signed by the attorney for appellant. The cavalier conclusion that the prosecution of Ella Hop-son was under a \u201cpatently unconstitutional statute\u201d does not make it so. The Civil Rights Act should not be misused as a device for federal review of a pending state criminal proceeding. Cf. Rodes v. Municipal Authority of Milford, 409 F.2d 16 (3d Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
