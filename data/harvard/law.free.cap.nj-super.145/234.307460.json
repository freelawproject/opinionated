Plaintiff complains that defendant\u2019s handling of the case resulted in a reduced award. Thereafter on January 28, 1975 plaintiff filed a complaint in the Essex County District Court against defendant alleging legal malpractice. Defendant\u2019s amended answer asserted the action was barred by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:14-2, the two-year statute of limitations. During the reargument of the motion to permit amending the answer to assert the aforementioned statute of limitations as a defense, the trial judge summarily dismissed the complaint, holding that the action was barred by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:L-2. We hold this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\"> There is no statute expressly dealing with an action sounded in legal malpractice. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:14-1 (the six-year statute) applies to \u201ctortious injury to the rights of another * * * or for recovery upon a contractual claim or liability * * <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:14^2 (the two-year statute) applies to \u201c[e]very action at law for an injury to the person caused by the wrongful act, neglect or default of any person * * We are satisfied the two-year statute applies only where the gravamen of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>complaint is injury to the person. Clearly, we do not deal here with a personal injury claim but rather an assertion that an attorney engaged for a particular purpose was negligent in the handling of it, resulting in pecuniary loss to appellant. Such a claim comes under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:14-1 (the six-year statute) and is therefore not barred. <em>Fuschetti v. Bierman, </em>128 <em>N. J. Super. </em>290, 294 (Law Div. 1974).

Iowa 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
