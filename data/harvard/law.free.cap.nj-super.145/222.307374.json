Miller was discharged from employment as a sheriff\u2019s officer in the Sheriff\u2019s Department of Bergen County for conduct unbecoming an employee in the public service. The employing authority found that he was guilty of concealing a crime, having failed to promptly report an alleged mugging to the Lodi Police Department, and found him guilty also of giving false information to investigating officers of the Lodi Police De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>partment and to attendants at the Hackensack Hospital. Miller appealed to the Civil Service Commission. The Commission found that Miller had committed the misconduct as charged, except that he did not give false information at the Hackensack Hospital. However, the Commission modified the penalty by substituting a six-month suspension for removal from employment, and ordered reinstatement with back pay mitigated bj1. Miller\u2019s earnings during the period beyond the six-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">On this appeal the employing authority contends that the evidence before the Commission strongly supported all charges of wrongdoing and the Commission erred in reducing the penalty for Miller\u2019s serious misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Miller was temporarily appointed as a sheriff\u2019s officer in May 1972 and worked as a jail guard at the Bergen County Jail Annex. In April 1973, in the course of his duties, Miller met an inmate named Jimmy Talavera. In the summer months of 1974, after Talavera\u2019s release from confinement, appellant and his wife socialized with Mr. and Mrs. Talavera.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">At midnight on September 9, 1974 Talavera telephoned Miller and said, \u201cI have a problem, would you please come over.\u201d According to Miller\u2019s testimony Talavera then hung up, and Miller went to Talavera\u2019s apartment in Lodi, New Jersey. When he arrived he observed a male lying on the floor in the living room with blood around his swollen mouth. Miller testified that Talavera said that the man lived with him, that Talavera found him downstairs in the lobby and that the man said he had been mugged.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Miller and Talavera transported the injured man to the Hackensack Hospital. There Miller identified himself as \"from the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u201d' and displayed his shield. When asked why he displayed his shield he testified on direct, \"Because it was understandable that anything like that has to have an investigation, you know.\u201d Clearly, by his own admission, Miller gave the impression that he was acting in an official capacity, the likely effect of which would dis-eoxrrage further police investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The admission record of the Hackensack Hospital bears the following notation: \u201cSheriff\u2019s Office: State pt was mugged Eoute 46, Lodi. Pound on highway.\u201d Miller denied furnishing this information, but other evidence in the case contradicts Miller\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The Lodi Police Department received a report that a large amount of blood was found in the parking lot of the apartment house. The trail of blood led to Talavera\u2019s apartment. At first neither Talavera nor Miller told the police officers what had happened. Miller identified himself as \u201cArthur Green\u201d of the Bergen County Sheriff\u2019s Office and gave them a false address. The police checked on the license plate of Miller\u2019s car and discovered his true identity and location. When they called him at home later in the morning Miller offered the excuse that he was a victim of circumstances and did not want Ms position in the Sheriff\u2019s Office jeopardized.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Investigating the incident, a detective from the Bergen County Sheriff\u2019s Office spoke to the victim, Peter Lange, at the hospital. He testified that the victim was \u201cbanged up pretty bad\u201d; his jaw was broken and he looked like somebody had \u201cworked him over with a club or iron bar.\u201d The detective could not determine how the assault had occurred. The detective also interviewed Miller, and Miller admitted that he was wrong in giving a false name 'to the police and in other respects, but that he did so because he was frightened and did not want to be implicated. There was evidence that Miller had been trained at the Police Academy and that Sheriff Officer policy was to report crimes and accidents to local authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The evidence establishes Miller\u2019s misconduct beyond any doubt. It is immaterial whether he actually stated at the Hackensack Hospital that he was investigating the mugging. His conduct gave all the appearance of official involvement of the Sheriff\u2019s Office. Failing to promptly report a serious crime, a high misdemeanor such as an atrocious assanli and battery, is a grave offense which may itself constitute an indictable crime. <em>N. J. 8. A. 2A </em>:9V \u2014 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Having regard for the high trust that must be placed in sheriff\u2019s officers, particularly jail guards, because of their sensitive involvement with prison inmates, we conclude that the penalty of removal from employment imposed by Miller\u2019s employing authority was well within that authority\u2019s discretion. Cf<em>. Moorestown Tp. v. </em>Armstrong, 89 <em>N. J. Super. </em>560 (App. Div. 1965), certif. den. 47 <em>N. J. </em>80 (1966). The Civil Service Commission erred in reducing the penalty to a six-month suspension and ordering mitigated back pay. <em>Gf. id. </em>Accordingly, the order of the Civil Service Commission is reversed and the employing authority\u2019s order of removal from employment is reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
