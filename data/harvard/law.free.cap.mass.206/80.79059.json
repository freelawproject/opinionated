The plaintiff testified as to the cause of the car stopping, \u201c it just seemed to me that it was a regular <em>stop; </em>I have an indistinct recollection of some one passing in front of me as though they went out of the front door.\u201d The defendant contended that the plaintiff could not recover without showing that the stop was not one made by the defendant\u2019s servants to avoid a collision. Subject to an exception by the defendant, the presiding judge refused to rule that there was no evidence of negligence on its part. <em>Held, </em>that the refusal was correct, because there was evidence which justified a finding that the car was stopped to let passengers get off and not to avoid a collision, and therefore that the suddenness of the stop was negligent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-10\">Tort for personal injuries received by the plaintiff, who, the declaration alleged, \u201c owing to the crowding on the car \u201d of the defendant on which she was riding as a passenger, \u201c was obliged to stand in said car,\u201d and was injured by reason of the negligent management of the car by the defendant\u2019s servants. Writ dated December 24, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-11\">The case was tried before <em>White, </em>J. The facts are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the presiding judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>refused to rule that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-3\"><em>F. W Fosdick, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-4\"><em>R. H. Sherman, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b103-5\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Y\">The plaintiff testified that she was standing up with her hand through the loop of \u201c the strap,\u201d and her thumb on the outside; that she had hold of the strap \u201c firmly,\u201d and that \u201c the strap was wrenched right out of my hand \u201d by the car\u2019s stopping \u201c very suddenly,\u201d more suddenly than she ever had seen a car stop, although she had been in the habit of riding on electric cars \u201c for a long while \u201d before the accident. She also testified that \u201c a number of other people \u201d standing in the car near her were thrown forward and back again by the sudden stop. This evidence, if believed, showed that the stop here in question was not of the kind incident to travel on an electric car and the case comes within <em>Lacour </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>200 Mass. 34, and <em>Cutts </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>202 Mass. 450, and not within <em>McGann </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 446, and <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This has not been seriously questioned by the defendant. The contention put forward by it is that in a case like that now before us a plaintiff does not go far enough with his proof to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence in the stopping of the car unless he goes farther and introduces evidence to show that the sudden stop was not made to avoid a collision; and it relies on what was said by Tathrop, J., in <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>183 Mass. 193, in support of this contention. But that point was not decided in <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway. </em>The stop there in question was of the kind which is incident to travel on electric cars. See in this connection <em>Magee </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>195 Mass. 111, 113; <em>Partelow </em>v. <em>Newton &amp; Boston Street </em>Railway, 196 Mass. 24, 31; <em>MeGann </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 446, 448, 449; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>199 Mass. 471, 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">It is not necessary to decide the point in the case at bar. In the case at bar the plaintiff did go farther. She testified that she did not remember distinctly, but \u201c it just seemed to me that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>it was a regular stop; I have an indistinct recollection of some one passing in front of me as though they went out of the front door.\u201d This justified a finding that the car was stopped to let passengers get off the car and not to avoid a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
