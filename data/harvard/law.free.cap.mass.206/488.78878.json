Lanman, who was the mother of the respondent, was appointed his guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ian in 1872, The respondent became of age in 1878 and the petitioner sought to charge him in item thirteen of the account of Martha E. Lanman, as guardian of the respondent, for seven hundred and twenty-eight weeks\u2019 board of the respondent from 1887 to 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">The respondent asked the justice to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">First. Mo sums due or alleged to be due from the ward to the guardian on account of indebtedness growing out of transactions between the -parties subsequent to the majority of the ward and not connected with the administration of the ward\u2019s estate can be allowed the guardian upon an accounting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">Second.

To this ruling the respondent excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">The justice made the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-10\">\u201c First. That the decree of the Probate Court, allowing the first account, is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-11\">\u201c Second. Of the final account, items one, five and fourteen, and so much of items seven and thirteen as is necessary to balance the account, to wit, $582.63, are allowed, leaving in the hands of the accountant nothing due the ward. The rest of Schedule B is disallowed. Case remitted to the Probate Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-12\">The justice also made a memorandum, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-13\">\u201c The evidence at the hearing on this account was exceedingly unsatisfactory. I am satisfied, however, upon the whole evidence, that the guardian, after the ward became of age, rendered services of the nature shown in items seven and thirteen and therein included ; that these services were rendered under an understanding between the parties that they should be regarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>as payment, so far as they went, of the amount due from the guardian as such, and that as early as April, 1902, there was no balance due the ward. I rule that of the money paid and services rendered after the ward became of age only so much as was paid or rendered upon such understanding should be regarded in this account, and only so much of that as is needed to balance the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">\u201cI have not passed upon the question whether the ward is indebted for any portion of these items seven and thirteen not charged against him in this decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">\u201c Items two, three, four, six and eight are disallowed, because of the lack of evidence to sustain them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\">\u201cItems nine, ten, eleven and twelve are disallowed, on the ground that the services therein stated were rendered after the ward came of age, and I do not find that there was any agreement at the time that they should be regarded as part payment of the amount due from the guardian to the ward. I have not passed upon the question whether these services were rendered nor whether the ward is answerable therefor to the estate of the guardian. I simply rule that they do not belong to this court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-8\">The respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-9\">The items of Schedule B of the final account allowed in whole or in part by the foregoing decree were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-10\">1. 1877 Cash to Charles H.

Balance due guardian as per first account 789.37</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-18\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-19\">\u00ab7. <em>O. </em>Johnston, for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-20\"><em>W. B. Grant $ J. M. </em>Daly, for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-21\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5dr\">By the first account, which was rendered about a year before the respondent became of age, the expenditures were shown to have been largely in excess of the income received, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and it was not until some thirty-one years later, after the death of the guardian, that the petitioner as her executor presented the second and final account of her guardianship. The first account not having been allowed, when the final account came in the entire administration of the estate was opened for revision. <em>Bennett </em>v. Pierce, 188 Mass. 186. But as the respondent took no exceptions to the order affirming the decree allowing the first account, the balance shown by that account as due the guardian must be deducted from the amount subsequently received from the sale of the ward\u2019s real estate. If this is done, there evidently remained a very appreciable sum coming to the respondent when he attained his majority, and for which he then might have demanded a probate accounting. <em>Brooks </em>v. Brooks, 11 Cush. 18. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>144 Mass. 195. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Gaskill, </em>175 Mass. 265, 269, and eases cited. The second account, however, having included a large number of items which accrued subsequently, the respondent now invokes the application of the general rule, that the settlement of accounts between a guardian and his minor ward covers only transactions during minority, and contends that consequently these charges should be disallowed for want of jurisdiction. <em>Woodbury </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>54 Maine, 332. <em>Pyatt </em>v. <em>Pyatt, </em>1 Dick. 285. <em>Leonard's appeal, </em>95 Penn. St. 196. <em>Matter of Allgier, </em>65 Cal. 228. It was undoubtedly one of the conditions of the guardian\u2019s bond that when her ward became of age she should settle her accounts and pay over or deliver whatever property or effects might remain in her possession or be due upon the settlement. Gen. Sts. c. 109, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 16. Pub. Sts. c. 139, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 22. R. L. c. 149, \u00a7 1, cl. 6. But, the money having remained with the consent of the ward in the guardian\u2019s possession and management, she was bound to account for it, and, while as to his person the guardianship had ceased, the trust still continued as to the property. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Hazelton, </em>9 Allen, 102, 104. <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>84 Maine, 423. <em>Pyatt </em>v. <em>Pyatt, </em>1 Dick. 285. <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>138 N. Y. 192. If the respondent, being of age, had released the guardian by an instrument under seal, the adjustment would have been valid unless it appeared that he had been overreached or that fraud had been practised upon him. <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Lobdell, </em>4 Cush. 510. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Hazelton, </em>9 Allen, 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>We see no sufficient reason, therefore, why he could not enter into an agreement with his former guardian, that upon payment of a part in cash, and the acceptance of services to be rendered by her in the future, the indebtedness should be considered as discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">If evidently the accountant sought not only to terminate the trust and to relieve the estate of the guardian and the sureties upon her bond from further liability, but also to charge the respondent with an amount largely in excess of the money retained, the relation between the testatrix and the respondent as to the transactions not included in the settlement was that of debtor and creditor which cannot be adjusted by a court of probate. Accordingly the guardian\u2019s account can be credited with only such and so much of the items as show a fulfilment of the agreement, and the single justice, upon evidence not reported having been satisfied that this had been done, properly ruled that nothing remained due to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
