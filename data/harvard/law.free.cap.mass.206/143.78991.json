Thinking that he might do so with safety, he started to drive across the tracks and was injured by the car striking his rear wheel. The case, therefore, should have been submitted to the jury under many recent authorities. <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>Lexington &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>205 Mass. 182. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>205 Mass. 410. <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>205 Mass. 422. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>205 Mass. 429. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>203 Mass. 569. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Dartmouth &amp; Westport Street Railway, </em>203 Mass. 546. <em>Jeddrey </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Northern Street Railway, </em>198 Mass. 232. <em>Stubbs </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Northern Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 513. <em>Halloran </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>192 Mass. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The chief argument urged in behalf of the defendant is that in some of its aspects the testimony of the plaintiff was so contradictory that it could not be true.
