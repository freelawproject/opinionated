J., in <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>7 Allen, 1, 6, as to the possibility of the court considering matters not strictly before them when the record shows clearly that the case resulted in a mistrial, is not to be taken to apply merely to a motion for a new trial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-13\">Contract for the alleged breach of a contract in writing which is printed below.

H. Webb.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-15\">On the day the contract was signed the plaintiff made a payment of $300 to be applied on the purchase price. On March 25 an additional payment of $200 was made in accordance with the terms of the contract. The plaintiff, relying on performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>by the defendant, had a suit of sails made for the yacht at a cost of $265 ; he also hired a sailor fo.r the season of 1907 at $75 a month and bought various small fittings for the boat at a cost of $11.15. When it appeared that the boat would not be finished for that season, the plaintiff was obliged to discharge the sailor whom he had hired and pay him $75 for one month\u2019s wages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\">After the contract was entered into, the plaintiff went back to his home and had no personal dealings with the defendant from that time forward, but various letters passed between the plaintiff and the defendant in reference to the boat. There was no question but that the plaintiff fully performed the terms and conditions of the contract up to April 29,1907, when the following letter was written by the plaintiff and later was received by the defendant:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">\u201c Dear Charlie:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">\u201c Some Providence people want to buy my boat; please quote price to build without sails or ballast $1500.00.

There was evidence given in behalf of the plaintiff to the effect that it would take about two weeks to get the boat ready to be put overboard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-11\">The plaintiff testified in his deposition that subsequent to May 1,1907, he wrote to the defendant asking for information as to the condition of his yacht, but that he never received any reply to his letter and shortly afterwards put the matter in the hands of his attorneys for adjustment. The defendant testified on direct examination that he received no letter from the plaintiff after the letter of April 29, but on cross-examination he testified that he might have received a letter; that if Mr. Webb sent such a letter he probably got it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>On August 29, 1907, the following letter was sent to the defendant by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys and was received by him :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">\u201c August 29th, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">\u201cMr. Charles C.

Webb <em>vs. </em>G. C. Hanley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Inasmuch as you have not fulfilled your part of the contract to build the boat for Mr. Webb, we hereby, in behalf of Mr. Webb, make demand on you for repayment of $851.15 with interest, being the amount paid you on the contract and liabilities assumed on the basis that the contract would be fulfilled. We advise you to confer with us as soon as possible in regard to this matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-12\">\u201c Yours very truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-13\">\u201c Blodgett, Jones <em>&amp; </em>Burnham.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-14\">The boat subsequently was finished by the defendant and was sold by him. The proceeds of the sale were kept by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-15\">The defendant testified that he previously had built for the plaintiff two other boats. These had been used for racing on the Great' Lakes; and the defendant further testified that he was familiar with the racing restrictions there. The plaintiff testified that this boat was to be used for racing and for cruising and that he intended to use it during the summer of 1907. The contract in writing did not state, nor was there any evidence, that this boat was to be used on the Great Lakes or raced in any special class except as might be inferred from the above and the residence of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-16\">At the trial the defendant on direct examination was asked the question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-17\">\u201c Are you familiar with the racing rules in the eastern waters; take, for instance, Providence; are you familiar with the racing rules there ? \u201d This was objected to. The judge excluded the question, and the defendant excepted. The defendant\u2019s counsel then offered to show \u201c that the fitting of the boat would be different, entirely different, if it was to go in eastern waters, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>was to go to Providence, than it would be if it were to go to Chicago, and that is the reason why he didn\u2019t go on with the work.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">The judge excluded the evidence offered, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">After a colloquy with the defendant\u2019s counsel, the judge said, \u201c The only question is whether you had a reasonable excuse which you would like to submit to the jury for breaking it [the contract], failing to comply with it, and I am ruling that you hadn\u2019t. So then it comes down to the question how much the plaintiff is entitled to recover, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">The defendant testified that in answer to a question \u201c Why did you stop ? \u201d, which was asked him by a representative of the plaintiff in August before the action was brought, he replied \u201c The reason I stopped was because there would be a difference in the .boat if the boat were sent to Providence, it would be fitted different because she is a racing boat and is not worth anything if she isn\u2019t fitted up for a racing boat, and if she isn\u2019t fast she isn\u2019t worth anything.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">The charge of the judge contained the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-9\">\u201c It is agreed, finally, whatever the pleadings are, that they did enter into this contract, and that the defendant was to build for the plaintiff this boat, the description of which is given, the kind of a board agreed upon, and that he agreed to build it and have it ready for use at such a date, between the twenty seventh of the month and the first of the next, say, or something like that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-10\">\u201c The defendant, anyway, didn\u2019t build his boat according to the contract, and never has built it and delivered it, and so he comes in here and attempts to avoid the responsibility. He says he was excused for not carrying out that written contract, and his excuse is this letter that has been read. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-11\">\u201c Between the twenty-seventh of April and the first of May the boat was to be delivered on cars. Now, on the twenty-ninth of April, 1907, Mr. Webb wrote: \u2018Dear Charlie (that is the defendant): Some Providence people want to buy my boat. Please quote price to build without sails or ballast, $1500. Will divide profits with you.' Will she fit the Lipton twenty-one class Great Lakes? \u2019 That is all that is said about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-12\">\u201cWell, it did seem to me, as a matter of law, that that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>not be an excuse for avoiding the contract, what I have read to you. Mr. Foreman, you make a contract to build me a boat or house and I tell you I am talking with some Providence people, who want to buy it; \u2018 Please quote price to build without sails or ballast, $1500. Will divide profits with you. Will she fit Lipton twenty-one class, Great Lakes ? \u2022\u2019 If he had said, \u2018 Hold on, don\u2019t go any further with the boat,\u2019 or said anything else, there might have been something for you, but in my opinion that was not a sufficient excuse for breaking his written contract, and I have so ruled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">This was all the material evidence offered by the defendant. At the close of the evidence the judge ruled that the evidence offered and the evidence introduced by the defendant were no defense to the action, and directed the jury to determine the damages for the breach of the contract. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $893, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-6\"><em>S. H. </em>Tyng, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-7\"><em>F. M. </em>Murphy, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATr\">The letter of April 29, taken in connection with the defendant\u2019s testimony which was admitted in evidence (that she was a racing boat and not worth anything if not fitted for racing), and also taken in connection with the testimony that was excluded (that the fitting of the boat if it was to go to Providence to race ought to be different from the fitting the boat ought to have if it was to go to Chicago to race), might have justified the defendant in stopping work on the boat until he learned from the plaintiff whether he sold her to the \u201c Providence people \u201d who wanted to buy her. See in this connection <em>Crossan </em>v. <em>New York New England </em>Railroad, 149 Mass. 196. But that is not what the defendant did. In the words of the bill of exceptions \u201c The boat was subsequently finished by the defendant and sold by him. The proceeds of the sale were kept by him.\u201d The letter is not a justification for the action which the defendant took.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">The defendant has urged upon us that there was a mistrial in the measure of damages, and that there should be a new trial although no exception was taken to the instructions given by the presiding judge on this point. We have no means of know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ing what the ruling of the judge on the measure of damages was. For that reason it is not necessary to consider whether the remark of Bigelow, C. J., in <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>7 Allen, 1, 6, relied on by the defendant, is not to be taken to apply to a motion for a new trial, as was the case in <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Ginsburg, </em>163 Mass. 143, the other case relied on by him in this connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\n<em>.Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
