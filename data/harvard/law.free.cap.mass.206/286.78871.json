Spelman, Esquire, as master. Later the case was heard by Davis, J., upon the master\u2019s report and exceptions thereto, and also on certain evidence introduced by the respondent, which was uncontroverted and which the judge found to be true. The respondent claimed under two tax deeds given respectively under sales for the non-payment of taxes assessed for the years 1892 and 1895. The judge overruled the exceptions to the master\u2019s report, confirmed that report, and ordered that a decree be entered for the petitioner. At the request of both parties, the judge reported the case for determination by this court. If the rulings of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>judge were right, a final decree for the petitioner was to be entered as ordered; otherwise, there was to be such a disposition of the case as this court might direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-6\"><em>C.

That act provided that the advertisement was to be : \u201c Three weeks successively in some newspaper published in the city or town where the premises to be sold for taxes are situated, if there is such newspaper, and, if not, then in a newspaper printed in the county where the real estate lies.\u201d Unless there is something to control it, this means that the sale is to be published in some one newspaper. So far from this result being controlled by other provisions, it is confirmed by \u00a7 43 of the same act (St. 1888, c. 390, \u00a7 43). That section provides that the deed shall state \u201c the newspaper in which the advertisement of the sale was published.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The act in force prescribing the charges and fees allowed to the collector (which are to be added to the amount of the tax) was St. 1889, c. 334, \u00a7 3. That provides for a charge or fee: \u201c For advertisement of sale in newspapers, the cost thereof.\u201d The provision in the Public Statutes (Pub. Sts. c. 12, \u00a7 36) and in St. 1888, c. 390 (\u00a7 41), is \u201c for advertisement in newspaper, the actual cost of the same.\u201d We have no means of knowing why the change was made from \u201c newspaper \u201d in Pub. Sts. c. 12, \u00a7 36, and St. 1888, c. 390, \u00a7 41, to \u201c newspapers \u201d in St. 1889, c. 334, \u00a7 3. Ho change however was made in the statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>(which we have referred to) regulating the advertisement to be made and providing that the sale should be advertised in some one newspaper. It cannot be held under these circumstances that there was a change in the law providing what advertisement was to be made, and it must be held that the-word \u201c newspapers \u201d in St. 1889, c. 334, \u00a7 3, is to be construed to mean copies of the newspaper in which the advertisement was inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We cannot accede to the argument that the statutes prescribe the minimum of the advertising which the collector is to make, and that any advertisement in addition to that which the court thinks reasonable is warranted. The sale of an owner\u2019s property for non-payment of taxes is <em>strictissimi juris, </em>and every requisite prescribed by the statute must be complied with. See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Home for Aged Women, </em>204 Mass. 563. In such cases there is no question of the- reasonableness of the departure from the statutory requisites. If there is a departure from them the tax title is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We are therefore of opinion that the ruling of the Land Court as to the tax title based on the assessment of 1892 was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">As to the tax title based on the assessment made in 1895: The respondent\u2019s contention here is that where the amount of the tax stated in the notice of the sale is larger than the real amount of it the sale is void, but if it is less the sale is good. His argument in support of this contention is that the owner, is prejudiced when the notice of sale calls for more than is due, but is not prejudiced when it calls for less. We do not stop at the fact that the notice is not for the benefit of the owner alone, (see <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Pitts, </em>7 Cush. 503, 505, 506,) for the real answer to this contention is that the authority of the collector is a limited one to sell for the amount assessed after giving notice by advertisement of his intention to sell for that amount. In <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Pitts, ubi sufra, </em>where the amount stated in the notice was greater than the assessment by seventy-eight cents, the collector in fact sold for the amount of the assessment. In the case at bar he appears to have sold for less than the amount of the assessment. He had no authority to do that. It is not possible to adopt the reasoning of the respondent that a slight variation by the collector from the authority vested in him will be disregarded. The difference in the case at bar is but fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>cents. But if that departure from the exact authority of the collector is allowed in the case at bar the difficulty will be to draw the line between the case at bar and other cases involving a greater departure. As we have said before, the authority to sell the property of an owner for non-payment of taxes is <em>strictissimi juris, </em>and there is no room for the allowance of any departure, reasonable or unreasonable, from the requisites prescribed by the statutes. See in this connection <em>Knowlton </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>136 Mass. 32; <em>Lancy </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>180 Mass. 411; <em>Hurd </em>v. <em>Melrose, </em>191 Mass. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
