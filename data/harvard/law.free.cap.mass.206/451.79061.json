There also was evidence that a gang called the \u201c shear gang \u201d received orders from L. <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence which would warrant a finding that L. had entire charge and superintendence of the department of distribution of materials in the yard, and that superintendence was his principal duty, and therefore that he was a person for whose negligence causing injury to an employee the defendant would be liable under R. L. c. 106, \u00a7 71, cl. 2.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Tort under R.

We do not think that the difference is so material as to compel a different conclusion in regard to the plaintiff\u2019s due care. In either case he was bound to keep a lookout and see that the track was clear. The plaintiff testified at this trial,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> as he did in substance before, that he was standing on the foot board looking down the track in the direction in which they were going, and that it was dark and he did not see any obstruction. He also testified that he had been over the switch where the accident occurred many times during the evening, the last time four or five minutes before the accident, and that there was no obstruction then. He further testified that it was customary for Locks to tell him when any of the bucket cars were moved by hand, but that no such notice was given to him in regard to the bucket car which caused the accident, and which was so moved. In respect to cars moved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>engine on which he was working he naturally would' be expected to keep run of them himself^ The engineer testified that the plaintiff stood turned around looking at him and talking to him as the engine was backing down. But this was denied by the plaintiff, and we think, as was said before by the Chief Justice, that the question of the plaintiff\u2019s due care was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">One Dobie testified for the defendant and his testimony, which was new, tended to show that Locks was not a superintendent. It is plain that Dobie himself was a superintendent. The works ran day and night, but Dobie worked only during the day time. The plaintiff worked nights, and there was testimony tending to show that he did Dobie\u2019s work at night. There was also testimony tending to show that he had charge of the stockers\u2019 gang and that it was his business to get from the stockchaser, as he was called, directions as to the kind and amount of stock that was required for the different furnaces, and then to see that it was loaded into bucket cars by the stockers and taken by the engine to the furnaces. The plaintiff and the engineer were subject to his directions, or it could be found that they were, and there was also testimony tending to show that a gang called the shear gang received orders from him. He worked more or less with his hands, and if Dobie\u2019s testimony was to be believed that was what he principally did. But it was for the jury to say what weight should be given to Dobie\u2019s testimony and to decide upon the whole evidence whether Locks\u2019s principal duty was or was not that of superintendence. In important, if not decisive, respects the case is substantially the same as it was before, and it cannot be said now, as the Chief Justice said in substance that it could not be said then, that there was no evidence warranting the jury in finding that Locks\u2019s principal duty was that of superintendence, and that the accident was due to negligence on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\n<em>\u00a1Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\"> Before <em>Sanderson, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
