L. c. 119, \u00a7 19, to settle its affairs, it appeared that the member died about three years and seven months before the appointment of the receiver, after having protested against the reduction, that about four months later the beneficiary accepted the reduced amount and surrendered his certificate, without any misrepresentaton having been made to him, but gave no release, and that about seven and a half months later the beneficiary sued out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>a writ against the corporation but filed no declaration and failed to enter the action. <em>Held, </em>that the member preserved his rights by protesting and that at his death the beneficiary was entitled to share in the fund to the extent of the full amount of the death benefit before the by-law; and that such acquiescence as was' shown on the part of the beneficiary without a release of his rights was not a bar to his being paid the balance of the death benefit out of the emergency fund, although that fund had been kept in existence by the acquiescence of the members generally in the validity of the by-law.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-9\"><em>H A. \"Wyman, </em>receiver, <em>pro se.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aon\"><em>J.

See <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>American Legion of Honor (Hall\u2019s Claim), ante, </em>158.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In this case the member died on January 20,1901, after having protested against the reduction. On May 29, 1901, the beneficiary took $1,900 and surrendered her certificate. We accept as true Wilson\u2019s version of the statements made to her at that time, and find that there was no misrepresentation made to her then. On January 18, 1902 (some seven and .a half months later), she sued out a writ against the defendant, \u201c but no declaration or statement of claim was filed, and no action of any kind was taken thereunder,\u201d and therefore that did not help to preserve her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The member preserved his rights by protesting, and the beneficiary at his death was entitled to be paid on the basis of a $5,000 certificate. That claim never has been released and is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Where the member did not acquiesce in the validity of the by-law but protested against it, the acquiescence of the beneficiary for this length of time should not in our opinion bar her from being paid the death benefit legally due to her out of the trust fund held for that purpose, although that fund has been \u00abkept in existence by the acquiescence of members generally in the validity of the by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The beneficiary is entitled to the relief stated in <em>Law\u2019s Claim, ante, </em>183.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\n<em>Decree accordingly,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
