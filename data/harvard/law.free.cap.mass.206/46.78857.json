L. c. 19, \u00a7 9, that \u201c heads of principal departments of the Commonwealth or of a city \u201d (among others) shall be exempt from the civil service rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The reason for the exemption is plain: The selection of the heads of those departments of the Commonwealth or of a city which correspond to the cabinet officers of the President of the United States, stands on a different footing from that of subordinates and clerks. See in this connection <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Trehy, </em>178 Mass. 186; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>195 Mass. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">It is not the head of every department of a city who is within this exemption. The exemption is confined to the \u201cheads of principal departments.\u201d There are some twenty-six departments created by the ordinances of the city here in question. They are not all of them \u201cprincipal departments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">In our opinion the \u201c sealer of weights and measures department \u201d is not one of the \u201c principal departments \u201d of this city. The duty to be performed by that department is a ministerial one, namely, to determine the accuracy of scales and measures. See <em>Moneyweight Scale Co. </em>v. <em>McBride, </em>199 Mass. 503, 514. The persons who make up this department are three in number. In no sense is it a \u201c principal \u201d department of this city.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">\n<em>Judgment of ouster.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
