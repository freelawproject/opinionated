At the second trial of the case, although there was much more evidence, and that of the plaintiff was stoutly controverted, and there was much stronger ground for a contention of the defendant that the plaintiff and her husband were not so ignorant as they represented themselves to be in regard to business matters and real estate 'transactions, it was <em>held, </em>that there still was evidence from which the jury were warranted in finding in accordance with the contentions of the plaintiff, and that the presiding judge was right in refusing to rule that as matter of law the plaintiff and her husband were guilty of negligence in relying on the defendant\u2019s representations.

Writ dated April 6,1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">The case previously was before this court as stated in the opinion. After rescript, it was tried again before Aiken, C. J. The evidence of the plaintiff tended to show that the plaintiff\u2019s husband was approached regarding the sale by one Spooner, mentioned in the opinion, who later brought the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s house, and that, in the subsequent dealings between the parties, Spooner and the defendant acted together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s husband as to one West, referred to in the opinion, was as follows: \u201c Soon after Spooner and I came down stairs, a man came in; ... he was introduced to me by Mr. Spooner as Mr. West, the man who was to cash the mortgages. ... We had some talk with Mr. West but Mr. Quimby was not present. . . . He says, 6 How much is it?\u2019 And I said, \u2018$2,000,\u2019 and he says, \u2018 That is pretty short notice to get so much money together,\u2019 that it would take only a few days, and I told him the first part of the week and I says \u2018 How about Tuesday ? \u2019 and he says \u2018 All right, and so it was agreed that I should meet him at the Warren House Tuesday. This was on Friday, and I went to the Warren Hotel the following Tuesday at the appointed time. Mr. West was there and I had some talk with him. He said he was sorry to disappoint me but he rather have his money at 6 % than at 4 %, and I asked him if he would like to see the mortgages and he said no, they was all right from the description that Quimby and Spooner had given him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">As stated in the opinion, other evidence of the plaintiff tended to establish the allegations of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-6\">At the close of the evidence, the presiding judge refused to rule that on all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. There was a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-8\"><em>M. M. </em>Taylor, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b415-9\"><em>J. A. </em>Thayer, <em>O. B. Perry A.

The case has now been fully tried on both sides, both the plaintiff and the defendant testifying, which neither did at the former trial. At this trial there was a verdict for the plaintiff, and the case is now here on exceptions by the defendant to the refusal of the presiding judge to rule that on all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and to the admission of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The defendant contends that the case as it now comes before us is distinguishable from the case as formerly presented. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>facts <em>pro </em>and <em>con </em>have been brought out much more fully at this trial than they were at the previous trial, and there is much stronger ground for the contention that the plaintiff and her husband, who acted as her agent, were not so ignorant, especially the husband, as1 they represented themselves to be in regard to busifiess matters and real estate transactions. But there was testimony at this trial as there was at the other tending to show that the defendant falsely represented the mortgages to be first mortgages and that the plaintiff and her husband both relied on the representations so made. The defendant and Spooner both strenuously denied that any such representations were made and in this and other matters the parties were diametrically at issue. In that situation it plainly was for the jury to determine what the facts were and whether, taking all of the circumstances into account, the plaintiff and her husband were warranted in relying upon the representations alleged to have been made. It could not have been ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff and her husband were guilty of negligence in relying upon such representations. It was for the jury to say what experience the plaintiff and her husband had had in real estate and business matters and from that and their appearance upon the stand to determine whether they exercised the degree of care which would naturally be expected of them or whether they were attempting to enforce an unjust claim. It cannot be said that there was no evidence warranting the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The only exception to the admission of evidence which has been argued by the defendant is that to the admission of a conversation between the plaintiff\u2019s husband and Spooner and a man by the name of West, at which the defendant was not present, which related to a cashing of one of the mortgages by West. The plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that, upon his objecting that he could not take the purchase price all in mortgages but must have some money, the defendant said \u201c I will, have a man there to cash it,\u201d meaning, evidently, one or more of the mortgages. The plaintiff\u2019s husband also testified that West was introduced to him by Spooner as the man who was to cash the mortgages. And it could have been found that he was there pursuant to the defendant\u2019s undertaking as part of the sale and purchase to find a man who would cash one or more of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>mortgages and that Spooner was acting for the defendant. Under those circumstances the conversation was admissible as bearing on the general contention of the plaintiff that she and her husband were induced to make the sale and conveyance by false representations on the part of the defendant, and the objection that the defendant was not present was met by the fact that Spooner was acting or could be found to be acting as his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The other exceptions to the admission of evidence have not been argued and we treat them as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
