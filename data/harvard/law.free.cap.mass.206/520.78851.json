The husband testified that the land in question had been bought by him and the title taken in his wife\u2019s name, that he put up a building upon it, occupied it for his business and never paid any rent to his wife \u201cor anything of that kind,\u201d that he paid taxes, water rates, expenses for repairs, painting, plumbing and insurance out of his own money, that he did not always consult his wife about such tilings although he did sometimes, that all negotiations for the sale of the premises were conducted by him and that the money received therefor went into his bank account; and there was evidence tending to show that, when the husband transmitted to the defendant an offer in writing for the property which the plaintiff had procured for her acceptance, she then being temporarily absent at a distance, the husband told her not to sign until her return, and that she did not do so, that upon the wife\u2019s return the husband stated to the plaintiff that his wife would not sign the deed, saying, \u201c What can I do <em>1 </em>\u201d <em>Held, </em>that there was evidence which warranted a finding that, although the legal title of the land stood in the defendant\u2019s name, she left the entire management of it to her husband.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b542-9\">At the trial of an action by a real estate broker against a married woman for a commission for procuring a sale of real estate of the defendant, it appeared that the negotiations of the plaintiff were entirely with the defendant\u2019s husband, and there was evidence from which a jury would have been warranted in finding that the husband had caused the real estate in question, which he himself paid for, to be conveyed to the defendant as a gift to her. Evidence of the plaintiff tended to show that, the property having been called to the plaintiff\u2019s attention by the defendant\u2019s husband, the plaintiff on July 23 of a certain year procured an offer for it at a price which the husband had named, and gave to the husband a form of option made out for the defendant\u2019s signature; that, in response to a question by the husband at that time, the plaintiff stated that his commission would be two per cent, which the husband said would be satisfactory; that the defendant was absent at the time in a distant city and that the husband stated that he would send the option to her; that the wife did nothing until her return about two weeks later, and upon her return refused to sign the option, and that the -husband then said to the plaintiff, <em>\u201c </em>If my wife won\u2019t sign the deed, what can I do ? \u201d The husband testified in cross-examination that he had told his wife, when he sent the option to her by mail, not to sign it until she returned. The property was sold to the plaintiff\u2019s customer on August 29. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>evidence that the defendant notified the plaintiff that she repudiated the arrangement as to a commission made with her husband. The defendant and her husband testified that she was not told of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. <em>Held, </em>that the fact, of the existence of the relation of husband and wife between the defendant and him with whom the plaintiff dealt, in connection with the other facts in evidence, warranted a finding by the jury that the husband told the defendant of the arrangement made with the plaintiff as to commission, and that, therefore, since the defendant did not repudiate the arrangement, a finding was warranted that the defendant ratified it, the jury being at liberty to disbelieve the testimony to the effect that the defendant was not told of the plaintiff\u2019s employment by her husband.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b543-5\">At the trial of an action by a real estate broker against a married woman for a commission for procuring a sale of certain real estate, it appeared that negotiations as to the employment of a broker had been carried on between the broker and the husband of the defendant, that the broker procured a customer who was willing to pay \u00a715,000, the price set by the husband, that, the purchaser preferring that his name should not be known in the transaction, the plaintiff, without disclosing the name of the customer, proposed that the defendant should sign an option to sell the property to the plaintiff, and that the defendant refused to sign an option for a sale at the price mentioned. The plaintiff testified that the defendant\u2019s husband said to him that the defendant had been looking over his books which showed the business which he had been doing as a blacksmith on the real estate in question and was of the opinion that, if he moved to a location which he proposed to move to, he would lose money, and that the husband said to the plaintiff, \" She says that she won\u2019t do any business at present,\u201d that the plaintiff then disclosed to the husband the name of his customer, and that the husband said, \u201c I admit the price is good and everything is satisfactory as far as you and I are concerned, but if my wife won\u2019t sign the deed, what can I do ? \u201d There was evidence that afterwards the plaintiff was told to do nothing further about procuring a customer, and that in about a month the defendant sold the property to the same customer for \u00a718,000. <em>Held, </em>that the jury might have found that the defendant did not revoke the plaintiff\u2019s authority to sell before the plaintiff disclosed the name of the customer, but that the conversation of the husband with the plaintiff amounted only to a refusal to sell for \u00a715,000; and that a finding, that the revocation afterwards made was a revocation in bad faith, was warranted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b543-6\">If the owner of real estate employs a broker to sell it for him for \u00a715,000 and agrees to pay him \u201cthe usual two per cent commission,\u201d and the broker procures a purchaser at the price named and then the owner in bad faith revokes the broker\u2019s authority and himself sells the real estate to the customer whom the broker had procured for \u00a718,000, what was done after such revocation is in legal contemplation done while the broker\u2019s authority remains unrevoked, and the broker is entitled to a commission of two per cent of \u00a718,000, not of \u00a716,000 only.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b543-7\">If, through the efforts of a broker employed by the owner to sell real estate, negotiations between the owner and a customer reached a point where, except for a revocation of the broker\u2019s authority by the owner, a sale would have been consummated, and if subsequently the owner sells the property to the same customer at a higher price under circumstances which would warrant a finding that the previous revocation of the broker\u2019s authority was made in bad faith, in an action by the broker against the owner for his commission, the question of whether the broker was the efficient cause of the trade finally made does not arise, because it does not affect the broker\u2019s right to his commission.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Contract for \u00e1 commission as a broker for procuring a sale of real estate for the defendant.

The plaintiff testified that the husband then employed him as a broker to get a customer for them at the price of $15,000. The husband testified that the plaintiff wanted him to put a price on them at that time; that he refused to do so, but said, \u201c If any one gave me an offer of $15,000 I would consider it with my wife.\u201d In March, 1909, one Metcalf, an officer of the Farr Alpaca Company, \u201c came to \u201d the plaintiff to see if he had any land for sale fit for a manufacturing site for the Barlow Manufacturing Company. The Barlow Company was then occupying as tenant some land of the Alpaca Company, on which the Alpaca Company wished to construct a building for its own use, and the Alpaca Company wanted a lot for the Barlow Company to induce the Barlow Company to surrender the lease and move away. The plaintiff showed him the defendant\u2019s lot and then called upon the defendant\u2019s husband to see if the price remained unchanged. He was told by the husband that the price was unchanged. Thereupon he gave Mr. Metcalf $15,000 as the price. In July Metcalf told him that his company would like an option on the land at that price, but that he did not want the Alpaca Company to be known in the matter, as it would bring all the real estate brokers down on them. Whereupon the plaintiff prepared an option running to himself for $15,000 and took it to the husband, explaining to him (the husband) that the option ran to him (the plaintiff) because his customer did not want to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>be known in the matter. At that time the husband asked what the plaintiff\u2019s charge would be in case the deal went through, and the plaintiff told him the\" usual two per cent commission. To this the husband said that that would be satisfactory. As to this conversation there was no real dispute. The husband testified to it in substance. The husband then said in substance, \u201c This property is my wife\u2019s; she is in the West; I will send the option to her.\u201d The option was dated July 23, the day of this conversation. In this conversation the husband said that he made it a condition of the sale that the plaintiff should procure for his business of a blacksmith a property known as the Barlow lot. This Barlow lot had nothing to do with the Barlow Manufacturing Company. The plaintiff accordingly procured an option on this Barlow lot. Before that option had run out the defendant returned to Holyoke and refused to sign the option. The plaintiff testified that the husband told him that the reason why the defendant refused to sign the option was because she had been looking over his books and thought that if he moved his blacksmith business up to the Barlow lot he would lose local business which he then had to the amount of $800 to $1,000 a year. The plaintiff then said that his customer was the Alpaca Company, who wanted the defendant\u2019s land for the Barlow Company, who were tenants of land belonging to the Alpaca Company which the Alpaca Company wished to occupy themselves, and that no one else would pay as much. To which the husband answered: \u201c If my wife won\u2019t sign the deed, what can I do ? \u201d This was about the middle of August. On August 29 the husband and Metcalf agreed (subject to ratification by the defendant and the directors of the Alpaca Company) to a sale to that company for $18,000 and as much of the material of the building then occupied by the Barlow Company, which was to be torn down, as the husband should select for a new blacksmith shop. This was carried through on September 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">1. The second ruling asked for was rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The defendant\u2019s husband testified that he bought the land here in question \u201c and put it in my wife\u2019s name \u201d; that he put up the building which stood on it, occupied it for his business, and \u201c never paid any rent for the property to my wife or anything of that kind.\u201d That he paid taxes, water rates, expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>for repairs, painting, plumbing and insurance, out of his own money; \u201c I did not always consult my wife about these things, sometimes I did \u201d ; that all the negotiations for the sale to the Alpaca Company were conducted by him, and the $18,000 received from it went into his bank account. There was no evidence that the defendant ever did anything about the premises beyond her testimony and that of her husband that she refused to sign the $15,000 option and after some time finally consented to sell for $18,000 and the old building material. It is significant in this connection that while the husband told the plaintiff that it was for his wife to decide upon the acceptance of the $15,000 option and finally disposed of that offer by the remark \u201c If my wife won\u2019t sign the deed, what can I do,\u201d he testified on the stand that when he sent the $15,000 option to her in the west he told her not to sign it until she came home. This warranted a finding that although the legal title stood in her name she left the whole management of this land and building to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">2. The sixth ruling asked for was rightly refused. We are of opinion that although the jury could take the view just stated (that the defendant was the holder of the legal title only and left the whole management of the land and building to her husband) they could take the view that it was really a gift to the wife (see for example <em>Cooley </em>v. Cooley, 172 Mass. 476, 477; <em>Lufkin </em>v. Jakeman, 188 Mass. 528, 530). If they did take that view, the fact that they were husband and wife warranted a finding that the husband told his wife of the arrangement which he testified that he made in her behalf on July 23, 1909, with the plaintiff, for the usual commission of two per cent if the deal went through. If he did, there was evidence of a ratification. The defendant did not notify the plaintiff that she repudiated it. See in this connection <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>205 Mass. 80. The jury were at liberty to refuse to credit the testimony of the defendant and her husband that she was not told of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. <em>Lindenbaum </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>197 Mass. 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">3. The defendant has contended that there was no evidence of bad faith within the rule laid down in <em>Cadigan </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>186 Mass. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>There might be a question as to this point being open to the defendant under the exceptions taken at the trial. But it is apparent from the answer made by the jury to the question put to them by the presiding justice and from the amount of the verdict, when taken in connection with the instructions given by the judge, that the jury found that the defendant revoked the plaintiff\u2019s authority in bad faith. Under these circumstances it is more satisfactory to consider the point than to go into the niceties of the question whether it is or is not open to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that there could be no bad faith because the plaintiff did not disclose the name of his customer until after the defendant had revoked his authority. And she relies in this connection on <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>193 Mass. 582, where the broker did not at any time disclose his customer\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">But that contention is not well founded. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony was: That about a week after the date of the option the defendant\u2019s husband telephoned him that his wife \u201c didn\u2019t care about selling, and he said, \u2018 I am afraid we won\u2019t be able to go along with it by the way she feels at present.\u2019 \u201d That he went to the husband\u2019s office the next day and the defendant then told him that his wife had been looking over his books, that she found that if he moved to the Barlow lot he would lose $800 to $1,000 of business (as stated in the beginning of this opinion), and ended with these words: \u201c She says she won\u2019t do any business at present.\u201d That he, the plaintiff, then said he was sorry because his customer was the Alpaca Company, and that they wanted it for the Barlow Company, \u201c who occupy a property that they wish to occupy, a property they wish to occupy themselves \u201d ; and that he (the plaintiff) then added, \u201cI don\u2019t know any similar concern that would be willing to pay you $15,000 for the property,\u201d and the defendant ended the conversation with the remark, \u201cI admit the price is good, and everything is satisfactory as far as you and I are concerned, but if my wife won\u2019t sign the deed, what can I do?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">This was not (or at any rate could be found not to be) a revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s authority to sell, but a refusal to sell for the price of $15,000, which up to that time had been the defendant\u2019s price.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>It was the defendant\u2019s husband who testified that the plaintiff\u2019s authority was revoked. The husband testified that at this interview \u201c he [the plaintiff] said, \u2018 Since my efforts have been unsuccessful, I don\u2019t mind telling you who this property was for. It was for the Farr Alpaca people.\u2019 I said, 6 Don\u2019t do anything more about it.\u2019 I told him several times to do. no more about it.\u201d Even on the husband\u2019s testimony the plaintiff\u2019s authority was not revoked (or it could be found that it was not revoked) until after the plaintiff disclosed the name of his customer. And even if this were not so the jury were at liberty to give credit to the plaintiff\u2019s story that the defendant\u2019s husband had gone no farther than to withdraw the price of $15,000 before he told him the name of his customer; and to find that after this disclosure had been made he was told to do no more about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">There was abundant evidence of a revocation in bad faith, and the eleventh request for a ruling was rightly refused, since it assumed as a fact that the disclosure of the customer was made after the revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">4. The defendant took an exception \u201c to that part of the charge which was to the effect that if the authority of the plaintiff was revoked not in good faith, it was a prevention and the plaintiff might recover just as if he had found a purchaser who offered $15,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We are of opinion that this part of the charge was too favorable to the defendant. Where the principal revokes the broker\u2019s authority in bad faith in order to secure to himself the fruits of the broker\u2019s work without paying him for it, the revocation, being in fraud of the broker\u2019s rights, is of no effect so far as those rights and the trade subsequently made are concerned. In such a case what is subsequently done is in legal contemplation done while the broker\u2019s authority remains unrevoked. If the plaintiff\u2019s authority in the case at bar was revoked in bad faith, the plaintiff was entitled to two per cent on the price paid ($18,000 and the old building material) not two per cent \u201c as if he had found a purchaser who offered $15,000.\u201d Where a defendant prevents performance by the plaintiff, the plaintiff can sue, but if he sues, the amount which he is entitled to recover is not the same as if he had performed. See for example <em>Barrie </em>v. <em>Quinby, </em>206 Mass. 259, 267, 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The part of the charge excepted to was too favorable to the defendant, and this exception must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">5. Where the evidence warrants the jury in finding that the negotiations had progressed to such a point that a revocation of the broker\u2019s authority (if his authority is revoked) is made in bad faith, the question of the plaintiff\u2019s being the efficient cause of the trade subsequently made does not arise. The fact that through the broker\u2019s efforts the negotiations have reached the point where it can be found that his authority, if revoked, has been revoked in bad faith, is of itself a finding that he found the customer for his principal if his principal finally agrees on a price with the customer found by the broker. It is no part of the broker\u2019s duty to see to the making of the contract between his principal and the customer found by him. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Gilson, </em>176 Mass. 477, 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The exception to the refusal to give the fifth ruling asked for must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">6. The judge told the jury that the only purpose for which they could consider (1) the evidence that the husband told the plaintiff that there was no question but that the wife would sign the option because she generally did what he asked her, and (2) the evidence that the husband told the plaintiff that his wife had been looking over his books and had found out that he would lose $800 to $1,000 by moving his business to the Barlow lot, as he then proposed to do, was \u201c for the purpose of contradicting Mr. Casey\u2019s testimony and affecting his credibility.\u201d We are of opinion that these matters were material and therefore that the contradictory statements were competent on the witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
