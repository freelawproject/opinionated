Whether the circumstances are such as to call for the application of such an exception is a question of fact to be decided primarily by the presiding judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>whose decision thereon should not be set aside by this court unless it is plainly wrong.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b595-3\">In an action of tort against a railroad company for the loss of buildings of the plaintiff by fire, it appeared that the fire was communicated to the plaintiff\u2019s buildings from buildings of a third person between the plaintiff\u2019s buildings and the railroad, which evidence of the plaintiff tended to show were ignited by fire from a locomotive engine of the defendant, while the defendant contended that the origin of the fire was inside the buildings. The plaintiff produced only one witness who testified to seeing a fire start outside the buildings. It appeared that immediately after the fire the witness was advised to see the attorney for the defendant. In cross-examination he stated that all the circumstances of the fire always had been clear in his mind, and that he did not think that it was notice of a suit that made him think of seeing the defendant\u2019s attorney. \u2019 A letter written by him to the attorney of the defendant was introduced in evidence, which among other things stated that the witness understood that his name had been given \u201c as a witness,\u201d and that his idea in writing the letter, \u201c after seeing the notice of suit \u201d was to learn whether he was \u201c to be called in the case. If so, by whom and when <em>1 </em>\u201d He also stated in cross-examination that he interviewed the defendant\u2019s attorney, but denied that he then stated in substance that he was not clear as to the circumstances of the fire. A second letter from him to the defendant's attorney, written about eleven months after the first one, then was introduced in evidence, in which he again asked whether he was to be called as a witness in the case, and stated, \u201c I want to refresh my memory in quite a few little things that I have forgotten since the night it [the fire] happened.\u201d The witness in cross-examination told the same story as to the fire that he had told in direct examination. The plaintiff, \u201c to cut off any possible argument\u201d that the witness\u2019s testimony was \u201c of recent contrivance, or was the result of bias or of any suggestion made to him from any source, or that he was willing to testify for either side, depending upon the inducements held out to him,\u201d offered to show that immediately after the fire the witness related to a police officer the same account of it that he had given in his testimony. When the offer was made, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cAll I have done is to simply read two letters.\u201d The evidence offered was excluded. <em>Held, </em>without deciding whether the exclusion was or was not proper, that, if under the circumstances the presiding judge thought and was justified in thinking that one of the purposes of the defendant in introducing the letters was to show that the witness was corrupt and willing to vary his testimony according to the interest of the party by whom eventually he might be called, the corroborative evidence offered by the plaintiff should have been admitted, unless such purpose was disavowed; and that otherwise it should have been rejected.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b595-4\">In an action of tort against a railroad company for the loss of buildings of the plaintiff by fire, it appeared that the fire was communicated to the plaintiff's buildings from buildings of a third person between the plaintiff\u2019s buildings and the railroad, which evidence of the plaintiff tended to show were ignited by fire from a locomotive engine of the defendant, while the defendant contended that the origin of the fire was inside the buildings. The building of the third person which first caught fire was provided with electric light wires. A witness for the plaintiff, qualified as an expert, testified that he had inspected the wiring a few weeks before the fire, had made some few changes in it, and considered it perfectly safe. The owner of the building testified to changes and additions which had been made in the electric lighting before those made a few weeks before the fire, and stated that there had been no inspection of the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>lights by the city inspector, that the city inspector had not been notified of his intention to make the changes, and that he, the owner, knew nothing about the requirements of any city ordinance in that regard. The defendant then offered an ordinance which required notification of the city supervisor of wires before the making of any changes in wiring, and that such supervisor be given an opportunity to examine the wiring before it was covered or enclosed. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney objected, in the hearing of the jury, to the evidence, stating that he understood it to be \u201c offered so far as it has any tendency to control, if it does, the \u25a0 evidence that has been offered by the plaintiff that the electric wiring there is safe and as eliminating one probable cause of the fire.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney said nothing. The presiding judge admitted the evidence, stating, \u201cI should say it didn\u2019t have any broader scope than that, and I think ... it is competent in cross-examination of this witness without finally deciding what its limitations are.\u201d There was a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions. <em>Held, </em>that the ordinance had no bearing to show the actual condition of the electrical apparatus in the building in question, that it was inadmissible to characterize the act of the owner bf the building as illegal, or as an admission by him, since he was not a party to the action, and that it had no bearing on any of the issues of the trial and should have been excluded; and, <em>also, </em>that its admission harmed the plaintiff, because the jury properly might have understood from the statements of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and of the presiding judge, and from the silence of the defendant\u2019s attorney, that the evidence was admitted as bearing at least in some way on the probabilities whether the wires were in a safe condition.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-3\">Tort for loss of buildings of the plaintiff alleged to have been caused by fire communicated by a locomotive engine of the defendant. Writ dated March 19, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-4\">The case was tried before <em>Sanderson, </em>J. It appeared that the fire was communicated to the buildings of the plaintiff directly from the buildings of one Edward A. Cowee, which consisted of a grain mill, an elevator and a one-story storehouse attached thereto, and which were situated adjacent to and east of the tracks of the defendant and between them and Crescent Street in the -city of Worcester. The plaintiff\u2019s property was on the east side of Crescent Street, opposite the Cowee property. Cowee\u2019s storehouse was on the north side of his elevator and was erected upon posts, the floor being about four feet from the ground. There was more or less lumber, hay, straw and rubbish under and about the storehouse. The fire on Cowee\u2019s premises was discovered about four o\u2019clock in the morning of February 5,1909, the storehouse being the first to burn. Mo question was ;made but that the plaintiff\u2019s buildings caught fire from the burning Cowee buildings, and the origin of the Cowee fire was the issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The letter of April 14,1909, referred to in the opinion, from the witness Butler to Mr. Thayer, the defendant\u2019s counsel, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-3\">\u201cDear Sir: After the fire which destroyed the Webb Granite &amp; Construction Co., the officer who travels the beat told me that he had given my name as a witness, to some one who had called at police headquarters.

My idea in writing you is, after seeing the notice of suit being brought over the affair, I wish to know if I am to be called in the case? If so, by whom and when? Hoping you will pardon me if I have put you to any trouble in my questions, I am, very respectfully yours, James W.

The plaintiff offered Tisdale as a witness as to what that statement was. Upon the defendant\u2019s counsel objecting, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cThis evidence is now offered on account of the line of cross-examinatian of the witness Butler, and to cut off any possible argument of my friend that the story now told by Butler is of recent contrivance, or is the result of bias or of any suggestion made to him from any source, or that he was willing to testify for either side, depending upon the inducements held out to him. If that js not to be the argument, then the offer by Tisdale that Butler made the same statement to him the morning of the fire is, of course, entirely immaterial. If that is to be argued, then Tisdale\u2019s testimony becomes important and competent.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201c All I have done is to simply read two letters.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then stated further, \u201cWe offer to show by this witness that Butler made entirely the same statement while the fire was in progress.\u201d The presiding judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>then stated, <em>\u201c </em>You may be right in your offer, but it is excluded,\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated, \u201c I wish to save an exception to the exclusion of the statement made by Butler to Tisdale directly after the fire, offered for the purpose of corroborating Butler, and for the purpose of cutting off any argument on the lines I have stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-3\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-4\">There was a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b598-5\">6r. <em>S.

It is urged by the plaintiff that the credibility and good faith of the witness had been attacked by the defendant on cross-examination, and hence that the evidence offered should have been admitted to show that his testimony about the origin of the fire was not of recent fabrication. At the trial the main question actually in dispute was whether the fire started on the outside of Cowee\u2019s buildings or on the inside of them. Upon this question there was conflicting evidence. Unless the fire started on the outside there was no case for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Butler, who was called by the plaintiff and who \u201c was the only witness who testified to seeing a fire before the building caught,\u201d testified that when he first saw the fire it appeared to be \u201c on the ground, near the north side of . . . [Cowee\u2019s] . . . building,\u201d and that on the morning of the fire he was advised by some one that he ought to go up and see Mr. Thayer, the general attorney for the defendant; and that before going to see Mr. Thayer he \u201c first wrote to him.\u201d Upon cross-examination he testified in substance that he always had been of the opinion that when he first saw the fire \u201c it was on the ground \u201d; that \u201c everything connected with this . . . [had] . . . always been perfectly clear in . . . [his] . . . mind \u201d at all times; that the gentleman who told him he ought to go and see Mr. Thayer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>one Whiting, the operator in the tower of the Cowee building; and that he did not think it was the notice of a suit that first led him to think of seeing Mr. Thayer, although as to this he did not remember. The defendant then introduced the letter of April 14,1909. This letter seems to indicate that at the time it was written the witness knew of the suit. He further testified that after sending that letter he called upon Mr. Thayer. The cross-examination continued as follows: \u201c Q. Now, at that time, Mr, Butler, when I asked you about the fire, didn\u2019t you say that you would have to think the thing over a little? A. I said there was some matters that occurred there not really concluded in my mind. I would have to think it over, \u2014 a few of the actual facts. I didn\u2019t even remember the date of the fire. \u2014 Q. When you were asked where the fire occurred you said you was a good deal confused and wasn\u2019t clear in your mind, the morning you saw me, and didn\u2019t want to say ? A. No, sir, I remember speaking to you about the fire, and you asked how it looked and I said as if a piece of waste burning, \u2014 Q. Are you pretty sure of that ? A. Yes. \u2014 Q. Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to think it over before you made an answer ? A. Only used that term as an illustration so you wouldn\u2019t get the idea that \u2014 Q. But you did want to think the thing over before you wanted to make any answer to that ? A. I don\u2019t know what things you are trying to get at, \u2014 the thinking over part. \u2014 Q. I asked you about the fire, \u2014 if you didn\u2019t see the light, \u2014 and you wanted to think it over some. A. I don\u2019t remember thinking over\u2014 Q. This year \u20141910 \u2014 early in this year, you weren\u2019t perfectly clear about the fire were you, and all matters connected with it, in your mind? A. Well, I was always how and where I see the fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\">He further testified that without any further communication from Mr. Thayer he wrote to him the letter of March 5, 1910, which (omitting the formal parts) reads as follows: \u201c Will you kindly inform me if I am to be called in as a witness in that B. &amp; M.'case? Why I ask is that I would want to refresh my memory in quite a \"few little things that I have forgotten about since the night it happened \u201d; and that there was nothing about the fire in which he was not clear. He then testified as to the fire as he .had in his examination in chief, and that he had not seen the attorney for the plaintiff until a week or two before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>There is here no contradictory statement by the witness as to the cause of the fire. He testifies both in the examination in chief and in the cross-examination that, when he first saw it, it was on the ground and that it looked like the burning of a \u201c piece of waste.\u201d The most that can be said is that the first letter seems to indicate that his statement that he did not call upon Mr. Thayer in consequence of the suit was not true, and the second letter that he had forgotten a \u201c few little things \u201d that happened on the night of the fire. The evidence subsequently offered by the plaintiff had no tendency to show whether or not the visit of the witness to Thayer was after notice of the suit or in consequence of such notice (apparently an immaterial matter in any event), or that the witness had not forgotten a few things, or what the things were which he might have forgotten. The evidence was offered however \u201c on account of the line of cross-examination of the witness Butler, and to cut off ,any possible argument . . . that the story now told by Butler is of recent contrivance, or is the result of bias or of any suggestion made to him from any source, or that he was willing to testify for either side, depending upon the inducements held out to him,\u201d and further, \u201c for the purpose of corroborating Butler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\">The general rule concerning the admission of previous statements for the purpose of corroborating a witness, with its exceptions, was quite fully considered in <em>Commonwealths. Tucker, </em>189 Mass. 457, and it was there said: \u201c The general rule [excluding such statements] is founded upon sound policy. The corroborative evidence, even when admitted, can have, at most, only a very indirect bearing upon the credibility of the witness, while from its very nature it may be likely to influence the jury as substantive evidence of its own truthfulness. And since the danger that the evidence will have such an illegitimate influence is so great, it is important that the general rule should be adhered to unless the case appears clearly within the exception \u201d (p. 484). And further it was said in substance, that whether the course of the trial had been such as to bring the case within any Exception to the general rule was a question of fact to be decided primarily by the presiding judge. \u201c His decision upon such a question ought not to be set aside by an appellate court unless it is plainly wrong. To use a common expression, . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the admission or exclusion of such testimony rests largely in the discretion of the trial court \u201d (p. 485).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">If under the circumstances existing at the time the evidence in question was offered, including the colloquy which then took place between the opposing counsel, the presiding judge thought and was justified in thinking that one of the purposes of the defendant in introducing the letters was to show that the witness Butler was corrupt and willing to vary his testimony according to the interest of the party by whom he eventually might be called, then the evidence should have been admitted to meet this attack unless this purpose was disavowed. Otherwise the evidence should have been rejected. In view of the conclusion to which we have come upon the other exception it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the ruling excluding the evidence was correct. Inasmuch, however, as the question might arise upon a future trial, we have thought it well to state some of the principles applicable to the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">2. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the fire started in the storehouse at the northern end of the Cowee building and upon the outside of it; and that it spread from there to other parts of the building. The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that at first it was an \u201c inside fire and started high up on the inside of the mill and elevator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">One possible way in which a fire might have started upon the inside was through defects in electric lighting installed in the building. Wilbur, an expert electrician called by the plaintiff, testified in substance that a few weeks before the fire, which occurred on February 5, 1909, he made some changes in the electric apparatus in some parts of the building and inspected the wiring in the storehouse, and that he considered it perfectly safe. Cowee, the owner of the plant, called by the plaintiff, was examined as to the condition of his buildings at the time of the fire without touching on the subject of electric wiring. On cross-e'Xamination he testified that the wiring was put into the plant in December, 1903; that then only nine lights were installed; that between that time and December 24,1908, the time of the inspection by Wilbur, additional lights were put into the plant, but that the witness got no permit from the city of Worcester to make this addition, and that there had been no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>inspection of these additional lights by the city inspector; that this officer was hot notified of the intention to make these changes, but the witness thought that after the changes were made this officer was notified to inspect it; that the witness knew nothing about the requirements of any city ordinance; that there never was any change \u201c.made with the original installation \u201d in the storehouse; that after the inspection by Wilbur on December 24, 1908, there was no change in any part of the plant; and that the wires in the storehouse never were \"covered or enclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">At the close of Cowee\u2019s testimony counsel for the defendant offered and the presiding judge admitted the ordinance in question, which provides in substance that all electrical appliances shall be arranged and maintained to the satisfaction of the supervisor of wires, and that before any changes are made the supervisor shall be notified, who shall be given an opportunity to inspect the wires and fixtures before they are covered or .enclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">The ordinance was not admissible to show the actual physical condition of the electrical apparatus. It had no bearing on that. Nor was it admissible to show that Cowee had committed an illegal act. He was no party to the suit; and the question was not whether the apparatus was there in violation of law, or in an unlawful condition, but whether it was there at all and in what physical condition. Nor was it admissible as furnishing a ground for argument that Cowee\u2019s failure to meet the requirements as to notice to and inspection by the official supervisor was in the nature of an admission that the wiring was so defective that he dared not have it officially inspected, and was not safe even in his own mind. Cowee not being a party to the suit his admissions could not be introduced unless they contradicted his testimony as a witness. Indeed there does not seem to be any way in which the ordinance could have any legitimate bearing on the issues on trial. It was plainly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">It is argued, however, that, even if that be so, still the record does not show that the plaintiff was harmed by its admission. It is said that Wilbur testified that all electric wiring within the city limits was inspected by the city supervisor, and that the ordinance did not add substantially anything to the evidence be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>fore the jury. But in view of what occurred at the time it was admitted this position does not seem tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">When the ordinance was offered, the counsel for the plaintiff in stating his objection to its admission used the following language : \u201c I understand that [it] is offered so far as it has any tendency to control, if it does, the evidence that has been offered by the plaintiff that the electric wiring there was safe and as eliminating one probable cause of the fire.\u201d Counsel for the defendant said nothing, but the presiding judge said, \u201c I do not know as I will rule definitely on it. I should say it didn\u2019t have any broader scope than that, and I think I said I thought it was competent in the cross-examination of this witness without finally deciding what its limitations were.\u201d All this was said in the presence of the jury. It does not appear that the matter was afterwards alluded to during the trial, or that the limitations were afterwards defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We think from this colloquy between counsel and court and the silence of the counsel for the defendant, that the jury properly may have understood that the ordinance was admitted as bearing at least in some way on the probabilities whether the wires were in a safe condition. The ordinance was wrongly admitted and it cannot be said that it was not prejudicial to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
