J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIv\">This is an appeal from a decree of the Superior Court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> dismissing a libel for divorce and revoking a previous decree for alimony. The appeal was not taken until twenty-one days after the entry of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">By Rule 44 of the Superior Court it is provided that, \u201c in cases where a question may be taken to the Supreme Judicial Court by appeal, for which no time is fixed by statute, the appeal shall be taken by a claim therefor in writing filed in the case within twenty days after the order or ruling is made from which the appeal is claimed.\u201d This case is not one of those in which thirty days is allowed for taking the appeal by the R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">It is contended that it is within the R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 19, which allows thirty days after the entry of the final decree in a suit in equity in which to take an appeal. But this section applies only to appeals in suits in equity. A libel for a divorce is not a suit in equity. It belongs on the law side of the court. The appellant refers to R. L. c. 152, \u00a7 29, which provides that the court may, \u201cif the course of proceeding is not specially pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>scribed, hear and determine all matters coming within the purview of this chapter according to the course of proceeding in ecclesiastical courts or in courts of equity, and may issue process of attachment and of execution and all other proper and necessary processes.\u201d This does not make libels for divorce suits in equity. It authorizes methods of hearing and determining the cases, and the issuing of process in such a way as is adapted to the nature of the proceeding.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b472-11\"><em>W. A. Davenport 3? H. D. Ward, </em>for the libellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aq9\">No counsel appeared for the libellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In determining whether a divorce shall be granted, the course of proceeding in the ecclesiastical courts may be adopted. In different parts of the chapter authority is given to deal with rights of property. In the R. L. c. 152, \u00a7 33, the right of the court to appoint trustees to hold property for the use of the wife or children is recognized. In \u00a7 32 it is provided that security for the payment of alimony may be required. In some of these matters the course of proceeding in equity is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The appellant also refers to \u00a7 31 of the same chapter, which gives the court power to \u201c enforce decrees made for allowance, for alimony or for allowance in the nature of alimony, in the same manner as it may enforce decrees in equity.\u201d This language distinguishes these decrees, made in divorce proceedings, from decrees in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">In <em>Ingalls </em>v. Ingalls, 150 Mass. 57, it was said that Pub. Sts. c. 151, \u00a7 13, relative to appeals in equity, was not applicable to an appeal in a suit for divorce. Libels for divorce are now, as they always have been in this Commonwealth, proceedings at law under statutes, and the R. L. c. 159, \u00a7 19, relative to appeals in suits in equity, has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The appeal, not having been taken seasonably, must be</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The case was submitted on briefs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-15\"> Made by <em>Schofield, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
