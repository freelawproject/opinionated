It was reversible error for the trial court to assign the employed counsel of defendant Beck to represent defendant Fernandez, because their interests conflicted, thereby depriving defendant Fernandez of a trial conformable to the requirements of due process of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Snyder, 297 </em>N. Y. 81; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>35 Misc. 189; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.

I. 141; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>251 App. Div. 40; <em>Von Moltke </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>332 U. S. 708.) II. The trial court should have excluded Fernandez\u2019 alleged confession as a matter of law. In any event, the court failed adequately to instruct the jury with respect to Fernandez\u2019 contention that the confession was induced by promises of immunity made to him by the prosecuting authorities of Michigan and New York. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Bayer, </em>331 U.

The trial court\u2019s summary rejection of thirty-two jurors on the People\u2019s challenges for cause was in direct contravention of the explicit provisions of subdivision 8 of section 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and requires a reversal of this judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carolin, </em>115 N.

It was an abuse of discretion for the Trial Judge to permit defendant Fernandez to be questioned twice on separate occasions concerning a similar crime in Michigan. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pettanza, </em>207 N.

It was prejudicial error to receive in evidence the confession of defendant Beck made to the psychiatrists who were sent by the District Attorney, without the knowledge or consent of her counsel, to conduct a mental examination of her in jail. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>287 N.

Prejudicial reversible error was committed by the Trial Judge in rejecting prospective jurors over counsel\u2019s objection and exception solely by reason of their opposition to capital punishment. (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 377, 380; <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>101 N. Y. 234; <em>People </em>v. <em>McQuade, </em>110 N.

Introduction into evidence of alleged unsigned, unread, unseen confessions of defendant Beck, the result of a relentless and persistent long process of questioning and the product of sustained pressure and promises, while at the same time denying to her the right of family, friends and counsel, and the failure to advise her of her constitutional rights, including the right to remain silent, violated section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and constituted a denial of due process of law under the State Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>297 U.

The issue of the voluntariness of the confessions was improperly submitted to,the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mummiani, </em>258 N. Y. 394.) IV. It was reversible error highly prejudicial to defendants for the trial court to limit examination of the former District Attorney of Nassau County and the Nassau County police official and permit expressions of opinion by prosecution witnesses as to the particular cause of death. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gleitsmann, </em>361 Ill. 165; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rongetti, </em>338 Ill. 56; <em>Matter of Hopkins, </em>172 N.

The trial court\u2019s interruptions of counsel, its extended cross-examination of defendants, its comments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>questions calculated to ridicule defendants and defendants\u2019 attorney, its curtailment of examination were so prejudicial as to deprive defendants of a fair and impartial trial and constitute reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>202 N.

The evidence establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that defendants, each aiding and abetting the other, killed Mrs. Fay; and further, that the killing was an intentional, deliberate and premediated act of defendants. II. The confessions of defendants were properly received in evidence, were properly submitted to the jury, and were properly found to be voluntary and not made under any promise of immunity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>246 N. Y. 409; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>224 N. Y. 90.) III. Defendants had a fair trial and there is no reversible error in the record. IV. There is no merit in the claim that the assignment of Mr. Rosenberg as attorney for defendant Fernandez, at the commencement of the trial, constitutes reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>216 N.

An autopsy disclosed a fractured larynx and two head wounds which penetrated the cranial cavity and pierced those membranes which overlie the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The body was that of Janet J. Fay who had met her death in a manner, presently to be described, which has given rise to this criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The two defendants-appellants Raymond Martinez Fernandez and Martha Jule Beck now stand convicted of murder in the first degree upon an indictment by a Grand Jury of Nassau County which charged that on or about January <em>4, </em>1949, in the town of Hempstead, Nassau County, each of the defendants \u201cthen and there aiding and abetting the other, wilfully, feloniously, and of malice aforethought, killed one Janet J. Fay by then and there striking [her] with a hammer, and * * * strangling [her] with a * * * scarf * *</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">By reason of local prejudice aroused in Nassau County against the defendants, the venue was moved to Bronx County where a trial of ten weeks\u2019 duration produced a record of more than 4,000 pages which we now review.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Briefly as to the life background of the two defendants prior to events which immediately preceded the homicide:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The defendant Fernandez was thirty-four years old at the time of the trial. Born in Hawaii of Spanish parents he was brought as a child to the United States where he lived until 1932 when he was taken by his mother to Spain and there was married at the age of seventeen. Four children have since been born of that marriage to a wife who still resides in Spain. After working oU lands owned by his father in Spain and later being engaged in combat service in the Spanish revolution, Fernandez returned in 1946 to the United States without his family. While employed with a construction company in Brooklyn he joined a \u201cLonely Hearts Club\u201d by which he was put in touch by correspondence with numerous women, one being the defendant Beck, whom he met personally in December, 1947, at her home in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The defendant Martha Jule Beck \u2014 twenty-nine years old at the time of the trial \u2014 was born in Florida where during the years of her high school education she demonstrated more than average proficiency and had become the librarian of a women\u2019s club. Later, after graduating from the Pensacola School of Nursing, she became a registered nurse in which capacity she rendered service in Florida and subsequently held responsible positions in hospitals in California and Arizona. In the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>time, during her girlhood and later, she had been the victim of a number of sexual experiences one of which was productive of her first child born out of wedlock in September, 1944. Three months later she married Alfred Beck, who was not the father of her child, and who, unbeknown to her, had been married and was then the father of four children. After learning of his prior marriage she left Beck and in December, 1945, gave birth to her second child of whom Beck was the father. Thereafter, in March, 1947, she was divorced from Beck.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">As already noted, Mrs. Beck first met the defendant Fernandez in Florida in December, 1947, as a result of communications which had come to her through a correspondence club. Thereafter Mrs. Beck came to New York City where, except for brief periods, she lived with Fernandez until December 17,1948, when they rented an apartment in a house at 15 Adeline Place, Valley Stream, Nassau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">During those months of 1948 while they were living together Fernandez, with the knowledge of Mrs. Beck, maintained his correspondence with women whose names he procured from Lonely Hearts Clubs and similar correspondence organizations. In fact he met and married two of those women and he visited others.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">On December 26, 1948, the Lonely Hearts Club correspondence \u2014 which Fernandez conducted under the name of \u201cCharles Martin\u201d \u2014 was rewarded by a letter from Albany, New York, written by Mrs. Janet J. Fay in reply to a letter from Fernandez in which he had given a description of himself and had invited further communication with her. In her answer Mrs. Fay in turn not only gave a description of herself \u2014 a widow, forty-one years old, attractive, height five feet four inches, weight 135 pounds, whose hobby was dancing \u2014 but also invited Fernandez to come to Albany.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In response to Mrs. Fay\u2019s invitation to Fernandez, he and Mrs. Beck on December 29,1948, drove to Albany where he went alone to Mrs. Fay\u2019s apartment and there introduced himself as \u201cCharles Martin.\u201d Several days later he took Mrs. Beck to call upon Mrs. Fay at which time he introduced Mrs. Beck as his sister. During those days at Albany Fernandez and Mrs. Fay met frequently at some of which meetings Mrs. Beck was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>present when there were demonstrations of something more than a platonic interest by Mrs. Fay for Fernandez. Those visits also were productive of conversation which at times was directed to financial matters with the result that on Monday, January 3, 1949, Mrs. Fay and Fernandez went to various Albany banks from which she drew out funds in the form of cash and cashier\u2019s checks which in total amount exceeded $4,000, all of which she turned over to Fernandez. On that same day the defendants drove Mrs. Fay from Albany to their recently rented apartment at 15 Adeline Place in Valley Stream, Nassau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">When they entered the apartment Fernandez noticed a number of pictures which previously had been hung in the living room had fallen to the floor. He then found a hammer with which he nailed the pictures back to the wall and placed the hammer on a chair in that room. Later, while Mrs. Beck was in the kitchen arranging for dinner Mrs. Fay and Fernandez prepared letters to be sent to Mrs. Fay\u2019s friends in Albany. These preparations were accomplished by writing diagonally across each letter sheet in large characters the word \u201c Surprise \u201d under which Mrs. Fay inscribed her signature. As to those single-worded notes signed by Mrs. Fay the fact should be noted at this point that, according to undisputed testimony by Fernandez, within two days thereafter \u2014 on a date <em>following </em>the homicide \u2014 the word \u201c Surprise \u201d appearing on each sheet was eradicated by the defendants and over Mrs. Fay\u2019s signatures were typewritten several notes to her Albany friends telling how happy and contented she was with \u201cCharles\u201d. In one of those post-mortem notes which bore the signature of Mrs. Fay, the writer \u2014 the defendant Fernandez \u2014 inserted the following statements among others: \u201c * * * I am all excited and having the most wonderful time of my life. I never felt as happy before. I soon will be Mrs. Martin and then we will go to Florida for the winter. * * * I am so happy and contented for Charles is so good and nice to me and also his family. They have done everything to make me feel comfortable and at home. * * * I really do miss you all but, I am sure that my prayers have been granted to me by sending this wonderful man to me. - - - Cod bless you all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>While Mrs. Fay was signing the sheets of paper upon which the single word \u201c Surprise \u201d was written, she also complied with a request by Fernandez that she indorse the checks on Albany banks which she had previously delivered to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We are thus brought to the several versions of the homicide given by the two defendants. There were received in evidence as part of the People\u2019s case \u2014 over objections presently to be considered \u2014 statements by the defendants in the nature of confessions made in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the defendants were apprehended. We postpone consideration of those statements and give those versions most favorable to the defendants as recorded by their testimony when called as witnesses in their own defense. First the description of the killing and related incidents according to testimony by the defendant Fernandez: As there was only one bedroom available at the defendants\u2019 apartment the sleeping arrangements made for Mrs. Fay on the night of January 3,1949, called for her occupying with Mrs. Beck a double bed in the bedroom and for Fernandez to sleep on a couch in the living room. Passing over his description of what occurred as the three made ready for the night, Fernandez testified that there came a time between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. of January 4, 1949, when he was awakened by Mrs. Fay who had entered the living room and was kneeling at the side of his Couch. Being unable to persuade her to leave the living room he went into the bedroom where he asked the defendant Beck to do what she could to \u201cquiet Mrs. Fay and put her to bed.\u201d When Mrs. Beck left her bed and was about to enter the living room Fernandez, after telling her that he would go into the bathroom, stated \u201cI told her as soon as I heard both women go back to bed I would leave the bathroom and go to sleep again.\u201d After remaining in the bathroom for a period of five or ten minutes\u2014 during which time he heard \u201cmurmurs of somebody speaking\u201d but could not \u201cdistinguish anything\u201d \u2014 Fernandez entered the living room where he found Mrs. Beck standing erect and Mrs. Fay crouched over a suitcase. His testimony as to what he then saw and did is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cI saw her head [Mrs. Fay\u2019s] was all splattered with blood. The suitcase was full of blood. On the floor was a great big puddle of blood. And as I saw that \u2014 I mean I stopped at the door. I saw that from view [sic] as I walked in. I rushed over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>to Mrs. Beck. She was standing straight just looking down at Mrs. Fay and no movement, she didn\u2019t say a word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">\u201cI shook her and I said: \u2018Mrs. Beck \u2014 \u2019 I said: \u2018Martha, what has happened?\u2019 She come out of something like a daze \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was a daze or coma, whatever it was, and she looked down and she says: \u2018 My God! \u2019 She says: \u2018 What has happened? \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cI said: \u2018You ought to know better than I do.\u2019 I told her right there if she could do something, take her to a hospital or a doctor, drive her down. She got on her knees and took her pulse, or whatever it was, I don\u2019t know, and told me, she said: \u2018It\u2019s too late. There is nothing we can do for her. She is dead. \u2019 \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Fernandez testified further that when Mrs. Beck told him that Mrs. Fay was dead he \u201cwent into a hysteric\u201d, drank liquor from bottles which were near at hand and began to cry; that while he was in that condition Mrs. Beck came over to him and said: \u201c \u2018Well, there is no use getting that way. There is nothing we can do.\u2019 \u201d Then, according to his testimony, \u201cwe decided of [sic] getting rid of the body.\u201d It is his testimony that he heard no \u201csound or moan or groan from Mrs. Fay\u201d; that he did not strangle her, although he admits having put a scarf around her neck to stop the blood which was \u201cgushing out of her head and to stop that bleeding so it wouldn\u2019t get all over the place in handling her\u201d. The defendants then tried to put the body of Mrs. Fay into a trunk which proved too small for that purpose. Lacking a trunk of sufficient size they put the body in a closet and a few hours later drove \u201cdown town\u201d where they first made an unsuccessful attempt at a Wall Street bank to cash a $2,000 check given to Fernandez the night before by Mrs. Fay and later purchased a trunk large enough to accommodate her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">During the ten days following the death of Mrs. Fay the defendants searched for a house which \u201chad a yard or garage or cellar or something where I [Fernandez] can dig a hole in the ground and put her body. \u2019 \u2019 After trips to Bridgeport and other communities along U. S. Route No. 1 they found a house at South Ozone Park which met their requirements. Meanwhile the large trunk containing Mrs. Fay\u2019s body remained in the defendants\u2019 Adeline Place apartment for three days and was then removed by them to the home of a sister of Fernandez where he knew he would find a spade and shovel. About ten days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the homicide he put those tools and the trunk into his car and drove the load to the house he had recently rented in South Ozone Park. There in the cellar he broke through the cement flooring and beneath it dug a hole into which he lowered the body of Mrs. Fay. He then covered the earthen refill with cement and left the place. There is testimony that after the homicide \u2014 which Fernandez referred to as \u201cthe occurrence of Mrs. Janet Fay\u201d \u2014 he and Mrs. Beck planned to go to Alaska. In line with that plan they drove on January 20, 1949, to Chicago where they stayed for a few days and then motored to Grand Rapids, Michigan. There \u2014 on the night of February 28, 1949\u2014 at the home of Mrs. Delphine Downing at 3435 Byron Center Road where they had rented accommodations, they were taken into custody by detectives from the local department of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The testimony given upon the trial by the defendant Fernandez does not differ in important details from that given by Mrs. Beck, except her account of the death of Mrs. Fay, which in substance was as follows: The time is about 11:00 p.m. on January 3, 1949, after Mrs. Fay had been driven by Mrs. Beck and Fernandez from Albany to the defendants\u2019 Valley Stream apartment. They had spent the evening there and Fernandez had suggested that it was time to prepare for the night. At midnight they were all asleep \u2014 after each of the two women had sauntered back and forth several times from their bedroom to the living room where Fernandez was to sleep. A few hours later, however, Mrs. Fay awoke and started a conversation which annoyed Mrs. Beck. In those circumstances Mrs. Fay, under a pretext of going to the kitchen for a drink of water, went instead into the living room. In a brief time \u2014 between 3:30 and 4:00 a.m. of January 4, 1949 \u2014 Fernandez came into the bedroom where he complained of Mrs. Fay\u2019s conduct and stated: \u201c \u2018I am going in the bathroom and you go and talk to her and bring her back to bed.\u2019 \u201d Responding to that request Mrs. Beck entered the living room where she observed Mrs. Fay lying on the couch. As to what then occurred Mrs. Beck testified \u25a0 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201cQ. And how was she [Mrs. Fay] dressed? A. She was completely nude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">Q. Was she alive then? A. She most certainly was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Q. What did you say when you entered that room? A. When I walked to the door there and I looked in and I saw her in that position and in the nude, I says, \u2018My gosh, Janet, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">She jumped up. She picked up her gown that was lying on the floor in front of the couch and she slipped that over her head and put the robe on and she says: \u2018I wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">Q. What did you say to her then? A. I said: \u2018I can see that by your appearance, that you certainly wasn\u2019t. \u2019 I said: \u2018What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">She says, \u2018Well, I was expecting Ray to come in the door. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">And I said, \u2018For a woman of your age, you\u2019re the hottest bitch that I have ever seen.\u2019 * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">Q. What made you say that? A. I was just burning up with jealousy and anger at the thought of what she was attempting to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">Q. Now, what did she say when you said that to her? A. When I said that, she rushed over towards me and drew back her fist and slapped me.

She was dead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The foregoing testimony given by the defendants on the trial makes clear their claim that the death of Mrs. Fay occurred after she sustained blows on the head from an instrument which penetrated her skull but before a scarf had been bound around her neck. In that important aspect the defendants\u2019 testimony at the trial differs from their previous confessions \u2014 given to Michigan authorities after their apprehension in that State'\u2014 which confessions were received in evidence as a part of the People\u2019s ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In her confession of March 3, 1949, Mrs. Beck stated in substance that at that early morning hour of January 4,1949, while she and Mrs. Fay were engaged in the angry conversation which took place in the living room where Fernandez had been sleeping, Mrs. Fay said to her that after she and Fernandez were married Mrs. Beck would have to move out. Upon hearing that statement Mrs. Beck picked up the hammer which was in a chair near at hand and struck Mrs. Fay on the \u201cback of the head.\u201d When Mrs. Fay, still moaning, dropped down from the kneeling position in which she had been, \u201cI [Mrs. Beck] said Bay, and I hit her again.\u201d While Mrs. Fay was still moaning and groaning, bleeding \u201cterribly\u201d, and after Fernandez had taken her by the throat with his \u201cbare hands\u201d in an attempt \u201cto keep her quiet\u201d, and she \u201ccontinued to moan\u201d Mrs. Beck reached for a scarf and placed it around Mrs. Fay\u2019s neck. Fernandez then tied it in a knot and after putting the end of the hammer through the scarf, he used it as a tourniquet and \u201ckept twisting .it.\u201d When Mrs. Beck was asked <em>\u20181 </em>What did you think he was doing ? \u2019 \u2019 her answer was: \u201cTo keep her quiet as she was groaning. Q. Did you realize what you were doing? A. Certainly, we both realized then we had gone so far that we would have to\u2014 Q. Kill her? A. Yes. Q. When you did that did she stop moaning? A. Yes, that is when we laid her out on her back here, approximately the center of the room between two chairs. Q. Then what did you do? A. I straightened up and said, oh, my God, darling, what have we done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Eight days after Mrs. Beck made the confession mentioned above and after conferring with her counsel appointed by the Michigan court, she was granted at her own request an opportunity to correct that part of her statement which referred to the use made of a hammer at the time of Mrs. Fay\u2019s death. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>describing motions made to her at that time by Fernandez, which indicated that he wanted her to get a hammer which was in the kitchen, Mrs. Beck stated: \u201c* * * Bay [Fernandez] motioned to the kitchen and did like that and I took it for granted that he motioned for me to go and get the hammer which I did and brought it back. I had on a housecoat and I held the hammer in my sleeve next to my arm. Then I went in and held it out to Bay and he said no, you have got to do it. I said I can\u2019t. We were saying it very low because she was talking then as to getting out of the house. He said you have got to do it and I said I can\u2019t. He said if you love me you will do it. That is when I hit her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">A confession by Fernandez was also given to Michigan authorities on March 3, 1949. The portion of that confession which describes the death of Mrs. Fay in the early morning of January 4,1949, is as follows: Fernandez has described how he left Mrs. Fay in the living room and had gone into the bedroom where he complained to Mrs. Beck that Mrs. Fay had interrupted his sleep at that early morning hour:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cQ. Did you say anything to Martha [Mrs. Beck] ? A. Yes, I did. I said see how you can keep'that woman quiet, no matter how it is and when I got back she had kept her quiet by hitting her on the head with a hammer. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">Q. Where was the body at that time? A. Bight here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">Q. Indicating where the suitcase was. Was she lying down? A. Flat on the floor and she was bleeding. I could hear blood dripping and she was moaning at that time. She dropped down and Martha was there and she called me and I came running and turned around and that bottle of whiskey was there and I drank it all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">Q. Wasn\u2019t that after? A. No. Then I came back and I helped her. She said to finish it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">Q. Where was the white scarf then? A. It must have been on my clothes, on the chair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">Q. Did Martha hand you that scarf? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-12\">Q. Where was the scarf when you came in? A. Don\u2019t remember exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-13\">Q. Did Martha have the scarf or was it still on the chair when you came in? A. I am not sure. I knew I put it around her neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Q. How did you tie it? A. We turned it around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Q. With what? A. Now, 1 got it. That question has been jumping at me hundreds of times. It was the hammer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">Q. The hammer? A. Yes, it was twisted with the hammer. Now I know. She had it tied on already, the scarf, and I put it in between the scarf and twisted it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">Q. Was that hammer already in there at that time when you came in the living room or did you put the hammer back. A. Don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">Q. Did you insert the hammer into the scarf? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">Q. And you turned it just as you would a tourniquet? Turning it around, tightening it around the throat ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">Q. Have you any idea how many times you turned that? A. Used a lot of strength to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">Q. Did she finally stop moaning? A. Don\u2019t know when she stopped. Went out and left again and came back in a few minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">The inconsistancies between defendants\u2019 confessions and their testimony given at the trial, quoted in part above, presented for the triers of the facts the important question whether the death of Mrs. Fay occurred before or after Fernandez applied to her neck his bare hands and a tourniquet. On that phase of the case witnesses were produced by both the prosecution and the defense. The prosecution called the assistant medical examiner of Queens County who performed an autopsy upon the body of Mrs. Fay after it was exhumed from beneath the cellar floor of the South Ozone Park house. In the course of that autopsy the medical examiner removed a scarf which had been knotted tightly around the victim\u2019s neck. The autopsy disclosed two head wounds, one over the right side at about the midline and the other slightly to the back of the head. The shape of one wound was rectangular and the other triangular, each of which wounds broke through the scalp, the bone of the skull and entered the cranial cavity. There was also disclosed a fracture of the larynx or windpipe. Based upon his findings at the autopsy and upon his experience and his judgment gained therefrom, the medical examiner stated his opinion to be that the fracture of the larynx occurred before the victim\u2019s death; that, although either the skull fractures or the fractured larynx would eventually have caused death, a person who had sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>such skull fractures would live for some <em>time </em>\u2014 \u201ca matter of minutes or might be hours\u201d \u2014 while the fracture of the larynx would cause the death within <em>\u201ca </em>few minutes at the very uppermost\u201d. On cross-examination counsel for the defendants adduced from the medical examiner the statement that in his opinion Mrs. Fay met her death within three minutes after the alleged strangulation. Upon this same question \u2014 whether the death of Mrs. Fay occurred before or after strangulation \u2014 the defendants called as their witness a physician who had been chief medical examiner of Nassau County for more than ten years and who was present at the autopsy performed upon the body of the decedent. In response to questions addressed to him on direct examination this witness for the defendants stated that in his opinion Mrs. Fay\u2019s death was not caused by fractures of the skull but by strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">A ruling which both defendants now assert constituted reversible error was made during the impanehnent of the jury. The selection of the jury was from three panels totaling more than six hundred veniremen and was accomplished in twelve court days. When that impanelment was completed declarations had been made in behalf of the People and the two defendants that each juror was satisfactory. In the meantime, however, counsel for the defendants, by appropriate objections, motions \"for mistrial and exceptions, had preserved the point now made in their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">1 The argument is that error prejudicial to the defendants\u2019 rights resulted from rulings by the Trial Justice on the <em>voir dire </em>examination when thirty-two challenges for cause made by the District Attorney were sustained upon the ground that the veniremen so challenged had indicated, by voice or upraised hand, in response to inquiry by the court or by the District Attorney, that they were opposed to capital punishment. The following excerpt from the record \u2014 covering an instance favorable to the defendants\u2019 position \u2014 will make clear the circumstances in which this point arose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cBy Mr. Robinson [the assistant district attorney]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">Q. Madam and you gentlemen that have just been called, I think you have sat here and listened to all the names and so forth. Are any of you opposed to capital punishment? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>A. (Talesmen Keck, Manghise and Cooperman raise their hands.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Mr. Robinson: Three. I challenge you all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">Mr. Rosenberg [counsel for defendants]: If your Honor please, may I be permitted to question these jurors concerning their principles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">The Court: No. When the jurors state they are opposed to capital punishment, the jurors are legally disqualified from sitting in a case of this character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">Mr. Rosenberg: May I state the reasons why I want to question the jurors ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">The Court: No; because it is not necessary. The mere statement by the three talesmen, that they are opposed to capital punishment, is sufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">Mr. Rosenberg: They still may have no conscientious scruples from rendering the death verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">The Court: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">Mr. Rosenberg: I take an exception to your Honor\u2019s refusal to permit me to examine these jurors. My exception is noted to your Honor\u2019s ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The grounds for challenge of a venireman for implied bias are set forth in section 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">\u201c\u00a7 377. <em>Grounds of challenge for implied bias. </em>A challenge for implied bias may be taken for all or any of the following causes, and for no other: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">\u201c8. If the crime charged be punishable with death, the entertaining of such conscientious opinions as would preclude his finding the defendant guilty; in which case he shall neither be permitted nor compelled to serve as a juror.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Under that statute the court is required in a capital case to exclude from the jury any venireman who may, on the <em>voir dire </em>examination, indicate that he has such conscientious opinions as would preclude him from returning a verdict of guilty. That section, however, does not require the court to permit service on the jury of veniremen who state that their conscientious opinions will not prevent them from returning a verdict of guilty. In such circumstances the court may exercise the statutory discretion with which it is endowed by section 376 <em>id. </em>That statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u201c\u00a7 376. <em>Particular causes of challenge. </em>Particular causes of challenge are of two kinds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201c1. For such a bias, as, when the existence of the facts is ascertained, does in judgment of law disqualify the juror, and which is known in this Code as implied bias:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201c2. For the existence of a state of mind on the part of the juror, in reference to the case, or to either party, <em>which satisfies the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, </em>that such juror cannot try the issue impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging, and which is known in this Code as actual bias.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">It is thus seen that, although in a capital case the court is not required as a matter of law under section 377 <em>(supra) </em>to exclude from the jury a venireman who states that his conscientious scruples would not prevent him from returning a verdict of guilty, nevertheless subdivision 2 of section 376 <em>(supra) </em>empowers the court in the exercise of the discretion thereby granted to excuse from the jury any venireman who, in the opinion of the court, cannot try the issues impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Here, among the thirty-two challenges which were sustained, there were several prospective jurors who expressed their opposition to capital punishment and as to whom inquiry was denied whether their opposition to the death penalty would prevent them from returning against the defendants a verdict of guilty. Had the court permitted such inquiry it might well have been developed that their scruples were such that they would not be able to join in a verdict of defendants\u2019 guilt. In that event, as we have seen, they would as a matter of law be excused under section 377 <em>id. </em>However, if such inquiry had educed a negative answer to the question whether their scruples would prevent them from finding the defendants guilty, the court had the power \u2014 \u201cin the exercise of a sound discretion\u201d, with which it was vested by section 376 <em>id. </em>\u2014 to excuse those jurors. Clearly, upon the <em>voir dire </em>examination, a declaration by a venireman that he is opposed to capital punishment \u2014 even though upon further inquiry he might state that he could find defendants guilty \u2014 is <em>some evidence </em>of his predisposition against the death penalty. We are thus led to conclude that such declaration afforded a sufficient basis for the ruling by the court \u2014 made in the exercise of its statutory discretion \u2014 which ruling, we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>assume, was in effect that such jurors could \u201cnot try the issue impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the party challenging * * (Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7 376, subd. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We therefore do not regard as reversible errors those rulings by the Trial Justice upon the <em>voir dire </em>examination now challenged by the defendants. We add, however, as a counsel of caution, that it would have been better practice \u2014 in connection with those challenges by the People, where further examination was denied \u2014 for the court to have withheld its ruling and delayed the exercise of its statutory discretion until further examination of the prospective jurors thus challenged had indicated whether their opposition to the death penalty would prevent their impartial determination of the defendants\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Both defendants also challenge rulings by which there were received in evidence the confessions, referred to <em>supra, </em>made by them in Michigan. Before considering those challenges it should be made clear that the death of Mrs. Fay in New York on January 4,1949, was not the reason which led to the defendants being taken into custody on February 28th in Michigan; nor was it, in the first instance, the reason why thereafter statements by the defendants were taken by local authorities in Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">We have seen that after leaving New York and reaching Michigan en route to Alaska, the defendants had rented accommodations in or near Grand Rapids at No. 3435 Byron Center Road \u2014 that being the home of Mrs. Delphine Downing and her two-year-old daughter. While the defendants were occupying those quarters there came a time in the latter part of February, 1949, when police authorities of Kent County, Michigan, were apprised of the fact that Mrs. Downing and her child had disappeared. The search then begun brought local police to the Downing home on the night of February 28th when the defendants were questioned as to \u201cthe whereabouts of Mrs. Delphine Downing\u201d. After being questioned on that subject at the Downing home the police took them to the local jail where further questioning brought forth statements which not only implicated the defendants in the disappearance of Mrs. Downing but also implicated them in the death in New York of Mrs. Janet Fay and gave a due as to where in Nassau County, New York, the body of Mrs. Fay could be found. That clue, when relayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>by news reporters in Michigan to news reporters in New York and thence to police officials of Queens and Nassau Counties, led to the exhumation of Mrs. Fay\u2019s body and set in motion in New York the police investigation which gave rise to the present criminal prosecution. As an incident to that investigation an assistant district attorney of Nassau County was sent on March 2, 1949, to Grand Rapids to investigate the source of the clue which had led to the discovery of Mrs. Fay\u2019s body. It thus came about that on March 3,1949, the statements already made to Michigan authorities by the defendants had not only made their presence in Michigan of first importance to the criminal investigation then in progress in connection with the disappearance of Mrs. Downing, but also made the defendants suspect in connection with the death of Mrs. Fay in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Although statements by the defendants made to Michigan authorities on March 1st and 2d were not received in evidence in the case now before us, we know, from testimony in the present case by Fernandez \u2014 called as a witness in his own behalf and previously instructed as to his right to refuse to answer any question which might incriminate him \u2014 that on the night of February 26,1949, at Byron Center Road he had shot and killed Mrs. Delphine Downing and had buried her body beneath the cellar floor of the Downing house. Indeed the fact was brought into the record at hand by counsel for the defendants that, on March 2, 1949, in the County Court of Kent County, Michigan, Fernandez pleaded guilty to having shot and killed Mrs. Downing.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Against this background of facts explanatory of how it came about that the three confessions made by the defendants in Michigan were offered at the trial of the present action in New York, we reach a consideration of the admissibility of those three confessions, viz., a single confession by each defendant made in Michigan on March 3d to the assistant district attorney of Nassau County who had then arrived on the Michigan scene, and the subsequent corrective statement by the defendant Beck made at her own request on March 11th to the prosecuting attorney of Kent County in the presence of the assistant district attorney of Nassau Connty.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Before the receipt in evidence of those three confessions their admissibility under section 395 of the Code of Criminal Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>eedure was the subject of a searching preliminary examination which \u2014 by testimony covering more than seven hundred pages of the record from witnesses called by the prosecution and the defense \u2014 developed in detail the circumstances in which the defendants\u2019 statements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The position taken by the defendants is that their confessions made in Michigan were involuntary and were made \u201cunder a promise of the District Attorney that the defendants would not be prosecuted here. \u2019 \u2019 In support of that position the defendants assert that when on March 1st and 2d they made statements to the Michigan authorities, they did so upon the promise by the prosecuting attorney of Kent County that their statements would not be used against them in another State. The defendants make the further assertion that the assistant district attorney of Nassau County was present in Grand Rapids on March 3d when Fernandez signed statements previously made by him to Michigan authorities; that on that occasion the Kent County prosecutor told him that he had been \u201c \u2018appointed to represent New York\u2019 \u201d and that the assistant district attorney of Nassau County said \u201c \u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019 \u201d There was also testimony by Fernandez that on the occasion last mentioned above, in the presence of the assistant district attorney of Nassau County, the Kent County prosecutor \u201cpromised me if I did sign those statements<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that they would never be used outside the State of Michigan, the contents of the statements would not be used, and they would be put in his safe\u201d. In that connection Fernandez stated he refused to sign those statements until the prosecutor had given him that promise. In reference to the statement which Fernandez made to the assistant district attorney of Nassau County on March 3d, Fernandez testified that the assistant district attorney made to him a promise \u2014 \u201cThat whatever I said, the contents, would never be used against me, it was just merely to clear the case, close the case, and that was all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Although Mrs. Beck was not called as a witness on the preliminary examination, she testified later in the trial that, prior to the statements she made to Michigan authorities on March 1st and 2d, the Kent County prosecutor had told her in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>stance that whatever statement she made would not be used against her in another State.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Proceeding upon the assumption that their testimony, to which reference is made above, was true, the defendants contend that the alleged prior promise made to them by the Kent County prosecutor when they made their confessions to Michigan authorities on March 1st and 2d, was to them an inducement to confess with assurance that their statements would not be used against them in another State; that inasmuch as the assistant district attorney of Nassau County was present and remained silent on the occasion when that promise was made, the inducement and assurance then gained by them continued as such when later they made the confessions which were received in evidence in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">No weight can be given to that argument when applied to the corrective statement made by Mrs. Beck on March 11th \u2014 which was done at her own request after she was advised as to her rights by the Michigan attorney assigned to her by the court \u2014 in which confession she stated she knew that it could be used against her in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The truth of the defendants\u2019 testimony hereinbefore mentioned \u2014 which they now claim should have dictated the rejection of their confessions when offered hy the prosecution as a part of the People\u2019s case \u2014 did not go unchallenged. Accordingly the testimony by the defendants on that phase of the case must be considered with the following testimony: The prosecuting attorney of Kent County when called as a witness by the <em>defendants </em>testified on <em>direct </em>examination that he was never authorized by the assistant district attorney of Nassau County or by anyone to represent the State of New York in the criminal investigation which was being conducted in Michigan and he denied that he had ever said to the defendants that he represented the State of New York in that investigation; he denied that he made any promise to either Fernandez or Mrs. Beck before they made their statements of March 1st and 2d. As to what occurred thereafter on March 3d, when Fernandez refused to sign his earlier confession, the Kent County prosecutor testified \u201cI asked [Fernandez] if he would sign a copy for my files in Michigan; that that signed copy itself would not be turned over to New York. But prior to the signing I explained to him that New York had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>unsigned copies, as did half the newspaper men that were there, and that I could be called as a witness to testify.\u201d The defendants also called as a witness the assistant district attorney of Nassau County who, as we have seen, had arrived at Grand Rapids during the evening of March 2d. As a witness for the defendants he denied that he had stated to Mrs. Beck that he would not prosecute her for any statement she made to him, or that, no matter what she said to him, it would not be used against her; he denied that the prosecuting attorney of Kent County was authorized by him or by the State of New York to promise her that nothing she might say would be used against her; he denied that he at any time authorized the Kent County prosecutor to represent the State of New York. In addition he testified that he \u201cmade no promise of any kind to either defendant at any time\u201d and that he had no recollection of having heard the Kent County prosecutor say in Mrs. Beck\u2019s presence that he would always keep his promise to her. When asked on direct examination by counsel for the defendants to state what promise the Kent County prosecutor had made in his presence, the assistant district attorney answered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">\u201cA. He told Fernandez that the only reason he wanted the statement signed, the statement that he had there, was that he wanted it for his file in Michigan; and he told Fernandez that he would not give that signed statement to me or to any other authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">Q. Did he say the signed statement would not be used against him? A. As I remember it, he said he would not give that signed statement to me or to any New York authority. He went on to tell Mr. Fernandez at that time, after I had handed Mr. McMahon a note \u2014 he told Mr. Fernandez at that time that he could be subpoenaed to New York and that he would have to testify if subpoenaed. He also pointed out to Mr. Fernandez at that time that during the taldng of the statements, the various newspapermen were there; that anyone of those newspapermen could be subpoenaed and would have to testify as to what they heard during the taldng of the statement. He pointed that out to Mr. Fernandez, and Fernandez nodded his head and said he understood that; that what he was concerned with was the signed statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>At a later point in the direct examination of the assistant district attorney as a witness called by the defendants the following question and answer appears: \u201cQ. Is it a fact, Mr. Robinson, that you said in the defendant Fernandez\u2019 presence that \u2018if Mr. McMahon made a promise, I will back Mr. McMahon and so will the State of New York and nothing you say will be used against you\u2019? A. I never made any such statement at any time either in the presence of Fernandez or Mrs. Beck or any other one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">When, in the light of section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we view that large portion of the record which bears upon the question whether the defendants\u2019 confessions of March 3 and 11,1949, were voluntary, or whether they were made as a result of a promise by the District Attorney that defendants would not be prosecuted in any State other than Michigan, we find no testimony which did more than present factual questions of credibility appropriate only for submission to the jury. The decision of those questions depended upon where lay the truth as between the testimony of the defendants and the testimony of the prosecuting attorney of Kent County, Michigan, and the assistant district attorney of Nassau County, New York. Had there been no conflict in the proof on the question of the voluntary quality of those confessions or as to whether a promise\u2014 such as those claimed by the defendants to have been made by the District Attorney \u2014 had in fact been made, the admission in evidence of those confessions would not have been a jury question. It is the obvious conflict in the testimony upon that subject \u2014 involving clear questions of credibility \u2014 which makes applicable the rule of our decisions that where such a conflict exists the confessions should be admitted in evidence and the question left to the jury whether they constituted voluntary statements by the defendants and were not brought about by circumstances proscribed by section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We think the Trial Justice exercised care clearly commensurate with the importance of this phase of the case to the defendants\u2019 rights, and we regard as adequate that portion of this charge which deals with that problem. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Doran, </em>246 N. Y. 409, 416-417; <em>People </em>v. <em>Trybus, </em>219 N. Y. 18, 22; <em>People </em>v. <em>Randazzio, </em>194 N. Y. 147, 156; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brasch, </em>193 N. Y. 46, 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>On the question whether either of the defendants was so overborne by prolonged questioning or otherwise before the confessions here involved were made, the record falls far short of affording a basis for such a claim. We note that at the close of the confession by Fernandez made on March 3d, he stated that in the conduct of his examination by the assistant district attorney of Nassau County he (Fernandez) had been treated \u201cperfectly\u201d and that what he had stated was done voluntarily. Likewise at the close of Mrs. Beck\u2019s confessions on the same day she went so far as to state that the treatment accorded to her while her confession was given had been \u201cwonderful\u201d and that she had voluntarily made the statement contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A point advanced by counsel for the defendant Fernandez presents the argument that it was reversible error for the Trial Justice to assign as trial counsel for the defendant Fernandez the same attorney who had been retained by the defendant Beck, the assertion being that the interests of the two defendants were in such conflict as to deprive Fernandez of a trial conformable to the requirements of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">At the opening of the trial on June 6,1949, when both defendants were present in court, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201c Mr. Rosenberg: The defendant Raymond M. Fernandez, if your Honor please, has a letter addressed to the Court, that I would like to present to your Honor (handing paper to the Court).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">The Court: (after reading paper.) Mr. District Attorney, will you look at this letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">Mr. Robinson: (after examining letter.) The People have no objection to the granting of the request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">The Court: Is there a similar application on behalf of the defendant Beck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">Mr. Rosenberg: No; no application in behalf of the defendant Beck. That is only in behalf of the defendant Fernandez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-14\">The Court: Do you appear for the defendant Beck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-15\">Mr. Rosenberg: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-16\">The Court: Well, in view of this request made to the Court, this letter the Court has just received from the defendant Fernandez, I will assign you, Mr. Rosenberg, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>act as attorney for the defendant Fernandez throughout this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">Mr. Rosenberg: To comply with the Statute, may the record officially show that your Honor grants me permission to withdraw at this time as his attorney and then accept your assignment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">The Court: Very well. You may do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">Mr. Rosenberg: And any statutory charges that counsel may be entitled to are a charge on the County of Nassau?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">The Court: That need not concern you. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The letter addressed by Fernandez to the Trial Justice, to which reference is made in the colloquy quoted above, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">\u201cJune 6th 1949.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">Dear Judge Pecora:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">I am at present without funds of any kind and my friends &amp; family can-not assist me in my defense. All my funds of several thousand Dollars &amp; other valuable properties are attached in the State of Michigan where they were taken from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">I am destitute and without the money now needed to defend my-self on the charge of Murder in the First Degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjB\">Would you please assign me council to protect my rights on and during my trial, \u2014 Mr. Rosenberg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\">Mr. Rosenberg, my present Lawyer has done a great deal for me here and I am perfectly satisfied and would appreciate that he be assigned to be my Lawyer. He is fully familiar with my case and I have greatest of confidence in him. I would also like to be able to get a complete Copy of the Minutes of my trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-16\">Raymond M. Fernandez \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Upon the argument of this appeal and in his brief counsel for Fernandez has made the statement that the designation of Mr. Rosenberg as counsel for Fernandez was done in a casual and perfunctory manner and without preliminary examination or inquiry to determine whether there might not well be conflicting interests between the two defendants, or other reasons why separate counsel should not be named. That comment is not borne out by the record of proceedings had at the trial after it had been in progress for more than three weeks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>At that time the Trial Justice had occasion to state to counsel for the defendants as follows: \u201cMr. Rosenberg, you were counsel for the defendants in this case prior to the 6th day of June, when the case' first appeared before this Court for trial, on which day I assigned you, at the request of the defendant Fernandez, to defend him, which was a request that you also asked me to accede to. But I understand that for a substantial period of time, covering several weeks at least, you had been the legal adviser of these two defendants in connection with matters relating to this case, so that you knew what this case was about long before, or weeks before the trial opened on June 6th. * * * You were not injected into this case for the first time on June 6th, when this trial opened, you were connected with the two defendants in this case for weeks prior to that time.\u201d From the foregoing statements which stand uncontradicted on the record, and from statements contained in the last paragraph of the Fernandez letter of June 6th, quoted <em>supra, </em>which was before the Trial Justice, it is clear that the Justice was informed that Mr. Rosenberg, who up to that time had served as attorney for both defendants, had as much knowledge of each defendant\u2019s case as could reasonably be expected at that time. In fact it appears of record before us that on March 14th, the day before the defendants \u2014 following extradition proceedings \u2014 were brought from Michigan to New York and <em>twelve weeks </em>before the trial herein commenced in the city of New York, Mr. Rosenberg was present in Grand Rapids where he made an unsuccessful effort to appear for and represent Fernandez at a hearing in the Circuit Court of Kent County, Michigan, in a proceeding involving a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">It may also be said that counsel\u2019s comment on this appeal in reference to \u201cconflicting interests between the two defendants\u201d reflects the benefit of hindsight employed from his vantage point taken long after the close of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Despite what was said at the opening of the trial in the colloquy quoted above \u2014 all in the presence of both defendants\u2014 and in spite of the written request by Fernandez for the assignment as his counsel of the attorney who had been retained by Mrs. Beck, we are now asked to hold that on the first day of the trial the presiding Justice should have refused to make the assignment requested by Fernandez. In the circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>record, which we deem relevant to the problem, we prefer to give the Trial Justice the benefit of the presumption that he did his duty, not only because he is entitled to that presumption but also because the record shows that as the trial progressed the question was repeatedly brought to the attention of all concerned as to whether additional counsel should be assigned to assist Mr. Rosenberg who was representing both defendants. For example: On June 29,1949, counsel for the defendant complained in open court that he did not have sufficient time to read the daily record of testimony which was being transcribed. The Trial Justice thereupon offered to assign additional counsel to aid him as attorney for the defendant Fernandez. In response to that offer Mr. Rosenberg stated he would consult Fernandez as to the court\u2019s offer and would report \u201ctomorrow\u201d. On the next day the following occurred;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">\u201cMr. Rosenberg: If your Honor pleases, for the record may it be noted that both defendants are perfectly satisfied with counsel that is now representing them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">Mr. Rosenberg: There is no question about that. I think there was mention yesterday about counsel. They are both perfectly satisfied and they authorize me to further proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">The Court; You see no reason for asking that counsel be assigned, other counsel, to assist you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">Mr. Rosenberg; Not in the middle of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">The Court: You know, I. offered to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">Mr. Rosenberg: Yes. As long as I am not unduly rushed I think I can continue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Again at the close of the direct examination of Fernandez by his counsel the following question and answer appear: \u201cQ. My last, question to you, Mr. Fernandez:. Do you feel now that you ape properly represented by counsel? A. I certainly do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ai_\">Thereafter on July 28th, at. the close of direct examination of Mrs. Beck by defendants\u2019 counsel the following appears: \u201cQ. Are you at this time perfectly satisfied with the way I have represented you? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">We also regard as relevant to the point under consideration the following excerpts from the charge to the jury given by the Trial Justice: \u201c* * * I feel certain that the People of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>State of New York were adequately represented upon this trial by Mr. Robinson, and by Mr. Huntington, another assistant district attorney of Nassau County who has assisted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201cI feel equally certain that the defendants in this case have had the benefit of an <em>exceedingly zealous and industrious and capable service </em>rendered to them by their counsel, Mr. Rosenberg. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u201cI am mindful of the labors and the difficulties and the responsibilities which entail upon counsel in a case, especially one of this character. I think I know something about the tribulations that sometimes attend the discharge of their important duties by lawyers engaged in the trial of a case; and if tempers became frayed and voices rose, I understand fully, and 1 hope you do, that it is an inevitable part of the trial of an important ease. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u201cAs 1 have already indicated, counsel on both sides in this case have discharged their duties <em>with diligence, with industry, and with </em>fidelity.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">True it is that there developed in this long trial instances where the interests of the two defendants being tried jointly were in conflict. In most of those instances, however, the Trial Justice gave definite instructions to the jury as to their duty in the consideration of that particular evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">When, at the conclusion of one of the longest and \u2014 from the standpoint of the presiding officer \u2014 one of the most difficult cases tried in recent years in the metropolitan area of this jurisdiction, the Trial Justice can say of the lawyer for both defendants what has been quoted <em>supra </em>\u2014 joining him with opposing counsel as having \u201c* * * discharged their duties with diligence, with industry, and with fidelity\u201d \u2014 we cannot say that the Trial Justice committed reversible error by his order, made in the exercise of his judicial discretion, by which he assigned as counsel for Fernandez the same attorney who had represented him up to that time and who had already been retained by Mrs. Beck.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The brief for Fernandez asserts that it was prejudicial error for the cotirt to receive in evidence testimony given by the two psychiatrists called by the prosecution \u2014 Doctors Lichtenstein and McCartney \u2014 which testimony quoted statements by Mrs. Beck recounting some of the incidents of Jantiary 3 and 4,1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In that connection it should be said at this point that although the plea of insanity as a defense interposed by Fernandez was withdrawn during the trial, a like defensive plea by Mrs. Beck was not withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The two witnesses whose testimony in part is criticized are psychiatrists of note who were employed by the prosecution to inquire into the sanity of Mrs. Beck. At the request of the District Attorney Dr. Lichtenstein first visited Mrs. Beck at the prison at Mineola on March 15,1949. Later he and Dr. McCartney went together to the prison where their examination, as described by Dr. Lichtenstein, was introduced by him by the following statement \u2014 which should be read with the fact in. mind that Mrs. Beck is a registered trained nurse who studied psychiatry as a specialty. Dr. Lichtenstein testified: \u201cDr. McCartney and I visited the prison together, and I said to her\u2014 I said, \u2018Now, my name is Dr. Lichtenstein and this is Dr. McCartney. We are psychiatrists. <em>We were sent here by the district attorney of the County of Nassau. We were ashed to make an examination of you. You need not say one word if you don\u2019t want to speak to us. That is your right. We may be called to testify in your case. If you decide to speak to us, if you decide to tell us about this crime, I trust that you will tell us the truth. Are you willing to speak to us?\u2019 And she said yes. </em>Now at that time we asked the matron to leave, and there were two doctors, Dr. McCartney and I, and the <em>nurse; </em>and I spoke to her, and she said the following concerning the crime * * (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Dr. Lichtenstein then recounted Mrs. Beck\u2019s statement of occurrences not only of January 3 and 4, 1949, but she also told them of sexual experiences which had occurred during the early years of her life. Then follows the long hypothetical question as to whether Mrs. Beck, at the time of the killing of Mrs. Fay, knew the nature and quality of her act. To that question the witness gave it as his opinion that at the time of the killing Mrs. Beck \u201c* * * knew the nature and the quality of the act and that she knew that the act was wrong.\u201d His reasons are given in full. Dr. Lichtenstein also testified that in his opinion Mrs. Beck, at the time of the killing suffered no amnesia and stated his reasons for that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Dr. McCartney, upon the same questions, testified that in his opinion Mrs. Beck at the time of the killing <em>* </em>* knew what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>she was doing; she knew the nature and quality of her act, and' she knew that it was wrong. \u2019 \u2019 His further opinion was that Mrs. Beck suffered from no amnesia at the time of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">It should he said that after Doctors Lichtenstein and McCartney left the stand Mrs. Beck was recalled and denied that when they examined her she was advised of her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The criticism now made in behalf of Fernandez of the ruling which permitted in evidence the testimony of the two psychiatrists called by the prosecution is that such ruling was contrary to public policy and contrary to that inherent fairness which is desirable in the administration of criminal law. Had the prosecution\u2019s two psychiatrists failed to warn Mrs. Beck there might have been a firmer basis for that criticism. We believe, however, that the warning given to her \u2014 if believed by the jury, as apparently it was believed \u2014 removes any disregard of public policy and any lack of fairness as bases for the criticism now leveled at the prosecution. In the circumstances disclosed by the record we do not regard the criticism by the defendant Fernandez so well founded as to prompt our reversal of the judgments of conviction herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In addition to the points and arguments made in behalf of the defendants, to which reference has already been made, we have considered with care all other matters to which the briefs of counsel direct our attention. Our conclusion is that the record contains no errors which so adversely affected the substantial rights of the defendants as to warrant reversal of the judgments herein and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Accordingly, as to each defendant, the judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\"> There is evidence that Mrs. Pay\u2019s age was sixty-one or sixty-six years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> The reference is to statements, made by Fernandez on March 1st and 2d, which were not received in evidence in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b363-9\">Desmond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3b\">(concurring). I concur with Judge Lewis for affirmance, and I agree with practically all of his able and comprehensive opinion. However, as to two matters I wish to express my separate views.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">First, as to the representation of both defendants by the same trial counsel, I do not see how the Trial Justice could have done other than he did. Long before the trial, these defendants retained this attorney to act for both of them. He had been active in trial preparation and preliminary proceedings for months before the trial. Just before the trial, apparently to save expense, defendant Fernandez asked the court to assign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>as his attorney, this same lawyer, and surely there was then no reason for the court to deny that request. When, during the trial, certain conflicts, or seeming conflicts in interest appeared, the court was careful to inquire as to whether both defendants still desired that this joint representation by the same attorney continue. They assured the Judge that they did. These defendants were shrewd, intelligent people, who knew what they wanted. If the time-honored rule \u2014 that a defendant has the right to be represented by counsel of his own choice \u2014 means what it says (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rocc\u00f3, </em>209 Cal. 68, 73), then there was nothing for the court to do about it, and no error in doing nothing further about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Second, as to the refusal of the court to permit cross-examinatian of some of the talesmen who said they were opposed to capital punishment, and as to the court\u2019s allowance of the challenges directed against those talesmen: This, I am bound to say, was plain error, under section 382 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, it did not deprive defendants of their right to trial by a fair and impartial jury. Under the controlling authorities, such an error prejudiced no substantial rights of defendants <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>294 N. Y. 405, 411, 412, and eases cited), and so it is no basis for a reversal (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 542).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">I vote to affirm as to each defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b364-7\">Conway, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkM\">(dissenting). On January 4, 1949, Mrs. Janet J. Fay was killed in the town of Hempstead, Long Island. The two codefendants, Raymond Fernandez and Martha Jule Beck, stand convicted of her murder, on an indictment which charged that each of them \u2018 \u2018 then and there aiding and abetting the other, wilfully, feloniously, and of malice aforethought, killed one Janet J. Fay by then and there striking [her] with a hammer, and * * * strangling [her] with a * * * scarf * *</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">There was a definite conflict of interest between the defendants. Fernandez maintained that he had had no hand in the slaying of Mrs. Fay no matter what he may have done after she had been struck down with a hammer while she and Mrs. Beck were alone together. In his testimony at the trial he stated that on the night of the homicide Mrs. Fay and Mrs. Beck occupied a double bed in the bedroom, while he slept on a couch in the living room of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the apartment. He said that there came a time between three and four o\u2019clock in the morning of January 4,1949, when he was awakened by Mrs. Fay, the deceased, who was kneeling at the side of his couch. Being unable to persuade her to return to her bed, he went into the bedroom and asked Mrs. Beck to try to persuade Mrs. Fay to return there. When Mrs. Beck proceeded toward the living room, Fernandez went into the bathroom. Before going however, he testified: \u201c I told her [Mrs. Beck] as soon as I heard both women go back to bed I would leave the bathroom and go to sleep again.\u201d After remaining in the bathroom for a period of from five to ten minutes, he returned to the living room where he found Mrs. Fay crouched over a suitcase, bleeding profusely, with Mrs. Beck standing near her, motionless. He said that he shook Mrs. Beck and upon coming \u2018\u2018 out of something like a daze \u201d she exclaimed \u201c What has happened? \u201d. He then said: \u201c You ought to know better than I do.\u201d He testified that Mrs. Beck (a registered nurse in Florida) then took Mrs. Fay\u2019s pulse and informed him that she was dead. They then decided to dispose of the body. Fernandez said he did not strangle Mrs. Fay although he did put a scarf around her neck to stop the bleeding so \u201cit wouldn\u2019t get all over the place in handling her\u201d. He attempted to explain his confession of participation by testifying that he made it to shield Mrs. Beck with whom he was in love. That testimony, if accredited, made Fernandez no more than an accessory.after the fact, a crime punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years. (Penal Law \u00a7 1934.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In his charge at the close of the trial, the learned Justice outlined in detail the claims of the prosecution and the evidence adduced in support of them, but failed to make reference to this defense of Fernandez or to charge the law applicable thereto. One of the primary purposes of a charge is to aid the jury in deciding the material issues in a case. It is to point out the relevant, material and vital facts, among a great number before them, which bear upon the issues of guilt or innocence. This court in referring to a Trial Judge\u2019s charge in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fanning </em>(131 hi. Y. 659, 663) said: \u201c \u2018 In a criminal case we think the judge has the right, and indeed it is his duty to present the evidence to the jury in such light and with such comments that the jury may see its relevancy and pertinency to the particular issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>upon which it was admitted, and thus he better qualified to appreciate its character and weight and to determine its credibility. These questions' are for the jury, but it is proper that a judge should assist the jury in marshalling the evidence so that they may the more readily and intelligently come to a conclusion which shall be satisfactory to themselves, consistent with the evidence and in accordance with the law. The judge should do this in a fair and impartial manner, having due regard to the' rights of the defendant and with a serious and anxious desire for their preservation\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">While the charge took some hours due to the length of the trial, the court failed to make reference to the one issue in the case raised by the defendant Fernandez which, if believed, would have led to his acquittal of the capital offense charged, although it might well have led to his conviction of a lesser crime. An omission such as that in a capital case has been held to be error (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>230 N. Y. 481, 488; <em>People </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>210 N. Y. 274, 308; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montesanto, </em>236 N. Y. 396) necessitating the ordering of a new trial. Here Fernandez was entitled at the very least, to a charge that if he were an accessory after the fact, he could not be found guilty of murder or manslaughter in any degree. The jury was not so charged and it is difficult to see how, when it deliberated, the jury could have given proper consideration to the facts presented by Fernandez in his defense without having been told the law with which to guide themselves, or that Fernandez might be convicted of the felony of being ah accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Of course, in the average case, where a defendant is represented by counsel alert only to his interest, an omission to charge upon the only defense put forward would be cured promptly by the request of his counsel for a proper and adequate charge with reference to that defense. Here that was not done and that brings us to a second and further reason why there must be a new trial here. There was a sharp conflict of interest between the two defendants and yet they were represented by the same counsel. So clear was that conflict that this court declined to assign for Fernandez on the appeal to us, the counsel who had represented him at the trial and who there also represented Mrs; Beck. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>300 N. Y. 646.) The sharpness of the conflict is made evident by the defense of Fernandez to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>we have referred. If that defense were true and was credited by the jury, Mrs. Beck and Mrs. Beck alone was guilty of the murder of Mrs. Fay. To request a charge of the Trial Justice that if the jury believed that defense, Fernandez was not guilty of murder but was only an accessory after the fact, would have been to stress and to emphasize that Mrs. Beck was solely guilty. No such request was made by counsel assigned for Fernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">At the opening of the trial, counsel theretofore retained by Mrs. Beck and Fernandez presented to the court a letter from the latter stating that he was destitute and asking the court to assign to defend him the same counsel who had been originally retained by both of them. The court thereupon asked the District Attorney, the public official familiar with the ease, to look at the letter. The assistant district attorney after examining it said that the People had no objection to the granting of the request. While the court was not then advised by the assistant district attorney that there was any such conflict of interest as to render it improper to <em>assign </em>the same counsel for Fernandez as was still under <em>retainer </em>by Mrs. Beck, the court was put upon notice of it five days after the commencement of the trial, which lasted for ten weeks, by the counsel for the two defendants. On that day defense counsel asserted that he did not have sufficient time to go over the confessions (plural) which had just been introduced, marked for identification and made available to him. He asked for the assignment of \u201c more counsel \u201d and later for the assignment of associate counsel. It was during that colloquy that the attention of the court was called by defense counsel to the duty of the court to protect the interests of the defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\"><em>\u201c </em>[Counsel]: Judge, if I undertook something that was too great for me, you are now the presiding judge, you have a duty to protect the rights of these defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court: And I am doing everything that the law warrants me doing to protect the legal rights of these defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201c [Counsel]: And if I bit off more \u2014 \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Immediately thereafter, the jury having been excused, a discussion took place in which the Trial Judge offered to assign additional counsel but was informed by the counsel for the defendants that he would consult with Fernandez as to the court\u2019s offer and would let the court know the result of the conference on the following day. On the day following this occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201c [Counsel]: If your Honor pleases, for the record may it be noted that both defendants are perfectly satisfied with counsel that is now representing them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u201c The Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\"><em>\u201c </em>[Counsel]: There is no question about that. I think there was mention yesterday about counsel. They are both perfectly, satisfied and they authorize me to further proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court: You see no reason for asking that counsel be assigned, other counsel, to assist you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">\u201c [Counsel]: Not in the middle of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court: You know, I offered to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\"><em>\u201c </em>[Counsel]: Yes. As long as I am not unduly rushed I think I can continue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">At the time of that colloquy, it had already become apparent that there had been confessions made by each of the defendants implicating the other and that it was impossible for one lawyer properly to defend both. In addition, at that time, both defendants were being defended by counsel under a plea of not guilty with a specification of insanity thereunder. Some weeks later Fernandez withdrew the specification, his counsel stating that the withdrawal was at \u201c his [Fernandez] specific request.\u201d There was no withdrawal of the specification by Mrs. Beck: The duty devolved upon the court to take prompt action to make certain that each defendant was adequately represented. We think the court should have exercised its own judgment and not been guided by defense counsel (who on the previous day had been of a contrary opinion) nor by the defendants themselves who were not competent to decide or solve the problem presented. A fair reading of the record indicates that, faced with the impossible task of defending two clients, each one of whom was. seeking to throw the blame upon the other, counsel failed to properly protect the interest of Fernandez but seems to have subconsciously placed Mrs. Beck in a preferred position in the defense presented to the crime charged against them both. We shall refer only to two situations which developed upon the trial but which make this situation clear. When Mrs. Beck was upon the stand, under direct examination by counsel, she was asked whether from the time that she was slapped or touched by Mrs. Fay until the time when she was shaken by defendant Fernandez, she had any recollection as to what had happened. It will be recalled-that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Fernandez\u2019 defense that when he came from the bathroom he found Mrs. Fay crouched upon the floor and Mrs. Beek in what appeared to be a daze and that he shook her to bring her to her senses and asked her what had occurred. In response to counsel\u2019s question Mrs. Beck said that she had no way of knowing what had occurred in the meantime. She said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">\u201c I don\u2019t know whether he had been there and left or whether that was the first time. The first thing I remember is he was shaking me by the shoulders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201c Q. You don\u2019t know whether Mr. Fernandez came back into the living room and was attempting to blame you for anything in connection with Mrs. Fay\u2019s bleeding? * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201c Q. There is no question you don\u2019t know what happened \u2014 you have no way of refreshing your recollection either \u2014 between the time that you had this discussion or argument or fight with Mrs. Fay up to the time that Mr. Fernandez asked you some questions? A. No, sir. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">* * Q. Are you taking or have you taken the word of the defendant Fernandez as to what had happened, if anything, on that occasion? A. Now, what do you mean by that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201c Q. When he was shaking you and he asked you certain questions concerning did you do it or what happened, are you taking the defendant Fernandez\u2019 word that something happened involving you and Mrs. Fay. A. It must have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">\u201c Q. I say are you taking his word for it? A. Yes, I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An1\">Counsel realized at this point that he was leading his client Mrs. Beck into testifying to matters where every word she uttered tended to charge from her own lips that Fernandez had been guilty of the murder at a time when she had not been in possession of her faculties. If Fernandez had been represented by counsel of his own, the leading of this witness would not have occurred without objection. Counsel himself realized the situation that was developing, as far as Fernandez was concerned, for at the folio from which we have just quoted (Record, pp. 2586-2587) counsel asked that the record show that the \u201c last few questions \u201d asked of Mrs. Beck had been asked at the express request of Fernandez. Fernandez had not yet withdrawn the specification of insanity. The client for whoin counsel had been assigned was thus trying the ease rather than the assigned counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Proof that the client for whom counsel had been assigned, Fernandez, as distinguished from the client by whom counsel had been retained, Mrs. Beck, was not, and could not be, adequately and properly represented is conclusively demonstrated by the following question and answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court: Is it the opinion of Dr. Hoffmann that she [Mrs. Beck] is under the legal definition of insanity embodied in Section 1120, now a sane person and has been since the killing of Mrs. Fay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">\u201c [Counsel]: No. His statement now to me is that she is still suffering from such a chronic defect of reason as to prevent her from knowing right or wrong when under the stress of her obsession; that she may have lucid intervals; she may act a certain way now; but even right now when she is under his domination, meaning the defendant Fernandez, she goes right back to that same set-up. That is Dr. Hoffmann\u2019s story to me now, and he is ready to testify as far as that is concerned. He says she may at times be able to consult with counsel and she may be able to \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201c The Court: All of that should have been gone into before this case was tried. \u2019 \u2019 Thus was disclosed not merely hostility between the clients but domination of the client who had retained counsel by the client for whom he had been assigned. Yet these are the clients who <em>through counsel </em>sought to assure the trial court :that they were <em>\u201c </em>perfectly satisfied \u201d with the legal representation afforded them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The final complete abandonment of Fernandez by counsel and of the latter\u2019s defense, however, will be found in his summation. Counsel said: \u201c * * * But, the only thing I am going to plead here is for <em>their life. </em>I plead for nothing else, believe me. I am not concerned with their liberty, I am concerned with their life. They are charged with a crime here punishable by death in the electric chair, and the only reason I stand here is to see that they do not go to the electric chair.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Here then was assigned counsel begging for the mercy of life imprisonment for a client whose defense was that he was an accessory after the fact for which the penalty was five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Due process which is guaranteed to each defendant in a criminal case includes the right to the aid of counsel. (N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 6; U. S. Const., 5th <em>&amp; </em>6th Amendts.) In truth, Fernandez had no counsel and his conviction may not stand. <em>(Powell </em>. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Alabama, </em>287 U. S. 45; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U. S. 60; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>251 App. Div. 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Returning now to the fact that the court was duly apprised of the conflict of interest here and was required to act thereon on the original heretofore quoted request of counsel, we quote in addition the following which occurred when the motion was made to dismiss at the close of the <em>People\u2019s </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">\u201c [Counsel]: In my duty as attorney in behalf of both defendants, if your Honor please, I would like to leave it to your Hon- or\u2019s discretion at this time if your Honor has any feeling that the rights of these defendants may conflict in any way at this time due to the proof that has been adduced at this trial. I ask your Honor to so state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">\u201c The Court: What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\"><em>\u201c </em>[Counsel]: If your Honor feels due to the proof that has been offered in behalf of \"the Prosecution, including these alleged confessions, that the rights of these defendants in any way conflict, I ask your Honor in the interests of justice to so state at this time. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court: Isn\u2019t it your duty to determine, as counsel for both defendants, under a responsibility which you voluntarily assumed, whether or not the interests of these defendants are in any way in conflict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201c [Counsel]: They didn\u2019t conflict at the beginning, but your Honor may be of the opinion that they conflict now due to the offer of the People\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court: I make no ruling now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\"><em>\u201c </em>[Counsel]: Does your Honor rule that their rights conflict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-13\">\u201c The Court: I make no ruling now. It is your responsibility, the responsibility you faced when you became attorney of record for both of these defendants. You will remember at the very opening of the trial, as the record amply shows, I offered to assign counsel to assist you if for any reason you felt that such assistance might be desirable and necessary, and you have stated quite clearly you didn\u2019t think that you needed associate counsel or counsel to assist you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-14\">\u201c [Counsel]: <em>After the People\u2019s case is now in, I say in the interests of justice it is immaterial what my thoughts may be if your Honor is of the opinion that their rights conflict. If your Honor is of the opinion that their rights conflict, your Honor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>should take affirmative action. I say that is immaterial of what I may do. * * *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201cThe Court: What do you suggest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201c [Counsel]: Your Honor could grant a severance to one of the defendants at this stage of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201c The Court: At this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201c [Counsel]: Yes, sir. At any stage of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>The Court: Motion denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201c [Counsel]: Your Honor could declare a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201c The Court: Motion denied.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">It is urged that argument by counsel in this court with reference to the rulings of the Trial Judge on matters of conflict of interest reflect the benefit of hindsight employed from a vantage point long after the close of the trial. To our minds this is not an answer for it is one of the functions of our court in a capital case to look back to see if there was such a conflict of interest as to deprive defendants of a fair trial. Thus in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fisher </em>(249 N. Y. 419, 427) we said: \u201c A retrospective view by an appellate court may reveal injustice or impairment of substantial rights unseen at the beginning.\u201d And again in the same case, quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(246 N. Y. 491, 497) we said (p. 424): \u201c The question always presented by such a motion [motion for a separate trial] is whether a jury can properly weigh the testimony upon the various issues which may arise. <em>' </em>The decision of the trial court rendered before the trial is dictated by a reasonable anticipation based on the facts then disclosed. The decision of this court rendered upon a review of the trial itself rests upon determination of whether the prophesy has been realized.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">We do not hold on this record that the original assignment of the counsel for Mrs. Beck to defend Fernandez was error as a matter of law, but we do hold that it was error for the trial court to fail to act promptly as soon as he was aware of the irreconcilable conflict of interests between the two defendants. The circumstances disclosed on this record rendered it impossible for Fernandez to have a fair trial. Our retrospective view clearly reveals an impairment of the substantial rights of Fernandez <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>unseen at the beginning \u2019 \u2019 by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">We think there was a further error committed. The jury was selected from three panels totaling 650 veniremen in all Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>sel for Fernandez on this appeal points out that on the <em>voir dire </em>examination of 32 veniremen, the court sustained challenges <em>for cause </em>made by the People upon the ground that the veniremen so challenged had indicated, by voice or upraised hand, that they were opposed to capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We shall take an example in addition to the one mentioned at pages 318-319 of the opinion of Judge Lewis as indicating the procedure followed by the court. Three prospective jurors were asked the question whether they were opposed to capital punishment and each raised his hand to indicate that he was. The District Attorney challenged them for cause and the court sustained the challenge. Counsel for defendants sought to question them but the court refused to permit it saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201c The Court: No. When jurors state they are opposed to capital punishment, the jurors are legally disqualified from sitting in a case of this character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201c [Counsel] : May I state the reason why I want to question the jurors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court: No; because it is not necessary. The mere statement by the three talesman, that they are opposed to capital punishment, is sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Counsel excepted and was given a <em>\u201c </em>general exception \u201d on this point. Exception was again taken by counsel when the defendants had exhausted their peremptory challenges, after the denial of the motion for a mistrial and to dismiss the entire panel, upon the ground that the refusal of the court to permit the opportunity of examination of prospective jurors concerning their views on capital punishment, had seriously prejudiced the rights of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Defense counsel objected to the challenges for cause on the ground that a juror is not necessarily disqualified because he is opposed to capital punishment so long as he has no scruples which would interfere with his performance of his duty to determine guilt or innocence. The court, nevertheless, sustained the challenges \u201c for cause \u201d saying at one point: \u201c Being opposed in principle, they can\u2019t serve \u201d, and at another, as we have seen, <em>\u201c </em>No. When jurors state they are opposed to capital punishment, the jurors are legally disqualified from sitting in a case of this character.\u201d Later this procedure was abandoned and' proper questioning of talesmen by the court and counsel occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>It is most important for us to remember that the definition of acts which constitute crimes and all procedure for the trial and punishment therefor are regulated by statutes, within legislative competency under our Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Glen, </em>173 N. Y. 395, 400.) Prospective jurors are selected and brought into court through the command and operation of statutes. Unless those statutes are followed there can be no proper jury to pass upon the guilt or innocence of a defendant. After the prospective jurors arrive in court they must be drawn by lot from a wheel in the custody of the clerk of the court. There may be no tampering with the wheel. The defendant is entitled to be tried by the first twelve competent, unbiased and qualified jurors drawn by lot. <em>(Hildreth </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>101 N. Y. 234; <em>People </em>v. <em>McQuade, </em>110 N. Y. 284.) Before quoting from the <em>Hildreth </em>case, we refer to the discussion in <em>People </em>v. <em>McQuade, </em>a criminal case, at pages 303 to 306, because on the last-mentioned page we find the following: <em>\u201c </em>This court had occasion to consider this general subject in <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>City of Troy </em>(101 N. Y. 234), and we adhere to the views then expressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The expression of views by Judge Andrews at page 239 of <em>Hildreth </em>v. <em>City of Troy (supra) </em>tersely and clearly sums up the theory of the applicable statutory law and when read in connection with chapter III of title VI of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7\u00a7 359-387), to which we shall refer hereafter, clearly points up the error committed below. It is as follows: <em>\u201c </em>The judgment should be reversed. The statute makes elaborate provision for securing an impartial jury. It provides that the first twelve competent jurors drawn, who are indifferent and not discharged or excused, shall constitute the jury. The law prescribes the qualifications of jurors. The court cannot add to, or detract from them. It cannot itself select the jury, directly or indirectly. It cannot in its discretion, or capriciously, set aside jurors as incompetent, whom the law declares are competent, and thus limit the selection of the jury to jurors whose names may be left. If this is done, a legal right is violated, for which an appellate court will give redress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Section 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure enumerates the causes for challenging prospective jurors for implied bias. Subdivision 8 of that section provides that in cases where the crime charged is punishable by death, if a juror has such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>objection to capital punishment \u201c as would preclude his finding the defendant guilty; * * * [then] he shall neither be permitted nor compelled to serve as a juror.\u201d Section 376 of the code empowers the trial court <em>\u201c </em>in the exercise of a sound discretion \u201d to determine whether such an objection on the part of an individual juror would prevent him from deciding the issues impartially and without prejudice to the substantial rights of the challenging party.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">While the statute permits of wide discretion on the part of the Trial Judge, proper procedure requires and permits, in the examination of each juror having a distaste for capital punishment, a further inquiry as to whether such an objection would prevent him from convicting a defendant of murder in the first degree carrying the death penalty if the evidence required such a verdict. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carolin, </em>115 N. Y. 658; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>131 N. Y. 617.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">An accused is entitled to competent jurors drawn for jury duty in the manner provided for by the laws of our State. Such jurors should only be excused for legal cause or by peremptory challenge <em>(People </em>v. <em>McQuade, </em>110 N. Y. 284, 305-306, <em>supra; Hildreth </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>101 N. Y. 234, <em>supra). </em>While we cannot say that the trial would have resulted differently had these jurors not been excluded, it is probable that the jury would have been constituted differently. Jurors, we know, differ in intelligence, judgment and fitness and, for the sake of justice according to law, Trial Judges should adhere strictly to the rules of law and the methods of procedure governing their selection so as to secure the legal right of a party to. have a jury selected from the competent ones as they are called from the jury box and to prevent any suspicion of an improper trial. The rejection of those 32 jurors without further examination on the sole ground that they were opposed to capital punishment was in contravention of the explicit provisions of section 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Prior </em>(294 N. Y. 405) the question presented was whether a motion dismissing the indictments returned against the defendants should be dismissed because the grand jury which returned those indictments was illegally constituted. We answered that question in the negative and the following sentence in the concurring opinion of Lehman, Ch. J., states sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>cintly the <em>ratio decidendi </em>(p. 413): <em>\" </em>The court has, however, no inherent or statutory power to set aside an indictment found by a grand jury because there were errors in applying the statutory method of procuring an impartial jury where the jury as impaneled conforms to the traditional concept of a grand jury and consists of a qualified group of men and women who represent a fair cross section of the impartial citizens of the county. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The citation is not apposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The judgment of conviction as to the defendants should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur with Lewis, J.; Desmond, J., concurs in separate opinion in which Froessel, J., concurs; Conway, J., dissents in opinion in which Loughran, Ch.
