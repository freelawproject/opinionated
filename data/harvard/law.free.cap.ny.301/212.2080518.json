Accordingly, the Appellate Division erred in annulling the determination because it believed that the punishment was unduly severe. Such usurpation of a purely administrative prerogative constitutes a dangerous departure from established principles and a serious threat to proper enforcement of the law. <em>(People ex rel.

They had no knowledge or reason to believe that there was an improper connection. Licensee neither benefited nor stood to benefit in any way from an erroneously connected tap. No one was in any way damaged or injured. There was an inadvertent, isolated, improper tapping by one not an agent. Assuming that a technical violation occurred, the determination of the State Liquor Authority in suspending petitioner\u2019s license for twenty days and requiring that its order of suspension be publicly displayed was arbitrary and unconscionable and, therefore, should be annulled. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>173 App. Div. 179; <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>271 App. Div. 511; <em>People </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>112 Misc. 377; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>173 App. Div. 177; <em>Matter of Monk </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>194 Misc. 241; <em>Matter of Marburg </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>286 N.

Prac. Act, \u00a7 607) and annuls the determination of the State Liquor Authority \u2014 as upholding the finding by the Authority that the respondent violated subdivision 4-a of section 106 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and that the annulment of the Authority\u2019s determination directed by such order rests upon the sole ground that the punishment imposed by the Authority was excessive. Upon that single ground the Appellate Division has annulled that determination on the law and has remitted the proceeding to the Authority \u201cfor further action and reconsideration of <em>the extent of the punishment imposed herein \u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The suspension of a liquor license is ' one of that type of action by the Authority which is subject to review by the Supreme Court but such review must be in the manner provided by article 78 of the Civil Practice Act. (Alcoholic Bever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>age Control Law, \u00a7 121, subd. 4). Under section 1296 of article 78 we find no provision for the judicial review of the measure of punishment imposed as an incident to disciplinary action ordered by an administrative board such as the Authority where, as in the present case, the Appellate Division has upheld a finding by the Authority of a statutory violation which is made the sole basis for such punishment. (See <em>People ex rel. Morrissey </em>v. <em>Waldo, </em>212 N. Y. 174, 177-179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Accordingly the order should be reversed and the determination of the State Liquor Authority confirmed, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Appeal taken as of right dismissed on the ground that the order does not finally determine the proceeding within the meaning of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Loughran, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur; Froessel, J., concurs in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
