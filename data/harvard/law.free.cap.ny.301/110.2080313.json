Plaintiff\u2019s letter does not constitute an offer to purchase. <em>(Watts </em>v. <em>Carter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>207 App. Div. 656; <em>Machinery Utilities Co. </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>224 App. Div. 392; <em>Blackwell </em>v. <em>Glidden Co., </em>208 App. Div. 317, 239 N.

Plaintiff\u2019s order of the merchandise in question was a firm and unqualified offer. <em>(Pope </em>v. <em>Terre Haute Car &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>107 N. Y. 61; <em>O\u2019Neill Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Petroleum Heat &amp; Power Co., </em>280 N. Y. 50; <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>169 Misc. 964.) II. Defendant\u2019s acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s order was definite and binding.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-9\">Loughran, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alc\">The action is one for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">On January 11, 1949, the plaintiff sent to the defendant a letter in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">\u201c We hereby order from you 1045 Flasks of Prime Virgin Mercury, 99.5% Pure, 76 pounds net weight each, standard iron flask, at a price of $60.75 per flask, in bond, C. I. F. New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\"><em>\u201c </em>We will establish immediately, in your favor, an irrevocable letter of credit, providing for payment against on board Bill of Lading, presented in New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\"><em>\u201c </em>We will take care of any and all commission payments that may be due in this transaction to Wm. M. Stieh &amp; Co., Inc. and agree to hold you harmless from any claims they may make in connection therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201c It is requested that you arrange for inspection certificates so that full weights and analysis as called for herein be assured and that these certificates be available along with the invoices, bill of lading, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">At the bottom of that letter, the defendant wrote and signed this sentence: <em>\u201c </em>We confirm that the above is our understanding of this agreement, and accept this order, subject to our arranging all the above phases of this transaction. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">A motion by the defendant for dismissal of the complaint was denied by the court at Special Term for reasons stated as follows: <em>\u201c </em>The letter is unequivocal and constitutes a definite and binding order. The assertion that defendant\u2019s acceptance was qualified and hence not binding must also be overruled at this time. While the language of the acceptance is ambiguous the facts should be developed at the trial.\u201d The Appellate Division affirmed by a vote of three to two and we now have the case on this further appeal by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The following three questions have been certified to us by the Appellate Division:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\"><em>\u201c </em>1. Does the complaint of the Plaintiff-Respondent state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Was the letter of the Plaintiff-Respondent a firm offer to purchase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">\u201c3. Was the language used by the Defendant-Appellant * We confirm that the above is our understanding of this agreement, and accept this order subject to our arranging all of the above phases of this transaction \u2019, a qualified or conditional acceptance, and therefore a rejection of the original offer? \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abq\">The Justices who dissented from the affirmance by the Appellate Division apparently thought that the \u201c subject to \u201d clause in the defendant\u2019s acceptance had been directed to every part of the plaintiff\u2019s order and not to the last paragraph thereof alone. Nothing turns on that issue, however; for if the acceptance was subject only to the defendant\u2019s arranging for the inspection certificates required by the last paragraph of the order, there was still no such absolute and unqualified assent to the plaintiff\u2019s proposal as was necessary to convert it into a promise. (See <em>Schenectady Stove Co. </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>101 N. Y. 45; <em>Poel </em>v. <em>Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., </em>216 N. Y. 310, 319; <em>Wittwer </em>v. <em>Hurwitz, </em>216 N. Y. 259, 264; 1 Williston on Contracts [Rev. ed.], \u00a7\u00a7 72-73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The dissenting opinion of the Appellate Division defines the phrase <em>\u201c </em>subject to \u201d as being the equivalent of \u201c conditional upon or depending on.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The orders should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs in all courts. The first question certified should be answered in the negative. The third question certified should be answered in the affirmative. The second question certified need not be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Dye, Fuld and Froessel, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Orders reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
