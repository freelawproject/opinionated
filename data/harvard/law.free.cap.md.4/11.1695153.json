Mrs. Mitchell also died in the same month, leaving her husband and numerous children surviving her.

They ask that, at all events, the undivided interest of Dorcas may alone be sold, without subjecting their respective parts of lot No. 1, and the moiety of the defendant Mary in lot No. 5, to sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-7\">Testimony was then taken showing that ihe several parcels of property above mentioned belonged to said Charles Tor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ranee at the date of his will, and wer\u00e9 owned by him in feej that it could not be advantageously divided amongst the parties interested, and that it woulcl be for their interest to sell.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">The court below passed a decree for the sale of the property, accompanying which, Le Grand, A. J., delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">\u201cThe bill in this case is filed to- procure a partition by sale of certain property mentioned in the proceedings. It is proved, and by the solicitor of the respondents admitted, that the property is incapable of partition except by sale. The principal facts in the case are as follows: Charles Torrance being seized of a large estate, made his last will and testament in 1822, and by it his estate was disposed of as follows:\u201d (The will of Charles Torrance is here recited as above.) \u201cIn 1823,-Elizabeth Torrance made her last will, which -was admitted to probate in 1829. After reciting the will of her husband, Charles Torrance, she proceeds to dispose of the entire estate among her eight children, giving to her sons an absolute estate in fee-simple to such portions as she devises to them. The particular part of the estate now sought to be operated upon by the decree of this court, is that which was devised for her daughter Dorcas, recently deceased, without ever having, been married. The parts of her will having reference to the share of Dorcas are as follows:\u201d (The portions of her will, above set forth, are here recited.) \u201cThe complainant is the son of a deceased son of Charles and Elizabeth To.rrance, and the defendants are two maiden daughters of the testators, and- the children of their other children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">\u201cThe first question that presents itself is, what estate was created by the will of Charles Torrance? The language used by the testator is explicit and unambiguous. It confers on his wife a life estate in his entire estate and gives her a power of appointment, with authority to dispose of the estate among all \u201cor such\u201d of his children, or their issue, <em>\u201cin such manner and proportion, and for such term and </em>estate,\u201d as she might think fit, subject, nevertheless, to the limitation that any portion given- to his daughters should be for <em>life, \u201cand after their </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>decease for the benefit of their children and their legal representative, in equal proportions, forever.\u201d </em>The proof shows, that Mrs. Torrance divided the estate into eight parts, giving one part to each of her children, the shares given to the sons absolutely and those to the daughters for life, with remainder over, as stated in the clause already copied from her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">\u201cIt is manifest, that it was the intent of Charles Torrance that in no event should his daughters take more than a life estate, and, under the terms of his will, it was not within the power of his wife to give them a larger estate. This being so, it appears to the court that his wife Elizabeth did not exceed her power in limiting the estate of the daughters to their natural life. The only difficulty in the case arises out of the language used in the will of Mrs. Torrance, in regard to the shares of such of her daughters as shall die without children, or the descendants of children, the language being, \u201c <em>the part or share of the estate hereinbefore devised to her or them,\u201d </em>(daughter or daughters,) \u201cshall descend to and be equally divided between <em>a.U my surviving children and their representatives, </em>as tenants in common.\u201d The will then goes on to provide, that the portion of any share which may so descend to any of her \u201csurviving\u201d daughters, shall be held in trust for the <em>like uses </em>and <em>put poses, </em>and <em>subject </em>to the same limitations and restrictions, and to descend to their respective children in like manner as the share before devised to her daughters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">\u201cIn regard to the interpretation of the word <em>\u201csurvivor,\u201d </em>there lias been and still is great contrariety of opinion. To use the language of a learned writer, \u201cthe state of the authorities seems hardly to justify the hope that litigation has reached its limits on this often occurring point.\u201d It is not deemed necessary to recur to the cases in which the questions has occurred. The principal decisions will he found collected in 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>735. An examination of them ..will justify, I think, the opinion that the liberal construction which had obtained, has been shaken, if not overruled, by subsequent cases, that is, in all cases where there is no explanatory context. A liberal construction of the words \u201csurviving chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>dren\u201d in the will of Elizabeth Torrance, would give to them an estate in fee, and demand of the court a dismissal of the bill, as in such case the complainant would be without such interest as is necessary to give him a standing in court. When this case was argued, I inclined to the opinion that such would necessarily be the decision of the court, but subsequent reflection and examination have induced the conviction that such construction would be erroneous. It would render the words <em>\u201cand </em>representatives\u201d wholly ineffective, and violate the manifest intention of the testator Charles, for it must be obvious it was his purpose that his daughters, in no event, should receive more than a life estate. Besides, if the estate of each daughter dying without issue devolves her estate on the survivor, when all shall have' died there would be none to take, and this would be the case when the two daughters now living shall have died. Looking, therefore, to the purpose of both testators as manifested throughout their wills, the clause must be interpreted so as to read as if written, \u201call my surviving children, and the representatives of my deceased children.\u201d Where the purpose of the testator is clear and not in conflict with any principle of law, courts will give it effect so that equity may be done. 2 <em>H. </em>\u00a7\u25a0 G., 130. 4 <em>G. </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>J., </em>328. <em>5 G. fy J., </em>459. <em>Ibid., </em>159. That courts will insert words necessary to effectuate the intention of a testator, is established by the cases. 7 <em>H. Sr J., </em>221, and 2 <em>H. </em>\u00a7\u2022 G., 42. If these views be correct, a decree must be given in conformity with the prayer of the bill. On the whole the court is of opinion, that the surviving daughters take but a life estate in the share of their sister Dorcas, and that the complainant, as representative of his father, takes his share as tenant in fee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">From this decree the defendants, Mary and Louisa Torrance, appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b26-6\">The cause was argued before Eccleston, Mason and Tuck, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-7\"><em>Wm.

The disposition by Elizabeth Torrance of the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Charles Torrance, took effect only as an <em>appointment </em>of <em>his </em>estate amongst his children. 2 <em>Crabb on Real Property, secs. </em>2028, 2029, (55 <em>Law Lib., </em>478.) 16 <em>Law Lib., </em>16, 17. 2 <em>Sugden on Powers, </em>26. 2 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>70. Hence it follows, that if she <em>exceeded </em>her power, the appointment is only good as far as within the power, and is void for the excess. 2 <em>Sugden on Powers, </em>90. 16 <em>Law Lib., </em>51. 5 <em>Simmons, </em>632. (7 <em>Eng. Ch. Rep., </em>562, <em>Sadler vs. Pratt.) </em>2 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>336, <em>Bristow vs. Warde, note (a.) </em>1 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>310, <em>note. 2 Ves., Jr., </em>640.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-8\">2nd. When, therefore, Mrs. Torrance appointed <em>one-eighth </em>of the estate to Dorcas, and imposed on that shave the limitations and restrictions directed by her husband, and <em>in the very words of her husband's will, </em>she had fully exercised the power. If there had been no appointment, the property would have descended to the heirs of Charles Torrance. He never said what should become of his estate in case his daughters should die without issue, and gave no power of appointment in such case to his wife. All that portion of her will, therefore, commencing at the word <em>\u201citem,\u201d </em>is <em>ultra </em>the power and merely void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">3rd. Hence Dorcas, by appointment of her mother, took <em>one-eighth </em>of her <em>father's </em>estate under her <em>father's </em>will, that is to say the <em>quantity </em>and <em>quality </em>of her estate in her said share, is to be decided by the intention in that respect of her father\u2019s will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-10\">4th. Under the will of her father, Dorcas took by construction a fee-simple. He designed the children of the daughters should take <em>through </em>their mothers. He does not say that his daughters shall take only a life estate, but he says that the part designed for his daughters shall be so secured to them for life, as to prevent the control of their husbands over it, and after their decease for the benefit of their <em>children. </em>The word children may be as well a word of <em>limitation </em>as of <em>purchase. </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>83, 86, 107. He meant the children to take through the mother as the representative of the mother \u2014 the words are, <em>\u201cshall be secured, to them;\u201d </em>that is, the whole estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and so secured as to pass for the benefit of the children \u2014 pass <em>by </em>descent as the mother\u2019s property. Why secure the share to the children if the daughter was to have but a life estate? The <em>corpus </em>or substance of the estate, and not its mere quality, was to be secured to the mother.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-5\">But the mother also meant by her will that the daughters should take an estate in fee, for she provides for the estate to <em>descend. </em>When lands are devised to one and his children, and he has no children at the time the devise was made, the devisee takes an estate tail. 2 <em>Powell on Devises, </em>494, (22 <em>Law Lib., </em>264.) Here Dorcas was unmarried when the mother made her will. She gives the estate to the daughter for and during her natural life, and after her death to her children. The meaning is that the estate should vest in the mother, and the children should take from her. The rule in <em>Shelley's case </em>stands on the same ground. The word \u201cissue\u201d is sometimes doubtful-^it may be a word of limitation or of purchase \u2014 so with <em>\u201cchildren.\" </em>If they <em>are to take </em>an estate descendible or through the first taker, it is a word of limitation, and the first taker takes an estate sufficiently large to enable the children to take an estate by descent. A devise for life may, by subsequent words, be enlarged to an estate tail. 2 <em>Crabb on Real Property, secs. </em>983, 985, 55 <em>Law Lib., 23, 25. </em>The whole will shows that the daughters were to take descendible estates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">The limitation over after the death of the daughter, \u201cwithout leaving any child or children,\u201d is too remote, being after an indefinite failure of issue. 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>236, 247, <em>Dallam vs. Dallam. </em>1 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>G., </em>123, 125, 126, <em>Newton vs. Griffith. </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>207, 209, 212. 6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>235, 236, <em>Biscoe vs. Biscoe.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-8\">5th. But if, upon the true construction of her father\u2019s will, the estate of Dorcas is properly to be considered as an estate in her for life, with a contingent remainder in fee to her children, then, in the event that has happened of her dying without issue, and the consequent failure of the limitation in Remainder to take effect, the reversion has descended upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the heirs at law of <em>Charles Torrance; </em>and the appellants are respectively entitled, each, to <em>one-sixth </em>part thereof; and the complainant below, upon amending his bill and claiming, through his father, as one of the heirs at law of said Charles Torrance, his grandfather, and claiming also as one of the heirs at .law of Charles Torrance, his uncle, will be entitled, as owner of <em>one-sixth </em>thereof, to maintain his bill for a partition or sale of said property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">The preceding points are based on the notion that so much of the will of Elizabeth Torrance, as is specified in the second point, is an excess of power, and inoperative and void. But if the court should hold otherwise, and deem the same a valid and effectual exercise of the power conferred upon her by her husband\u2019s will, then\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">6th. The effect in law of said item, is to convert the estate, antecedently given to Dorcas by her mother\u2019s will, (whether that antecedent estate was an estate in fee or an estate for life,) into an estate in fee-tail general; and which in Maryland is an estate in fee-simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">7th. But if this be wrong, and the quantity of estate given to Dorcas was but an estate for her life, and the limitation over, after a limitation in fee to her children, be good by way of executory devise, then the limitation over being to \u201call my <em>surviving children </em>and their respective representatives as tenants in common,\u201d is exclusive of the complainant, who is not a child (but a grand-child,) of Elizabeth Torrance, and whose father, John Torrance, died long before Dorcas. The share of Dorcas, upon this construction, would he divisible between the three surviving daughters, Mrs. Clopper, Mary Torrance and Louisa Torrance, subject to the trusts imposed on the shares of the daughters by the mother\u2019s will. The words <em>\u201ctheir representatives,\" </em>refers to the surviving children. The word <em>\u201cchildren\u2019' </em>here does not mean <em>grand-children. </em>16 <em>Law Lib., </em>148. 2 <em>Sugden on Powers, </em>272. 13 <em>Eng. Ch.

He then confers upon her the power to dispose of the estate, with two restrictions attached. In the first place, she is required to dispose of the estate \u201camong all or such of my children or their issue, in such manner and proportion, and for such time and estate, as she shall think fit.\u201d The second restriction or condition requires, \u201cthat the respective shares or portions, designed for my daughters, shall be secured to them, for life, free and clear of any control of their respective husbands, or without being liable to the payment of their debts, and after their decease for the benefit of their children, and their legal representatives, in equal proportions forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Subsequently, Mrs. Elizabeth Torrance, in supposed pursuance of the power delegated to her by her husband, made her will disposing of the whole estate. The first question which arises is, were the bequests under Mrs. Torrance\u2019s will made in accordance with the power conferred upon her, by her husband ; and secondly, if they were, what are the nature and effect of those bequests'?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">This court is of opinion that the testatrix did not transcend her powers, in the will which is now before us. As directed by her husband, she disposed of the estate <em>among his children and their issue, </em>and also directs that <em>the several interests designed for his daughters should he held as separate estates free from, the control or dominion of their husbands. </em>We cannot discover that any limit was placed upon the power, as relates to the <em>quantity and quality </em>of the estate to be devised, further than those already enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">We are next to consider what interest did the several devisees take under Mrs. Torrance\u2019s will?</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Her three sons, Charles, George and John Torrance, each took one-eighth part of the estate in fee-simple. There is no dispute upon this point. Nor is there any question in regard to the interest taken by Mrs. Clopper and Mrs. Mitchell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Each took an equitable life estate, with remainder in fee to their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The present controversy grows out of the proper construction to be given to the clauses of the will which relate to the devises to the three daughters, Mary, Louisa and Dorcas Torrance, and especially that clause which relates to their <em>dying without children, &amp;c.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Those three, we are of opinion, took each but a <em>life estate </em>under the will. Whether this life estate was created by the mother by virtue of the general power conferred upon her, in her husband\u2019s will, <em>that she might dispose of the estate in such manner and proportion, and for such term and estate, as she shall think fit; </em>or whether it was taken in pursuance of the direction or condition imposed by the husband, <em>that the respective shares or portions designed for my daughters shall he secured to them for life, </em>it is immaterial for us to inquire at present. The result would be the same. The case of <em>Chelton vs. Henderson\u2019s Lessee, </em>9 <em>Gill, 432, we think </em>conclusively determines the construction which we have placed upon Mrs. Torrance\u2019s will to be the proper one. See, also, the case of <em>Ware, and Others, vs. Richardson, </em>decided at the present term. (3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Dorcas, one of the daughters, has since died, without having left issue, or been married; and the next question to be determined is, what is the legal <em>effect </em>of the following clause of the will of her mother upon her interest? That clause is in these words, viz: \u201cItem. \u2014 In the event of the decease of any of my aforesaid daughters, without leaving any child or children, or descendants of such child or children, the part or share of the estate hereinbefore devised to her or them, so dying, shall descend to, and be equally divided between all my surviving children, and their respective representatives, as tenants in common, share and share alike.\u201d The above clause is to be construed in connection with the previous clause, wherein the life estate is created in Dorcas, and where, after her death, the fee is conferred upon her children, in the following words, to wit: \u201cand from and after the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>cease of the said Dorcas, then, in trust that the said share shall become the estate of all and every the child and children she may have, their heirs,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Under the authority of <em>Griffith vs. </em>Newton, 1 <em>Harr. and Gill, </em>111, and indeed of all the leading and well adjudicated cases upon the subject, both in England and in this country, we think, that the expression, <em>dying without leaving any child or </em>children, <em>or descendants of such child or </em>children, amounts to an indefinite failure of issue, and that the limitation over, being too remote, is consequently void. <em>Descendants </em>and <em>issue, </em>in this instance, mean the same. The devise in the present will, it will be seen, can only take effect over, at the period when the issue or descendants of the first taker, shall become extinct, and when there are no longer any descendants of the issue, or children of the grantee, without any reference to any particular time, or any particular event. An executory devise upon such an indefinite failure of issue, upon principle, is clearly void, because it might tie up property for endless generations.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In the case of <em>Tenny vs. Agar, </em>12 <em>East., </em>253, the devise was to the son and daughter in fee, but if they should happen to die without having <em>any child or issue lawfully </em>begotten, then remainder over. Upon this clause of the will Lord Ellenborough held, that nothing could be clearer than that the remainder-man was not intended by the testator to lake any thing until the issue of the son and daughter were all extinct, and the remainder over, was consequently held void and inoperative. <em>Issue </em>in that case was a term clearly not more comprehensive than <em>descendants </em>is, in this. There are numerous authorities sustaining these general propositions, and to those already cited we would add, <em>King vs. Rumball, Cro. Jac., </em>448. <em>Holmes vs. Meynel, T. Raym., </em>452. <em>Denn vs. Slater, </em>5 <em>Term Rep., </em>335. <em>Doe vs. Ellis, </em>9 <em>East., </em>382. <em>Barlow vs. Salter, </em>17 <em>Ves., </em>479. <em>Dallam vs. Dallam, </em>7 <em>Har. and John., </em>220. <em>Bells vs. Gillespie, </em>5 <em>Rand., </em>273. <em>Ide vs. Ide, 5 Mass., </em>500. <em>Irwin vs. Dunwoody, </em>17 <em>Serg. and Rawle, </em>61.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The estate, therefore, in which Dorcas had an interest, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>remainder over being void, falls back to the estate of the original testator, Charles Torrance, and descends as undisposed of property, to his heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The father of the complainant being dead at the time Dorcas died, the complainant takes one-sixth of the property in which Dorcas had a life estate, as heir directly of his grandfather, and not as heir of his father, who never was seized of any interest in her share of the estate. Neither was his uncle, Charles, ever seized of any interest in Dorcas\u2019 share, which could descend to the complainant, the uncle having also died intestate and without children, before Dorcas.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We are also of opinion, that the averments in the bill, and the proof, are sufficient to warrant the sale and the relief prayed for, and that therefore the decree below must be affirmed</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">We remand the cause with instructions to distribute the fund arising from the sale when brought into court, in accord-with the principles announced in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\"><em>Decree affirmed and cause </em>remanded, <em>costs in both courts to be paid out of the proceeds of sale.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
