As to the rights of the parties, independent of <em>\u201cBold Venture:\u201d </em>The proprietors <em>o\u00ed \u201cFell\u2019s Prospect\u201d </em>have equal rights with the owners of <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019s Keck.\u201d \u201cFell\u2019s Prospect\u201d </em>was granted 1763, and the act of 1773 is the only act under which the plaintiffs claim. In 11 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>359, no act of 1773 was referred to, but that decision went upon the act of 1745. The act of 1773, in fact, added two hundred acres to the city, and included <em>\u201cFell\u2019s Prospect.\u201d </em>A legislative act is a grant, and the defendants are therefore grantees of <em>equal </em>date with the plaintiffs, for <em>\u201cFell\u2019s Prospect\u201d </em>was added to the city the <em>same day </em>with' <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019s Keck.\u201d </em>This makes the distinction between this case and the case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>because in that there was no reference to the act of 1773, and the plat made under it. The legislature could distribute favors to whom it chose. There was no inherent power in the elder patent, that it should alone be the recipient of these favors. The right to improve is a <em>quasi property, </em>but it vests only when the improvements are made, and this applies to us, the owners of u <em>Fell\u2019s Prospect,\u201d </em>as well as the owners of <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019s Meek.\u201d </em>The legislature have the right to grant land covered by water. <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019s Meek\u201d </em>originally ran across an arm of the <em>sea, </em>and therefore was not riparian any more than <em>\u201cBold Venture.\u201d </em>The grant of <em>\u201cBold Venture\u201d </em>has been again and again affirmed by this court. The only limitation upon the sovereign power is, that it cannot grant land so as to interfere with the rights of navigation and fishery. The case in <em>2 H. &amp; McH., 246, </em>turned upon the point that there had been a fraud committed upon the lord proprietary in obtaining the grant of the patent of <em>\u2018'Bold Marsh.\u201d </em>The directions of the lord proprietary to the land office was, that all lands within five miles of Baltimore should be reserved and not granted, and the application for the resurvey of <em>\"Bold Marsh\u201d </em>did not aver that it was within five miles of the city, which was <em>in fact </em>the case, and the patent was vacated on this ground. The doctrine of alluvion never sanctioned the idea that if there was a sudden subsiding of the sea, the land would belong to the riparian proprietor; in such a case it would belong to the State, and so if an island suddenly springs up. The riparian proprietor gets what increases little by little, of which the law takes no notice\u2014 <em>gradual </em>accretion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-5\">2nd. As to the effect of <em>\"Bold Venture:\u201d </em>If an heir of Mrs. Oulton should appear, what would bar his recovery? nothing! The outstanding title is good. The evidence shows that the property became fast land in 1836, and could not have been taken possession of before. Limitations could not run against an heir of Oulton, except from the time when the land became fast, and if such an heir should come forward to-day' he could recover. There has been no claim or possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>adverse to that of <em>John Oulton. </em>But the case has been twice decided, and unless this case differs in a material point from' the case in 6 <em>Gill, </em>the judgment must be affirmed. It is said that it is different, because the acts of 1796 and 1816 are now in. But the act of 1796, ch. 68, gives new rights to nobody, it simply erects Baltimore town into a city. The 11th sec. gives the city council full power to control all improvements into the basin, but it makes no new grants to anybody. The act of 1816 is merely an act to enlarge the city of Baltimore. These acts therefore make no difference in the two cases. The only additional evidence is the administration on the estates of John and Mary Oulton, and the grant of \u201cPem-<em>Mico,\u201d </em>and this is introduced to show an escheat of <em>\"Bold Venture\u201d </em>prior to 1745. But this evidence falls, because the defendants show the will of <em>Oulton, </em>by which he devises the land to his wife and makes her his heir. But <em>Mrs. Oulton </em>also died the same year, and administration was granted on her estate. This is no evidence ^fhat she died intestate, because the custom then was to grant letters of administration as well where there was a will as where not. There has been no search for her will; she may have left a large family and the record still be correct. The answer to this is, that no claim has been made by the heirs of Oulton. No claim could be made until 1836, when the land first appeared above water.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-5\">The propositions of law embraced in the plaintiff\u2019s prayers could, by no possibility, be granted. The first prayer is defective for various reasons. There is but one <em>Spencer </em>mentioned in the evidence. There is no proof that the daughters of Peterkin died intestate and without issue. They may have had issue without being married, and in such case the issue, though illegitimate, would have been the <em>heir at law. </em>There is no evidence as to when these 'children died. This prayer does not raise the question which survived, <em>Peterkin or his wife. </em>There is no evidence that Benjamin Spencer died intestate. Again it could not be granted, because it takes no notice of <em>\"Bold, Venture.\u201d </em>It supposes that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>could recover in spite of <em>\"Bold </em>Venture,\u201d which is directly in the teeth of the decision in 6 <em>Gill.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-5\">The second prayer could not be granted, because it calls upon the jury to say that if there was no <em>descent </em>the plaintiffs could recover, whereas there might have been a devise of the land in question. An escheat cannot be proved by proving that there are no parties claiming by <em>descent.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-6\"><em>Reverdy Johnson </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-7\">1st. As to the true interpretation of the acts of 1745 and 1773: What are the rights a proprietor gets where his land borders on a navigable river? The first right such riparian owner has is a right of <em>navigation and of fishery. </em>As to fishery, he has the <em>exclusive </em>right to draw his net to his own shore. He has no exclusive right to navigate, though he has to start his vessels from his own <em>land. </em>But there is another right belonging to such properties, and that is the right of <em>alluvion. </em>Now what is this right? It is the right to become the owner of all the land which may accrue by <em>gradual </em>accretion; but such increase must <em>he gradual. </em>The reason of this right is, because he is liable to lose by the washing away of his lands. It must be <em>gradually acquired, </em>it cannot be <em>made: </em>if the sea subsides <em>at once, </em>the land uncovered does not belong to the proprietors of the original tract, because in such case there is not found the essential ingredient of <em>gradual </em>accretion \u2014 so if an island suddenly springs up. If this be so, there is then no impropriety in granting fast land to one and land covered by water to another. But this is not now an open question. The State may grant land covered by water outside of the fast land. The opinion in 1 <em>Gill, </em>512, by Judge <em>Dorsey, </em>is sustained by the case of <em>Brown vs. Kennedy, </em>5 <em>H. </em>&amp; J., 202, 204, 208, 209. The same doctrine is advanced in 11 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>358, by Justice <em>Stephens. </em>The law of this State then is, that the grant of <em>\u201c Mountenay\u2019s </em>Jfeck\u201d does not include the land covered by <em>\u201cBold </em>Venture,\u201d and gave no title to land south of its <em>southernmost </em>line. Independent then of the act of 1745, if the owners of <em>\"Mountenayh </em>JVec/c\u201d had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>undertaken to fill up the land included within the lines of <em>\u201cBold </em>Venture,\u201d by driving down piles, or anything else, the owner of <em>\u201cBold </em>Venture\u201d could have brought ejectment and stopped them. Apart from the escheat of <em>\u201cBold </em>Venture,\u201d then, the case is clear of difficulty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">Up to 1745, then, the patentee of <em>\u201cBold Venture\u201d </em>was the owner of all the land within its lines. If the State had the right to grant this patent, it is inconsistent that the owners of <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019 s </em>Neck\u201d should be entitled to any part of it. But it is admitted for the sake of the argument, that this rule is qualified so far as to prohibit the grant of land in <em>\u201cBold </em>Venture,\u201d so as to interfere with the alluvial rights of <em>\u201cMountenay's Neck.\u201d </em>This would only give the first grantee the same right as against the second grantee that he would have as against the State; But what is this right of alluvion?^-it is not the right to improve. The act of 1745 gave the riparian owners the right to have what they would not have by the right of alluvion. All the owners of these water lots under this act had equally the right to improve, including the owners of <em>\u201cBold Venture.\u201d </em>The land here has not been made by any alluvion, but by artificial causes. The same facts exist here as in <em>Brown vs. Kennedy. </em>The act of 1745 has nothing to do with the alluvial rights belonging to <em>\u201c </em>Moun<em>tenay\u2019s Neck\u201d </em>\u2014 it is entirely separate and distinct. The State had the right to grant the land, and having granted <em>\u201cBold Venture\u201d </em>in 1695, she could not, in 1745, by any power of grant, authorise the owner of <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019s Neck\u201d </em>to come within the lines of <em>\u201cBold Venture.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">Again, the doctrine of 11 <em>G. &amp; J. </em>is not applicable to this case. In that case the defendants claimed title by virtue of <em>\u201cFells Prospect,\u201d </em>and claimed as riparian owners also. But at the time the act of 1745 was passed, <em>\u201cFells Prospect\u201d was not </em>granted, and this was the weakness of the defendants\u2019 case. The court did not, in that case, decide, that in reference to the dates of the patents themselves, the right to improve belonged to the eldest title, they only decide, that as <em>\u201cFells </em>Prospect\u201d was not then granted, the right to improve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>belonged to <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019s Neck.\u201d </em>11 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>359. The act of 1745 was a <em>quasi </em>grant, and attached to each of the water lots which the State had previously granted by patent. If the act of 1773 had not passed, the owner of \u201c <em>Mountenay\u2019s Neck\u201d </em>could lay no claim to this property; they only had it by that act. They do not get this right by <em>seniority </em>of patent by virtue of that act, because it then, for the first time, brings <em>\u201c Mountenay\u2019s Neck\u201d </em>into Baltimore city, but at the <em>same time \u201cFell\u2019s Prospect\u201d </em>was brought in. Suppose these two tracts were granted by the same patent, with the power to make this improvement, would one part of it have any right over that of another? But the fact that they were granted at different times makes no difference. The right here was a right in the nature of a franchise attaching to the lands, <em>first </em>given by the act of 1773. At that time we were then holders of water lots as well as were the holders of \u201c <em>Mountenay\u2019s Neck.\u201d </em>The right <em>vested eo instanti </em>in the proprietors of the two tracts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-5\"><em>Bulany </em>for the appellants, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">The merits of the case are not affected by the little discrepancies and omissions in the prayers, and these points ought to be discouraged, and this is in strict conformity to the act of 1825, ch. 117. 11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>361. The objection comes too late, and moreover, there is sufficient in the record to submit the question of possession, independent of the deeds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-8\">It is said, that as the act of 1773 was passed after both patents of <em>\u201cFell\u2019s Prospect\u201d </em>and <em>\u201cMountenay\u2019s Neck\u201d </em>it threw the right of improvement upon both <em>equally. </em>This puts the parties in conflict as to their rights, and the <em>rule </em>then is to give it to the <em>eldest patent. </em>This was the rule laid down in 11 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., in analogy to the seniority of patents when granted of the same land. 1 <em>Gill, </em>510. 1 <em>Gill, </em>506, 507. The effect of an <em>escheat </em>is to draw with it all the rights which belonged to the original patent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-10\">The points involved in this case have been decided in the case of 2 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>246. The fact that the lands in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>case were within in the <em>reserves </em>does not vary the case, for the act of 1782, ch. 38, appropriates these reserves to such purposes as the General Assembly should thereafter direct. This reserve was therefore dedicated by the act of 1773 to the improvements specified by that act. 2 <em>Md. Ch. Decisions, </em>495.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-5\">. The ground of the decision in 1 <em>Gill </em>and 6 <em>Gill </em>is upon the effect of the outstanding title of \u201c <em>Bold </em>Venture.\u201d The construction of the act of 1745 and 1773 was unquestionably erroneous. The doctrine of estoppel does not apply to a legislative act.. The words of the act of 1745 are in the <em>future tense-, </em>as, well as in the past.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ALA\">Tuck, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">As the present controversy grows out of the same title as that, set up in the case of <em>Hammond vs. Inloes, (ante, 138,) </em>and the suit was defended in the same manner, reference is made to the opinion in that case for a statement of what we-consider to have been settled by the former decisions of this court, and by which some of the questions argued on this-appeal are also to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">It is sufficiently shown by the letters of administration on the estate of John and Mary Oulton, that they were dead in the year 1709. 1 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., sec. </em>550. He devised <em>\"Bold </em>Venture\u201d to Mary Oulton in fee. As evidence that this tract escheated after her death, the plaintiffs relied on the patent of \u201cRogers\u2019 Inspection,\u201d granted in 1759, which was also- in evidence in the case of <em>Wilson vs. Inloes, </em>6 <em>Gill, </em>and on the first trial of <em>Casey vs. Inloes, </em>1 <em>Gill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">The plaintiffs offered three prayers and the defendants offered three, identical with those presented in 6 <em>Gill, </em>and the. case of <em>Hammond vs. Inloes, </em>at this term. If the plaintiffs\u2019 case has not been materially improved, the judgment of this court must be the same in both eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">\u25a0 Objection has been made on the part of the appellees to the title of the plaintiffs, independently of any defence on their part founded upon the grant of \u201c <em>Bold </em>Venture.\u201d They have also contended, that as the title of the plaintiffs' com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>menced in 1773 by the legislative grant of that year, (as now insisted by them,) no priority of franchise or right to improve could be claimed by one riparian owner over another, both being such at the passage of that act; and that as the addition to Baltimore town, then made, first included the water line of <em>\u201cMountenay\u201d </em>and that of <em>\u201cFelPs Prospect\u201d </em>under which the defendants claim, both of which had been previously granted, the owners of these tracts must be considered as entitled, cotemporaneously, to the \u201cimmunities and privileges\u201d conferred by that act; that is, the right to impw in the act of 1745: and that <em>\u201cMountenay^ </em>situation in that respect than <em>\u201cFelPs Prospk </em>it unnecessary to express any opinion uj because we think that the interests of the pf the case should be disposed of by a decision*</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The <em>first </em>prayer of the plaintiffs was defect?! mitting to the jury to find, whether the addition to Baltimore was made as located on the plats. If the act of 1745, at the time of its passage, did not affect the property in controversy, because it had not then become a part of Baltimore, the act of 1773 conferred no privileges to the riparian owners, unless it appeared that the addition was made in pursuance of that act. According to the prayer, the jury might have found for the plaintiffs, even if the addition had never been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">But this prayer is defective in not taking notice of the title of <em>\u201cBold Venture,\u201d </em>for the reasons assigned by us in <em>Hammond vs. Inloes, </em>to which reference is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The <em>second </em>prayer asserts that <em>\u201cBold Venture\u201d </em>escheated before 1745. The evidence shows that Mary Oulton died in 1709. But it does not submit to the jury whether she died intestate as well as without heirs. But apart from this defect in the frame of the prayer, we thiuk that the evidence was not sufficient to warrant the finding of an escheat before 1745. The law does notpsesume that a person dies without heirs. The absence of any claim of title by those representing her is not to be taken against the defendants, when we consider the nature of the property, as we have heretofore said, in <em>Ham</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>mond\u2019s case. </em>If <em>\u201cRogers\u2019 Inspection\u201d </em>be relied on as proof of escheat, we must not forget that the Court of Appeals, in 1 Gill, 510, decided that a patent is evidence of escheat at the'.date of the warrant and not before. The other evidence, in our opinion, does not show that the property had returned to the State at an earlier period than April 1759, the date of the warrant for <em>\u201cRogers\u2019 Inspection.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The <em>third </em>prayer, predicated on the same proof, refers the escheat of <em>\u201cBold Venture\u201d </em>to 1773, and asserts that it was sufficient to authorise the jury to find that fact as of that time. We do not think that the further lapse of twenty-eight years from the time of Mary Oulton\u2019s death will, under the circumstances of this case, produce that result. And if <em>\u201cRogers\u2019 Inspection\u201d </em>is supposed to be evidence of the fact, as of the date of the warrant, it must be taken altogether, as well against, as for, the party offering it in evidence. And from it it may fairly be inferred, that the State had, previously to the act of 1773, granted all of <em>\u201cBold Venture;\u201d </em>for that patent grants to Rogers a certain number of acres, <em>\u201cclear of elder surveys,\u201d </em>which must mean elder surveys <em>o\u00ed \u201cBold Venture,\u201d </em>because Rogers was entitled by his warrant to take up the whole of that tract as escheat. This statement in the patent we regard as evidence, upon the authority of this court in 1 <em>Gill, </em>492, where an ancient certificate of the surveyor was received as evidence, that at that time the premises were in possession of the persons named therein as being in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">We are of opinion that this case is not materially different from <em>Hammond vs. Inloes; </em>and for the reasons assigned and upon the authorities cited in both cases, we approve of the refusal by. the court below to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers, and of their instructions to the jury as prayed on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
