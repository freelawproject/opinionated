J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Avp\">In calculating the taxable value of decedent\u2019s estate, the Transfer Inheritance Tax Bureau (Bureau) refused to allow as a deduction that portion of the executors\u2019 commission which was calculated upon the amount by which the market value of the common stocks left by the testator had risen since his death. The executors appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">In 1962 the Bureau promulgated a ruling which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">\u201cPursuant to the authority granted by the Director of the Division of Taxation the following policy will be followed in determining the amount to be allowed as a deduction for executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s commissions. (R. S. 54:34-5c; N. J. S. 3A:10-1 et seq).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">1. <em>Rates</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-14\">First ..........$ 100,000.00 \u2014 5% (gtatutory)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-15\">Next .......... 400,000.00 \u2014 3%%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-16\">Next ....... 500,000.00 \u2014 3%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-17\">Excess over............ 1,000,000.00 \u2014 2%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number># * s|: \u2756 \u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">3. Where a formal account is filed, and the amount allowed by the court for the executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s commissions is <em>greater </em>than the amount previously fixed by the Bureau, the examiner shall, before revising the assessment, obtain a plain copy of the judgment allowing commissions, and shall apply <em>the rate used by the court to the value, as of the date of death </em>as determined by the Bureau, of the property on which the allowance of the court is based; <em>provided, that'the value of any property not subjected to tax shall be excluded from the computation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The Chancery Division granted executor\u2019s commissions of $231,540, admittedly calculated upon the following formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201c$ 100,000 at 5% ........................... $ 5,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">5.012.000 at <em>3Yz% </em>........................ 175,420.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">5.112.000 at <em>1% </em>........................... 51,120.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">$231,540.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The Bureau allowed a deduction of only $173,386.06 of this amount, on the basis that the difference represented commissions upon the increased value of the stocks. The executors contend that this was error, arguing that, since <em>R. S. </em>54:34-5(c) says flatly that \u201cThe ordinary expenses of administration, including the ordinary fees allowed executors\u201d shall be allowed and sets forth no exceptions or limitations upon this direction, the Bureau was obliged to follow the express language of the statute, and its regulation to the contrary is invalid. Furthermore, pointing out that <em>N. J. S. 3A </em>:10-1 provides that \u201cAllowance of commissions on corpus in excess of $100,000.00 to executors * * * shall be made with reference to their actual pains, trouble and risk in settling the estate, rather than in respect to the quantum of the estate,\u201d they argue that the statute sets up no mathematical formula for the calculation of commissions in estates of this size; if it were not known how the Chancery Division arrived at the commissions it awarded, the entire sum would have to be allowed by the Bureau; and the fact that here the court\u2019s reckoning was known should make no difference. Indeed, say they, the court did not reward them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>for the rise in value of the stocks but rather for the risk they took in advising their retention, and the use of the mathematical formula was purely fortuitous and was not intended to isolate and pay for the rise in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">A testamentary transfer, in legal contemplation, occurs at the date of death; the value of the property so transferred upon which the tax is computed is its net value as of the date of death; the tax is not only due but vests in the State immediately upon the date of death, and the appreciation of the value of the assets after the testator\u2019s death is not taxable. <em>Hamlen v. Martin, </em>128 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>393 <em>(Prerog. </em>1940); <em>United States v. Kingsley, </em>41 <em>N. J. 75 </em>(1963); <em>R. S. </em>54:35-1. That being so, we are persuaded to follow the reasoning of <em>In re Woolworth\u2019s Estate, </em>235 <em>App Div. </em>160, 256 <em>N. Y. S. </em>839 <em>(App. Div. </em>1932) affirmed 260 <em>N. Y. </em>637, 184 <em>N. E. </em>125 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1932). There commissions based on an increase in asset value were disallowed. The Appellate Division said that since \u201cno increase in the value of the estate occurring subsequent to the transfer is taxable * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">It would seem to follow naturally and logically that any increase or decrease cannot affect the amount of deductions based thereupon, but that such deductions should be based upon the value of the estate passing at the time of decedent\u2019s death.\u201d (256 <em>N. Y. S., </em>at <em>p. </em>847)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201cIn other words, these commissions on the increase are an expense having no basis in the property transferred, but arising solely from property not transferred by the decedent\u2019s death and acquired since the transfer, and therefore not subject to taxation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">[The increase in value upon which these commissions are based] accrued and became the property of the beneficiaries subsequent to the transfer, and it would seem that any commissions based upon this increase are an expense to be borne by the beneficiaries of the estate and not deductible from the appraised value. To deduct these additional commissions from the appraised gross value of the estate at the time of decedent\u2019s death would result in relieving from taxation a portion of the estate which did pass to the transferees.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>848)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The executors reply that this decision might have been to the contrary if the New York statute had specifically directed the deduction of executor\u2019s commissions, as ours does, citing a comment in 92 <em>A. L. R. </em>537, 544 (1934) to that effect. However, as the Bureau points out, the New York Appellate Division, in <em>In re Hard\u2019s Estate, </em>261 <em>App. Div. </em>192, <em>(App. Div. </em>1941) 24 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>867 (1941), held the reasoning of <em>Woolworth </em>applicable to the New York Tax Law of 1930, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 60 (adopted after Woolworth\u2019s death) which, in \u00a7 249-n, provided for an estate tax on the decedent\u2019s \u201cnet estate,\u201d and in \u00a7 249-s defined the \u201cvalue of the net estate\u201d as the \u201cgross estate\u201d minus, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\"><em>\u201c1. </em>Such amounts * * * (b) for administration expenses * * * as are allowed by the laws of this state. * * * Deductions on account of commissions or allowances to executors shall not exceed the amount of such commissions or allowances as prescribed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Under section 285, subdivision 2 of the Surrogate\u2019s Court Act then in effect commissions were to be computed on \u201cthe value of any real or personal property, to be determined in such manner as the surrogate may direct, and the increment thereof, * * Nevertheless the court held in <em>Hard\u2019s Estate </em>that the reasoning in <em>Woolworth </em>was unaffected by the enactment of the new law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
