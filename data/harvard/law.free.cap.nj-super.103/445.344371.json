A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AkT\">Judge Barrett, on August .17, 1961, found that defendant\u2019s conduct, in driving while he was intoxicated, was under the totality of the circumstances, \u201cwilful and malicious as the terms are used in the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d Consequently, the judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to stay, pending his bankruptcy proceeding, the execution against his wages issued to satisfy a judgment in a negligence action. This finding was incorporated in an order dated August 24, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">We agree with Judge Hayden\u2019s determination made on March 8, 1968 upon a renewed application for a wage execution, and here appealed, that Judge Barrett\u2019s decision was <em>res adjud\u00edcala </em>on the issue of dischargeability of the judgment in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Defendant first contends that <em>prior </em>to a bankruptcy discharge a state court does not have jurisdiction to decide the issue of whether a debt allegedly arising from a willful and malicious act is dischargeable. He asserts that any such prior finding is therefore not <em>res adjudicata </em>in a state court until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>such issue is properly raised <em>after </em>discharge. Defendant\u2019s position is that the nature of the relief sought before Judge Barrett was discretionary and the sole determination that be could properly have made was that \u201cit appears\u201d that the judgment was not dischargeable. It is asserted that lie lacked jurisdiction to make \u201ca finding of fact bearing on the nature of the debtor\u2019s dischargeability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">However, defendant himself in 1961, in opposing plaintiff\u2019s wage execution and in requesting a stay, asserted the dischargeability of the judgment entered against him as an absolute bar against the issuance of the wage execution. Defendant did not then take the position he now urges. Thus, dischargeability was the issue that was contested by the parties and submitted to the court for determination. And the court flatly decided it on the merits. The decision of the question was material to the court\u2019s action of denial of the motion for a stay, being the only ground therefor. AYc therefore find an identity of issues in the 1961 and 1968 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">None of the cases cited by defendants holds that a state court with jurisdiction over a claim cannot, <em>prior </em>to discharge, adjudicate on the merits the dischargeability of that claim in the course of a hearing on a request for a stay. To the contrary, it would seem that such jurisdiction has been taken for granted. See <em>Pettit v. Port Newark Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>110 <em>N. J. Eq. 324, </em>329 <em>(Ch. </em>1932); <em>Mass v. Kuhn, </em>130 <em>App. Div. </em>68, 114 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>S. </em>444 , 445 <em>(App. Div. </em>1909); <em>St. Louis, B. &amp; M. Ry. Co. v. Brack, </em>102 <em>S. W. 2d </em>261 <em>(Tex. Ct. App. </em>1937); Harts<em>field Co. v. Newlin, </em>49 <em>Ga. App. </em>546, 176 <em>S. E. </em>516 <em>(Ga. Ct. App. </em>1934). We conclude that this contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Defendant further argues that the determination and order of Judge Barrett was not <em>res adjud\u00edcala </em>because it was not a \u201cfinal\u201d judgment reviewable on appeal. This point is frivolous. The determination terminated the litigation on the matter decided, being an adjudication of a litigated matter in the proceedings subsequent to judgment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>order on that decision was therefore a final appealable adjudication. <em>Romano v. Maglio, </em>41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>561, 568-570 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
