J. S. A. </em>34:15-8, is equatable with \u201cgross negligence,\u201d or similar concepts importing constructive intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Our discussion of the background against which the cited provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law was adopted by amendment in 1961 <em>(L. </em>1961, <em>c. </em>2) in <em>Miller v. Muscarelle, </em>67 <em>N. J. Super. </em>305, 321 <em>(App. Div. </em>1961), certification denied 36 <em>N. J. </em>140 (1961), demonstrates there was a strong legislative reaction against the previous practice of workmen suing fellow employees, even those in supervisory eapaoilies. after recovery of compensation against the common employer. It was there pointed out that in practical effect such actions often subject the employer itself to an indirect burden of liability to the injured employee beyond that scheduled by the workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Ibid. </em>The policy objective sought by the 1961 amendment would not be attained if the exception for \u201cintentional wrong\u201d were construed to leave open a loophole for such actions against fellow employees in the guise of claims for \u201cgross negligence.\u201d We think the Legislature intended the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201cintentional wrong,\u201d in this context, to have their commonly understood signification of deliberate intention. Compare 2 <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 69.20, <em>pp. </em>161-62, dealing with employer-misconduct statutes, where willful intent to cause injury is'held to require a showing of deliberate intention rather than gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In view of the foregoing we need not consider whether there was a common-law liability of defendants to the decedent in respect of the dangerous condition of the autoclave, on th\u00e9 fact situation here shown and the legal principles concerning duty laid down in relation thereto in <em>Miller v. Muscarelle, supra (67 N. J. Super., </em>at <em>p. </em>331).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
