A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AVV\">Trial of these consolidated personal injury and death actions resulted in substantial verdicts in favor 'of plaintiffs and against defendants Maeomber and Barry, except that the $7,500 verdict in favor of Victoria A. Hill is against Maeomber alone. Barry\u2019s motion-for -a new trial was denied. Barry appeals from the judgment based on the verdicts, against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">.\u2022 Maeomber has .not appealed. His position on this appeal is that the trial court did not commit error and the judgment should ,be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">We reserved, pending . oral argument of the appeal, a motion to dismiss Barry\u2019s appeal made by plaintiff Charles C. Hill, administrator <em>c. t. a. </em>of the estate of Crosby-M. Hill, deceased.- We now' deny- that motion.' We are satisfied that the technical objection as to the caption of Barry\u2019s notice of appeal, in which the' title of the consolidated action brought by movant was not mentioned, does not deprive this court of jurisdiction to hear Barry\u2019s appeal from the' judgment in that case or warrant dismissal of his appeal from the result of that action. The movant was timely served with the notice of,appeal.. In the body of the notice of appeal it is clearly manifested that Barry is appealing \u201cfrom the whole of the final judgment entered- * * * on October 9, 1967\u201d in favor of the several plaintiffs named, including expressly \u201cCharles C. Hill, administrator c. <em>t. a. </em>of the estate of Crosby M. Hill, deceased.\u201d The specified judgment, generally captioned the same as that on Barry\u2019s notice of appeal, included the awards in favor of the plaintiff representative of the estate as to both claims made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">We touch briefly on the broad outlines of this three-car, successive collision accident to put the issues in proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>On February 28, 1965, a clear dry day, about 6 :50 p.m., Crosby Hill was driving his automobile south on Route 50 near Mays Landing, New Jersey. His daughter Victoria, then about 21 years old, was in the right front passenger seat and was holding her two-year-old nephew James Davis on her lap. Louise Hill, Crosby\u2019s wife, and his other grandson, seven-3rear-old Vernon E. Davis, Jr., were in the rear of the car, with Louise on the left and Vernon on the right. There was testimony that at that time and place an automobile operated by defendant Macomber northerly along Route 50 veered across the white line separating the northbound and southbound traffic and struck the Hill car head-on in the southbound lane. Both vehicles were then traveling at a speed of 40 to 50 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The impact between the Hill and Macomber cars was undoubtedly a heavy one. The lack of skidmarks in the roadway, the speed at which each vehicle was traveling before they met head-on, the physical damage to the front of each car as demonstrated by the photographs in evidence, and the debris in the southbound lane of Rout 50 left by the collision \u2014\u25a0 all attest thereto. Trooper Bellarosa of the State Police was at the Mays Landing barracks at about 6:50 p.m. on that Sunday evening, about a mile or a mile and a half away and, as he testified, he heard a crash and went down the road to investigate the accident. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Following the initial impact, Victoria Hill unfastened her seat belt and got out of the car. She started to the back of her father\u2019s car when there was \u201canother heavy crash,\u201d according to her testimony. She stood for a few seconds until she gathered herself together and then went back to her car to find James. In her words, \u201che was hanging out of the car with his head out and his feet on the seat.\u201d He had not been in that position when she left the ear. She took him up and started down the street for help when a man came up. Trooper Bellarosa was right behind him. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>In that short interval while Victoria was out of her father\u2019s car \u2014 a matter of a few minutes at most \u2014 Barry, also proceeding northerly on Route 50, drove his automobile into Macomber\u2019s disabled car, striking its left rear with the right front of Barry\u2019s. The path Barry\u2019s automobile traveled after striking the Macomber vehicle was not testified to by any eyewitness. But when the trooper came upon the scene within minutes of the accident he observed and testified to the location of all three cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">According to Trooper Bellarosa, the rear end of the Ma-comber car was in the southbound lane; the vehicle was facing in a westerly direction at a right angle, and part of it protruded on the shoulder. No portion of Macomber\u2019s automobile was then in the northbound lane. The Hill car was at least partially off the road, on the shoulder of the road against or near a telephone pole, as we understand the record. Barry\u2019s automobile was resting against Hill\u2019s vehicle. In the trooper\u2019s words, \u201cthey were intermingled. There was damage to the right front of the Hill vehicle and it was actually interlocked with the left front door of the Barry vehicle. * * * <em>It was intermingled so that the wrecker had to take them apart.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Barry\u2019s argument on appeal does not challenge the jury\u2019s finding that he was negligent. Indeed, there was ample evidence to support such a finding. He, as well as Macomber, had been in each other\u2019s company and had been drinking before the accident. The trooper detected a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol\u201d about both Barry and Macomber at the scene. The jury could find in Barry\u2019s own recital of the happening enough to predicate a finding of negligence on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Rather, Barry\u2019s primary contention is that there was insufficient proof to show that his alleged negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries to plaintiffs. He claims error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant his motion to dismiss on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number> Since Victoria\u2019s injuries were entirely the result of the first impact between the Kill and Macomber automobiles \u2014 she alone was outside her father\u2019s ear at the time of the second, successive collision \u2014 the trial court properly limited her right to recovery against Macomber. Nobody questions that trial ruling. Barry\u2019s argument is restricted to the other persons who were still in Hill\u2019s car when the second collision occurred. Barry maintains that the first Maeomber-Hill impact was solely responsible for the injuries, or in the alternative, the jury should have apportioned the damages between the two incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The jury could properly find from the evidence that Barry\u2019s car collided with Hill\u2019s automobile and this impact was a substantial one. The trooper testified that the Barry and Kill vehicles were \u201cintermingled\u201d and so \u201cactually inter-locked * * * that the wrecker had to take them apart,\u201d and that his study of the accident scene and investigation led him to the conclusion that the impact between those vehicles was \u201cheavy.\u201d To this may be added Victoria\u2019s testimony that the child, whom she had left in the car, was seemingly half-propelled out of the car following the second crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We are mindful of Barry\u2019s argument that both Victoria Hill and Vernon Davis, Jr. gave testimony from which a jury could find that the Barry-Hill impact was not severe. Victoria testified that after the second crash she did not observe any movement in her father\u2019s ear, even though she was standing outside it and only an arm\u2019s length away. The boy testified that he felt only a \u201cjerk\u201d after the second crash. However, it was for the jury to decide from all the evidence whether the Iiill-Barry impact was severe enough to be causative of or contributory to the injuries sustained by the persons who remained in the Hill vehicle following the HillMacomber crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The real difficulty in the case stems from the absence of proof as to what injuries were suffered in each collision. The Macomber-Hill collision could have caused all the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>juries sustained by plaintiffs. In the case of Victoria Hill, it did. In that instance, recovery by her was properly against Macomber alone, as noted above. But as to the other injured plaintiffs, circumstances, precluded testimony by them as to what injuries were first caused by Macomber\u2019s negligence as contrasted with those successively caused by Barry\u2019s negligence. Crosby Hill never regained consciousness after the first collision with Macomber and died four hours later at the hospital. Louise Hill suffered amnesia following the initial impact and was unable to give helpful testimony. Victoria Hill gave no testimony as to the injuries sustained by the several passengers in the Hill car, other than those relating to herself. The two-year-old boy, James Davis, was too young to testify. His seven-year-old brother, Vernon, gave very limited testimony, none of which attempted to separate his injuries between. the two collisions with the Hill vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Neither Macomber nor Barry testified to the injuries sustained by the passengers in the Hill automobile. This was due to their own dazed condition and injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u25a0 There was medical testimony as to the nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the several persons in Hill\u2019s automobile, but there was no allocation of the injuries to the first collision of the Macomber and Hill cars, or of those resulting from the collision of the Barry and Hill automobiles. .</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00ed Crosby Hill died as the result of \u201cmultiple injuries.\u201d These included a crushed chest, \u201chemothorax,\u201d multiple fractured ribs on the right side, \u201cpneumo-thorax,\u201d a head injury and various internal injuries. The steering wheel, behind which Hill had been sitting, was broken and this probably caused decedent\u2019s flailed chest. There was no proof that the first collision caused the steering wheel to be broken. That this happened might very well be. Dr. Eoris, who attended Hill at the hospital when he was in a coma, concluded that Hill died as a result of the multiple injuries, and not just because of his chest injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Dr. Godfrey asserted in response to a hypothetical question that two blows would be more likely to produce severe damage than would one, because of the damage already sustained as a result of the first impact. lie agreed that a minor bump or simple jerk, would not tend to cause the effects seen on the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We need not detail the injuries suffered by the other plaintiffs. They were serious in each instance. As in the case of decedent, a severe blow or severe blows would be needed to cause them. Beyond their opinion that forceful impacts were necessary, the doctors were not able to separate the injuries or their end results and attribute them to the first collision rather than to the later one. If these medical experts were not able to do so, it follows that a jury could not reasonably do so. Any attempt on its part to apportion the damages would reduce itself to sheer speculation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\"> The trial judge properly denied Barry\u2019s motion to dismiss, based as it was on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to prove that his negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries to plaintiffs. Whether proximate cause exists is simply \u201ca question- of whether the ordinary mind, guided by logic, common sense, justice, policy and precedent, would consider that cause appears in a cause-and-effect context.\u201d <em>Miehl v. Darpino, </em>99 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1, 9 <em>(App. Div. </em>1968). \u201cWhere there is a factual dispute as to the events and circumstances which caused the injuries, proximate cause is a jury question.\u201d <em>Melone v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>163, 175 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The trial judge had instructed the jury as to Barry\u2019s claim that plaintiffs\u2019 injuries resulted from the initial collision between the Hill and Macomber automobiles, and not from any negligence on his part. The jurors were told that plaintiffs had the burden of proving by the greater weight Of the credible evidence not only that Barry was negligent, but also that there was a proximate causal relationship between that negligence and the injuries. They were instructed that, if more than one defendant was negligent, there could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>be no recovery against one deemed to be1 negligent, \u201cif his neglig\u00e9nce was not a substantial factor in producing the accident or injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">To insure a correct verdict, the court submitted interrogatories to be answered by the jury. The answers demonstrated its finding that Macomber and Barry were each guilty .of negligence, and that the negligence of each \u2014 except as to Victoria \u2014 was a proximate cause of the accident and inT juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Barry\u2019s main claim is that the jury should have been given the opportunity to apportion the damages between him and Macomber, holding him liable only for the damage specifically caused by, or the aggravation of injury resulting from negligence on his part. The difficulty with Barry\u2019s position is that the jury could not find from the evidence before it any valid basis for an apportioning of damages, or for calculating the factor of aggravation, absent proof of the nature and extent of injuries pre-existing which were aggravated by the second collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The majority view in our country in cases similar to the instant one, where there are collisions in rapid succession producing a single end result, and no proof as to what damage was separately caused by each collision, is to hold both tortfeasors jointly and severally responsible. See Annotation, 100 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>16 (1965). Although concurrent tortfeasors generally are not jointly and severally liable where their acts caused distinct and separate injuries, or where some reasonable means of apportioning the damages is evident, the negligent driver of the automobile in the successive impact has been held jointly and severally liable for all of plaintiff\u2019s injuries, if the injuries are \u201cindivisible\u201d and the liability therefor cannot be allocated with reasonable certainty to the successive collisions. This has come to be known as the \u201csingle indivisible injury\u201d rule. Por some cases in which it was applied, see <em>Maddux v. </em>Donaldson, 362 <em>Mich. </em>425, 108 <em>N. W. 2d </em>33, 100 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1961); <em>Holtz v. </em>Holder, 101 <em>Ariz. </em>247, 418 <em>p. 2d </em>584 <em>(Sup. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>Ct. </em>1966); <em>Berryman v. People\u2019s Motor Bus Co., </em>228 <em>Mo. App. </em>1032, 54 <em>S. W. 2d </em>747 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1932); <em>Brantley v. Couch, </em>383 <em>S. W. 2d </em>307 <em>(Mo. Ct. App. </em>1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">This doctrine is more conducive to justice than the old rule which precluded all recovery simply because plaintiff was unable to prove what damage each of two or more tortfeasors did. See <em>Adams v. Hall, 2 Vt. </em>9 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1829), where an owner of sheep suffered loss to his flock through the depredation of two dogs, separately owned. In the absence of testimony as to which dog killed which sheep, neither owner was held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In these days of chain collisions, it is better that a plainiff, injured through no fault of his own, should be compensated by both tortfeasors, even though one of them may pay more than his theoretical share of the damage which his wrong has helped to create, than that the injured party have no recovery. Our courts have seemingly favored this more modern policy. See <em>Ristan v. Frantzen, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>455 (1954) and <em>Matthews v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>56 <em>N. J. L. </em>34 <em>(Sup Ct. </em>1893).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In <em>Restatement, Torts (2d ed. </em>1965), \u00a7 4334 provides that damages for harm are to be apportioned among two or more causes where (a) there are distinct harms, or (b) there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm. That latter approach was not possible here in the light of the evidence before the jury. <em>Section 433B </em>provides that where the tortious conduct of two or more actors has combined to bring about harm to the plaintiff, and one or more actors seeks to limit his liability on the ground that the harm is capable of apportionment among them, the burden of proof as to apportionment is upon each such actor. The evidence here did not demonstrate any such capability of apportionment. Barry did not sustain the burden required of him. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s rulings on the issues of apportionment and limitation of recovery for mere aggravation were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>So, too, we find no basis for reversal in any of the other grounds urged by Barry. The trial court\u2019s submission to the jury of its own special interrogatories was a proper exercise of judicial discretion. The rejection of Barry\u2019s special interrogatories was also justifiable under all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The judgment is in all respects affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
