The defense was constructive eviction. Judgment went in defendant\u2019s favor; the trial judge held that the case was a close one, plaintiff had the burden of proof, and he had not sustained it.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was denied. His further motion to amend the statement in lieu of record settled by the trial judge <em>(R. R. </em>1:6-3) was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The trial judge misplaced the burden of proof. Where constructive eviction is raised as a defense to an action for rent, the burden is upon defendant to prove such eviction. <em>Alexandria Realty Co. v. Whitman, </em>8 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>21, 148 <em>A. </em>12 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1929); <em>cf. Gunther v. Oliver, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>376 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1922). The matter must therefore be remanded for a reevaluation of the proofs in the light of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Reversed and remanded for new findings, to be filed within three weeks. We retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
