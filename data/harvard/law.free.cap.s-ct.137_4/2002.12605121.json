The Mississippi Supreme Court held that it may do just that. But this decision seems difficult to square with the teachings of this Court's cases holding that legislatures generally cannot limit the compensation due under the Takings Clause of the Constitution. See\n  <em>\n   Monongahela Navi. Co. v.\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   United States,\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566709\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/148/312/#p327\">\n   148 U.S. 312\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 327,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566709\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/148/312/#p327\">\n   13 S.Ct. 622\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566709\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/148/312/#p327\">\n   37 L.Ed. 463\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (1893). Tension appears to exist, too, between the decision here and decisions of the Federal Circuit. See,\n  <em>\n   e.g.,\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Toews v. United States,\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2201672,9378887\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1371/\">\n   376 F.3d 1371\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1376 (2004). And the matter is one of general importance as well, for many states have adopted statutes like Mississippi's and the question presented implicates a fundamental feature of the compact between citizen and State. Given all this, these are questions the Court ought take up at its next opportunity.\n </opinion>\n <p type=\"majority\">\n </p>\n</casebody>\n"
