Neither party disputes that the issue is one of national importance or that the courts of appeals have already weighed in extensively. I would therefore grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   California generally prohibits the average citizen from carrying a firearm in public spaces, either openly or concealed. With a few limited exceptions, the State prohibits open carry altogether. Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 25850, 26350 (West 2012). It proscribes concealed carry unless a resident obtains a license by showing \"good cause,\" among other criteria, \u00a7\u00a7 26150, 26155, and it authorizes counties to set rules for when an applicant has shown good cause, \u00a7 26160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the county where petitioners reside, the sheriff has interpreted \"good cause\" to require an applicant to show that he has a particularized need, substantiated by documentary evidence, to carry a firearm for self-defense.

They requested declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the sheriff from denying licenses based on his restrictive interpretation of \"good cause,\" as well as other \"relief as the Court deems just\n   and proper.\" First Amended Complaint in No. 3:09-cv-02371, (SD Cal.) \u00b6\u00b6 149, 150, 152. The District Court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, and petitioners appealed to the Ninth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a thorough opinion, a panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n    742 F.3d 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel examined the constitutional text and this Court's precedents, as well as historical sources from before the founding era through the end of the 19th century.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n    at 1150-1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on these sources, the court concluded that \"the carrying of an operable handgun outside the home for the lawful purpose of self-defense ... constitutes 'bear[ing] Arms' within the meaning of the Second Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n    at 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It thus reversed the District Court and held that the sheriff's interpretation of \"good cause\" in combination with the other aspects of the State's regime violated the Second Amendment's command that a State \"permit\n   <em>\n    some form\n   </em>\n   of carry for self-defense outside the home.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n    at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Ninth Circuit\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   granted rehearing en banc and, by a divided court, reversed the panel decision. In the en banc court's view, because petitioners specifically asked for the invalidation of the sheriff's \"good cause\" interpretation, their legal challenge was limited to that aspect of the applicable regulatory scheme. The court thus declined to \"answer the question of whether or to what degree the Second Amendment might or might not protect a right of a member of the general public to carry firearms openly in public.\"\n   <em>\n    Peruta v. County of San Diego,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/#p942\">\n    824 F.3d 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 942 (2016). It instead held only that \"the Second Amendment does not preserve or protect a right of a member of the general public to carry\n   <em>\n    concealed\n   </em>\n   firearms in public.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/#p942\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/#p942\">\n    at 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We should have granted certiorari in this case. The approach taken by the en banc court is indefensible, and the petition raises important questions that this Court should address. I see no reason to await another case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The en banc court's decision to limit its review to whether the Second Amendment protects the right to concealed carry-as opposed to the more general right to public carry-was untenable. Most fundamentally, it was not justified by the terms of the complaint, which called into question the State's regulatory scheme as a whole. See First Amended Complaint \u00b6 63 (\"Because California does not permit the open carriage of loaded firearms, concealed carriage with a [concealed carry] permit is the only means by which an individual can bear arms in public places\");\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74 (\"States may not completely ban the carrying of handguns for self-defense\"). And although the complaint specified the remedy that intruded least on the State's overall regulatory regime-declaratory relief and an injunction against the sheriff's restrictive interpretation of \"good cause\"-it also requested \"[a]ny further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nor was the Ninth Circuit's approach justified by the history of this litigation. The District Court emphasized that \"the heart of the parties' dispute\" is whether the Second Amendment protects \"the right to carry a loaded handgun in public, either openly or in a concealed manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Peruta v. County of San Diego,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174777\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/758/1106/#p1109\">\n    758 F.Supp.2d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1109 (S.D.Cal.2010). As the Ninth Circuit panel pointed out, \"[petitioners] argue that the San Diego County policy in light of the California licensing scheme\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   violates the Second Amendment because it precludes a responsible, law-abiding citizen from carrying a weapon in public for the purpose of lawful self-defense\n   in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   manner.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n    742 F.3d, at 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel further observed that although petitioners \"focu[s]\" their challenge on the \"licensing scheme for concealed carry,\" this is \"for good reason: acquiring such a license is the only practical avenue by which [they] may come lawfully to carry a gun for self-defense in San Diego County.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even the en banc court acknowledged that petitioners \"base their argument on the entirety of California's statutory scheme\" and \"do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   contend that there is a free-standing Second Amendment right to carry concealed firearms.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/#p942\">\n    824 F.3d, at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Had the en banc Ninth Circuit answered the question actually at issue in this case, it likely would have been compelled to reach the opposite result. This Court has already suggested that the Second Amendment protects the right to carry firearms in public in some fashion. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Heller,\n   </em>\n   to \"bear arms\" means to \" 'wear, bear, or carry upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    554 U.S., at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Muscarello v.

The most natural reading of this definition encompasses public carry. I find it extremely improbable that the Framers understood the Second Amendment to protect little more than carrying a gun from the bedroom to the kitchen. See\n   <em>\n    Drake v. Filko,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067760\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/426/#p444\">\n    724 F.3d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444 (C.A.3 2013) (Hardiman, J., dissenting) (\"To speak of 'bearing' arms solely within one's home not only would conflate 'bearing' with 'keeping,' in derogation of the [\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ] Court's holding that the verbs codified distinct rights, but also would be awkward usage given the meaning assigned the terms by the Supreme Court\");\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

The panel opinion below pointed to a wealth of cases and secondary sources from England, the founding era, the antebellum period, and Reconstruction, which together strongly suggest that the right to bear arms includes the right to bear arms in public in some manner. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071964\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1144/#p1148\">\n    742 F.3d, at 1153-1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (canvassing the relevant history in detail); Brief for National Rifle Association as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   6-16. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Nunn v.

Other cases similarly suggest that, although some regulation of public carry is permissible, an effective ban on all forms of public carry is not. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Reid,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"902261\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ala/1/612/#p616\">\n    1 Ala. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616-617 (1840) (\"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, the Second Amendment's core purpose further supports the conclusion that the right to bear arms extends to public carry. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   emphasized that \"self-defense\" is \"the\n   <em>\n    central component\n   </em>\n   of the [Second Amendment] right itself.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    554 U.S., at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This purpose is not limited only to the home, even though the need for self-defense may be \"most acute\" there.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    at 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Self-defense has to take place wherever the person happens\n   to be,\" and in some circumstances a person may be more vulnerable in a public place than in his own house.

The Court has not heard argument in a Second Amendment case in over seven years-since March 2, 2010, in\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

Since that time, we have heard argument in, for example, roughly 35 cases where the question presented turned on the meaning of the First Amendment and 25 cases that turned on the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. This discrepancy is inexcusable, especially given how much less developed our jurisprudence is with respect to the Second Amendment as compared to the First and Fourth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous. But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-\n   defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.
