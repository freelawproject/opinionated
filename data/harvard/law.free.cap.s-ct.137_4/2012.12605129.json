Trinity Lutheran Church applied for such a grant for its preschool and daycare center and would have received one, but for the fact that Trinity Lutheran is a church. The Department had a policy of categorically disqualifying churches and other religious organizations from receiving grants under its playground resurfacing program. The question presented is whether the Department's policy violated the rights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center is a preschool and daycare center open throughout the year to serve working families in Boone County, Missouri, and the surrounding area. Established as a nonprofit organization in 1980, the Center merged with Trinity Lutheran Church in 1985 and operates under its auspices on church property. The Center admits students of any religion, and enrollment stands at about 90 children ranging from age two to five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Center includes a playground that is equipped with the basic playground essentials: slides, swings, jungle gyms, monkey bars, and sandboxes. Almost the entire surface beneath and surrounding the play equipment is coarse pea gravel. Youngsters, of course, often fall on the playground or tumble from the equipment. And when they do, the gravel can be unforgiving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large portion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by participating in Missouri's Scrap Tire Program. Run by the State's Department of Natural Resources to reduce the number of used tires destined for landfills and dump sites, the program offers reimbursement grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that purchase playground surfaces made from recycled tires. It is funded through a fee imposed on the sale of new tires in the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Due to limited resources, the Department cannot offer grants to all applicants and so awards them on a competitive basis to those scoring highest based on several criteria, such as the poverty level of the population in the surrounding area and the applicant's plan to promote recycling. When the Center applied, the Department had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity. That policy, in the Department's view, was compelled by Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"That no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its application, the Center disclosed its status as a ministry of Trinity Lutheran Church and specified that the Center's\n   mission was \"to provide a safe, clean, and attractive school facility in conjunction with an educational program structured to allow a child to grow spiritually, physically, socially, and cognitively.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 131a. After describing the playground and the safety hazards posed by its current surface, the Center detailed the anticipated benefits of the proposed project: increasing access to the playground for all children, including those with disabilities, by providing a surface compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; providing a safe, long-lasting, and resilient surface under the play areas; and improving Missouri's environment by putting recycled tires to positive use. The Center also noted that the benefits of a new surface would extend beyond its students to the local community, whose children often use the playground during non-school hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Center ranked fifth among the 44 applicants in the 2012 Scrap Tire Program. But despite its high score, the Center was deemed categorically ineligible to receive a grant. In a letter rejecting the Center's application, the program director explained that, under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance directly to a church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants as part of the 2012 program. Because the Center was operated by Trinity Lutheran Church, it did not receive a grant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Trinity Lutheran sued the Director of the Department in Federal District Court. The Church alleged that the Department's failure to approve the Center's application, pursuant to its policy of denying grants to religiously affiliated applicants, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Trinity Lutheran sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the Department from discriminating against the Church on that basis in future grant applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Court granted the Department's motion to dismiss. The Free Exercise Clause, the District Court stated, prohibits the government from outlawing or restricting the exercise of a religious practice; it generally does not prohibit withholding an affirmative benefit on account of religion. The District Court likened the Department's denial of the scrap tire grant to the situation this Court encountered in\n   <em>\n    Locke v. Davey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n    540 U.S. 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). In that case, we upheld against a free exercise challenge the State of Washington's decision not to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a state scholarship program. Finding the present case \"nearly indistinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Locke,\n   </em>\n   \" the District Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did not require the State to make funds available under the Scrap Tire Program to religious institutions like Trinity Lutheran.\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v.

The court recognized that it was \"rather clear\" that Missouri\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   award a scrap tire grant to Trinity Lutheran without running afoul of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v.

But, the Court of Appeals explained, that did not mean the Free Exercise Clause compelled the State to disregard the antiestablishment principle reflected in its own Constitution. Viewing a monetary grant to a religious institution as a \" 'hallmark[ ] of an established religion,' \" the court concluded that the State\n   could rely on an applicant's religious status to deny its application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230217\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/779/#p784\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230217\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/779/#p784\">\n    at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Locke,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n    540 U.S., at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; some internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Gruender dissented.

Writing for the plurality, Chief Justice Burger acknowledged that Tennessee had disqualified ministers from serving as legislators since the adoption of its first Constitution in 1796, and that a number of early States had also disqualified ministers from legislative office.

If the cases just described make one thing clear, it is that such a policy imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny.\n    <em>\n     Lukumi,\n    </em>\n    508 U.S., at 546,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11787\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/520/#p533\">\n     113 S.Ct. 2217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This conclusion is unremarkable in light of our prior decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Like the disqualification statute in\n    <em>\n     McDaniel,\n    </em>\n    the Department's policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a choice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit\n    program or remain a religious institution. Of course, Trinity Lutheran is free to continue operating as a church, just as McDaniel was free to continue being a minister. But that freedom comes at the cost of automatic and absolute exclusion from the benefits of a public program for which the Center is otherwise fully qualified. And when the State conditions a benefit in this way,\n    <em>\n     McDaniel\n    </em>\n    says plainly that the State has punished the free exercise of religion: \"To condition the availability of benefits ... upon [a recipient's] willingness to ... surrender[ ] his religiously impelled [status] effectively penalizes the free exercise of his constitutional liberties.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/618/#p628\">\n     435 U.S., at 626\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2406\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/618/#p628\">\n     98 S.Ct. 1322\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Department contends that merely declining to extend funds to Trinity Lutheran does not\n    <em>\n     prohibit\n    </em>\n    the Church from engaging in any religious conduct or otherwise exercising its religious rights. In this sense, says the Department, its policy is unlike the ordinances struck down in\n    <em>\n     Lukumi,\n    </em>\n    which outlawed rituals central to Santeria. Here the Department has simply declined to allocate to Trinity Lutheran a subsidy the State had no obligation to provide in the first place. That decision does not meaningfully burden the Church's free exercise rights. And absent any such burden, the argument continues, the Department is free to heed the State's antiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a church. Brief for Respondent 7-12, 14-16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    It is true the Department has not criminalized the way Trinity Lutheran worships or told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a certain view of the Gospel.

In\n    <em>\n     Locke,\n    </em>\n    the State of Washington created a scholarship program to assist high-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education. The scholarships were paid out of the State's general fund, and eligibility was based on criteria such as an applicant's score on college admission tests and family income. While scholarship recipients were free to use the money at accredited religious and non-religious schools alike, they were not permitted to use the funds to pursue a devotional theology degree-one \"devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n     540 U.S., at 716\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 1307\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).

Respectfully, I harbor doubts about the stability of such a line. Does a religious man say grace before dinner? Or does a man begin his meal in a religious manner? Is it a religious group that built the playground? Or did a group build the playground so it might be used to advance a religious mission? The distinction blurs in much the same way the line between acts and omissions can blur when stared at too long, leaving us to ask (for example) whether the man who drowns by awaiting the incoming tide does so by act (coming upon the sea) or omission (allowing the sea to\n    come upon him).

The Court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding, for the first time, that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church. Its decision slights both our precedents and our history, and its reasoning weakens this country's longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Founded in 1922, Trinity Lutheran Church (Church) \"operates ... for the express purpose of carrying out the commission of ...

No two States' experiences were the same. In some a religious establishment never took hold. See T. Curry,\n    The First Freedoms 19, 72-74, 76-77, 159-160 (1986) (Curry). In others establishment varied in terms of the sect (or sects) supported, the nature and extent of that support, and the uniformity of that support across the State. Where establishment did take hold, it lost its grip at different times and at different speeds. See T. Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 510-511 (1970 ed.) (Cobb).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Despite this rich diversity of experience, the story relevant here is one of consistency. The use of public funds to support core religious institutions can safely be described as a hallmark of the States' early experiences with religious establishment. Every state establishment saw laws passed to raise public funds and direct them toward houses of worship and ministers. And as the States all disestablished, one by one, they all undid those laws.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Those who fought to end the public funding of religion based their opposition on a powerful set of arguments, all stemming from the basic premise that the practice harmed both civil government and religion. The civil government, they maintained, could claim no authority over religious belief. For them, support for religion compelled by the State marked an overstep of authority that would only lead to more. Equally troubling, it risked divisiveness by giving religions reason to compete for the State's beneficence. Faith, they believed, was a personal matter, entirely between an individual and his god. Religion was best served when sects reached out on the basis of their tenets alone, unsullied by outside forces, allowing adherents to come to their faith voluntarily. Over and over, these arguments gained acceptance and led to the end of state laws exacting payment for the support of religion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Take Virginia. After the Revolution, Virginia debated and rejected a general religious assessment.

In 1784, an assessment bill was proposed that would have allowed taxpayers to direct payments to ministers (of sufficiently large churches) or to the poor. Non-Christians were exempt. See Curry 155. Controversy over the bill \"eclipse [d] in volume of writing and bitterness of invective every other political dispute since the debate over the question of independence.\" J. Rainbolt, The Struggle To Define \"Religious Liberty\" in Maryland, 1776-85, 17 J. Church &amp; State 443, 449 (1975). Critics of the bill raised the same themes as those in Virginia: that religion \"needs not the power of rules to establish, but only to protect it\"; that financial support of religion leads toward an establishment; and that laws for such support are \"oppressive.\" Curry 156, 157 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Copy of Petition [to General Assembly], Maryland Gazette, Mar. 25, 1785, pp. 1, 2, col.1 (\"[W]hy should such as do not desire or make conscience of it, be forced by law\"). When the legislature next met, most representatives \"had been elected by anti-assessment voters,\" and the bill failed. Curry 157. In 1810, Maryland revoked the authority to levy religious assessments. See Md. Const. Amdt. XIII (1776), in 3 Federal and State Constitutions 1705 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909) (Thorpe).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    In New England, which took longer to reach this conclusion, Vermont went first. Its religious assessment laws were accommodating. A person who was not a member of his town's church was, upon securing a certificate to that effect, exempt. See L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 50 (1994) (Levy). Even so, the laws were viewed by many as violating Vermont's constitutional prohibition against involuntary support of religion and guarantee of freedom of conscience. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Address of Council of Censors to the People of Vermont 5-8 (1800) (\"[R]eligion is a concern personally and exclusively operative between the individual and his God\"); Address of Council of Censors [Vermont] 3-7 (Dec. 1806) (the laws' \"evils\" included \"violence done to the feelings of men\" and \"their property,\" \"animosities,\" and \"the dangerous lengths of which it is a foundation for us to go, in both civil and religious usurpation\"). In 1807, Vermont \"repealed all laws concerning taxation for religion.\" Levy 51.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The rest of New England heard the same arguments and reached the same conclusion. John Leland's sustained criticism of religious assessments over 20 years helped end the practice in Connecticut. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Esbeck, Dissent and Disestablishment: The Church-State Settlement in the Early American Republic, 2004 B.Y.U. L. Rev. 1385, 1498, 1501-1511. The reasons he offered in urging opposition to the State's laws will by now be familiar. Religion \"is a matter between\n    God and individuals,\" which does not need, and would only be harmed by, government support. J. Leland, The Rights of Conscience Inalienable (1791), in The Sacred Rights of Conscience 337-339 (D. Dreisbach &amp; M. Hall eds. 2009). \"[T]ruth gains honor; and men more firmly believe it,\" when religion is subjected to the \"cool investigation and fair argument\" that freedom of conscience produces.\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 340. Religious assessments violated that freedom, he argued. See\n    <em>\n     id.,\n    </em>\n    at 342 (\"If these people bind nobody but themselves, who is injured by their religious opinions? But if they bind an individual besides themselves, the bond is fraudulent and ought to be declared illegal\"). Connecticut ended religious assessments first by statute in 1817, then by its State Constitution of 1818. See Cobb 513.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    In New Hampshire, a steady campaign against religious assessments led to a bill that was subjected to \"the scrutiny of the people.\" C. Kinney, Church &amp; State: The Struggle for Separation in New Hampshire, 1630-1900, p. 101 (1955) (Kinney). It was nicknamed \"Dr. Whipple's Act\" after its strongest advocate in the State House.\n    <em>\n     Orford Union Congregational Soc. v.

(1875). He defended the bill as a means \"to take religion out of politics, to eliminate state support, to insure opportunity to worship with true freedom of conscience, [and] to put all sects and denominations of Christians upon a level.\" Kinney 103. The bill became law and provided \"that no person shall be compelled to join or support, or be classed with, or associated to any congregation, church or religious society without his express consent first had and obtained.\" Act [of July 1, 1819] Regulating Towns and Choice of Town Officers \u00a7 3, in 1 Laws of the State of New Hampshire Enacted Since June 1, 1815, p. 45 (1824). Massachusetts held on the longest of all the States, finally ending religious assessments in 1833.

Like the use of public dollars for ministers at issue in\n    <em>\n     Locke,\n    </em>\n    turning over public funds to houses of worship implicates serious antiestablishment and free exercise interests. The history just discussed fully supports this conclusion. As states disestablished, they repealed laws allowing taxation to support religion because the practice threatened other forms of government support for, involved some government control over, and weakened supporters' control of religion. Common sense also supports this conclusion. Recall that a state may not fund religious activities without violating the Establishment Clause. See Part II-A,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . A state can reasonably use status as a \"house of worship\" as a stand-in for \"religious activities.\" Inside a house of worship, dividing the religious from the secular would require intrusive line-drawing by government, and monitoring those lines would entangle government with the house of worship's activities. And so while not every activity a house of worship undertakes will be inseparably linked to religious activity, \"the likelihood that many are makes a categorical rule a suitable means to avoid chilling the exercise of religion.\"\n    <em>\n     Amos,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28203\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/327/#p336\">\n     483 U.S., at 345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28203\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/327/#p336\">\n     107 S.Ct. 2862\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).

A straightforward reading of Article I, \u00a7 7, prohibits funding only for \"any church, sect, or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such.\" The Missouri courts have not read the State's Constitution to reach more broadly, to prohibit funding for other religiously affiliated institutions, or more broadly still, to prohibit the funding of religious believers. See,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Saint Louis Univ. v. Masonic Temple Assn. of St. Louis,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8312214\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/220/721/#p726\">\n     220 S.W.3d 721\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 726 (Mo.2007) (\"The university is not a religious institution simply because it is affiliated with the Jesuits or the Roman Catholic Church\"). The Scrap Tire Program at issue here proves the point. Missouri will fund a religious organization not \"owned or controlled by a church,\" if its \"mission and activities are secular (separate from religion, not spiritual in) nature\" and the funds \"will be used for secular (separate from religion; not spiritual) purposes rather than for sectarian (denominational, devoted to a sect) purposes.\" App. to Brief for Petitioner 3a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-35. Article I, \u00a7 7, thus stops Missouri only from funding specific entities, ones that set and enforce religious doctrine for their adherents. These are the entities that most acutely raise the establishment and free exercise concerns that arise when public funds flow to religion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Missouri has recognized the simple truth that, even absent an Establishment Clause violation, the transfer of public funds to houses of worship raises concerns that sit exactly between the Religion Clauses. To avoid those concerns, and only those concerns, it has prohibited such funding. In doing so, it made the same choice made by the earliest States centuries ago and many other States in the years since. The Constitution permits this choice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    3\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In the Court's view, none of this matters. It focuses on one aspect of Missouri's Article I, \u00a7 7, to the exclusion of all else: that it denies funding to a house of worship, here the Church, \"simply because of what it [i]s-a church.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2023. The Court describes this as a constitutionally impermissible line based on religious \"status\" that requires strict scrutiny. Its rule is out of step with our precedents in this area, and wrong on its own terms.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The Constitution creates specific rules that control how the government may interact with religious entities. And so of course a government may act based on a religious entity's \"status\" as such. It is that very status that implicates the interests protected by the Religion Clauses. Sometimes a religious entity's unique status requires the government to act. See\n    <em>\n     Hosanna-Tabor,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n     565 U.S., at 188-190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n     132 S.Ct. 694\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Other times, it merely permits the government to act. See Part III-A,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    . In all cases, the dispositive issue is not whether religious \"status\" matters-it does, or the Religion Clauses would not be at issue-but whether the government must, or may, act on that basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Start where the Court stays silent. Its opinion does not acknowledge that our precedents have expressly approved of a government's choice to draw lines based on an entity's religious status.

Those cases did not deploy strict scrutiny to create a presumption of unconstitutionality, as the\n    Court does today.

A faithful reading of\n    <em>\n     Locke\n    </em>\n    gives it a broader reach.\n    <em>\n     Locke\n    </em>\n    stands for the reasonable proposition that the government may, but need not, choose not to fund certain religious entities (there, ministers) where doing so raises \"historic and substantial\" establishment and free exercise concerns.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n     540 U.S., at 725\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897994\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/712/\">\n     124 S.Ct. 1307\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Second, it suggests that this case is different because it involves \"discrimination\" in the form of the denial of access to a possible benefit.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2022. But in this area of law, a decision to treat entities differently based on distinctions that the Religion Clauses make relevant does not amount to discrimination.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    To understand why, keep in mind that \"the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all.\"\n    <em>\n     Wallace v.

This explains why Missouri does not apply its constitutional provision in that manner. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35-36. Nor has it done so here.

Just three years ago, this Court claimed to understand that, in this area of law, to \"sweep away what has so long been settled would create new controversy and begin anew the very divisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent.\"\n    <em>\n     Town of Greece v.

It makes clear today that this principle applies only when preference suits.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    IV\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment contain a promise from our government and a backstop that disables our government from breaking it. The Free Exercise Clause extends the promise. We each retain our inalienable right to \"the free exercise\" of religion, to choose for ourselves whether to believe and how to worship. And the Establishment Clause erects the backstop. Government cannot, through the enactment of a \"law respecting an establishment of religion,\" start us down the path to the past, when this right was routinely abridged.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The Court today dismantles a core protection for religious freedom provided in these Clauses. It holds not just that a government may support houses of worship with taxpayer funds, but that-at least in this case and perhaps in others, see\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    at 2024, n. 3-it must do so whenever it decides to create a funding program. History shows that the Religion Clauses separate the public treasury from religious coffers as one measure to secure the kind of freedom of conscience that benefits both religion and government. If this separation means anything, it means that the government cannot, or at the very least need not, tax its citizens and turn that money over to houses of worship. The Court today blinds itself to the outcome this history requires and leads us instead to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.

The principle it establishes can be manipulated to call for a similar fate for lines drawn on the basis of religious use. See\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2025 - 2026 (GORSUCH, J., concurring in part); see also\n     <em>\n      ante,\n     </em>\n     at 2025 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part) (going further and suggesting that lines drawn on the basis of religious status amount to\n     <em>\n      per se\n     </em>\n     unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of religious belief). It is enough for today to explain why the Court's decision is wrong. The error of the concurrences' hoped-for decisions can be left for tomorrow.
