We conclude that it did and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On October 1, 1996, the plaintiff, A. Aiudi and Sons, LLC, filed an application with the commission for the removal of approximately 95,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel from its property in Plainville. The plaintiffs property is located in a residential zone and is situated between a residential neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>hood and a concrete plant utilized by the plaintiff. The commission held two public hearings in connection \u2022with the plaintiffs application during which it received testimony regarding the potential impact of the plaintiffs proposed activity from experts and owners of property abutting the plaintiffs property.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At the November, 1996 hearing, the plaintiff offered a brief overview of the area it sought to excavate but presented no other evidence in support of its application. At the December, 1996 hearing, Gregory Granger, an attorney appearing on behalf of the abutting property owners, objected to the plaintiffs application pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Granger presented four expert witnesses, all of whom testified about the negative impact that the plaintiffs proposed excavation posed to neighboring properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Thereafter, the commission denied the plaintiffs application,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the plaintiff appealed to the trial court. Construing the plaintiffs application as an application for site plan approval, the trial court upheld the commission\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiffs application and dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. The trial court con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>eluded that the rule announced in <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 222 Conn. 262, 265-66, 608 A.2d 1178 (1992), authorizes a zoning commission to take into account general considerations of health, safety and welfare of the community in denying a site plan application when the applicable regulations so permit. The trial court further concluded that, because the applicable town zoning regulations expressly authorize the commission to deny an application on the basis of these \u201cgeneral considerations,\u201d the commission properly considered, inter alia, the health and safety of the community in denying the plaintiffs application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">On the granting of certification, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, concluding that, even though the plaintiff had filed its application as an application for site plan approval, the application, \u201cin substance,\u201d qualified as one for a special exception rather than site plan approval.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A. <em>Aiudi &amp; Sons, LLC v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>72 Conn. App. 502, 505, 516, 806 A.2d 77 (2002). The Appellate Court noted that, even if it were to accept the plaintiffs characterization of its application as one for site plan approval, General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the applicable regulations authorized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>commission to deny the plaintiffs application on the basis of considerations of public health, safety and welfare. Id., 515. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: First, \u201c[d]id the Appellate Court properly hold that the plaintiffs site plan application was actually an application for [a] special exception?\u201d <em>A. Aiudi &amp; Sons, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>262 Conn. 919, 812 A.2d 861 (2002). Second, \u201c[d]id the Appellate Court properly determine that if the application was seeking site plan approval, general criteria in the zoning regulations could serve as a basis for denial?\u201d Id. We conclude that the Appellate Court properly determined that the plaintiffs application was, \u201cin substance,\u201d one for a special exception and, therefore, need not reach the second certified issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that its application qualified as an application for a special exception. The plaintiff submits that the language of \u00a7 910 (2) of the regulations of the town of Plainville requires the issuance of a permit for the plaintiffs proposed activity and not a special permit or special exception. The plaintiff contends, therefore, that its application does not qualify as an application for a special exception but, rather, as an application for site plan approval. According to the plaintiff, the classification of its application as one for site plan approval rather than one for a special exception means that \u00a7 8-3 (g), rather than General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>applies. In support of its claim that the commission improperly denied its application on the basis of general considerations of public health, safety and welfare, the plaintiff relies on <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>177 Conn. 420, 423, 418 A.2d 66 (1979). We disagree with the plaintiff that its application was merely one for site plan approval and conclude that the application qualifies as an application for a special exception, thereby implicating the provisions of \u00a7 8-2 (a) rather than \u00a7 8-3 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We begin by noting our standard of review when interpreting statutes as well as regulations. \u201cStatutory construction . . . presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>261 Conn. 545, 548, 804 A.2d 777 (2002), quoting <em>Tighe </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>259 Conn. 83, 89, 788 A.2d 40 (2002). Such plenary review also applies to questions of law relating to the interpretation of regulations. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>258 Conn. 691, 698, 784 A.2d 354 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">When the provisions of a zoning regulation contain requirements or procedures mirroring those found in special exceptions, we have held that an application qualifies as an application for a special exception in substance even though the regulation does not identify or label the application as one for a \u201cspecial exception.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Etzel </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 539, 540-41, 235 A.2d 647 (1967); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Common Council, </em>154 Conn. 156, 159-60, 222 A.2d 337 (1966); see also <em>Huhta </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>151 Conn. 694, 696, 202 A.2d 139 (1964) (\u201c[w]hether or not . . . [the] term [special exception] is used in the particular zoning regulations is not material\u201d). In <em>Etzel </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 155 Conn. 539, the trial court dismissed the appeal of the plaintiff, Johanna Etzel, who owned land in a \u201clight industrial\u201d zone in North Haven, from the decision of the defendant zoning board of appeals denying her application for a certificate of approval for the erection of an automotive service station. Id., 540. Etzel thereafter appealed to this court. Id. We noted that, pursuant to the applicable zoning regulations, \u201cautomobile service stations are a permitted use in . . . a [light industrial] zone, but no permit for the construction of an automobile service station may be issued until the proposed location has been approved as suitable by the zoning board of appeals and, following such approval, certain designated physical aspects of the layout have been approved by the planning and zoning commission.\u201d Id. Accordingly, we held that \u201c[t]he zoning regulations . . . place an automobile service station in the category of a special exception.\u201d Id. We discounted the fact that the applicable regulation did not employ the term \u201cspecial exception\u201d and noted that the absence of that term from the regulations was \u201cof no consequence\u201d; id., 541; because \u201c[t]he language of the section ma[de] clear that no permit for the construction of an automobile service station [was] to be issued until the special conditions pertaining to that use of the land ha[d] been satisfied.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Common Council, </em>supra, 154 Conn. 156, in which the plaintiff, Seymour R. Powers, appealed from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal from the defendant common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>council\u2019s denial of liis application for the designation of land as a multiple housing project area. Id., 158. The city of Danbury had enacted a zoning ordinance that provided that \u201csubject to the provisions of [Danbury Zoning Ordinance] \u00a7 3.17, a multiple housing project is a permitted use in a professional office and apartment district. The effect of \u00a7 3.17, however, is that no property within the district may be put to that use unless the property is first recommended by the planning commission and designated by the council for that use.\u201d Id., 159. In <em>Powers, </em>we noted, as we did in <em>Etzel, </em>that the applicable ordinance did not use the term \u201cspecial exception\u201d or the term \u201cspecial permit.\u201d Id. Nonetheless, we concluded that \u201c[t]he nomenclature is immaterial so long as the effect is the same\u201d; id.; and held that \u201cthis area designation process [was] in effect a procedure for the granting of a special permit.\u201d Id., 160; see also <em>Heithaus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>258 Conn. 205, 220, 779 A.2d 750 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Similarly, in the present case, we are not constrained by the use or lack of use of the term \u201cspecial exception\u201d or the term \u201cspecial permit\u201d in determining the effect of the particular regulations at issue. Rather, we examine these regulations, focusing on their requirements and procedures. With this principle in mind, we next turn to the applicable regulatory scheme and the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Article 9 of the zoning regulations of the town of Plainville governs the removal of, inter alia, sand and gravel. Section 900 of the regulations provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided for in </em>. . . <em>Article [9], there shall be no removalfrom the premises, in any district, </em>of earth, sand, gravel or clay except as surplus material, resulting from bona fide construction. A bona fide construction site shall retain upon completion, a minimum of four . . . inches of topsoil in areas to be either seeded, planted with trees, shrubbery or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>cultivated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 9, \u00a7 900 (1989). Accordingly, the removal of sand and gravel in any district in the town is expressly prohibited unless such removal occurs in conjunction with bona fide construction or falls within an exception otherwise provided in article 9 of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Section 910 outlines the only exceptions to the prohibition enunciated in \u00a7 900. See generally id., \u00a7 910. Subsection (2) of \u00a7 910<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> authorizes the commission, in its discretion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to \u201cgrant a permit for the removal of sand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>gravel or clay in any zone . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 910 (2). Section 910 (2) nevertheless contains numerous conditions to the granting of such a permit, including a public hearing on the proposed removal, the applicant\u2019s satisfaction of the requirements contained in article 6 of the regulations, and the fulfillment of certain conditions enumerated in \u00a7 910 (2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id. Thus, \u00a7 910 (2) serves as the lone gateway to the approval of an application for the removal of sand and gravel from a property located within the town when such removal will not be performed in conjunction with bona fide construction. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">As \u00a7 910 (2) instructs that an applicant must satisfy the requirements and conditions enumerated in article 6,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we examine that article and find that it reveals a host of submission requirements and other standards and considerations. Id., art. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 600 through 603. Section 603,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in particular, details the general considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tions and standards for site plans. Id., art. 6, \u00a7 603. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Commission may approve, approve with conditions, modify <em>or deny </em>a Site Plan Application or Site Plan Modification. In approving such an application or approving it with conditions or approving it subject to modification, the Commission <em>shall </em>make a finding [that] the proposed use . . . <em>con</em>form[s] <em>to the following considerations and standards </em>in addition to any additional requirements for specific uses included in these Regulations. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The considerations and standards listed thereafter describe criteria relating to traffic access, circulation and parking, landscaping and screening, illumination, and the character and appearance of, inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>alia, the proposed use. Id., \u00a7 603 (1) through (5). In particular, subsection (5) of \u00a7 603 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he character and appearance of the proposed use . . . shall be in general harmony with the character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood and will not adversely affect the general health, safety or welfare of the inhabitants of the [t]own . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 603 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Even though the plaintiff had submitted its application as one for site plan approval pursuant to \u00a7 910 (2) and, by incorporation, \u00a7 603 of the regulations, the Appellate Court concluded that, \u201c[b]ecause the plaintiff was applying for a permit that is not allowed as of right in th[e] zone [in which the property was situated],\u201d the plaintiffs application qualified as one for a special exception. <em>A. Aiudi &amp; Sons, LLC v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 508. In support of its conclusion, the Appellate Court noted that \u201cthe posture of the application process [in the present case]\u201d; id.; resembled that of the process followed by the commission in considering applications for special exceptions. See id., 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We note, as did the Appellate Court, that the regulations governing the plaintiffs application parallel those that generally govern applications for special exceptions. See id. We previously have observed that \u201c[a] special [exception] allows a property owner to use his property in a manner <em>expressly permitted </em>by the local zoning regulations.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heithaus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 215. Nevertheless, special exceptions, although \u201cexpressly permitted\u201d by local regulations, \u201cmust satisfy [certain conditions and] standards set forth in the zoning regulations themselves as well as the conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values [as required by \u00a7 8-2].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Id., 215-16. Moreover, we have noted that the \u201cnature [of special exceptions] is such that their precise location and mode of operation must be regulated because of the topography, traffic problems, neighboring uses, etc., of the site.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barberino Realty &amp; Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 607, 612, 610 A.2d 1205 (1992). We also have recognized that, \u201cif not properly planned for, [such uses] might undermine the residential character of the neighborhood.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 612-13. Thus, we have explained that the goal of an application for a special exception is to seek \u201cpermission to vary the use of a particular piece of property from that for which it is zoned, without offending the uses permitted as of right in the particular zoning district.\u201d <em>Heithaus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In the present case, \u00a7 910 (2) of the regulations explicitly allows the plaintiffs proposed use, namely, the removal of sand and gravel from its property, but subjects such removal to numerous conditions and standards. See Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 9, \u00a7 910 (2) (1989). Accordingly, this regulatory scheme bears resemblance to those regulatory schemes that define and govern special exceptions. See <em>Heithaus </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 215-16. Moreover, as with the regulation of other special exceptions, \u00a7 910 (2) serves to minimize the adverse impact that the removal of sand and gravel might have on the surrounding neighborhood and to safeguard permitted uses in that neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The cumulative effect of these overlapping qualities, coupled with our holdings in <em>Etzel </em>and <em>Powers, </em>leads us to conclude that the plaintiffs application qualifies as an application for a special exception even though \u00a7 910 (2) uses the term \u201cpermit\u201d rather than \u201cspecial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>exception\u201d or \u201cspecial permit.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 9, \u00a7 910 (2) (1989). Because we conclude that the plaintiff applied for a special exception, we now turn to the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions that govern special exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> authorizes municipal zoning commissions to enact regulations providing that \u201ccertain . . . uses of land are permitted only after obtaining a special permit or special exception from a zoning commission . . . General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 (a) further provides that the \u201cobtaining [of] a special permit or special exception . . . [is] subject to standards set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>forth in the regulations and to conditions necessary to protect the public health, safety, convenience and property values.\u201d Thus, in accordance with \u00a7 8-2 (a), an applicant\u2019s \u201cobtaining\u201d of a special exception pursuant to a zoning regulation is subject to a zoning commission\u2019s consideration of these general factors. Cf. <em>Willimantic Car Wash, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>247 Conn. 732, 738-39, 724 A.2d 1108 (1999) (\u201cthe gist of [\u00a7 8-2] ... is that zoning regulations must promote the public welfare\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Pursuant to its authority under \u00a7 8-2 (a), the commission adopted \u00a7 502 of article 5 of the regulations,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tied, \u201cGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.\u201d Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 5, \u00a7 502 (1995). Section 502 mandates, for any type of approval, that the commission find that the proposed use complies with twelve standards enumerated therein. Id. Subsections (A) and (B) of \u00a7 502 require that: (1) \u201c[t]he nature of the proposed use and its location <em>[do] not impair public health, safety or the general welfare [of] the public . . . </em>[and that they are] consistent with [the] orderly development of the [t]own and [conform] to the requirements of [the] Regulations\u201d; (emphasis added) id., \u00a7 502 (A); and (2) \u201c[t]he proposed use and proposed buildings and structures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>are in harmony and character with the surrounding properties and area </em>and do not hinder or discourage the development and use of adjacent properties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., \u00a7 502 (B). It follows, therefore, that when the commission determines that a use proposed in connection with an application for a special exception fails to satisfy one of the foregoing standards or other standards enumerated in \u00a7 502, it may deny the application. See id., \u00a7 502; see also <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>244 Conn. 619, 627, 711 A.2d 675 (1998) (\u201cgeneral considerations such as public health, safety and welfare, which are enumerated in zoning regulations, may be the basis for the denial of a special permit\u201d); <em>Whisper Wind Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>229 Conn. 176, 177, 640 A.2d 100 (1994) (\u201cin the case of a special permit, zoning regulations may authorize a planning and zoning commission to deny an application on the basis of enumerated general considerations such as public health, safety and welfare\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Therefore, because we have determined that the plaintiffs application qualifies as one for a special exception, and because \u00a7 502 of the regulations, which sets forth the standards for special exceptions, expressly requires that a proposed use not impair the public health, safety or the general welfare, and that it be in harmony with the surrounding properties, the commission properly could have considered those factors in denying the plaintiffs application.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the list of special exceptions outlined in \u00a7 500<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the regulations, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>enumerates eleven uses but does not include the removal of sand and gravel among those uses, constitutes an exclusive catalog of all special exceptions. The plaintiff contends that, if the commission had sought to include the removal of sand and gravel as a special exception, it easily could have done so by characterizing it as such in \u00a7 500 of the regulations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 500 is not an exhaustive list of special exceptions. <em>A. Aiudi &amp; Sons, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 510. The court reasoned that \u201c[although \u00a7 500 lists certain uses that \u2018must\u2019 be considered to be special exceptions permitted in any zone, [it] does not state that this list is exclusive.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the Appellate Court determined that the plaintiffs application, which was submitted pursuant to \u00a7 910 (2), could constitute an application for a special exception. See id., 510-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We previously have noted that \u201c[z]oning regulations, as they are in derogation of common law property rights, cannot be construed to <em>include or exclude by implication what is not clearly within their express </em>terms.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>208 Conn. 696, 705, 546 A.2d 823 (1988). We also have noted that, \u201c[w]henever possible, the language of zoning regulations will be construed so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>that no clause is deemed superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The plaintiff asks us to read into \u00a7 500 language designating the list of special exceptions contained therein as exhaustive. The language of \u00a7 500 does not indicate, however, that the fist of special exceptions contained therein is exhaustive; see Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 5, \u00a7 500 (1989); and, consequently, we cannot inteipret \u00a7 500 as an exhaustive list of special exceptions as the plaintiff urges. In addition, \u00a7 500 provides that the enumerated eleven uses \u201care declared to possess such special characteristics that each <em>must be </em>considered as a special exception.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Section 500 does not state, however, that the uses enumerated therein possess such special characteristics that those, and <em>only those, </em>uses are considered as special exceptions.

Traffic Access. All proposed access to the site accommodates two way traffic entering and exiting the site, except as modified by Section 504, Drive Through Windows for Banks, Financial Institutions, Retail Stores and Restaurants, of the Regulations. The number of site access drives is adequate to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development. Site access drives are designed to safely accommodate existing traffic and traffic generated by the proposed development. Site access drives are properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>aligned and provide adequate site distance for the motorists and pedestrians.

Circulation and Parking. Adequate off-street parking and loading areas are provided to prevent patrons, visitors and/or employees of a particular use from parking in public streets. Adequate, safe and accessible pedestrian circulation is provided to and within the site. Interior pedestrian and vehicular traffic circulation systems are designed to minimize conflicts between these two types of traffic and to provide safe access to and from buildings, structures and off-street parking areas. Loading areas are designed and located to prevent conflicts with pedestrian traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeo\">\u201c3. Landscaping and Screening.

See Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 9, \u00a7 910 (2) (1989). If we were to accept the plaintiffs interpretation, we effectively would read the \u201cpermit\u201d requirement out of the regulation. This we decline to do. See <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>208 Conn. 696, 705, 546 A.2d 823 (1988) (\u201c[whenever possible, the language of zoning regulations will be construed so that no clause is deemed superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Similarly, the plaintiffs application does not qualify as an application for a variance because \u00a7 900 does not completely bar the removal of sand and gravel when such removal is unrelated to bona fide construction. E.g., <em>Burlington v. Jencik, </em>168 Conn. 506, 508, 362 A.2d 1338 (1975) (\u201c[a] variance is authority extended to the owner to use his property in a manner forbidden by the zoning enactment\u201d); see Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 9, \u00a7 900 (1989). Rather, \u00a7 900, in using the phrase, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided for in this Article,\u201d permits such removal subject to the conditions set forth in \u00a7 910 (2). Plainville Zoning Regs., art. 9, \u00a7 900 (1989); see also id., \u00a7 910 (2) (enumerating conditions that must be satisfied to obtain permit for removal of, inter alia, sand and gravel).
