The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly determined that it had failed to satisfy its burden of proving that the exemption described in General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-407 (8)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>and (9)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> includes the separately stated expenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>employees who are not located at, and who do not solely devote their time to, a single housing project.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuade us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issues were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s concise and well reasoned memorandum of decision. <em>Renaissance Management Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, 48 </em>Conn. Sup. 221, 838 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>260 (2002). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses all arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the issues and the applicable law concerning those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. <em>See Davis </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>259 Conn. 45, 55-56, 787 A.2d 530 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-16\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-422 provides: \u201cAny taxpayer aggrieved because of any order, decision, determination or disallowance of the Commissioner of Revenue Services under section 12-418, 12-421 or 12-425 may, within one month after service upon the taxpayer of notice of such order, decision, determination or disallowance, take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district of New Britain, which shall be accompanied by a citation to the Commissioner of Revenue Services to appear before said couit. Such citation shall be signed by the same authority, and such appeal shall be returnable at the same time and served and returned in 1he same manner, as is required in case of a summons in a civil action. The authority issuing the citation shall take from the appellant a bond or recognizance to the state of Connecticut, with surety to prosecute the appeal to effect and to comply with the orders and decrees of the court in the premises. Such appeals shall be preferred cases, to be heard, unless cause appears to the contrary, at the first session, by the court or by a committee appointed by it. Said court may grant such relief as may be equitable and, if such tax has been paid prior to the granting of such relief, may order the Treasurer to pay the amount of such relief, with interest at the rate of two-thirds of one per cent per month or fraction thereof, to the aggrieved taxpayer. If the appeal has been taken without probable cause, the court, may tax double or triple costs, as the case demands; and, upon all such appeals which are denied, costs may be taxed against the appellant at the discretion of the court, but no costs shall be taxed against the state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-407 (8) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Sales price\u2019 means the total amount for which tangible personal property is sold, the total amount of rent received for occupancy or the total amount received for any service rendered on or after July 1,1975, or the total amount of payment or periodic payments received for leasing or rental of tangible personal property for the term of any such lease or rental occurring on or after July 1, 1975, valued in money, whether paid in money or otherwise, without any deduction on account of any of the following: (a) The cost of the property sold; (b) the cost of materials used, labor or service cost, interest charged, losses or any other expenses; (c) the cost of transportation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of the property prior to its purchase.
