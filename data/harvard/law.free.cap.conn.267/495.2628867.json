The defendant, Pablo E. Santos, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction, rendered following a conditional plea of nolo contendere, of possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that the actions of the police constituted a search and seizure violative of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>state constitutional rights under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 and 9,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution and the first, fourth and fourteenth<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that the police detained him without a reasonable and articulable basis to suspect that criminal activity had occurred or was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>about to occur, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the seized narcotics, which he claimed were seized illegally during a warrantless patdown search of his person for weapons. The court held a suppression hearing on the motion during which the following facts were adduced. On September 7,2001,. at 10:23 p.m., Troopers Chick Bistany and Steven McManaway of the Connecticut state police, Troop K, conducted a routine patrol of the athletic fields on Plains Road (athletic fields) in the town of Windham. The athletic fields consist of a soccer field, softball field, tennis courts and basketball courts, all of which are accessible from a common parking lot. Although not equipped with lighting for nighttime use, the publicly owned athletic fields do not close at sunset, and there are no signs posted restricting public access or limiting the use of the fields to daylight hours.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The athletic fields are noted for a high instance of criminal activity, including drug transactions and prostitution,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and state police, at the request of the town, therefore patrolled the area nightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">When the troopers entered the athletic fields\u2019 parking lot on the evening in question, they noted the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>of two parked automobiles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> McManaway drove to the right of the parking lot toward one of the automobiles,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while Bistany drove to the left, toward the other, a white Chevrolet Lumina, in which the defendant was a passenger. Bistany turned on his vehicle\u2019s spotlight to illuminate the area around the Lumina. At this point, neither trooper witnessed any illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">As Bistany approached the Lumina, which was parked with its front end abutting the athletic fields, he observed three individuals standing outside the car, and a fourth, the defendant, exiting the right passenger side of the vehicle. Bistany stopped his cruiser behind the Lumina, at a slight angle, and trained the spotlight on the car and the individuals. Bistany then activated his cruiser\u2019s mobile video recorder and his body microphone, allowing him to record all visual and audio events transpiring in front of his cruiser.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Bistany, who was in full uniform, including his state police badge, identifying state police patches, service revolver, and cap stun,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> exited his cruiser and approached the four men. Bistany testified that, as he got closer to the men, he noted that they were \u201cpacing back and forth . . . [and] appeared visibly nervous . . . .\u201d Bistany stopped at the rear of the Lumina, approximately four feet from the men, and asked them what he characterized at the suppression hearing as routine questions, including what they had been doing at the athletic fields and where they had come from. One of the men responded that they were \u201cnot causing any trouble\u201d and that they were \u201cjust driving around.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>At this point, Bistany asked the men, who were standing on either side of the Lumina, to come to the rear of the Lumina, in front of his cruiser. When the four men complied and were standing in a line in front of him, Bistany asked who was driving the Lumina. One of the defendant\u2019s companions identified himself as the driver and Bistany requested to see his identification. When the individual who had identified himself as the driver began to move toward the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Bistany instructed him to stop and return to where he had been standing. At this point, Bistany, out of concern for his safety, instructed all four men to remain still and submit to a patdown search.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Bistany proceeded to conduct a patdown search of each individual. As Bistany began searching the first man, McManaway returned from patrolling the opposite side of the parking lot and assisted Bistany by watching the three individuals not being searched. When Bistany searched the first individual, he noted that the individual felt wet and was covered in grass clippings. Bistany asked the individual why that was so, and the man responded that he and the other three men had been wrestling on the ground prior to Bistany\u2019s arrival.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The defendant was the third person searched. Bistany testified that, when he called the defendant over to him, the defendant approached with his hands clenched. As he reached Bistany, the defendant turned around and placed his fists under his armpits. Bistany instructed the defendant to put his hands behind his back, and, after the defendant complied, he began to pat him down. Bistany told the defendant to relax and open his hands. Bistany then observed a clear plastic bag containing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>white, powdery substance between the fingers of the defendant\u2019s right hand. The troopers subsequently arrested the defendant for possession of narcotics.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The state charged the defendant with possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-279 (a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of \u00a7 21a-277 (a). The defendant thereafter moved to suppress the seized narcotics on the ground that the police did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity that is required to conduct a valid <em>Terry </em>stop.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968). Specifically, the defendant argued in his motion that: (1) his detention was unwarranted because the troopers did not possess a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a crime had been or was about to be committed; (2) the <em>Terry </em>pat-down of his person was unwarranted because the troopers did not have a reasonable suspicion or probable cause to suspect that the defendant was presently armed and dangerous; and (3) consequently, the exclusionary rule and the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine required suppression of all evidence obtained during and subsequent to the stop and seizure. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that, when Bistany decided to detain and pat down the defendant, he had a reasonable and articulable suspicion for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 61-6,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere to the second count, possession of narcotics with intent to sell, in order to appeal immediately the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress. The trial court accepted the defendant\u2019s conditional plea and, after the state nolled the first count, possession of narcotics, the trial court rendered judgment of guilty on the charge of possession of narcotics with intent to sell. The defendant subsequently appealed from the judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress and challenges both the trial court\u2019s factual findings and its legal conclusion. First, the defendant contends that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>court improperly found that the defendant and his companions were \u201csweating\u201d and \u201cpacing back and forth\u201d during the questioning by Bistany. The defendant further claims that, based on these erroneous factual findings, the trial court improperly concluded that there existed a reasonable and articulable basis for the <em>Terry </em>stop and that the subsequent patdown search was valid. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luurtsema, </em>262 Conn. 179, 184, 811 A.2d 223 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">When considering the validity of a <em>Terry </em>stop, our threshold inquiry is twofold. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 645, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992). First, we must determine \u201cat what point, if any, did the encounter between [the police officer] and the defendant constitute an investigatory stop or seizure.\u201d Id. Next, \u201c[i]f we conclude that there was such a seizure, we must then determine whether [the police officer] possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion at the time the seizure occurred.\u201d Id., 645-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">We must first determine, therefore, at what point, if at all, a seizure occurred. \u201cWe have . . . defined a person as seized under our state constitution when by means of physical force or a show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained. ... In determining the threshold question of whether there has been a seizure, we examine the effect of the police conduct at the time of the alleged seizure, applying an objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>standard. Under our state constitution, a person is seized only if in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>237 Conn. 390, 404, 678 A.2d 1338 (1996). Therefore, \u201c[w]hether there has been a seizure in an individual case is a question of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 292, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In the present case, the state concedes that a seizure occurred when Bistany instructed the defendant and his acquaintances to remain still and submit to a patdown search.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Specifically, this was the point in time after Bistany had assembled the men, including the defendant, at the rear of the Lumina and in front of the police cruiser, and after Bistany had instructed the driver of the automobile to return to where he had been standing after he had attempted to retrieve his identification from inside the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">We next turn, therefore, to the pivotal issue in this case: whether the trial court properly concluded that the seizure was based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity. The determination of whether a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists rests on a two part analysis: \u201c(1) whether the underlying factual findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous; and (2) whether the conclusion that those facts gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>rise to such a suspicion is legally correct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkins, </em>240 Conn. 489, 496, 692 A.2d 1233 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u201cUnder the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9, of our state constitution, a police officer is permitted in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner to detain an individual for investigative purposes if the officer believes, based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the individual is engaged in criminal activity, even if there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>258 Conn. 68, 75, 779 A.2d 88 (2001); see also <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 330-31, 110 S. Ct. 2412, 110 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1990); <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u201c[I]n justifying [a] particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 75; see also <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 392 U.S. 21; <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 148-49, 438 A.2d 679 (1980). \u201cIn determining whether a detention is justified in a given case, a court must consider if, relying on the whole picture, the detaining officers had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>supra, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">We begin this inquiry by reviewing the facts as found by the trial court in its memorandum of decision, which formed the basis for its conclusion that the investigatoiy detention of the defendant was justified. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the court found the following facts: \u201c[M] embers of the Connecticut state police . . . were conducting a patrol check of the [athletic] fields of Plains Road in Windham .... [T]he area is noted for the high instance of criminal activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and there have been numerous instances of used hypodermic needles . . . and empty narcotics baggies being found in the area. . . . When [Bistany] approached the . . . individuals, they appeared nervous, were sweating, and were pacing back and forth. The officer also noted an odor of alcohol emanating from the individual\u2019s breath.\u201d The defendant specifically challenges the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendant and his companions were sweating and pacing back and forth, claiming that these findings are clearly erroneous. We address each factual challenge separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">After reviewing the videotape of the encounter, we cannot reasonably discern any indicia of perspiration on the defendant or his companions. The footage, shot from the police cruiser, at night, under the glare of the spotlight, is grainy and provides no support for a finding that the defendant or his companions were perspiring. Furthermore, neither Bistany nor McManaway testified at the suppression hearing that the defendant or his companions were sweating. In addition, the state conceded at oral argument in this matter that there was no testimony that they were perspiring. Thus, the court\u2019s finding that the defendant and his companions \u201cwere sweating\u201d cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">We also find no support for the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant and his companions were \u201cpacing back and forth.\u201d Although Bistany testified that the four men were \u201cpacing back and forth,\u201d our review of the videotape leads us to conclude otherwise. The videotape depicts the defendant and his friends standing at the rear of their car, occasionally shifting their weight from one foot to the other while standing in the glare of the spotlight, answering Bistany\u2019s questions. That movement cannot properly be characterized as \u201cpacing back and forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Having concluded that these factual findings were clearly erroneous, we must determine whether the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>court\u2019s legal conclusion\u2014that a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity justified the intrusion\u2014can be supported by the remaining facts found, namely, that Bistany noted the \u201codor of alcohol emanating from the individual\u2019s breath\u201d and that \u201cthe area is noted for the high instance of criminal activity . . . .\u201d We conclude that these remaining facts alone do not satisfy the requirement that there be a <em>reasonable and articulable </em>suspicion that the defendant had engaged or was about to engage in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">First, the fact that Bistany smelled alcohol cannot reasonably support the investigatory detention of the defendant. Consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons over the age of twenty-one is not unlawful unless accompaniedby other conduct, such as the operation of amotor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There is no evidence in the record that the individual who smelled of alcohol was the defendant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> There is no evidence that the defendant was the driver of the vehicle.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, while Bistany testified that he noticed the odor of alcohol <em>at some point,\u201d </em>(emphasis added) he conceded that he could not accurately recall at <em>which point </em>he smelled the alcohol. There is no evidence in the record indicating that Bistany detected the odor of alcohol <em>prior </em>to the seizure. Thus, the fact that the officer detected the odor of alcohol on <em>some </em>person at <em>some </em>point during the encounter cannot provide a reasonable and articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Second, the mere presence of the defendant and his companions in a high crime area at night is not suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ciently indicative of criminal activity to justify the investigatory detention. Although, \u201c[t]he character of the neighborhood and the officer\u2019s knowledge of narcotics distributions in the area may properly be considered\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>62 Conn. App. 376, 399, 771 A.2d 206 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moreland, </em>23 Conn. App. 495, 497, 582 A.2d 212 (1990); a person\u2019s physical presence in an area where police anticipate criminal activity, alone, does not justify an arbitrary investigatory detention of that person. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>195 Conn. 668, 678-79 n.15, 490 A.2d 984 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">When considering the impact of a defendant\u2019s presence in a high crime area as afactor in a <em>Terry </em>stop analysis, this court previously has relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 99 S. Ct. 2637, 61 L. Ed. 2d 357 (1979), the facts of which are similar to the present case. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mikolinski, </em>256 Conn. 543, 549, 775 A.2d 274 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>204 Conn. 187, 195, 527 A.2d 1168, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 927, 108 S. Ct. 293, 98 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1987); <em>State v. Torres, </em>197 Conn. 620, 626, 500 A.2d 1299 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 673. In <em>Brown, </em>two police officers conducted a <em>Terry </em>stop of a defendant whom they observed walking in the opposite direction of another man in an alley located in an area known for drug trafficking. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 48. Although the men were a few feet apart when the police observed them, one officer testified that he believed that they previously had been together. Id., 49. He further testified that the police had stopped the defendant because he looked suspicious and they had never seen him in that area before. Id. The United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that [the defendant] was in aneigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>borhood frequented by drug users, standing alone, is not a basis for concluding that [the defendant] himself was engaged in criminal conduct.\u201d Id., 52. \u201cThe lesson from <em>Brown </em>... is simply that physical presence in a geographical area where the police may have reason to anticipate possible violations of the law does not in and of itself justify arbitrary investigatory stops.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>supra, 678-79 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In the present case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s presence in a high crime area at night, without any other facts, cannot form the basis for a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant had engaged or was about to engage in criminal activity. Simply put, the record in the present case is devoid of 'evidence of suspicious activity. The state, in its brief, fails to articulate with specificity any criminal activity reasonably indicated by the facts and circumstances set forth in the record. The defendant\u2019s mere physical presence at the athletic fields was neither suspicious nor criminal. Without more, we cannot conclude that the trooper had a reasonable and articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The state likens the present case to other cases in which the denial of a motion to suppress seized contraband based on a neighborhood\u2019s unsavory notoriety have been upheld.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The cases relied upon by the state in its brief ar e factually distinguishable. For instance, the state points to <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 149-50, in which this court upheld the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>conclusion that a reasonable and articulable basis for suspicion of criminal activity existed due to the defendant\u2019s presence in a commuter parking lot during customary work hours and his \u201cplainly furtive conduct\u201d upon the police officer\u2019s approach.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Likewise, the state relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Conn. 577, 585-86, 345 A.2d 532 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 960, 94 S. Ct. 1977, 40 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1974), in which this court concluded that the investigatory detention of the defendant was justified when police officers had observed the defendant drive his vehicle into the parking lot of a motel late at night, and drop off four passengers who entered the motel and, shortly thereafter, emerged from the motel hurriedly and cautiously. Finally, the state relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Moreland, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 498, in which the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s presence in an area known for drug trafficking, along with the defendant\u2019s conversation with the occupant of an automobile and a third individual and the defendant\u2019s open display of money, supported the trial court\u2019s finding that a reasonable and articulable basis for suspicion existed to warrant the defendant\u2019s detention. These cases all involved conduct on the part of the defendant beyond mere physical presence in a high crime area. Unlike the present case, each involved plainly furtive, even bizarre, behavior, which, when coupled with a neighborhood\u2019s crime-ridden reputation, clearly supplied the basis for a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Finally, the state argues that a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity can arise from noncriminal acts. Although we have stated that \u201c[a]n investigative stop can be appropriate even where the police have not observed a violation because a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>able and articulable suspicion can arise from conduct that alone is not criminal\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lipscomb, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 76; the state\u2019s argument fails to recognize that, even if the acts prompting the stop are not criminal, the stop is justified only if the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that <em>criminal activity is afoot. </em>\u201cThe issue is not whether the particular conduct is innocent or guilty, but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>257 Conn. 610, 625, 778 A.2d 108 (2001). In the present case, the noncriminal conduct that prompted the stop, i.e., the presence of four men in the parking lot of public athletic fields at night, without more, reasonably could not give rise to the belief that they were engaged in criminal activity. Accordingly, the detention and patdown search violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Having concluded that the defendant\u2019s detention was not supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity, we turn our attention to the defendant\u2019s claim that the seized narcotics must be suppressed pursuant to the exclusionary rule.
