Christian, Jr., appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56b (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2) (A), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>amended by No. 99-255, \u00a7 1, of the 1999 Public Acts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and reckless driving in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) permitted the defendant\u2019s wife, Joan Christian, to testily, over the defendant\u2019s objection, regarding his confidential marital communications to her; (2) refused to admit the testimony of a certain witness to show that the defendant\u2019s wife had a motive for falsely testifying against the defendant; and (3) refused to admit emergency medical \u201crun sheets,\u201d as either prior inconsistent statements, or under the business record exception to the hearsay rule, to impeach emergency personnel who testified for the state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Although we agree with the defendant\u2019s first two claims, we nevertheless conclude that the trial court\u2019s improprieties were harmless. We disagree with the defendant\u2019s third claim. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of March 17, 2000, the defendant went to a bar in Southwick, Massachusetts with the victim, Victoria Ryan, and the victim\u2019s roommate, Alexander Imperatrice. They arrived at the bar sometime between 9 and 9:30 p.m., whereupon the defendant, the victim and Imperatrice all consumed alcohol. At around 11 p.m., they left the bar and, with Imperatrice driving, proceeded to the victim\u2019s residence in Enfield, arriving there at approximately 11:30 p.m. Thereafter, the defendant and the victim told Imperatrice that they were \u201cgoing back out,\u201d and at around 11:45 p.m., the two entered the victim\u2019s car, a 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and drove off, with the victim driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Sometime after midnight, Debra Wilson was traveling on Suffield Street in Windsor Locks when she noticed that the car in front of her did not have its headlights illuminated. The headlights remained unlit for approximately one mile before becoming illuminated somewhere near the border between the towns of Windsor Locks and Suffield. As Wilson continued on Suffield Street into the town of Suffield, she noticed that the car in front of her had increased its speed and was \u201cpulling away\u201d from her, although she herself was traveling at a rate of ten or fifteen miles above the posted speed limit. Soon thereafter, Wilson lost sight of the other car\u2019s taillights.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">As Wilson continued on Suffield Street in a northerly direction, the road curved sharply to the right and passed under a railroad overpass. As Wilson approached the overpass, she observed that the guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>posts along the left side of the road had been knocked down. She stopped her vehicle, whereupon she observed the victim\u2019s car resting under the railroad overpass, in a creek at the bottom of a six and one-half foot embankment off the side of the road, with steam rising from the front of the car. Wilson drove to her house, which was close to the scene of the accident, and called 911. She then returned to the accident scene and, standing at the edge of the embankment, pointed a flashlight at the victim\u2019s car. She yelled out that she had just called 911, and a male voice responded, \u201cThank you.\u201d According to Wilson, the voice sounded like it came from the male individual she observed sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, behind the steering wheel. Wilson asked the man if he was alright, and he responded, \u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d Wilson then asked how many people were in the car, and the man told her that there were two. Finally, Wilson asked him if they both were alright, and the man responded, \u201cYes, we\u2019re both okay.\u201d The police arrived at the scene shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Officer Shawn Nelson of the Suffield police department arrived at the scene at approximately 12:50 a.m. on March 18, 2000. He identified himself as a police officer and, upon receiving no response from the occupants of the victim\u2019s car, made his way down the embankment to the vehicle. Sergeant David Bourque of the Suffield police department arrived shortly thereafter and joined Nelson at the bottom of the embankment. Nelson and Bourque both observed that the car\u2019s driver\u2019s side door was open, and that the defendant was sitting in the creek, unconscious, with his back against the open driver\u2019s side door and his body slumped forward into the driver\u2019s seat area. Through the window of the closed passenger\u2019s side door, Bourque observed that the victim \u201cwas in the passenger seat with her buttocks fully in the seat.\u201d Nelson forced open the passenger\u2019s side door, which was jammed shut, and he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Bourque observed that the victim was seated in the passenger seat with her body slumped forward toward the vehicle\u2019s center console, which was completely destroyed. She was not wearing a seat belt. The victim did not make any movement, nor did she respond to Nelson\u2019s questions asking if she was alright.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Nelson and Bourque soon were joined by other emergency personnel, including several firefighters and Deidre Vorih, an emergency medical technician. Vorih observed that the defendant still was sitting in the creek, unconscious and leaning against the open driver\u2019s side door. She revived the defendant, who appeared confused. After ascertaining that the defendant was able to use his legs, Vorih instructed him to get out of the creek and wait in the driver\u2019s seat of the car while she tended to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Because the victim was not breathing and had no pulse, the emergency personnel had to remove her from the vehicle to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her. The victim was a relatively large woman, approximately five feet eight inches tall and weighing approximately 200 pounds, and it took the concerted efforts of Nelson, Vorih and two or three firefighters to remove her from the car and carry her up the embankment. CPR was performed on the victim, who never regained consciousness. She was transported by ambulance to Hartford Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Vorih then tended to the defendant while they waited for a second ambulance to arrive to transport him to the hospital. She observed that the defendant was \u201cmuch more lucid\u201d than he had been earlier, and that he was able to answer her questions regarding his medical history. After the second ambulance arrived at the scene, Vorih and another emergency medical technician, Nicole Ruggiero, accompanied the defendant to Hartford Hospital. On the way to the hospital the ambu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>lance stopped to pick up Tonya Ford, a paramedic, who also accompanied the defendant to the hospital. In the course of the ride to the hospital, the defendant told both Vorih and Ruggiero that, before the accident, he had been at a friend\u2019s house, and that he had been driving to a bar in Southwick, Massachusetts. He also told them that he had been in a previous car accident five weeks earlier, and was taking prescription pain medication for injuries sustained in that accident. With regard to the previous accident, Vorih asked the defendant, \u201cWere you driving then too?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cYeah, I was driving then, too.\u201d In addition, the defendant repeatedly told Vorih, Ruggiero and Ford that he had been driving the victim\u2019s car at the time of the accident at issue in the present case, and that he had been wearing his seat belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">When the ambulance arrived at Hartford Hospital, the defendant was examined by a trauma team headed by Orlando C. Kirton, a general surgeon, who determined that the defendant had sustained several injuries, including a broken left clavicle, or collarbone, with accompanying abrasions and bruising to the upper left side of his chest, a broken bone in his right hand, two broken toes in his right foot and a bruise on his right hip. The defendant\u2019s blood was drawn, revealing that he had a blood alcohol level of 0.20, twice the legal limit. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The defendant told Robert Beginsky, a junior resident physician and part of the trauma team on duty at Hartford Hospital when the defendant was admitted, that he did not remember the accident or whether he had been the driver or the passenger. Beginsky noted that the defendant initially had stated that he thought he had been the passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The victim was pronounced dead at Hartford Hospital at 1:42 a.m. on March 18, 2000. The cause of death was \u201cmultiple blunt traumatic injuries,\u201d including \u201cmultiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>rib and sternal fractures . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently was charged by substitute information with manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 53a-56b (a), operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2) (A), and reckless driving in violation of \u00a7 14-222 (a). See footnotes 2 through 4 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">At trial, the defendant did not contest that he was intoxicated on the evening of March 17, 2000. Rather, the defendant argued that the victim had been driving her car at the time of the accident and that he had been in the passenger seat. The state presented the testimony of Vorih, Ruggerio and Ford, all of whom testified that the defendant repeatedly had told them that he had been driving at the time of the accident. The state also presented the testimony of the defendant\u2019s estranged wife, Joan Christian, who testified, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the defendant had told her that he had been driving at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In addition, the state presented evidence concerning the circumstances of the accident. Specifically, Bourque testified that, on the basis of the \u201ccrush\u201d damage to the vehicle and the location of paint chips from the victim\u2019s vehicle on the stone trestle wall of the railroad overpass, he determined that the vehicle had been moving at a speed of approximately fifty miles per hour when it hit the wall at a 73 degree angle, and that it then had rotated approximately 88 degrees before coming to rest at the bottom of the embankment. After comparing the circumstances of the accident to video recordings of professional crash tests, which were shown to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Bourque characterized the collision as a frontal impact. On the basis of the crash test video recordings, the frontal impact collision, the weight of the victim, the victim\u2019s position in the passenger seat and Wilson\u2019s statement to the police that she had witnessed a male seated in the driver\u2019s seat, Bourque testified with a reasonable degree of certainty that the defendant had been driving at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Bourque also testified, with the aid of a videotaped reenactment that was shown to the jury, that due to the intense damage to the vehicle, a woman of the victim\u2019s height and weight could not have moved from the driver\u2019s seat into the passenger\u2019s seat after the vehicle had come to rest. Finally, Bourque testified that the driver\u2019s side seat belt, which was shown to the jury, had suffered structural damage and was found in a retracted and \u201clocked\u201d position. In contrast, the passenger\u2019s side seat belt was not found in a locked position.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Ira Kanfer, a pathologist from the office of the chief medical examiner, testified that the injury to the victim\u2019s right arm was consistent with the type of injury that occurred to people located on the passenger side of motor vehicles. He also testified that the defendant\u2019s injuiy to his left clavicle and the bruising of his right hip were consistent with injuries that might be caused by a driver\u2019s side seat belt, \u201cbecause the [driver\u2019s] seat belt comes over your left shoulder\u201d and \u201c[t]he buckle is put on the right hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">John Kwasnoski, an accident reconstruction expert, testified that, once the car had hit the trestle wall, it took less then one second for the car to go down the embankment. Kwasnoski further testified that, under the circumstances of the accident, which he also characterized as a frontal impact, the \u201cnatural tendency\u201d would be for the occupants of the car to move \u201cvery much forward and slightly to the right . . . .\u201d There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>fore, it was Kwasnoski\u2019s opinion that, if the driver of the car had been wearing a seat belt, it would have been impossible for the driver to shift into the passenger seat. He further testified that, in the present case, there was no evidence that the driver had been unrestrained. Kwasnoski also testified that the occupants\u2019 slight movement to the right similarly would have been restricted by the frontal air bags, which had deployed during the accident. Finally, Kwasnoski testified that he did not believe that the victim could have hit the steering wheel\u2014which was obstructed by an air bag\u2014 and \u201cthen somehow reboundfed] from that and [gone] sideways and [gotten] both her upper body and her feet over on the other side of the console.\u201d Rather, he believed that the injuries to the victim\u2019s chest had been caused by her body moving forward, at a high rate of speed, into an air bag as it deployed at a rate of more than 100 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">In the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, Eugene Baron, an accident reconstruction expert, testified that, based on the severe damage to the interior of the vehicle and the injuries sustained by its occupants, it was \u201cmore probable\u201d that the victim, and not the defendant, had been the driver. Specifically, Baron testified that the severe damage to the vehicle\u2019s steering column and steering wheel probably had been caused by \u201can occupant [who had] sustained very severe chest and facial trauma.\u201d He further stated that the steering wheel rim significantly had been bent toward the dashboard, indicating that the driver of the vehicle had not been wearing a seat belt. In addition, Baron stated that the driver\u2019s side seat belt had not sustained the type of deformation or other damage that customarily would be found after a high-speed collision. Baron testified that he had observed blood on the driver\u2019s side air bag, the center of the steering wheel rim, the dashboard and the passenger side door panel. He also testified that the damage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>the dashboard on the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle was consistent with the injury to the defendant\u2019s right hand. Finally, Baron testified that the vehicle had rotated clockwise approximately 90 degrees after hitting the trestle wall, and that any \u201cobjects\u201d in the car, including its occupants, would have been propelled toward the right side of the vehicle during the rotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The defendant also presented Robert Fisher, the defendant\u2019s treating physician, who testified that the injury to the defendant\u2019s left clavicle \u201ccould not have been caused by a seat belt with any reasonable medical probability.\u201d In addition, the defendant presented the expert testimony of Ricardo Sanchez, chairman and assistant director of emergency medicine at Saint Fr ancis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford, who testified that the victim\u2019s chest injury could not have been caused by an impact with a deploying air bag, but \u201cmay have\u201d been caused by traumatic contact with \u201csome blunt object, such as the steering wheel or some other part of the vehicle.\u201d Sanchez further testified that anxiety, intoxication or discomfort could cause a patient to make an incorrect statement to a treating paramedic.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts. Thereafter, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and imposed on the defendant a total effective sentence of ten years and seven months imprisonment, suspended after eight years and seven months, five years probation and a $500 fine. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessaxy.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly permitted the defendant\u2019s wife, Joan Christian, to testify, over his objection, regarding his confidential communications to her. The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. In the early hours of March 18, 2000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Joan Christian was finishing her shift as a waitress at a restaurant in Avon when she received a telephone call informing her of the defendant\u2019s accident. She immediately went to Hartford Hospital, where she was greeted by Imperatrice, a chaplain and several physicians, who told her that the victim had died in the accident and that they believed that the defendant had been the driver of the vehicle involved. After consulting with the physicians, Joan Christian went, by herself, to the defendant\u2019s hospital room to inform him that the victim had died. When she arrived, the defendant quietly told her that he had been driving the vehicle, and he then made motions with his hands as though he were operating a steering wheel. Joan Christian quickly covered the defendant\u2019s hands with her own and \u201chushed\u201d him, ostensibly to prevent him from making any further incriminating statements. Imperatrice and the physicians entered the room immediately thereafter. The defendant made no further incriminating remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">At trial, the state offered Joan Christian as a witness. She testified, upon voir dire, that at the time of trial, she and the defendant were separated and in the process of getting divorced. She further testified, however, that at the time of the accident in March, 2000, although she and the defendant still were living together, the marriage \u201cwas very rocky\u201d and that it \u201cwent downhill\u201d after the night of the accident. Finally, she testified that the marriage was over and that she did not feel that preserving the confidentiality of the defendant\u2019s statement would have any effect on repairing the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to prevent Joan Christian from testifying about this communication on the ground that it was a privileged confidential marital communication. Specifically, the defendant argued that, although no Connecticut case expressly has recognized the existence of the marital communications privilege, the dictum of this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>199 Conn. 631, 649, 508 A.2d 1376 (1986), indicates that the privilege \u201chas seemingly been accepted\u201d by the courts of this state. The defendant further argued that the marital communications privilege was applicable to the present case because the communication had been \u201cmade during [the] marriage, out of the presence of third parties . . . .\u201d In response, the state argued that, regardless of whether the privilege was available, the communication was not confidential, and thus, not privileged, because the defendant previously had made similar communications to Vorih, Ruggiero and Ford while riding in the ambulance to the hospital. The state further argued that application of the privilege would be inappropriate because the marriage between the defendant and his wife was \u201crocky\u201d at the time of the communication, and that they were separated at the time of trial and in the process of getting divorced. The state argued, therefore, that any harm that disclosure might cause to the defendant\u2019s marital relationship was outweighed by the interest of the court and of society in \u201cthis judicial investigation of the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine. Although the court concluded that the marital communications privilege \u201cmay exist in certain circumstances,\u201d it determined that the privilege did not apply in the present case because the marriage irretrievably had broken down. Specifically, the court stated: \u201c[B]ased on the dictum in <em>Littlejohn, </em>certainly this court will not say that no such privilege exists in Connecticut even though it is not set forth in a statute. I think our Supreme Court strongly indicates that the privilege does exist under some circumstances. Certainly there must be a marriage in effect; certainly the communication must be confidential, must have been made confidentially so that other people were not privy to it. And those circumstances seem to be present here. Although, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>with respect to the confidential nature of the communication, I think that may be questioned in view of the evidence that we have heard, that the defendant essentially made the same inculpatory statement to other people before he made the statement to his wife. But I think the overriding factor in the circumstances of this case is that at the time the statement was made, but most importantly now, at the time of trial, the marriage relationship exists in name only, de jure, we might say, but not de facto. In my opinion, the marriage relationship has so broken down that at present the marital privilege, if it existed, has lost its purpose and must, therefore, give way to the competing strong interest of justice; namely, that relevant and material evidence be presented to a jury so that the jury can make a correct decision based on the facts.\u201d Consequently, Joan Christian testified concerning the communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">On appeal, the defendant revives his argument to the trial court that the marital communications privilege is alive and well in Connecticut. Specifically, the defendant claims that, although neither the courts nor the legislature explicitly have recognized such a privilege, \u201cthe case law and the statutory history . . . show that this privilege is well recognized.\u201d The defendant therefore contends that the trial court improperly precluded the defendant from asserting the privilege concerning the communication, which had been made in confidence and while the couple was living together and in alegally valid marital relationship. In response, the state ruges us not to recognize the marital communications privilege because \u201cthe cost of recognizing the common law . . . privilege exceeds its dubious benefits.\u201d Rather, the state contends, the legislature has enacted \u201ca reasonable compromise\u201d by codifying the separate and distinct adverse marital testimonial privilege in General Statutes \u00a7 54-84a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state further argues that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>even if we recognize the marital communications privilege, it is inapplicable in the present case because the defendant\u2019s previous statements to Vorih, Ruggiero and Ford rendered his communication to his wife not confidential. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We note at the outset that evidentiary privileges are governed by \u00a7 5-1 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise required by the constitution of the United States, the constitution of this state, the General Statutes or the Practice Book, privileges shall be governed by the principles of the common law.\u201d The adverse spousal testimony privilege, which is codified at \u00a7 54-84a, belongs to the \u201cwitness spouse.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saia, </em>172 Conn. 37, 43, 372 A.2d 144 (1976). Under that privilege, the husband or wife of a criminal defendant has a privilege not to testify against his or her spouse in a criminal proceeding, provided that the couple is married at the time of trial. See id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>113 Conn. 288, 290, 155 A. 223 (1931); see also C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 5.34.1, pp. 325-26. The marital communications privilege, on the other hand, \u201cpermits an individual to refuse to testify, and to <em>prevent </em>a spouse or former spouse from testifying, as to any confidential communication made by the individual to the spouse during their marriage.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rakes, </em>136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998); see also <em>Trammel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 40, 51, 100 S. Ct. 906, 63 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1980) (marital communications privilege \u201cprotect[s] information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship\u201d); 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed. 1999) \u00a7\u00a778 through 86, pp. 323-42; C. Tait, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 5.35.1 through 5.35.5, pp. 328-31. Because the marital communications privilege is not addressed squarely by either the federal constitution, state constitution, General Statutes or Practice Book, it is governed by the principles of the common law. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 5-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 649, this court stated: \u201cWe have never explicitly held that confidential communications between husband and wife are privileged under the common law of this jurisdiction. Our early case <em>of State v. Hoyt, </em>47 Conn. 518 (1880), strongly suggests that the <em>Hoyt </em>court felt that there was such a privilege. See [id.], 540.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The later case of <em>Spitz\u2019s Appeal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number><em>from Commissioners, </em>56 Conn. 184, 14 A. 776 (1887), clearly hypothesizes such aprivilege.\u201d In <em>Littlejohn, </em>the defendant sought to assert the marital communications privilege to prevent his wife from testifying as to some twenty-five or thirty confidential communications. <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>supra, 648-49. This court concluded that, \u201c[although the confidential communications involved may have been admitted in error, any error was harmless.\u201d Id., 650. Accordingly, we did not answer the question of whether the marital communications privilege existed under our common law. We remarked, nonetheless, that the privilege for confidential marital communications \u201ccommends itself to judicial acceptance.\u201d Id., 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\u201c[T]he rules of privilege, of which the most familiar are the rule protecting against self-incrimination and those shielding the confidentiality of communications between husband and wife, attorney and client, and physician and patient, are not designed or intended to facilitate the fact-finding process or to safeguard its integrity. Their effect instead is clearly inhibitive; rather than facilitating the illumination of truth, they shut out the light.\u201d 1C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 72, p. 299. Privileges have \u201cthe effect of withholding relevant information from the factfinder .... Accordingly, although a . . . privilege must be applied so as to effectuate its puipose, it is to be applied cautiously and with circumspection because it impedes the truth-seeking function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>of the adjudicative process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Montgomery, 254 Conn. 694, 724, 759 A.2d 995 (2000). A privilege should be recognized, therefore, only if four essential conditions have been met: \u201c(1) The communications must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed. (2) This element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties. (3) The relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered. (4) The injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation.\u201d 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence (1961) \u00a7 2285, p. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The principles underlying the marital communications privilege are well recognized. \u201cThe basis of the immunity given to communications between husband and wife is the protection of marital confidences, regarded as so essential to the preservation of the marriage relationship as to outweigh the disadvantages to the administration of justice which the privilege entails. . . . Hence it is that the privilege with respect to communications extends to the testimony of husband or wife even though the different privilege, excluding the testimony of one against the other, is not involved.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Wolfle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>291 U.S. 7, 14, 54 S. Ct. 279, 78 L. Ed. 617 (1934). The marital communications privilege protects \u201cinformation privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship\u2014once described . . . as \u2018the best solace of human existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trammel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 445 U.S. 51, quoting <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 209, 223 (1839).

Ct. 1611, 123 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1993). \u201c[T]he primary purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>confidential marital communication privilege is to foster marital relationships by encouraging confidential communication between spouses . . . <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Pasek, </em>886 P.2d 272, 276 (Wyo. 1994). The privilege \u201cpermitfs] a husband and wife to communicate freely with one another without fear that their communications will be used against them at some future date.\u201d G. Sodaro <em>&amp; </em>P. Wilson, \u201cSpousal Privileges,\u201d in 2 Testimonial Privileges (S. Stone &amp; R. Taylor eds., 2d Ed. 1995) \u00a7 5.07, p. 5-11. \u201cWe encourage married people to confide in each other by protecting their statements from later scrutiny in court.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>249 F.3d 632, 641 (7th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">It therefore is apparent that the purposes underlying the marital communications privilege asserted by the defendant are quite different from those supporting the separate and distinct privilege against adverse spousal testimony relied upon by the state. \u201cThe [adverse spousal testimony] privilege looks forward with reference to the particular marriage at hand: the privilege is meant to protect against the impact of the testimony on the marriage. The marital communications privilege in a sense, is broader and more abstract: it exists to insure that spouses generally, prior to any involvement in criminal activity or a trial, feel free to communicate their deepest feelings to each other without fear of eventual exposure in a court of law.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>750 F.2d 585, 590 (7th Cir. 1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Adamson, </em>72 Ohio St. 3d 431, 433, 650 N.E.2d 875 (1995) (\u201c[s]pousal privilege and spousal competency are distinct legal concepts which interrelate and provide two different levels of protection for communications between spouses\u201d). We therefore are not persuaded by the state\u2019s assertion that the privilege against adverse spousal testimony, codified at \u00a7 54-84a, alone is sufficient to protect the interests of open communication in the marital relationship. Accordingly, we reaffirm our statement in <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 649, that the marital communications privilege \u201ccommends itself to judicial acceptance,\u201d and we expressly accept that privilege as a fixture of our common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Our conclusion, recognizing the existence of a privilege for confidential marital conummications, aligns us with every other jurisdiction in the country.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Connecticut is unique among its sister states, which each have a statute or a rule of evidence expressly providing for the privilege.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even when the marital communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>privilege is a product of legislative fiat, however, courts have continued to recognize the strong common-law roots of the privilege. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gianakos, </em>644 N.W.2d 409, 415 (Minn. 2002) (\u201cdespite the statutory nature of Minnesota\u2019s marital privilege, its roots are in the common law\u201d); <em>State </em>v. Holmes, 330 N.C. 826, 828, 412 S.E.2d 660 (1992) (\u201c[t]he common law has long recognized a privilege protecting confidential marital communications, that is, information privately disclosed between a husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship\u201d); see also 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 78, p. 325 (\u201cstatutes protecting marital communications from disclosure are declaratory of the common law\u201d). The federal courts, moreover, continue to recognize and apply the privilege as a matter of federal common law. See <em>Trammel </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 445 U.S. 45 n.5, 51 (recognizing marital communications privilege); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Westmoreland, </em>312 F.3d 302, 306 (7th Cir. 2002) (\u201c[t]he marital communications privilege is well-established in the federal courts\u201d), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1042, 123 S. Ct. 2094, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1077 (2003); see also Fed. R. Evid. 501 (providing that \u201cprivileges . . . shall be governed by the principles of the common law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">As we have stated, the marital communications privilege permits an individual to prevent his or her spouse or former spouse from testifying as to any confidential communication made by the individual to the spouse during their marriage. In the present case, it is uncontroverted that the statement made by the defendant to his wife, along with the accompanying gesticulations, were \u201ccommunications.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must determine: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>(1) whether the defendant had made those communications to his wife during their marriage; and (2) whether those communications were confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We begin our analysis by determining whether the defendant had made the communications to his wife while the couple were in a valid marital relationship. In the present case, the trial court determined that the marital communications privilege, if it existed, was inapplicable because \u201cat the time the statement was made, but most importantly now, at the time of trial,\u201d the defendant\u2019s marriage irretrievably had broken down. The state contends that the trial court\u2019s decision was proper, because the defendant\u2019s marriage was \u201cbeyond repair\u201d both at the time the statement was made and at the time of trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused to apply the privilege. Specifically, he claims that the trial court\u2019s focus was imprecise because the privilege attaches at the time that the confidential statement was made, and if made during the marriage, the privilege survives the dissolution of the marriage. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">\u201c[T]he scope of our appellate review depends upon the proper characterization of the rulings made by the trial court. To the extent that the trial court has made findings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous. When, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>however, the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>Kimber Mfg., Inc., </em>265 Conn. 1, 7, 826 A.2d 1088 (2003). In the present case, the trial court\u2019s determination that the marital communications privilege does not apply to existent marriages that irretrievably have broken down was a conclusion of law. Thus, our limited task, in connection with the first prong of the test, is to decide whether, based on the facts set forth in the record, the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law was legally and logically correct. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">For the marital communications privilege to apply, the communications must have been made in confidence <em>during the marriage. </em>Once the marital communications privilege has attached, moreover, it continues to survive even after the marriage has ended. See <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>United States, </em>347 U.S. 1, 6, 74 S. Ct. 358, 98 L. Ed. 435 (1954) (\u201cdivorce . . . does not terminate the privilege for confidential marital communications\u201d); see also 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 85, p. 339 (\u201cabout one-half of the statutes codifying the [marital communications] privilege explicitly provide that it continues after death or divorce\u201d);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 5.35.4, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>330 (marital communications privilege continues after divorce and death of spouse). In other words, the privilege focuses on the marital relationship between the spouses <em>at the time that the communication was made, </em>and not at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">As we have noted, the marital communications privilege was founded upon the strong policy of preserving the marital relationship through the fostering of confidences between spouses. This policy applies with equal force to preserve <em>all </em>legally valid marriages, irrespective of marital difficulties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cIndeed, the reasons justifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the marital communications privilege\u2014encouraging] marital partners to share their most closely guarded secrets and thoughts, thus adding an additional measure of intimacy and mutual support to the marriage\u2014apply with equal force to married couples who, despite the appearance to outsiders of an irretrievably broken marriage, may still share hopes of reconciliation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blazek </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>177 Ariz. 535, 539-40, 869 P.2d 509 (App. 1994). We conclude, therefore, that the marital communications privilege applies to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Although the defendant\u2019s marriage may have been acrimonious at the time that he had made the communications to his wife, the marital communications privilege nonetheless was valid. Furthermore, because the focus is on the status of the marital relationship at the time of the communication, their marital status at the time of trial was immaterial. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s communications to his wife, made while the couple was living together as husband and wife, were subject to the marital communications privilege insofar as those communications were confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">We next focus our analysis on the question of whether the communications were confidential. The state contends that the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>motion in limine can be affirmed, nevertheless, because the marital communications were not confidential. Specifically, the state relies on the defendant\u2019s previous, similar statements to Vorih, Ruggerio and Ford. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We note, at the outset, that the determination of the second factor, that is, whether a communication was confidential, depends on the facts of the particular case. It is axiomatic that the marital communications privilege protects only those communications that are confidential.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Wolfle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 291 U.S. 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\u201cAlthough marital communications are presumed to be confidential, that presumption may be overcome by proof of facts showing that they were not intended to be private.\u201d <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 347 U.S. 6; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>384 A.2d 687, 691 (Me. 1978) (following \u201cthe near universal rule . . . that all marital communications are presumed to be confidential, and the party seeking to introduce the evidence must overcome the presumption\u201d [citations omitted]). The state, therefore, as the party seeking to introduce the marital communication into evidence, bears the burden of overcoming the presumption of confidentiality by proving that the communication between the defendant and his wife was not confidential. See <em>Blau </em>v. <em>United States, </em>340 U.S. 332, 333, 71 S. Ct. 301, 95 L. Ed. 170 (1951) (\u201c[M]adtal communications are presumptively confidential. . . . The Government made no effort to overcome the presumption.\u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>Commonwealth v. Hancharik, </em>534 Pa. 435, 442, 633 A.2d 1074 (1993) (\u201c[communications between husbands and wives are presumed to be confidential, and the party opposing application of the rule disqualifying such testimony bears the burden of overcoming this presumption\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Witchey, </em>388 N.W.2d 893, 895 (S.D. 1986) (\u201c[w]ith the introduction of evidence of private communications between spouses goes the burden of showing that either the nature of the communication or the circumstances under which it occurred render the communication not privileged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">We recognize that there is a split of authority concerning the test to be applied in determining whether a communication was confidential. Under the traditional view, a communication is confidential if the communicator, at the time of the communication, subjectively <em>intended </em>that the content of the communication not be disclosed to third parties or the public. See, e.g., <em>Hall </em>v. <em>State, </em>720 So. 2d 1043, 1047 (Ala. Crim. App. 1998); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Levi, </em>67 Haw. 247, 250, 686 P.2d 9 (1984); see also \u201cDevelopments in the Law\u2014Privileged Communications,\u201d 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1450, 1573 (1985) (\u201c \u2018[cjonfidentiality\u2019 usually requires that the communicator subjectively intend that the communication not be disclosed\u201d). Some jurisdictions, however, apply an objective test, wherein a communication is confidential if, at the time of the communication, the communicator could have had a <em>reasonable expectation of confidentiality. </em>See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Benner, </em>284 A.2d 91, 109 (Me. 1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>McMorrow, </em>314 N.W.2d 287, 289 (N.D. 1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>May, </em>540 Pa. 237, 250, 656 A.2d 1335 (1995). We think that the latter standard is the better approach, because it is consistent with our prior case law construing the distinct, but analogous, privilege for attorney-client communications. See <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>254 Conn. 145, 157, 757 A.2d 14 (2000) (\u201cstatements made in the presence of a third party are usually not privileged because there is then no reasonable expectation of confidentiality\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Accordingly, a marital communication is considered confidential if, at the time of the communication, the holder of the privilege had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Under either test, however, the party offering the marital communication usually can overcome the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>sumption of confidentiality through evidence that the communication had been made in the presence of a third party. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>92 F.3d 1313, 1331-32 (2d Cir. 1996) (evidence that third person had been in room with defendant and spouse overcame presumption of confidentiality), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1093, 117 S. Ct. 771, 136 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Levi, </em>supra, 67 Haw. 250 (defendant\u2019s statements to wife in presence of third parties not confidential); <em>State </em>v. <em>McMorrow, </em>supra, 314 N.W.2d 288-89 (marital communications not confidential when made while couple in car with third person). Even when no third party actually was present, the presumption of confidentiality may be rebutted by evidence that the communication was intended or expected to be disclosed to a third party or to the public. See, e.g., <em>In re Witness Before the Grand Jury, </em>791 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir. 1986) (communications concerning defendant\u2019s bank accounts, real estate transactions, credit cards, car registration, and payment of insurance premiums not confidential because defendant knew information was or would be disclosed to third parties or public); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCown, </em>711 F.2d 1441, 1452-53 (9th Cir. 1983) (check written by wife on husband\u2019s behalf overcame presumption that husband\u2019s instruction to wife to write check intended as confidential); <em>Grulkey v. United States, </em>394 F.2d 244, 246 (8th Cir. 1968) (husband\u2019s letters to wife not confidential wherein husband knew wife would need help reading them); <em>Yoder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>80 F.2d 665, 667-68 (10th Cir. 1935) (husband\u2019s note to wife not confidential when written on large cardboard and conspicuously posted); see also \u201cDevelopments in the Law\u2014Privileged Communications,\u201d supra, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1573 (\u201ceven if the communications were made in private, the presumption of confidentiality may be rebutted by showing that the communicant intended the statements to be disclosed to specific third parties or to the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>In the present case, the trial court made no determination as to whether the defendant\u2019s communications to his wife were confidential.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather than resolving the question of confidentiality, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe overriding factor\u201d in its decision to admit the testimony was \u201cthat at the time the statement was made, but most importantly now, at the time of trial, the marriage relationship exists in name only, de jure, we might say, but not de facto.\u201d Thus, the trial court did not conclude that the state had overcome the presumption of confidentiality, nor did it conclude that the communication was not confidential. Similarly, the state has not presented any persuasive reason on appeal that would lead us to conclude that the communication was not confidential, that is, that the defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality. Therefore, we do not agree with the state\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s decision to allow Joan Christian\u2019s testimony was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Our determination that the trial court improperly allowed Joan Christian to testify, however, does not end our inquiry. We also must decide whether the impropriety was harmful. \u201cWhen an improper evidentiary ruling is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. As we recently have noted, we have not been fully consistent in our articulation of the standard for establishing harm. . . . One line of cases states that the defendant must establish that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>the result. ... A second line of cases indicates that the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 667, 835 A.2d 895 (2003). For purposes of the present case, we need not choose between the two formulations or decide whether there is any functional difference between them because we conclude that the defendant has not satisfied his burden of proving harm under either formulation of the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The defendant claims that the admission of Joan Christian\u2019s testimony concerning the privileged communication was harmful because that testimony was \u201ccritical to the state\u2019s case.\u201d The defendant contends that it is more probable than not that the jury accorded greater weight to Joan Christian\u2019s testimony than to other testimony in the case. Specifically, the defendant points out that he had made his statements to Vorih, Ruggiero and Ford, indicating that he was the driver, when he was still \u201cconfused\u201d and intoxicated, and that those statements later were clarified by the testimony of Kirton that the defendant, upon arriving at the hospital, initially believed that he had been the passenger. The defendant\u2019s communications to Joan Christian, on the other hand, were made after his intoxication and confusion had receded. In addition, the defendant argues that testimony concerning marital communications frequently is accorded greater weight than other types of testimony. See, e.g., <em>Hall </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 720 So. 2d 1049 (\u201ca jury might reasonably be expected to accord substantial weight to ... a confession, in part because of the very fact that it was made privately by a husband to his wife\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The state contends, in response, that the defendant cannot meet his burden. Specifically, the state argues that \u201cit is unlikely that the jury placed much reliance\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>upon the privileged testimony because Joan Christian admitted on cross-examination that she and the defendant were getting divorced, that they were involved in a contentious custody dispute and that their relationship was poor. In addition, the state points out that Joan Christian\u2019s testimony was cumulative to the testimony of Vorih, Ruggerio and Ford concerning the defendant\u2019s similar statements to them that he was the driver. Finally, the state points to the \u201coverwhelming\u201d physical evidence establishing that the defendant was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We agree with the state that the admission of the privileged testimony constituted harmless error. As the state correctly points out, Joan Christian\u2019s testimony that the defendant had admitted to operating the vehicle is merely cumulative of the testimony of Vorih, Ruggiero and Ford regarding the defendant\u2019s similar admission. \u201cIt is well established that if erroneously admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other evidence presented in the case, its admission does not constitute reversible error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>250 Conn. 611, 639, 737 A.2d 404 (1999), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>529 U.S. 1060, 120 S. Ct. 1568, 146 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2000). Moreover, although the defendant presented some evidence that he was not the driver, the state presented an abundance of evidence to support a finding that the defendant had indeed been the driver. Specifically, Wilson testified that she heard amale voice coming from aperson sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, behind the steering wheel. Bourque testified that, when he arrived at the scene of the accident, the victim \u201cwas in the passenger seat with her buttocks fully in the seat.\u201d Bourque also testified that, based upon his reenactment of the accident, he had determined that a woman of the victim\u2019s height and weight could not have moved from the driver\u2019s seat into the passenger\u2019s seat. The state also presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Kwasnoski, who testified that, under the circumstances of the accident, the \u201cnatural tendency\u201d would have been for the occupants of the car to move \u201cvery much forward and slightly to the right . . . .\u201d Finally, the state presented evidence that the injuries to the defendant\u2019s left clavicle were consistent with those that might be caused to a driver by a restraining device, such as the driver\u2019s side seat belt. In light of the volume of evidence presented by the state indicating that the defendant had been driving at the time of the accident, we cannot say \u25a0in the present case that it was more probable than not that the erroneously admitted privileged testimony affected the jury\u2019s verdict, nor can we say that any prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict. Accordingly, we conclude that the improper admission of the privileged testimony constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly precluded Victoria Bobryk from testifying with regard to a conversation that she had overheard between Joan Christian and her attorney. Specifically, the defendant claims that Bobryk\u2019s testimony concerned the effect that the defendant\u2019s conviction would have had on Joan Christian\u2019s claim for custody of the couple\u2019s child, and was therefore relevant impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. As we previously have discussed, Joan Christian testified at trial that the defendant had told her that he had been driving the vehicle at the time of the accident. See part I of this opinion. On cross-examination, the defendant questioned her concerning her truthfulness in a prior, unrelated criminal proceeding in Connecticut Superior Court, wherein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Joan Christian herself had been charged with driving under the influence. Specifically, the defendant asked her if she had told the court in that proceeding that she had no prior convictions and never had participated in an alcohol education program, despite the fact that she had an earlier conviction for driving under the influence in Massachusetts and had participated in that state\u2019s alcohol education program. Joan Christian admitted that she had not been entirely truthful in that proceeding, but explained that she had thought that the court\u2019s questions in that proceeding pertained solely to convictions in Connecticut and the Connecticut alcohol education program.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In connection with questions regarding her marriage to the defendant, Joan Christian testified that the defendant had abandoned her and their young son in October, 2000, and that she thereafter had moved with the son to Massachusetts. Upon further cross-examination, she testified that she had initiated court proceedings in Massachusetts regarding the defendant\u2019s visitation rights with their son, and that in the court file for those proceedings she had enclosed newspaper articles concerning the charges against the defendant in the present case. Joan Christian further testified that the defendant had initiated divorce and child custody proceedings in Connecticut in February or March, 2001. She admitted that, in a discussion with the defendant concerning those proceedings, she had told him that she had been \u201ckeeping up\u201d with the status of the present case. She further admitted that she had contacted the state\u2019s attorney and had given a statement to the Suffield police department concerning the present case. Joan Christian acknowledged that her divorce and child custody proceedings against the defendant were \u201chotly contested,\u201d and that her conflicts with him had escalated over time. She also admitted that she was not \u201ctoo happy\u201d with the fact that the defendant had left her without paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>their bills, although she had given him money for that purpose. Nonetheless, she stated that she was not angry with him, and that she was testifying against him in the present case because it was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, the defendant questioned Joan Christian regarding a conversation she had with her attorney in the Enfield courthouse in May, 2001. Specifically, the defendant asked her if she recalled having had a conversation with her attorney, who had represented her in both the driving under the influence proceeding and the divorce and child custody proceedings, while they were in a small vestibule of the Enfield courthouse following the pretrial conference in the driving under the influence proceeding. Joan Christian testified that she did not remember that particular conversation. The defendant then asked her if she recalled discussing with her attorney the effect that the defendant\u2019s conviction in the present case might have on the divorce and child custody proceedings, and she testified that she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">After the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant attempted to have Bobiyk testify. In making this proffer, he explained that Bobryk, a former legal intern for the defendant\u2019s attorney in the present case, had gone to the Enfield courthouse, at the attorney\u2019s direction, to observe Joan Christian in her driving under the influence proceeding. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s attorney had told Bobryk \u201cto make a note of\u2019 whether Joan Christian was driving a car when she left the proceeding, because \u201cthese were things that were deemed to be relevant in the divorce litigation.\u201d After the proceeding, Bobryk waited in the small vestibule of the courthouse to attempt to see if Joan Christian left the courthouse driving a vehicle. At this point, Joan Christian purportedly entered the vestibule with her attorney and discussed with him the impact that the defendant\u2019s conviction in the present case would have on the divorce proceeding. In particular, it was acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>that, if the defendant was convicted in the present case, \u201cthere would be no further question about him . . . getting custody of their child.\u201d Joan Christian\u2019s attorney purportedly asked her about the status of the defendant\u2019s criminal proceeding, and she told him that she did not know. She and her attorney then went to the clerk\u2019s office to check on the status.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The state objected to the admission of Bobryk\u2019s testimony on grounds that its admission would violate the evidentiary rule against impeaching a witness based on extrinsic evidence concerning a collateral matter, and because Joan Christian\u2019s communications with her attorney were protected by the attorney-client privilege. The defendant argued, in response, that Bobryk\u2019s testimony was not extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter, because Joan Christian\u2019s \u201cefforts to use [the present case] to bolster her [child] custody and divorce litigation\u201d were relevant to her credibility as a witness in the present case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection and excluded the proffered testimony \u201cfor two essential reasons. One is I believe it is collateral. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way you could characterize the evidence that . . . Bobryk would offer here as material to, or even relevant, to any of the issues raised by this case. Secondly ... I believe [that] . . . under the peculiar circumstances of this encounter as set forth in the defendant\u2019s offer of proof, it would appear to me to be a really egregious eavesdropping on the part of an agent of the defense attorney here. . . . And, I think it would be just absolutely violative of any kind of policy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>we can hope to have which keeps attorney-client privileges\u2014attorney-client confidentiality sacrosanct.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we briefly set forth the standard of review. \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>232 Conn. 740, 746-47, 657 A.2d 611 (1995). Furthermore, [t]o establish an abuse of discretion, [the defendant] must show that the restrictions imposed upon [the] cross-examination were clearly prejudicial. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 426, 493 A.2d 223 (1985). The proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 747. When the trial court excludes defense evidence that provides the defendant with a basis for cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses, however, such exclusion may give rise to a claim of denial of the right to confrontation and to present a defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>260 Conn. 339, 350-51, 796 A.2d 1118 (2002). When defense counsel is permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which it appropriately can draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness, those constitutional rights have been satisfied. <em>State v. Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 509, 438 A.2d 749 (1980). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>With these principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly ruled that the proffered testimony was inadmissible extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter. The defendant contends that Bobryk\u2019s testimony was relevant and material to the merits of the case, because \u201c[Joan] Christian\u2019s bias or motive went to the very core of her testimony . . . .\u201d The state asserts, in response, that the testimony properly was excluded because \u201cthe jury had sufficient evidence from which to assess Joan Christian\u2019s bias and motivation for testifying against the defendant. Permitting the additional testimony proffered by Bobryk would have unnecessarily complicated the case and unduly distracted the jury\u2019s attention from the principal issues before them.\u201d We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">\u201c[C]ross-examination is the principal means by which the credibility of witnesses and the truth of their testimony is tested. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>229 Conn. 60, 69, 640 A. 2d 553 (1994). Although only relevant evidence may be elicited through cross-examination; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 562, 643 A.2d 854 (1994); [e]vidence tending to show motive, bias or interest of an important witness is never collateral or irrelevant. [Indeed, it] may be . . . the very key to an intelligent appraisal of the testimony of the [witness]. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 248, 630 A.2d 577 (1993) [on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996)]. Accordingly, cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show that a witness\u2019 testimony was motivated by bias may not be unduly restricted. Id., 249; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>228 Conn. 118, 123, 635 A.2d 762 (1993). Bias may consist of a friendly feeling or of hostility. It may be shown in a variety of ways. <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 719, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 58, 671 A.2d 323 (1996); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-5 (\u201c[t]he credibility of a witness may be impeached by evidence showing bias for, prejudice against, or interest in any person or matter that might cause the witness to testify falsely\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In the present case, it is clear that Joan Christian was an important witness for the state. Consequently, evidence of any motive, bias or interest that may have impacted the credibility of her testimony cannot be characterized as collateral or irrelevant. The proffered testimony bore directly on the issue of her motive, bias or interest, in that, had it been heard and credited by the jury, the jury could have inferred that Joan Christian would benefit from the defendant\u2019s conviction by virtue of its effect on her civil proceedings against him for divorce and custody of their child. Therefore, the testimony improperly was excluded as collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Furthermore, the trial court improperly determined that admission of Bobryk\u2019s testimony would have violated the attorney-client privilege held by Joan Christian. We previously have stated that, \u201c[c]ommunications between client and attorney are privileged when made in confidence for the purpose of seeking legal advice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>Kimber Mfg., Inc., </em>supra, 265 Conn. 10. \u201cBy contrast, statements made in the presence of a third party are usually not privileged because there is then no reasonable expectation of confidentiality.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cascone, </em>195 Conn. 183, 186, 487 A.2d 186 (1985). The only recognized exceptions to this rule are when the third party was an interpreter, clerk or agent of <em>the client\u2019s </em>attorney; see <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp., </em>supra, 254 Conn. 158; which Bobryk clearly was not. At oral argument before this court, the state conceded that, because the communication had been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>in the presence of a third party, it was not protected by the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, because the communication at issue was made in her presence, Bobryk should have been allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In light of our conclusion that Bobryk\u2019s testimony improperly was excluded, we next must consider whether that impropriety violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, or whether the error was merely evidentiary in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">We already have concluded that Bobyrk\u2019s testimony was relevant impeachment evidence and that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of that testimony improperly denied the defendant meaningful access into a legitimate area of inquiry. Whether that impropriety violated the constitutional protection of the confrontation clause depends, however, upon a variety of factors. \u201c[W]e consider the nature of the excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>260 Conn. 813, 828, 801 A.2d 718 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">We begin by noting that the defendant effectively cross-examined Joan Christian, during which time he was able to extract several admissions concerning her interest in the outcome of the litigation in the present case. For example, the defendant questioned her regarding the pending divorce and child custody proceedings. Joan Christian acknowledged that those proceedings were \u201chotly contested . . . .\u201d She admitted that, in a discussion with the defendant concerning those proceedings, she had told him that she had been \u201ckeeping up\u201d with the status of the present case. She also admitted that she had contacted the state\u2019s attorney and had given a statement to the Suffield police department concerning the present case. In addition, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>cross-examined Joan Christian regarding her bias against him. Specifically, she testified that the defendant had abandoned her and their young son, and admitted that she was not \u201ctoo happy\u201d with the fact that he had left her without paying their bills. Finally, she acknowledged that her conflicts with the defendant had \u201cescalated over time.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant exposed numerous facts from which the jury could have concluded that Joan Christian\u2019s testimony was tainted by motive, bias or interest, and, therefore, was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Under all of the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the constitutional standard of confrontation had been met, and, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s improper exclusion of Bobryk\u2019s testimony was merely an evidentiary impropriety. \u201c[I]n order to prevail on appeal, the defendant must show that the restrictions imposed by the trial court were harmful. ... In order to do so, the defendant must establish that the impropriety was so prejudicial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 830. We conclude that the defendant has not satisfied this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The defendant, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 253-54, contends that the impropriety was harmful because it had a tendency to influence the decision of the jury. In <em>Colton, </em>we concluded that the trial court improperly had excluded evidence that a chief witness for the state had abused illegal drugs and engaged in prostitution, because it was relevant to that witness\u2019 interest in receiving a monetary award for testifying against the defendant. Id., 251-52. We further concluded that the impropriety constituted reversible error. Specifically, we stated: \u201cThe importance of [the witness\u2019] testimony to the state\u2019s case against the defendant cannot be underestimated. The state conceded in its closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>argument to the jury that it would have to credit [the witness\u2019] testimony to convict the defendant. . . . The exclusion of evidence bearing on the motivation of a chief witness for the state, particularly when no other evidence corroborated material aspects of the witness\u2019 testimony, is harmful error.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 254. In the present case, by contrast,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as we already have stated, Joan Christian\u2019s testimony concerning the material issue of whether the defendant had been driving at the time of the accident was cumulative of the testimony of three other witnesses. See part I of this opinion. Moreover, the state presented a substantial amount of physical evidence, in addition to the testimony of these witnesses, indicating that the defendant had been the driver. See id. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidentiary impropriety of the trial court was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded from evidence the emergency medical \u201crun sheets\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> prepared by Ruggiero and Ford. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to admit the run sheets either as prior inconsistent statements or under the business records exception to the hearsay rule and, therefore, denied him his constitutional right to present evidence that he was confused and disoriented when he made the incriminating statements to Ruggiero and Ford in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Ruggiero testified on direct examination that she had arrived at the accident scene at approximately 12:55 a.m. on March 18,2000. At the scene, she made a physical assessment of the defendant, during which she asked him questions concerning the accident. Specifically, Ruggiero asked him if he had been driving and wearing his seat belt, and he answered both questions in the affirmative. The defendant appeared coherent when he answered these questions. During the ambulance ride to the hospital, however, the defendant wavered \u201cbetween coherent and confused.\u201d Ruggiero marked the box labeled \u201cconfused\u201d on her run sheet, but she explained that she had done so because \u201cat times, he wasn\u2019t really cooperative with answering.\u201d Nonetheless, she asked the defendant several times whether he had been driving and wearing a seat belt, and each time the defendant responded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">On cross-examination, the defendant questioned Ruggiero about why she had marked the box labeled \u201cconfused\u201d on the run sheet, and not the box labeled \u201coriented.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> She explained: \u201cHe was oriented to person, place, and time, which is what we go by. He knew where he was, he knew his name, and he knew what time it was. The reason why I checked confused was because he did not remember the accident, the actual impact.\u201d Ruggiero further explained that, in her assessment, \u201che was confused at [the] time.\u201d On recross-examination, Ruggiero again acknowledged that the run sheet stated that the defendant had been \u201cconfused,\u201d and not \u201coriented,\u201d after the accident. Ford testified, on direct examination by the state, that the defendant \u201cwas con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>fused at times,\u201d but that he was able to answer most of her questions. She asked the defendant, several times, if he had been driving at the time of the accident. Each time, he responded affirmatively. Ford testified that the defendant did not appear to be confused when he told her that he had been driving. On cross-examination, Ford acknowledged that she had marked the box labeled \u201cconfused\u201d on the run sheet, and had not marked the box labeled \u201coriented.\u201d She also acknowledged that \u201cthere was some confusion,\u201d and that the defendant \u201cwas not totally oriented . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">After the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant offered Ruggiero\u2019s and Ford\u2019s run sheets into evidence, as either prior inconsistent statements or under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Specifically, the defendant argued that, because the run sheets \u201cstate that the defendant was confused and that he was not oriented\u201d and \u201cthe testimony contradicted that,\u201d they were admissible under \u00a7 6-10 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> as prior inconsistent statements used to impeach the credibility of the witness. The defendant further argued that the run sheets were admissible for <em>substantive </em>purposes under <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). Finally, the defendant argued that the run sheets were admissible as business records, because Ruggiero and Ford had reduced their prior statements into written reports on the date of the accident, as they had been obligated to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The trial court determined that the run sheets were inadmissible extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. Specifically, the court determined that the statements on the run sheets were not inconsistent with the statements made at trial because Ruggiero and Ford had admitted making those statements on the run sheets. Therefore, the court concluded that the statements were inadmissible for both purposes of impeachment and as substantive evidence. The court did not make a determination concerning whether the run sheets were business records; during oral argument, however, in response to the defendant\u2019s assertion that the run sheets were admissible as \u201cbusiness record[s] of . . . prior statements],\u201d the trial court stated that \u201c[i]f the witness admits to making the statement, extrinsic evidence of the statement is inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly precluded the run sheets as prior inconsistent statements for the purpose of impeaching witnesses and as substantive evidence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant contends that the prior statements included in the run sheets, stating that the defendant had been confused and not oriented, were inconsistent with the in-court testimony of both Ruggerio and Ford stating that the defendant had been coherent. The state contends, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>response, that there was no substantial inconsistency between the in-court testimony and the statements on the run sheets because Ruggerio and Ford both acknowledged having stated, on their run sheets, that the defendant was confused and not oriented. Therefore, the introduction of the run sheets would have been cumulative evidence. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-10 (c) (\u201c[i]f a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness is shown to or if the contents of the statement are disclosed to the witness at the time the witness testifies, and if the witness admits to making the statement, extrinsic evidence of the statement is inadmissible, except in the discretion of the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\u201cIn deciding whether the statement is admissible, the trial court must review it in light of the witness\u2019 entire testimony to determine whether it is, in fact, inconsistent with that testimony; <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>214 Conn. 752, 764, 574 A.2d 182 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>[supra, 200 Conn. 748 n.4]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 710, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979); and, if so, whether such inconsistency is substantial and relate [s] to a material matter. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra, 763-64. Such a determination as to inconsistency lies within the discretionary authority of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bova, </em>240 Conn. 210, 227, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997). As the trial court correctly determined, both witnesses admitted, in their testimony, to their prior statements on the run sheets. Therefore, the run sheets were not inconsistent with the testimony elicited at trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding the run sheets as prior inconsistent statements for the purpose of impeaching the witnesses and as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly precluded the run sheets under the business record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>exception to the hearsay rule. Specifically, the defendant claims that the run sheets are business records because they \u201care made in the regular course of the business of [ambulance] companies\u201d and emergency medical technicians have \u201ca duty to write the run sheets contemporaneously with the ambulance user.\u201d He further contends that the run sheets were admissible, as business records, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-180,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> because they were relevant to the material issue of whether the defendant was coherent when he told Ruggiero and Ford that he had been driving at the time of the accident. The state contends, in response, that the defendant has not established that the run sheets were business records in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 52-180 (a). The state also contends that any error in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was harmless because the proffered evidence would have been cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\u201cSection 52-180 sets forth an exception to the evidentiary rule otherwise barring admission of hearsay evidence for business records that satisfy express criteria. <em>Calcano </em>v. <em>Calcano, </em>257 Conn. 230, 240, 777 A.2d 633 (2001); <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp., </em>246 Conn. 594, 600, 717 A.2d 713 (1998); see also Conn. CodeEvid. \u00a7 8-4 (incorporating \u00a7 52-180). Section 52-180 (a) provides that a record of an act, transaction, occurrence or event is admissible as evidence of that act, transaction, occurrence, or event, provided that the record was made in the regular course of business. <em>Pagano </em>v. <em>Ippoliti, </em>245 Conn. 640, 650-51, 716 A.2d 848 (1998). The rationale for the exception derives from the inherent trustworthiness of records on which busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>nesses rely to conduct their daily affairs. <em>Calcano </em>v. <em>Calcano, </em>supra, 240-41 (\u00a7 52-180 recognizes the inherent trustworthiness of documents created for business rather than litigation purposes); <em>Bell Food Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sherbacow, </em>217 Conn. 476, 486, 586 A.2d 1157 (1991) (fact that the business relies on such records tends to establish their trustworthiness); see generally <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty </em>Corp., supra, 600-601 (setting forth development of rule).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirsch, </em>263 Conn. 390, 400, 820 A.2d 236 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\u201cTo be admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule, a trial court judge must find that the record satisfies each of the three conditions set forth in ... \u00a7 52-180. The court must determine, before concluding that it is admissible, that the record was made in the regular course of business, that it was the regular course of such business to make such a record, and that it was made at the time of the act described in the report, or within a reasonable time thereafter. ... In applying the business records exception, the statute [\u00a7 52-180] should be liberally interpreted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Calcano </em>v. <em>Calcano, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">We need not decide whether the trial court\u2019s failure to admit the run sheets into evidence under \u00a7 52-180 was improper because, even if it was, the impropriety was harmless.

Although, with respect to the confidential nature of the communication, I think that may be questioned in view of the evidence that we have heard, that the defendant essentially made the same inculpatory statement to other people before he made the statement to his wife.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> The defendant did not argue, at this time, that Bobiyk\u2019s testimony would not violate the attorney-client privilege. In a previous discussion regarding Joan Christian\u2019s conversation with her attorney at the Enfield courthouse, however, the defendant argued that the attorney-client privilege would not apply if \u201cshe knew that there was a third party present.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\"> The trial court also stated: \u201cNow, I\u2019m not suggesting in the slightest, not one iota, that [the defendant\u2019s attorney] suggested that . . . Bobryk go and try to overhear the conversation of an opposing party which was being held, they thought, in confidence with her attorney. But that, nevertheless, would be the result that we\u2019d have. We\u2019d essentially have an agent of . . . the attorney for one party surreptitiously positioning herself so that she could [overhear] a conversation between the opposing party and that person\u2019s attorney.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\"> We note, moreover, that the impropriety in <em>Colton </em>was constitutional in nature, and therefore, in that case <em>the state, </em>and not the defendant, had the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\"> The defendant, in his brief to this court, defines a \u201crun sheet\u201d as \u201cthe medical record of the injury, condition and treatment of the patient. It is completed by the [emergency medical technician] as part of the record of the ambulance company.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> The ran sheets filled out by Ruggiero and Ford contained a section entitled, \u201cVerbal Response,\u201d which included checkboxes for the following five options: (1) \u201cNone\u201d; (2) \u201cIncomplete Sounds\u201d or \u201cIncomplete Words\u201d; (3) \u201cInappropriate Words\u201d; (4) \u201cConfused\u201d; and (5) \u201cOriented.\u201d Ruggiero and Ford both placed a mark in the box labeled \u201cConfused,\u201d and left the other boxes blank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\"> Section 6-10 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u201c(a) Prior inconsistent statements generally. The credibility of a witness may be impeached by evidence of a prior inconsistent statement made by the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">\u201c(b) Examining witness concerning prior inconsistent statement. In examining a witness concerning a prior inconsistent statement, whether written or not, made by the witness, the statement should be shown to or the contents of the statement disclosed to the witness at that <em>time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">\u201c(c) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement of witness. If a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness is shown to or if the contents of the statement are disclosed to the witness at the time the witness testifies, and if the witness admits to making the statement, extrinsic evidence of the statement is inadmissible, except in the discretion of the court. If a prior inconsistent statement made by a witness is not shown to or if the contents of the statement are not disclosed to the witness at the time the witness testifies, extrinsic evidence of the statement is inadmissible, except in the discretion of the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\"> Although the defendant, in his brief to this court, addressed the usage of prior inconsistent statements for impeachment purposes and substantive evidence as separate issues, we analyze them together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b775-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (a) provides: \u201cAny writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, shall be admissible as evidence of the act, transaction, occurrence or event, if the trial judge finds that it was made in the regular course of any business, and that it was the regular course of the business to make the writing or record at the time of the act, transaction, occurrence or event or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
