On appeal, the plaintiff, the secretary of the office of policy and management, contends that, contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) require him to: (1) treat each personal leave day and holiday as representing eight hours of leave time in accordance with the standard workday; (2) award the defendant eight hours of credit toward her ten hour workday for each such personal leave day and holiday; and (3) deduct two hours from the defendant\u2019s vacation account to make up for the difference in horns between her workday and the eight hours of leave time to which the plaintiff claims the defendant statutorily is limited for each personal leave day and holiday. We reject the plaintiffs claim and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The record reflects the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The defendant has been employed by the department of correction (department) since August, 1988. Since May, 1994, she has held the position of lieutenant. When the defendant first was appointed a lieutenant, the department assigned her to work an eight and one-half hour day, with four days on and two days off, repeating every six weeks. In October, 2000, the department changed her schedule to a ten hour workday.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Throughout her employment as a lieutenant, the defendant\u2019s weekly schedule has averaged forty hours per week over a six or eight week period.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">On March 13, 2000, the defendant filed a grievance with the personnel division of the department of administrative services (administrative services) claiming, inter aha, that, relying on the standard eight hour workday for state employees, the department improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>was treating each of her personal leave days and holidays as representing eight hours of leave time and then deducting from the defendant\u2019s vacation account the difference between the number of hours in her nonstandard workday and the eight hours of credit to which the department claimed she was entitled for each such personal leave day and holiday.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant contended that this practice violated \u00a7 5-250 (c) and that she was entitled to have each personal leave day and holiday credited against her nonstandard workday on a day-for-day basis. She therefore sought restoration to her vacation account of all the time that the department had deducted from that account in connection with her use of personal leave and holiday time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On April 19, 2000, administrative services denied the defendant\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Thereafter, the defendant appealed from the denial of her grievance to the employees\u2019 review board (board). After a hearing, the board concluded that the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ment\u2019s practice violated \u00a7 5-250 (c). Specifically, the board determined that the practice deprived the defendant of vacation time to which she was entitled because \u00a7 5-250 (c) does not reflect an intent by the legislature to penalize in such a manner employees whose workdays exceed the standard eight hours. Accordingly, the board ordered the department to: (1) grant the defendant three full calendar days of personal leave annually and credit her vacation account for any time that had been deducted from that account because of her use of personal leave days; and (2) make similar adjustments to the defendant\u2019s vacation account for any hours debited from that account in connection with her use of holiday leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The plaintiff then appealed from the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court issued its decision dismissing the plaintiffs administrative appeal, concluding that the terms \u201c \u2018day\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018holiday\u2019 \u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), respectively, represent an entire \u201c \u2018calendar day,\u2019 \u201d rather than eight hours. Thus, the trial court determined that the department statutorily is. required to apply each of the defendant\u2019s personal days and holidays against her nonstandard workday <em>on a day-for-day basis, </em>thereby barring any deduction from the defendant\u2019s vacation account because of her use of personal and holiday leave. The court also ordered the plaintiff to restore any time that had been deducted from her vacation account in connection with her use of leave pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a). This appeal by the plaintiff followed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant is entitled to personal leave days and holidays on the basis other nonstandard workday, rather than the standard eight hour day. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that construing \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) to award leave on the basis of the standard eight hour workday is consistent with other statutory provisions addressing irregular work schedules. The plaintiff further contends that the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) gives rise to inequitable and irrational results, in particular, bestowing on employees working a nonstandard workday a windfall of additional leave time as compared to similarly situated employees working a standard eight hour day. Therefore, according to the plaintiff, the only reasonable interpretation of the terms \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d is an eight hour day.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The defendant, on the other hand, contends that equating personal leave days and holidays with the standard eight hour workday is incompatible with the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the pertinent statutory language and history. She further contends that employees working nonstandard workdays would receive disparate treatment under the interpretation urged by the plaintiff because they would have less vacation time available to them than employees who work a standard eight hour day. Therefore, the defendant contends, the trial court properly construed \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d to mean a \u201ccalendar day.\u201d We agree with the trial court that \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) require the plaintiff to apply the defendant\u2019s personal days and holidays on the basis of her nonstandard workday, without any deduction from the defendant\u2019s bank of vacation leave to account for the difference in hours between her workday and the standard eight hour workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We begin by setting forth the well established standard that governs our review of an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>agency\u2019s decision. \u201c[A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>261 Conn. 1, 13, 803 A.2d 879 (2002). In the present case, there is no claim that the relevant statutory provisions previously have been subjected to judicial scrutiny or to a time-tested interpretation by the board. We, therefore, accord no deference to the board\u2019s interpretation of those provisions. As a result, our review is plenary because the plaintiffs claim involves a question of statutory construction. See, e.g., <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>264 Conn. 498, 506, 823 A.2d 1208 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>With these principles in mind, we turn to the merits of the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">As with all issues of statutory construction, we begin with the pertinent statutory language. General Statutes \u00a7 5-250 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn addition to annual vacation, each appointing authority shall grant to each full-time permanent employee in the state service <em>three days of personal leave of absence with pay </em>in each calendar year. Personal leave of absence shall be for the purpose of conducting private affairs, including observance of religious holidays, and shall not be deducted from vacation or sick leave credits. . . (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 5-254 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[e]ach full-time permanent employee in the state service shall be granted <em>time off with pay for any legal holiday. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As a preliminary matter, we reiterate that neither party contends that our construction of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) should differ on the basis of any purported distinction between a \u201cday\u201d of personal leave and a \u201choliday.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, as we discuss at greater length later in this opinion, the language of the two provisions and their legislative history reflect an interrelated purpose of providing time for the observance of certain holidays, including religious holidays.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 5-250 (c) (\u201c[p]ersonal leave of absence <em>shall be for the purpose of </em>conducting private affairs, including <em>obser</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>vanee of religious </em>holidays\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 5-254 (a) (providing for time off with pay for legal holidays, including certain religious holidays).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, for purposes of this appeal, we construe \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) similarly with respect to the leave time granted therein. See <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131, 157, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002) (courts under duty, when reasonably possible, to construe related statutes harmoniously).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">When one considers the statutory language, of particular significance is the phrase in \u00a7 5-250 (c) providing that, \u201c[p]ersonai leave of absence . . . <em>shall not be deducted from vacation or sick leave credits. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) If the legislature intended that a \u201cday\u201d of personal leave means a calendar day, then the practice of deducting two hours of vacation time for every personal day the defendant takes\u2014solely because her ten hour workday exceeds the standard eight hour workday\u2014directly contravenes that statutory mandate. If, on the other hand, as the plaintiff contends, the legislature intended that a \u201cday\u201d of personal leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>means a standard eight hour day, then the challenged practice does not violate \u00a7 5-250 (c). We turn, therefore, to the meaning of the terms \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We first note that those terms are not defined in either \u00a7 5-250, \u00a7 5-254 or elsewhere in the State Personnel Act, General Statutes \u00a7 5-193 et seq. In the absence of a statutory definition, words and phrases in a statute are to be construed according to their common usage. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. Sandoval, 263 Conn. 524, 552, 821 A.2d 247 (2003). The dictionary defines \u201choliday\u201d as: \u201ca <em>day </em>on which one is exempt from one\u2019s usual labor or vocational activity . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. A \u201cday\u201d is defined as: \u201cthe time of light or interval between one night and the next [or] . . . the period of the earth\u2019s rotation on its axis ordinarily divided into 24 hours . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Consistent with these definitions, courts generally have construed the word \u201cday,\u201d when left unqualified, to mean a calendar- day. See, e.g., <em>The Pocket Veto Case, </em>279 U.S. 655, 679, 49 S. Ct. 463, 73 L. Ed. 894 (1929) (\u201c[t]he word \u2018days\u2019 when not qualified, means in ordinary and common usage calendar days\u201d); <em>Booker </em>v. <em>Chief Engineer of the Fire Dept. of Woburn, </em>324 Mass. 264, 266, 85 N.E.2d 766 (1949) (\u201cthe word \u2018day\u2019 means a calendar day\u201d); <em>Kuznitsky </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>381 Ill. 182, 186, 44 N.E.2d 893 (1942) (\u201cif the legislature had contemplated or intended any other or different day than the ordinary calendar day when they speak of \u2018portion of a day\u2019 they would have said so by appropriate lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>guage\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c[A] calendar day is the space of time that elapses between two successive midnights.\u201d <em>Booker </em>v. <em>Chief Engineer of the Fire Dept. of Woburn, </em>supra, 266; accord <em>Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crown High Corp., </em>165 Conn. 608, 611-12, 345 A.2d 1 (1973) (noting that, \u201c[b]y statute, New York has provided that \u2018[a] calendar day includes the time from midnight to midnight\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, administrative services defines the \u201ccustomary work day\u201d as lasting \u201cfrom 12:01 a.m. to 12:01 a.m. the following day . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 5-238-4. Therefore, the fact that the legislature did not qualify the term \u201cday\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 5-250 (c) suggests that a \u201cday\u201d of personal leave represents an entire twenty-four hour period for which a state employee elects not to work but, nonetheless, is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">When seeking to ascertain the proper construction of the words \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d as those terms are used in \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), respectively, we also look to the legislative purpose underlying those statutory subsections. As noted previously, \u00a7 5-250 (c) expressly provides that \u201c[p]ersonal leave of absence shall be <em>for the purpose of </em>conducting private affairs, including <em>observance of religious holidays </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The grant of a day of leave for such a purpose suggests a full calendar day off from work because, as a general matter, the observance of a religious holiday requires the entire day, not just a portion of that day. Similarly, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature, in granting paid leave for legal holidays, intended to exempt state employees from their usual duties for a full calendar day. See <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>255 Conn. 693, 700, 768 A.2d 433 (2001) (\u201c[c]ertainly when the legislature declares a day to be a holiday, it means at least to free public officers from the obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of keeping open their offices or attending to their duties on that day\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Thus, on the basis of the language and purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), we are persuaded that the legislature\u2019s use of the terms \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d in those provisions reflects its intent that employees shall be compensated for leave commensurate with their scheduled hours during the calendar day. Indeed, there is nothing in the related statutory scheme or legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) or 5-254 (a) to suggest a contrary intent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The plaintiffs reliance on other statutory provisions related to irregular work schedules and average work weeks as indicating the legislature\u2019s intentthat \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d mean a standard eight hour day is misplaced. The plaintiff first cites to General Statutes \u00a7 5-238,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>which permits the commissioner of administrative services to designate a position as \u201cunscheduled\u201d when its work requirements cannot be met by a standard schedule, provided that, \u201cover a period of not more than eight weeks, no employee serving in a position designated as unscheduled shall <em>average </em>more than five workdays and [forty] hours per week per period.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff contends that, because \u00a7 5-238 permits the averaging of such irregular schedules based on the standard <em>work week, </em>which in turn translates to five standard eight hour <em>workdays, </em>\u00a7 5-238 evinces a legislative intent that employees working irregular hours and standard hours be treated the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Along a similar vein, the plaintiff cites to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-245 and 5-246,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which address overtime and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>equivalent time off with pay for hours worked in addition to the \u201caverage\u201d forty hour work week for certain state employees. The crux of the plaintiffs argument is that, because both of these provisions require that employees working irregular schedules be compensated on the basis of an \u201caverage\u201d workweek, the legislature similarly intended that, for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 and 5-254, employees working irregular, or nonstandard, daily schedules be treated the same as employees working a standard eight hour day.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We fail to see the correlation that the plaintiff seeks to draw between \u00a7\u00a7 5-238, 5-245 and 5-246 and the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>presented by this case. The focus of each of those statutory sections is a standard forty hour <em>work week; </em>there is no indication that a standard workday has any particular significance insofar as those statutory provisions are concerned. Moreover, there is nothing in those provisions that suggests any relationship to the use and calculation of personal leave days and holidays under \u00a7 \u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a). We are not persuaded, therefore, that \u00a7\u00a7 5-238, 5-245 and 5-246 have any bearing on whether the legislature intended personal leave days and holidays to be credited on the basis of a calendar day or an eight hour day.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">As the plaintiff contends, the State Personnel Act does evince the legislature\u2019s intent that similarly situated employees be treated equally, whenever reasonably possible. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-194 (\u201c[t]his chapter shall be so construed and administered as to provide a uniform and equitable system of personnel administration of employees in the state service\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 5-238 (\u201cThe Commissioner of Administrative Services shall issue regulations for establishing and maintaining uniform and equitable hours of work required of all employees in the Executive Department .... The number of hours any employee shall be required to be on duty each day or in any week or month shall be uniform for all whose positions are allocated to the same class . . . .\u201d). The plaintiff maintains that the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) is contrary to this legislative goal. In particular, the plaintiff underscores the fact that, whenever the defendant uses a personal leave day or takes holiday leave, she is relieved of <em>ten hours of work </em>as a result of her nonstandard workday, whereas her similarly situated colleague working a standard day is relieved only of <em>eight hours of work. </em>Consequently, by the end of the year, the defendant will have worked as many as thirty fewer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>hours than her colleague,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> without any commensurate reduction in the defendant\u2019s pay.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that this is a \u201cbizarre\u201d and inequitable result that counsels against our adoption of the trial court\u2019s construction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">We are mindful, however, that inequities also would result if we were to adopt the plaintiffs construction of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a). For example, pursuant to \u00a7 5-250 (a),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a full-time permanent employee who has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>worked a full calendar year is entitled to \u201can annual vacation with pay of twenty-one consecutive calendar days or its equivalent. ...\u201d For a person working a standard forty hour week, these twenty-one consecutive calendar days represent three work weeks, or 120 hours, of paid vacation time. Under the current practice, and applying the construction advocated by the plaintiff, two hours are deducted from the defendant\u2019s vacation account for each personal leave day that she takes and for each state holiday on which she otherwise would have been assigned to work. The sum total of this reduction in vacation leave is not insignificant. Because the defendant is entitled to three days of personal leave, and the state has designated twelve days as state holidays; see footnote 13 of this opinion; the defendant could have as many as thirty hours deducted from her vacation account each year.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, although \u00a7 5-250 (a) entitles the defendant to the same 120 hours of vacation time as similarly situated employees who work a standard eight hour day, the construction of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) advocated by the plaintiff would result in the defendant having as many as thirty fewer hours of disposable vacation time than employees working an eight hour day.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The construction urged by the plaintiff gives rise to another, albeit related, inequity with respect to the defendant\u2019s use of holiday leave. Under that construction, the defendant would be entitled to eight hours of holiday leave time for each holiday that falls on a day when she otherwise would have been working. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the defendant works a ten hour day, however, two hours would be deducted from her vacation account to make up for the difference between her ten hour workday and the eight hours of holiday leave to which the plaintiff claims the defendant statutorily is limited. Those two hours would be deducted from the defendant\u2019s vacation account, however, even though she <em>cannot </em>work that day <em>because </em>it has been deemed a state holiday.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> To deduct two hours from the defendant\u2019s vacation account under those circumstances is neither equitable nor consistent with the propose of holiday leave, namely, to compensate state employees fully for holidays on which our state offices and facilities, with but a few exceptions, are closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Although we recognize that the inequity that flows from the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) is not insignificant, neither is the unfairness that would result if we were to adopt the plaintiffs interpretation of those provisions. Thus, we must choose from two competing interpretations, each of which gives rise to inequities of similar magnitude. In such circumstances, the parties\u2019 equitable arguments cannot serve as the basis for our resolution of the question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We are persuaded that the legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), respectively, without any limiting language and read in light of those terms\u2019 ordinary meanings, indicates that the legislature intended for employees to receive personal and holiday leave credit on the basis of a calendar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>day.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, neither the purpose nor the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) suggests that the legislature intended the terms \u201cday\u201d and \u201choliday\u201d to represent an eight hour workday. \u201cWe will not impute to the legislature an intent to limit [a] term where such intent does not otherwise appear in the language of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Love, </em>246 Conn. 402, 412, 717 A.2d 670 (1998). Despite our recognition that the construction we adopt today will result in disparate treatment of employees working a standard eight hour day and those working a nonstandard day in excess of eight hours, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is the function of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luurtsema, </em>262 Conn. 179, 202, 811 A. 2d 223 (2002). Of course, the legislature is free to decide that, for purposes of such leave benefits, a day equates to an eight hour day. Indeed, Congress has done so. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6129 (\u201c[f]or purposes of administering sections 6303(a), 6304, 6307(a) and (d), 6323, 6326, 6327, and 8339(m) of this title, in the case of an employee who is in any program under this subchapter, references to a day or workday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>[or to multiples or parts thereof] contained in such sections shall be considered to be references to 8 hours [or to the respective multiples or parts thereof]\u201d). We, however, cannot do so by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In summary, the grant of personal leave days and holidays under \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), respectively, is intended to compensate state employees on the basis of a calendar day. Section 5-250 (c) explicitly provides that personal days are \u201c [i]n addition to annual vacation\u201d and \u201cshall not be deducted from vacation or sick leave credits.\u201d Accordingly, the practice of deducting time from the defendant\u2019s accrued vacation credits on account of her use of personal and holiday leave, solely because she works in excess of an eight hour day, violates that mandate of \u00a7 5-250 (c). Therefore, the trial court properly concluded that the practice must be discontinued and that the defendant is entitled to restoration of any time deducted from her vacation account, because of her nonstandard workday, for her use of personal leave days and holidays pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\"> The named defendant, the employees\u2019 review board (board), also is a party to this action.

The department then deducted one-half hour from the defendant\u2019s vacation leave account to make up for the difference between her eight and one-half hour workday and the eight hours of leave time to which the department deemed she was entitled, under \u00a7 5-250 (c), for each personal day. The department also employed this practice with respect to holiday leave time. Therefore, on a state holiday when the defendant otherwise would have been working, the department awarded the defendant eight hours of credit toward her eight and one-half hour workday, and then deducted one-half hour from her bank of vacation time to account for the difference between her workday and the eight hours of holiday leave for which she had been credited in accordance with the department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5-254 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> Although the defendant did not cite to \u00a7 5-254 (a.) in her grievance complaint, she also sought restoration of any vacation time that had been deducted in connection with her use of holiday leave.

Although <em>Nagy </em>does not bear directly on the issue presented by this appeal, it is consistent with our conclusion that a \u201cday\u201d means a calendar day.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In <em>Nagy, </em>the issue was whether, under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-247 and 5-250, the plaintiff state employees, who gradually had increased the length of their workday from seven to eight hours, were entitled to a full eight hour \u201cday\u201d of sick or vacation leave based on the then-standard workday of eight hours, or whether those statutory provisions entitled them only to seven hours of leave for each day they had earned at the time the standard workday was seven hours. Id., 695-96. The dispute arose because the statutes at issue in that case, in contrast to those at issue in the present case, permitted hourly computation of leave time. Id., 700. Nonetheless, we held in <em>Nagy </em>that the plaintiffs were entitled to a full \u201cday\u201d of leave, in accordance with the current eight hour workday. Id., 704-705. In so concluding, we rejected the contention of the defendant board that the relevant statutes granted leave in terms of <em>hours </em>rather than <em>days. </em>Id., 703-704. Thus, to the extent that <em>Nagy </em>is relevant to the issue presented by this appeal, it supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a \u201cday\u201d is a calendar day, that is, a full day, irrespective of the number of hours that an employee may have been scheduled to work on that day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b285-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-238 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Commissioner of Administrative Services shall issue regulations for establishing and maintaining uniform and equitable hours of work required of all employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>in the Executive Department, which regulations shall be approved by the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management.

Because, however, we do not know how many state holidays fall on days when the defendant otherwise would have been scheduled to work, we also do not know precisely how many fewer hours she would be required to work, on an annual basis, than her colleague with an eight hour workday. Hypothetically, though, if the defendant were to use all three of her personal leave days, <em>and </em>if every state holiday fell on a day when she otherwise was scheduled to work, the defendant would work an annual total of thirty fewer hours than her colleague, if, of course, her colleague also used all of her personal leave days and if each of the twelve state holidays fell on one of her colleague\u2019s regularly scheduled workdays, as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> The plaintiff also contends that, had the legislature intended to grant greater leave time to employees working nonstandard schedules, it knew how to express such an intent.

State Agencies \u00a7\u00a7 5-254-2 (c) (2), 5-247-2 (a) (2) and 5-250-2 (b). Without more, we do not see how the language of these <em>administrative regulations </em>supports the plaintiffs claim regarding the language used by the <em>legislature. </em>Moreover, although the commissioner of administrative services has established regulations that govern the award of leave to part-time state employees, the legislature has not conferred such authority upon the commissioner with respect to permanent full-time state employees. The regulations relied on by the plaintiff, therefore, are inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\"> The plaintiff also asserts that, under the trial court\u2019s construction, the result becomes that much more inequitable when considering its effect on vacation and sick leave.

Indeed, as a correctional supervisor, it may be that the defendant does, in fact, work on one or more such holidays each year. Generally, however, state employees do not, and cannot, work on state holidays, unless authorized to do so, because the vast majority of state offices and facilities are closed to them, as well as to the public, on such days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b292-5\"> The plaintiff contends that an interpretation of \u201cday\u201d as a calendar day has \u201cno meaning in measuring\u201d these benefits and that this same interpretation of \u201choliday\u201d is \u201cwholly divorced from the context of calculating benefit entitlement . . . .\u201d This claim lacks merit.

Although we acknowledge the theoretical possibility of such anomalous results, we decline to construe \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), which apply to large numbers of state employees, on the basis of a few hypothetical, and seemingly remote, fact patterns.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b293-8\">ZARELLA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Atq\">concurring. I concur in the result reached by the majority but disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis. Following the approach to statutory interpretation adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003), the majority begins by examining the statutes and case law of other jurisdictions to determine the meaning of the terms \u201cday\u201d and \u201clegal holiday\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a), respectively. The majority then seeks to divine the legislative purpose underlying the statutory language by examining the related statutory scheme and legislative history. I would adopt a simpler approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>As I have stated elsewhere, if the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, as in the present case, we need look no farther for its meaning than the words of the statute itself, unless such an interpretation produces an absurd result. Id., 634 (Zarella, <em>J., </em>dissenting). Only when the meaning of statutory language cannot be determined in this fashion should we consider the statutory scheme, the common-law principles governing the same subject matter and the statute\u2019s legislative history. Id. (Zarella, J., dissenting). I therefore disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) should be construed similarly because the language and legislative history of the two provisions \u201creflect an interrelated purpose of providing time for the observance of certain holidays, including religious holidays.\u201d I also disagree with the majority\u2019s emphasis on the subjective intent of the legislature in addition to the pertinent statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">I initially disagree that personal and holiday leave under \u00a7\u00a7 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) should be interpreted similarly on the ground that both provisions \u201creflect an interrelated purpose of providing time for the observance of certain holidays, including religious holidays.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-250 (c) expressly provides that personal leave \u201cshall be for the purpose of conducting private affairs, including [but not limited to the] observance of religious holidays . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 5-254 (a) provides \u201ctime off with pay for any legal holiday\u201d without referring to the religious or secular character of the holiday. Accordingly, because the language of each statute is different, I would conduct a separate analysis of each provision under the applicable canons of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 5-254 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach full-time permanent employee in the state service shall be granted time off with pay for any legal holiday. ...\u201d As the majority correctly notes, there are no provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sions in the State Personnel Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that define the term \u201clegal holiday.\u201d The majority observes, therefore, that, in the absence of a statutory definition, we must construe the words and phrases of a statute according to their common usage. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). The majority nevertheless proceeds directly to the statutes and case law of other jurisdictions in construing the meaning of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I find such an analysis superfluous because the term \u201clegal holiday\u201d is generally understood to mean a full calendar day. In other words, a reasonable person simply would not interpret the statute to mean that state employees working a nonstandard ten hour day must report for two hours of work on Thanksgiving, Independence Day or any other day designated as a legal holiday if the employee\u2019s nonstandard workday happens to fall on the holiday. Indeed, such an interpretation would produce absurd results. Because most state offices are closed on legal holidays, employees reporting to work on a legal holiday might not be able to perform their usual duties, much less enter the building, in the absence of other employees. Accordingly, a construction of the term \u201clegal holiday\u201d to mean a full calendar day is both reasonable and consistent with the term\u2019s common usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 5-250 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn addition to annual vacation, each appointing authority shall grant to each full-time permanent employee in the state service three days of personal leave of absence with pay in each calendar year. Personal leave of absence shall be for the purpose of conducting private affairs, including observance of religious holidays, and shall not be deducted from vacation or sick leave credits. . . .\u201d Neither the statute nor the State Personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Act contains a definition of the term \u201cday\u201d for purposes of calculating personal leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The majority observes that neither party has argued that this court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cday\u201d in \u00a7 5-250 (c) and the term \u201choliday\u201d in \u00a7 5-254 (a) should differ on the basis of any purported distinction between a \u201cday\u201d of personal leave and a \u201choliday.\u201d Furthermore, it is a well settled canon of statutory construction that \u201cthe legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... [T]his tenet of statutory construction . . . requires us to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter .... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute ... we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction. ... In applying these principles, we are mindful that the legislature is presumed to have intended a just and rational result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 310-11, 819 A.2d 260 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Sections 5-250 (c) and 5-254 (a) are part of a single statutory scheme, namely, the State Personnel Act. In order to achieve a harmonious result, the two statutes must be construed so that both personal leave days and paid legal holidays refer to calendar days rather than standard eight hour workdays. Such an interpretation is reasonable and there is nothing in either statutory provision to suggest that a distinction should be made between them on that basis. Such an interpretation also is consistent with other provisions in the statutory scheme. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-250 (a) (each full-time employee shall be granted \u201can annual vacation with pay of twenty-one consecutive calendar days or its equivalent\u201d). I believe that this is a more logical and legally defensible approach than that which the majority takes in construing the two provisions in a similar manner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 5-250 (c) expressly provides that personal leave days shall be \u201c[i]n addition to annual vacation\u201d and that personal leave \u201cshall not be deducted from vacation or sick leave credits.\u201d Consequently, under the plain language of the statute, hours taken for personal leave may not be deducted from an employee\u2019s vacation account. I thus reach the same result as the majority but via a more direct path.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-190 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
