The plaintiffs claim that the operations of the Millstone Nuclear Power Generating Station (Millstone) have resulted in unreasonable pollution and should be halted because Millstone has been functioning for several years without a valid water discharge permit and emergency authorization. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their action directly in the Superior Court and rendered judgment thereon. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"AuM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The present action is one of several actions brought over the course of the last three years by organizations and individuals challenging the validity of water discharge authorizations issued by the state department of environmental protection (department) with respect to the operation of the Millstone facility in Waterford.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to the commencement of this action, Millstone was operated by the defendant Northeast Nuclear\" Energy Company (Northeast). The facility utilizes seawater from Niantic Bay to cool its three nuclear reactors and discharges the heated water containing radioactive and toxic wastes into Long Island Sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The operations of the facility require department approval in the form of a water discharge permit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which is valid for five years. The department last issued a discharge permit to Northeast on December 14, 1992, with an expiration date of December 13,1997. Northeast submitted a timely permit renewal application on June 13, 1997.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The application is still pending, but Millstone continues to operate pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (b), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]hen a licensee has made timely and sufficient application for the renewal of a license or a new license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature, the existing license shall not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Millstone also discharges into the public waters certain toxic substances that are not covered by the 1992 permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On October 13, 2000, the department issued an emergency authorization pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-6k<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that covers the additional discharges. The emergency authorization provides that it will expire \u201cupon a final determination on [Northeast\u2019s] application for reissuance of [its water permit] or upon the [commissioner of environmental protection\u2019s] determination that the requirements of Section 22a-6k of the Connecticut General Statutes are no longer applicable to the activities authorized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In February, 2001, the defendant Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc. (Dominion), in conjunction with its efforts to acquire the Millstone facility,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> applied to the department for the transfer of environmental permits issued to Northeast. On March 8, 2001, the plaintiffs commenced the present action in the judicial district of Hartford seeking: (1) a judgment declaring that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>1992 permit had expired, that the emergency authorization was invalid and that neither the permit nor the authorization could be transferred; (2) a temporary and permanent injunction to prevent the continued operation of the Millstone facility; and (3) a temporary and permanent injunction to prevent the named defendant, Arthur J. Rocque, Jr., commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), from approving the transfer of the permit and emergency authorization from Northeast to Dominion. According to the plaintiffs, the purpose of the requested relief was to protect \u201cthe air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 requests for relief were based in part on allegations that the permit renewal application was invalid because the three nuclear- reactors were shut down at the time the application was filed. Consequently, the Millstone facility was not engaged in operations of a continuing nature as required for application approval under \u00a7 4-182 (b). The plaintiffs also alleged that the emergency authorization had been issued in violation of the letter and spirit of the law because its issuance presumed the validity of the underlying permit and it was one in a series of authorizations routinely issued to Northeast over a period of years without notice to the public and without public participation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>On March 8, 2001, the plaintiffs also filed a separate application for a temporary injunction to enjoin the transfer of the permit and emergency authorization from Northeast to Dominion. Because of the imminent sale of Millstone to Dominion, the court ordered that a hearing be held prior to March 31,2001, on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a temporary injunction. On March 15, 2001, Northeast filed an application to transfer the case to the complex litigation docket in Norwich. The chief administrative judge of the civil division and presiding criminal judge for the judicial district of Hartford determined that the case should be transferred as requested, but scheduled the injunction hearing for March 27,2001, in the judicial district of Hartford, as no judge was available in the Norwich court to hold the hearing prior to the end of March.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On March 29, 2001, following the hearing in Hartford, the court, <em>Schuman, J., </em>issued a written opinion denying the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a temporary injunction. That same day, the department approved the transfer of all environmental permits and emergency authorizations from Northeast to Dominion. On March 30, 2001, the plaintiffs petitioned this court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a, for certification to take a direct appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of the application for a temporary injunction. The petition was denied on April 3, 2001. Meanwhile, by order dated March 27, 2001, the case was transferred to the complex litigation docket in Norwich. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Four days later, Northeast closed on the anticipated sale of Millstone to Dominion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>While those proceedings were pending, all three defendants filed motions to dismiss the case,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> claiming that the plaintiffs lacked standing under \u00a7 22a-16<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq. (CEPA), and had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford heard arguments on the motions to dismiss as well as on the motion for a temporaiy injunction at the March 27,2001 hearing. Thereafter, the court issued a briefing schedule on the motions to dismiss in a footnote to its written opinion denying the application for a temporary injunction. Both sides filed briefs during the first two weeks in April, 2001. After the case was transferred to the complex litigation docket in Norwich, the court held a two day evidentiary hearing on the motions to dismiss. On July 19, 2001, the court, <em>Koletsky, J., </em>granted the motions to dismiss in a ruling from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The court determined that the plaintiffs had \u201cno standing to bring a \u00a7 22a-16 action to challenge either the transfer of the permit, the validity of the emergency authorization or the validity of the extension of the underlying 1992 permit with the expiration date of 1997,\u201d under the principles espoused in <em>Fish Unlimited </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities Service Co., </em>254 Conn. 21, 755 A.2d 860 (2000) <em>(Fish II). </em>The court explained: \u201c[T]here is no question that <em>[Fish II] </em>requires the holding that the \u00a7 22a-16 action brought by the plaintiffs cannot be brought in an area expressly placed . . . within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>exclusive domain of the commissioner . . . .\u201d The court further explained: \u201cWith respect to the challenges to the validity of the 1992 permit and its extension and the emergency authorizations, the court finds and holds that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring a \u00a7 22a-16 action in this proceeding or in this area which is committed by the legislature to the exclusive domain of the . . . commissioner. . . . Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the statutory scheme is logical, straightforward and uncomplicated. Section 22a-16 actions are not available where the commissioner . . . has the responsibility to act. When the commissioner . . . acts, there is an administrative appeal from that. There is still, the court opines, no \u00a7 22a-16 action after action by the commissioner, should the commissioner issue a permit to Millstone. . . . [A]s I said before, standing is not there.\u201d After the court granted the motions to dismiss, it denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reargument, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The plaintiffs claim on appeal that the court improperly (1) granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss their complaint for (A) lack of standing under \u00a7 22a-16 and (B) failure to exhaust their administrative remedies, and (2) denied their application for a temporary injunction. The plaintiffs also claim that alleged procedural irregularities in the hearing proceedings on the motions to dismiss were \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Because we agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling on the issue of standing, we do not reach the remaining issues raised in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We first address the defendants\u2019 claim that the request of the plaintiffs for injunctive relief to enjoin the transfer of the permit and emergency authorization should be dismissed on the ground of mootness. The defendants point out that the commissioner long ago <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>approved the transfer of permits and authorizations and that, shortly thereafter, Northeast conveyed the Millstone facility to Dominion. The defendants therefore argue that there is no longer a controversy between the parties with regard to the transfers and the court can afford the plaintiffs no practical relief. Northeast further claims that the appeal should be dismissed insofar as it pertains to Northeast because Northeast retains no ownership or legal interest in the Millstone facility and has no control over the facility\u2019s current operations, and, thus, this court cannot provide the plaintiffs with any practical relief. We agree with the defendants on both claims of mootness.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u201cMootness implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... An actual controversy must exist not only at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 492-93, 778 A.2d 33 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Connecticut courts have rejected injunctive remedies on the ground of mootness where the issue before the court has been resolved or has lost its significance because of intervening circumstances. See <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 249-52, 440 A.2d 310 (1982) (court dismissed as moot plaintiffs request for injunctive relief to restrain picketing during strike because strike and picketing had ended while appeal was pending); <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Gaitor, </em>16 Conn. App. 379, 381 n.2, 547 A.2d 1375 (court dismissed as moot plaintiffs request to enjoin city of Hartford from administering promotional examination to police officers following city\u2019s promotion of officers during pendency of appeal), cert. denied, 209 Conn. 824, 552 A.2d 430 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In the present case, following the court\u2019s denial of the application for a temporary injunction on March 29, 2001, the department approved the transfer of all environmental permits and authorizations from Northeast to Dominion. Two days later, Northeast conveyed the Millstone facility to Dominion. In light of the fact that the facility has been sold and that the permit and emergency authorization have long since been transferred, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 request for injunctive relief to prevent the transfers from taking place is rendered moot. The plaintiffs\u2019 request for a judgment declaring that the permit and authorization may not be transferred also is rendered moot. Intervening circumstances have changed the legal landscape, a controversy no longer exists between the parties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the court cannot grant the plaintiffs any practical relief. \u201c[W]here the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Connecticut courts also have dismissed cases on the ground of mootness where the court can offer no practical relief because the position of one of the parties has changed. <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>197 Conn. 566, 570-71, 499 A.2d 1158 (1985) (appeal regarding legality of sentence dismissed as moot because plaintiff completed sentence imposed while appeal was pending). In this case, Northeast\u2019s position changed when it sold the Millstone facility to Dominion. Northeast does not now own or operate the facility or hold the attendant permits and authorizations. Consequently, Northeast has no remaining connection with Millstone and a controversy can no longer be said to exist between Northeast and the plaintiffs. We therefore dismiss the appeal insofar as it relates to Northeast because the appeal has been rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We next address the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 standing. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss their complaint because \u00a7 22a-16 affords them standing to bring an action alleging unreasonable pollution for lack of a valid permit directly in the Superior Court. The defendants respond that past Supreme Court decisions have held that standing is not available under \u00a7 22a-16 to commence such claims directly in the Superior Court. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We begin our analysis by setting forth the appropriate standard of review. \u201cIf a party is found to lack standing, the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the cause. ... A determination regarding a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. When . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction .... The objection of want of jurisdiction may be made at any time . . . [a]nd the court or tribunal may act on its own motion, and should do so when the lack of jurisdiction is called to its attention. . . . The requirement of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by any party and can be raised at any stage in the proceedings. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u201cStanding is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. . . . These two objectives are ordinarily held to have been met when a complainant makes a colorable claim of direct injury he has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . provides the requisite assurance of concrete adverseness and diligent advocacy. . . . The requirement of directness between the injuries claimed by the plaintiff and the conduct of the defendant also is expressed, in our standing jurisprudence, by the focus on whether the plaintiff is the proper party to assert the claim at issue. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u201cTwo broad yet distinct categories of aggrievement exist, classical and statutory. . . . Classical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>aggrievement requires a two part showing. First, a party must demonstrate a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as opposed to a general interest that all members of the community share. . . . Second, the party must also show that the agency\u2019s decision has specially and injuriously affected that specific personal or legal interest. Aggrievement does not demand certainty, only the possibility of an adverse effect on a legally protected interest. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u201cStatutoiy aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case. In other words, in cases of statutory aggrievement, particular legislation grants standing to those who claim injury to an interest protected by that legislation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>262 Conn. 480, 485-87, 815 A.2d 1188 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u201cTraditionally, citizens seeking to protect the environment were required to show specific, personal aggrievement to attain standing to bring a legal action. . . . The Connecticut Environmental Protection Act; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-l et seq.; however, waives the aggrievement requirement in two circumstances. First, any private party, including a municipality, without first having to establish aggrievement, may seek injunctive relief in court for the protection of the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction .... General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16. Second, any person or other entity, without first having to establish aggrievement, may intervene in any administrative proceeding challenging conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a).\u201d (Citation omitted; inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>nal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fish II, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In concluding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their complaint directly in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16, the trial court relied on our reasoning in <em>Fish II, </em>a case very similar to the present case. All of the plaintiffs<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and one of the defendants<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in the present case were parties in <em>Fish II. </em>Furthermore, the dispositive issue in <em>Fish II, </em>as here, was whether the plaintiffs had standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to commence an action in the Superior Court seeking (1) injunctive relief to prevent the operation of the Millstone facility and (2) a judgment declaring that the water discharge permit was invalid.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See id., 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Our analysis of the standing issue in <em>Fish II </em>was guided by our decisions in two earlier cases, <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984), and <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>192 Conn. 591, 473 A.2d 787 (1984). In <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc., </em>the plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court from a decision of the defendant Stamford environmental protection board approving an application to develop a large tract of land for use as a regional postal facility. <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 248. The environmental protection board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>was the city agency responsible for regulating activities affecting wetlands and watercourses in Stamford under the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 et seq. Id. The plaintiffs, one of whom had intervened in the proceeding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, claimed, inter alia, that the board had not considered air pollution, noise pollution and other environmental problems created by increased traffic that would be generated by the new development. Id., 251. The trial court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, we concluded that \u201c[s]ection 22a-19, which authorizes any person to intervene in any administrative proceeding and to raise therein environmental issues must be read in connection with the legislation which defines the authority of the particular administrative agency. Section 22a-19 is not intended to expand the jurisdictional authority of an administrative body whenever an intervenor raises environmental issues. Thus, an inland wetland agency is limited to considering only environmental matters which impact on inland wetlands. Other environmental impacts must be raised before other appropriate administrative bodies, if any, or in their absence by the institution of an independent action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16. . . . [Gjeneral environmental matters [involving air and noise pollution and environmental problems created by increased traffic] were not relevant to the proceedings before [the environmental protection board] and therefore its refusal to entertain comment or evidence of a noninland wetland nature was appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id., 250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Shortly thereafter, we issued our decision in <em>Middle-</em>town, in which we employed similar logic to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment that the plaintiffs lacked standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to seek an injunctive remedy against the defendants in the Superior Court. The <em>Middletown </em>plaintiffs had sought to enjoin the defendant utility company and its parent company from proceeding with a plan to bum contaminated mineral oil containing poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at an electric generating plant, even though the defendants had obtained the approvals required for the disposal of substances containing PCBs from the department and from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 593-94. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the plaintiffs appealed to this court from the judgment of dismissal. Id., 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The plaintiffs in <em>Middletown </em>claimed that they had standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to seek an injunction to preclude the proposed burning of oils containing PCBs on the basis of the defendants\u2019 \u201cfailure to obtain a variety of approvals and permits\u201d including a water discharge permit under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-430. Id., 595. We rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in reliance on our decision in <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>Id., 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We first noted that \u00a7 22a-16 \u201cpermits any private party, including a municipality, to seek injunctive relief \u2018for the protection of the public <em>trust </em>in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction.\u2019 We have recently concluded, however . . . that invocation of [CEPA] is not an open sesame for standing to raise environmental claims with regard to any and all environmental legislation. In <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>[supra, 192 Conn. 247], we held that \u00a7 22a-19 of [CEPA], which permits any person, on the filing of a verified pleading, to intervene in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>administrative proceeding and to raise therein environmental issues \u2018must be read in connection with the legislation which defines the authority of the particular administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 596-97. We then stated that the same principle that had informed our holding in <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc., </em>namely, that \u00a7 22a-19 did not expand the jurisdictional authority of an administrative body whenever an intervenor raised environmental issues, was applicable \u201cto bar the [plaintiff] city\u2019s standing under the licensing statutes. The trial court was therefore correct in concluding that \u00a7 22a-16 did not provide the plaintiffs with standing under any statute other than [CEPA] itself.\u201d Id., 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We had no further occasion to address the issue of whether \u00a7 22a-16 confers standing to bring claims of unreasonable pollution under the licensing statutes until <em>Fish II, </em>where we affirmed our holding in <em>Middle-town. Fish II, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 24. After reviewing our reasoning in <em>Middletown, </em>we concluded: \u201c[T]he plaintiffs seek to use \u00a7 22a-16 to afford standing to raise permitting claims governed by \u00a7 22a-430. The department, however, has statutory and regulatory authority to issue water discharge permits, to determine the completeness of renewal applications and to pursue any one of several remedies if it concludes that a discharge is creating unreasonable pollution or is occurring without a valid permit. . . . Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Fish II, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 32-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In the present case, we also conclude that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring their complaint pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16. We have stated that \u201cone of the basic purposes of [CEPA] is to give persons standing to bring actions to protect the environment and standing is conferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>only to protect the natural resources of the state from pollution or destruction.\u201d <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 499, 400 A.2d 726 (1978). Yet, here, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of unreasonable pollution is based upon allegations that: (1) the 1992 permit became invalid on December 14, 1997, the day it expired, and has remained invalid since that time because the facility was not engaged in operations of a continuing nature as contemplated under \u00a7 4-182a (b) when the permit renewal application was filed; and (2) the issuance of the \u201cemergency\u201d authorization violated the letter and spirit of \u00a7 22a-6k because it was one in a series of authorizations <em>routinely </em>issued to Northeast over a period of years and, hence, did not address an \u201cimminent threat to human health or the environment . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-6k (a) (1). Allegations of improper decisions by the commissioner for failure to comply with the statutory requirements regarding permit renewal proceedings and emergency authorizations cannot be construed as anything other than a licensing claim under \u00a7 22a-430.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, following our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>established precedent in <em>Middletown </em>and <em>Fish II, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>lack standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to bring their claim directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>in the Superior Court. As we stated in <em>Fish II, </em>\u201c[t]he plaintiffs . . . cannot use \u00a7 22a-16 as an \u2018open sesame\u2019 to litigate environmental issues that are governed by \u00a7 22a-430, and which clearly have been placed within the exclusive domain of the department. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 597.\u201d <em>Fish II, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The plaintiffs claim that we should reevaluate our present interpretation of \u00a7 22a-16 with respect to actions brought pursuant to the licensing statutes, because the dissent in <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>259 Conn. 131, 170, 788 A.2d 1158 (2002) <em>(Borden, J., </em>dissenting), suggests that the time has arrived for this court to revisit the <em>Middletown </em>holding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The dissent in <em>Nizzardo </em>raised the question of whether standing under \u00a7 22a-16 had been construed too narrowly in <em>Middletown, </em>stating that \u201cit was self-contradictory to hold, as we did in <em>Middletown, </em>that one has standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to raise environmental concerns only under [CEPA] itself, and that, when one attempts to bring such an independent action, one has no standing to do so. In other words, it is difficult to see why the action that was held to be without standing in <em>Middletown </em>was not an action under [CEPA] itself. The majority [in Nizzardo], in relying on and reaffirming the holding of <em>Middletown, </em>does not explain this self-contradiction.\u201d <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 195 <em>(Borden, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The majority in <em>Nizzardo </em>concluded, and we continue to maintain, that the claim in <em>Middletown </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>brought under the licensing statutes. Id., 152-53. Indeed, it was precisely <em>because </em>the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had failed to obtain required permits that we were persuaded in <em>Middletown </em>that the plaintiffs lacked standing under \u00a7 22a-16. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Moreover, construing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of an invalid permit and emergency authorization as an independent claim of unreasonable pollution under \u00a7 22a-16 would effectively remove from the department and give to the court the department\u2019s authority under \u00a7 22a-430 to make decisions regarding permit applications. It is not our function to take such a step; that determination rests with the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The plaintiffs next contend that the commissioner has instituted numerous actions pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 in which this court has held that unlawful activities that occur in the absence of permits or in violation of statutes, regulations and abatement orders create unreasonable pollution under CEPA. See <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>237 Conn. 135, 140-41, 676 A.2d 795 (1996) (claim alleged unreasonable pollution of state waters for town\u2019s failure to comply with pollution abatement orders); <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection </em>v. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., </em>227 Conn. 175, 190, 629 A.2d 1116 (1993) (claim alleged unreasonable pollution for failure to obtain permit for operation of solid waste facility that generated leachate, thereby degrading groundwater); <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>L &amp; S Construction, </em>226 Conn. 205, 209, 626 A.2d 1299 (1993) (claim alleged unreasonable pollution for depositing construction debris in close proximity to area water supply in absence of permit). In the cases cited by the plaintiffs, however, the claims of unreasonable pollution were directed primarily to the polluting activity itself, and not, as here, to the validity of an existing permit or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>authorization, a condition that does <em>not </em>directly threaten the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state under \u00a7 22a-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We stated in <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 161, which the plaintiffs themselves cite, that \u201cto establish aprima facie case under \u00a7 22a-16, the plaintiff must establish that the conduct of the defendant, acting alone, or in combination with others, has, or is reasonably likely unreasonably to pollute . . . the public trust in the . . . water of the state.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Allegations of a flawed licensing proceeding do not meet that test.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As the defendants persuasively argue, a claim under CEPA that conduct causes unreasonable pollution is not the same as a claim that conduct fails to comply with the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>other environmental statutes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To illustrate the point, the fact that conduct may be permitted under the relevant environmental statute does not preclude a claim that the activity causes unreasonable pollution under CEPA, as when the alleged pollution exceeds the amount approved in the permit. Conversely, a claim that conduct is not properly authorized does not necessarily establish that the conduct causes unreasonable pollution under CEPA. Accordingly, the issues raised in the cases cited by the plaintiffs are different in kind from the issue raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The plaintiffs also attempt to draw a distinction between the claim of unreasonable pollution in <em>Fish II </em>and their present claim of unreasonable pollution. They assert that the claim in <em>Fish II </em>related to the validity of the permit, whereas the claim in this case alleges serious \u201congoing pollution\u201d that is unlawful because it is \u201cunpermitted.\u201d We do not agree that the present claim of \u201congoing pollution\u201d differs in any significant respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>from the claim in <em>Fish II </em>of an invalid permit. The plaintiffs in this case always have characterized their claim of \u201congoing pollution\u201d as a claim of unreasonable pollution on the ground that Millstone has been operating without a valid permit and emergency authorization.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, the claim of \u201congoing pollution\u201d cannot be considered in isolation, because it would not, without more, be actionable under \u00a7 22a-16, which allows claims to be brought only for protection from <em>\u201cunreasonable </em>pollution . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16. Accordingly, we reject the argument that the claim of unreasonable pollution in <em>Fish II </em>is distinguishable from the claim of \u201congoing\u201d unreasonable pollution in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The plaintiffs next contend that they have standing to bring their claim under \u00a7 22a-16 because the legislature contemplated that issues of pollution in violation of the public trust might implicate regulatory or administrative proceedings. They argue that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-18, the court may, but need not, remand the parties to administrative, licensing or other proceedings to determine the legality of the defendants\u2019 conduct. The Superior Court thus is empowered to determine the legality of that conduct, separate and apart from the agency\u2019s own proceedings. We do not agree that the plaintiffs\u2019 have standing to raise their claim of an invalid permit pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 and 22a-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 22a-18 provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) If administrative, licensing or other such proceedings are required or available to determine the legality of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court <em>in its discretion </em>may remand the parties to such proceedings. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) We interpreted \u00a7 22a-16 in conjunction with \u00a7 22a-18 in <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). In that case, the plaintiff city of Waterbury brought an action seeking a judgment declaring, inter alia, that it had not unreasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>polluted, impaired or destroyed the public trust, as provided in \u00a7 22a-16, by diverting water from the Shepaug River pursuant to a 1921 agreement with the town of Washington to increase Waterbury\u2019s public water supply. Id., 511-12. The defendants counterclaimed, alleging, inter alia, that the city\u2019s excessive diversion of the water had violated the act and breached the 1921 agreement. Id., 511, 522. The trial court found for the defendants on their counterclaim. Id., 519. The city appealed, asserting that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the water diversion claim because the defendants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the \u201cminimum flow statutes,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 26-141a through 26-141c. Id., 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On appeal, the city argued that the defendants\u2019 complaint was premised on the lack of flow in the Shepaug River and that, because the rate of flow is governed by the minimum flow statute, which is enforced by the department, the defendants were precluded under our holdings in <em>Middletown, Fish Unlimited </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities Service Co., </em>254 Conn. 1, 756 A.2d 262 (2000) <em>(Fish I), </em>and <em>Fish II </em>requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies from bringing their action to the court until the department had addressed the issue. <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 528, 538. We nonetheless concluded in <em>Waterbury </em>that, under \u00a7 22a-18, the court <em>may, in its discretion, </em>remand the parties to administrative proceedings that might be available to determine the legality of a defendant\u2019s conduct, and that the defendants need <em>not </em>exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing an independent action in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16. Id., 537, 545. We also stated that, under the doctrine of \u201cprimary jurisdiction, which is embodied by \u00a7 22a-18 of CEPA, the court has discretion, and in certain cases should refer the case, or certain aspects of it, to the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tive agency, yet retain jurisdiction for further action, if appropriate, under that section.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Id., 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Waterbury. </em>In that case, the defendants\u2019 claim of excessive diversion of water was an allegation of direct harm to the environment. The court specifically observed: \u201cTo resolve the question of whether Waterbury\u2019s diversion of water from the Shepaug River violated CEPA, the trial court [would be] required to determine whether Waterbury\u2019s diversion was of such magnitude that it constituted, not merely an impairment, but an unreasonable impairment of the public trust in the river as a natural resource in violation of \u00a7 22a-16.\u201d Id., 522-23. Here, by contrast, the plaintiffs did not make an allegation of direct harm to the environment, but alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>unlawful and unreasonable pollution on the ground that Millstone is operating without a valid permit and emergency authorization. Under the reasoning in <em>Middle-town </em>and <em>Fish II, </em>that claim cannot be brought directly in the Superior Court because it is a permitting claim. Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot prevail on their argument that \u00a7\u00a7 22a-16 and 22a-18 provide them with standing to bring their action directly in the Superior Court, as claims brought under the licensing statutes do not involve conduct that directly causes pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we note that, in <em>Waterbury, </em>we agreed with the plaintiffs characterization of our decisions in <em>Middletown, Fish I </em>and <em>Fish II </em>as being based on a theory of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 538-39. After describing those cases as implicating the exhaustion doctrine, we held in <em>Waterbury </em>that, to the extent that the <em>Waterbury </em>holding conflicted with our previous decisions applying the exhaustion doctrine to an independent action under \u00a7 22a-16, namely, <em>Middle-town, Fish I </em>and <em>Fish II, </em>we overruled them. Id., 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">We now clarify our decision in <em>Waterbury </em>to recognize that <em>Middletown </em>and <em>Fish II </em>involved claims that the plaintiffs lacked standing because the court did not have jurisdiction \u201cto litigate environmental issues that are governed by \u00a7 22a-430, and which clearly have been placed within the exclusive domain of the department.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Fish II, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 34; <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 597. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>also note, however, that <em>Waterbury </em>properly characterized our ruling in <em>Fish I </em>as based on the exhaustion doctrine. In <em>Fish I, </em>we concluded that the trial court should have dismissed the case for lack of standing under \u00a7 22a-16 and remanded the matter to the department for an initial determination before bringing their action to the court, because the department had authority to grant the requested injunctive relief during the permit renewal proceeding in which Fish Unlimited had intervened. <em>Fish I, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 17, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Although this clarification does not affect our holding in <em>Waterbury </em>that the exhaustion doctrine does not apply where the legislature determines that a court may exercise jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16, despite the availability of administrative procedures, there must be no possible confusion as to our reasoning in <em>Middle-town </em>and <em>Fish II, </em>because we rely on those two cases as precedent in the current matter.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">With each new case, we have continued to refine the law on standing under \u00a7 22a-16. We have determined that a plaintiff has standing to bring an independent action under \u00a7 22a-16 where an administrative body does not have jurisdiction to consider the environmental issues raised by the parties. See <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 250; <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>204 Conn. 38, 46, 526 A.2d 1329 (1987); <em>Nizzardo </em>v. <em>State Traffic Commission, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 155; <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Alves, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 486-87. We also have concluded that where an administrative body has been granted authority to adjudicate conduct with adverse environmental effects, the exhaustion doctrine does not apply. See <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 537. In cases such as <em>Waterbury, </em>an indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>dent action may be brought directly in the Superior Court, but the court has discretion to retain jurisdiction and remand the matter for administrative proceedings. Id., 546. Where the alleged conduct involves a permitting claim, however, there is no standing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 to bring the claim directly in the Superior Court, and the claim must be resolved under the provisions of the appropriate licensing statutes. <em>Fish II, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 21; <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Hartford Electric Light Co., </em>supra, 192 Conn. 591. The present claim falls within this last category.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Our conclusion that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claim under \u00a7 22a-16 is dispositive, and precludes our consideration of their remaining claims that the trial court improperly relied on the exhaustion doctrine and improperly conducted proceedings \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d We do not reach the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly denied their application for a temporary injunction for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The appeal from the judgment dismissing the action against Northeast Nuclear Energy Company is dismissed; the judgment dismissing the action against the named defendant and the defendant Dominion Nuclear Connecticut, Inc., is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\"> The plaintiffs in this case are Connecticut Coalition Against Millstone, an organization based in Mystic, advocating the use of safe and renewable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>energy; STAR Foundation, a nonprofit corporation based in East Hampton, New York, representing Long Island residents concerned about the toxic effects of nuclear contamination; New York State Assemblyman Fred Thiele; and North Fork Environmental Council, based in Long Island.

They argued that, even if the trial court should have granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary injunction, the commissioner\u2019s subsequent approval of the permit transfer, followed by the sale of the Millstone facility to Dominion, rendered it impossible for the court to grant the plaintiffs any practical relief.

General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fish I, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 3, 8. The plaintiffs\u2019 request for relief was based on allegations that the system contributed significantly to \u201cthe virtual demise of the winter flounder population in the Niantic River, and to the serious depletion of other aquatic species that are entrained and impinged at the unit 2 intake structure.\u201d Id., 8-9. The plaintiffs thus sought not only to enjoin the restart of unit 2, but to require conversion of the once-through cooling system to a closed cooling system and the installation of a fish return system to reduce the alleged environmental damage. Id., 9-10. The plaintiffs in <em>Fish I </em>therefore made a claim of conduct with direct environmental consequences, unlike the plaintiffs in the present case, whose claim of unreasonable pollution is based on the fact that the facility is operating without a valid water discharge permit and emergency authorization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\"> The plaintiffs argue that <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002), established that, under CEPA, pollution is \u201cunreasonable\u201d when it is illegal. In <em>Waterbury, </em>we stated: \u201c[W]hen, as in the present case . . . the legislature has enacted an environmental legislative and regulatory scheme specifically designed to govern the particular conduct that is the target of the action, that scheme gives substantive content to the meaning of 1he word \u2018unreasonable\u2019 as used in the context of an independent action under CEPA. Put another way, when there is an environmental legislative and regulatory scheme in place that specifically governs the conduct that the plaintiff claims constitutes an unreasonable impairment under CEPA, whether the conduct is unreasonable under CEPA will depend on whether it complies with that scheme.\u201d Id., 557. We do not agree with the plaintiffs that the quoted language can be construed to support their claim that they have standing under \u00a7 22a-16 to bring the present action. The \u201cconduct\u201d to which we referred in <em>Waterbury </em>involved the diversion of waters from a river, which had a direct effect on the environment. Here, the claim of unreasonable pollution is based on allegations that Millstone is operating wilhout a valid permit and emergency authorization, a claim of improper conduct under the licensing statutes that does not directly threaten the environment. The alleged improprieties in the present case were, therefore, not the type of conduct that we were contemplating when we decided <em>Waterbury.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\"> The plaintiffs state in their brief that their claim of \u201cunreasonable and lawless pollution\u201d is alleged in paragraphs eight, nine, ten, sixteen, seventeen, twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty and thirty-nine of the complaint. Those paragraphs include allegations of the polluting activity (eight, nine, and ten), allegations that the 1992 permit has expired (sixteen and seventeen), allegations that the emergency authorization is invalid (twenty-four, twenty-six and twenty-eight through thirty) and allegations that Millstone operations involve conduct that has, or is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting the natural resources of the state (thirty-nine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b161-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-18 provides: \u201c(a) The court may grant temporary and permanent equitable relief, or may impose such conditions on the defendant as are required to protect the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u201c(b) If administrative, licensing or other such proceedings are required or available to determine the legality of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court in its discretion may remand the parlies to such proceedings. In so remanding the parties the court may grant temporary equitable relief where necessary for the protection of the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction and the court shall retain jurisdiction of the action pending completion of administrative action for the purpose of determining whether adequate consideration by the agency has been given to the protection of the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction and whether the agency\u2019s decision is supported by competent material and substantial evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u201c(c) If the agency\u2019s consideration has not been adequate, and notwithstanding that the agency\u2019s decision is supported by competent material and substantial evidence on the whole record, the court shall adjudicate the impact of the defendant\u2019s conduct on the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state in accordance with sections 22a-14 to 22a-20, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u201c(d) Where, as to any administrative, licensing or other proceeding, judicial review thereof is available, the court originally taking jurisdiction shall maintain jurisdiction for purposes of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u201c(e) The court may award any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity which maintains an action under section 22a-16 or intervenes as a party in an action for judicial review under section 22a-19, and obtains declaratory or equitable relief against the defendant, its costs, including reasonable costs for witnesses, and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\"> We also discussed the matter of primary jurisdiction in <em>Fish I, </em>where the defendants had argued, in the alternative, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed under that doctrine. See <em>Fish I, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 11 n.15. We stated in <em>Fish I </em>that \u201c[t]he doctrine of primary jurisdiction . . . arises in cases in which a plaintiff, in the absence of a pending administrative proceeding, invokes the original jurisdiction of the court. ... In this case, [the plaintiff] has intervened in the defendants\u2019 permit renewal proceeding before the department . . . [BJecause an administrative action is pending, the primary jurisdiction doctrine does not apply.\u201d (Citations omitted.) We subsequently declared in <em>Waterbury </em>that \u201c[p]rimary jurisdiction . . . applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views. ... [A] court, may not refer a controversy within its jurisdiction to an agency under this doctrine where the agency itself lacks jurisdiction; the court\u2019s jurisdiction in such cases is exclusive.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 574. Accordingly, primary jurisdiction may be retained' by the court, even after it decides to remand a case for administrative proceedings. Id., 546. The <em>Waterbury </em>court thus overruled <em>Fish I </em>to the extent that <em>Fish I </em>had been based on the exhaustion theory. The <em>Waterbury </em>ruling and the theory of primary jurisdiction are not relevant in the present context, however, because the claim here, unlike the claims in <em>Fish I </em>and <em>Waterbury, </em>is a permitting claim under \u00a7 22a-430, and cannot be brought pursuant to \u00a7 22a-16 as a claim of environmental pollution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> We expressly stated that in <em>Middletown </em>and <em>Fish II </em>\u201cwe concluded that, pursuant to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the defendants were required to bring their claims to the administrative bodies entrusted with enforcement of the environmental statutes on which their claims were based.\u201d <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 538-39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"> In <em>Fish II, </em>we stated: \u201cIn light of the conclusion that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claim directly in the Superior Court, we do not reach the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Fish II, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 30 n.10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> We take no issue with the characterization in <em>Waterbury </em>of our ruling on standing in <em>Fish I </em>as based on the exhaustion doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
