We conclude that a fiduciary removed from its position pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) has not been removed \u201cfor cause\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 45a-243 and, therefore, does not have standing to appeal its displacement. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. In 1966, the John B. Faile Irrevocable Trust (trust) was created for the benefit of the defendants, certain individuals named as beneficiaries of the trust.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The instrument creating this trust named an individual fiduciary, James J. Preble, and a corporate fiduciary, the United Bank and Trust Company (United), as cotrustees while making no provision for the involuntary removal of either fiduciary. Thereafter, Preble passed away and United was left as the sole administrator of the trust. Following a corporate merger, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tiff became the successor in interest to United and assumed its role as the sole fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">On December 10, 2001, the defendants filed a petition in the Probate Court for the district of Hartford asking that the plaintiff be removed, pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4), as fiduciary for the trust, and that Putnam Trust (Putnam) be installed as the successor fiduciary. Thereafter, the Probate Court, <em>Killian, J., </em>issued a written memorandum of decision granting the defendants\u2019 petition to remove the plaintiff as fiduciary. As a threshold matter, the Probate Court indicated that \u201c[p]rior to October 1,2001, the removal of a fiduciary [under \u00a7 45a-242 (a)] was permitted only in those circumstances where it was demonstrated that a fiduciary either lacked the capacity to perform the duties of the [t]rustee or [was] neglectful of those duties,\u201d and that the plaintiffs performance as fiduciary was such that the court \u201cwould be incapable\u201d of finding such inadequacy in this matter. The Probate Court, however, went on to recognize that General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 45a-242 (a), as amended by P.A. 01-114, now supplied \u201csignificant new grounds for removal of [a] [t]rustee . . . .\u201d In particular, P.A. 01-114 added subdivision (4) to \u00a7 45a-242 (a), which provides for the removal of a fiduciary when \u201cthere has been a substantial change in circumstances or removal is requested by all of the beneficiaries, the court finds that removal of the fiduciary best selves the interests of all the beneficiaries and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the governing instrument and a suitable cofiduciary or successor fiduciary is available.\u201d The Probate Court concluded that, \u201c[i]n contrast to the other subdivisions] of \u00a7 45a-242 (a), all of which require some blamable acts on the part of the fiduciary in order to justify removal, [\u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) authorizes] removal by a unanimous request of the beneficiaries . . . and requires no blamable act on the part of the [t]rustee . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The Probate Court went on to determine that the removal of the plaintiff was permissible under \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) because: (1) the defendants were unanimous in their desire to remove the plaintiff; (2) removal was in the best interests of the defendants as it was undisputed that (a) Putnam already administered other trusts for the benefit of the defendants and to centralize management in one fiduciary would increase convenience and efficiency, (b) the services offered by Putnam were more personalized than those of the plaintiff, and (c) the fees charged by Putnam were lower than those imposed by the plaintiff; and (3) removal did not conflict with a material purpose of the trust because (a) the plaintiff was not the entity chosen by the settlor to administer the trust, and (b) the trust did not vest any special discretion in the trustee and did not require unique skills such that the plaintiff was the sole entity capable of effective administration of the trust. Accordingly, the Probate Court issued an order removing the plaintiff as fiduciary and turned administration of the trust over to Putnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from this order of removal to the Superior Court. On appeal to the Superior Court, the plaintiff claimed that the Probate Court had abused its discretion by improperly concluding that: (1) the defendants to the trust unanimously had requested the plaintiffs removal; (2) \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) permits the removal of a fiduciary without a demonstration that the current administration of the trust was detrimental to the interests of the beneficiaries in some manner; (3) the removal of the plaintiff as fiduciary best served the interests of the defendants; and (4) the removal of the plaintiff did not conflict with a material purpose of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Subsequently, the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs appeal. Specifically, the defendants claimed that while \u00a7 45a-243 confers standing to appeal \u201cwhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the fiduciary has been removed \u2018for cause\u2019 by a court of probate,\u201d \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4), the provision under which the plaintiff had been removed, authorizes the removal of a fiduciary without a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and, therefore, is outside the scope of \u00a7 45a-243. Put differently, the defendants claimed that \u201c[w]hen there has been removal of a fiduciary because of the fiduciary\u2019s unfitness, an appeal of the removal is authorized; however, where the removal of a fiduciary is not based on any reasons attributable to the fiduciary . . . that is, the removal was not \u2018for cause\u2019 but for the reason [s] set forth in \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) . . . no appeal of the removal is authorized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">On October 11, 2002, the Superior Court, <em>Koletsky, J., </em>issued a written memorandum of decision granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. In dismissing the plaintiffs appeal, the Superior Court reviewed the text and legislative purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 45a-242 and 45a-243, and determined that the standing to appeal conferred by \u00a7 45a-243 is implicated only when a fiduciary has been removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and that a removal effected pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) is not such a removal. Therefore, the Superior Court concluded that the plaintiff was without standing to pursue an appeal of its removal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the removal of a fiduciary from its position pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) is a removal \u201cfor cause\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-243 and, therefore, a fiduciary has standing to appeal such removal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff relies upon our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>interpretation of the phrase \u201c \u2018for cause\u2019 \u201d in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board, </em>181 Conn. 1, 7, 434 A.2d 293 (1980), citing Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, which expressed that \u201c[t]he ordinary and customary meaning of the phrase \u2018for cause\u2019 is \u2018[for] a good or adequate reason\u2019 . . . .\u201d Under this inteipretation, the plaintiff claims, the removal of a fiduciary based upon the factors articulated in \u00a7 45a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>242 (a) (4); see footnote 1 of this opinion; is a removal \u201cfor cause\u201d and, therefore, the fiduciary may appeal such removal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-243. Moreover, the plaintiff claims that the relevant legislative histories and underlying legislative purposes of these statutes support the conclusion that a fiduciary removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) may appeal the removal by means of \u00a7 45a-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In response, the defendants claim that the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d in \u00a7 45a-243 has a more narrow meaning than that advanced by the plaintiff. In the defendants\u2019 view, the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d is to be interpreted, in accordance with the definition provided in West\u2019s Legal Dictionary (1986), as \u201ca reason that is relevant to ability and fitness to perform one\u2019s duty.\u201d Under this interpretation, the defendants assert, a removal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) is a removal based upon factors entirely unrelated to the plaintiffs ability or fitness as a fiduciary and, therefore, is not a removal \u201cfor cause\u201d within the ambit of \u00a7 45a-243. Furthermore, in direct contrast to the position of the plaintiff, the defendants claim that the relevant legislative histories and motivating purposes of these statutory provisions buttress the conclusion that a fiduciary removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) may not challenge such removal by an appeal taken under \u00a7 45a-243. We agree with the defendants that a fiduciary that has been removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) has not been removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and, therefore, lacks standing to appeal that removal under \u00a7 45a-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">As a threshold matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. The plaintiff is challenging the conclusion of the trial court with regard to the interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) and 45a-243. Issues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review. <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>262 Conn. 257, 272, 811 A.2d 693 (2003). \u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Social Services </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>265 Conn. 723, 734, 830 A.2d 228 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Thus, our interpretive task begins with the relevant statutory language. Section 45a-242 (a) provides that \u201c[t]he court of probate having jurisdiction may, upon its own motion or upon the application and complaint of any person interested or of the surety upon the fiduciary\u2019s probate bond, after notice and hearing, remove any fiduciary if: (1) The fiduciary becomes incapable of executing such fiduciary\u2019s trust, neglects to perform the duties of such fiduciary\u2019s trust, wastes the estate in such fiduciary\u2019s charge, or fails to furnish any additional or substitute probate bond ordered by the court, (2) lack of cooperation among cofiduciaries substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>tially impairs the administration of the estate, (3) because of unfitness, unwillingness or persistent failure of the fiduciary to administer the estate effectively, the court determines that removal of the fiduciary best serves the interests of the beneficiaries, or (4) there has been a substantial change of circumstances or removal is requested by all of the beneficiaries, the court finds that removal of the fiduciary best serves the interests of all the beneficiaries and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the governing instrument and a suitable cofiduciary or successor fiduciary is available. A successor corporate fiduciary shall not be removed in such a maimer as to discriminate against state banks or national banking associations, nor shall any consolidated state bank or national banking association or any receiving state bank or national banking association be removed solely because it is a successor fiduciary, as defined in section 45a-245a.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Section 45a-243 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any fiduciary has been removed for cause by a court of probate, as provided in section 45a-242, the fiduciary may appeal from such order of removal in the manner provided in sections 45a-186 to 45a-193, inclusive. . . .\u201d By its plain terms, therefore, the right of a removed fiduciary to appeal its removal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-243 is limited to those instances in which the \u201cfiduciary has been removed <em>for cause ... as provided in section 45a-242 </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d is not defined statutorily in \u00a7\u00a7 45a-242, 45a-243, or in any other provision within chapter 802 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Following a comprehensive review of various other sources for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>meaning of the phrase, including dictionaries and sundry other provisions of the General Statutes and the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies that also employ the wording, we conclude that the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d is ambiguous and, depending upon the context, can be used in either the manner advanced by the plaintiff or as advanced by the defendants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We further con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>elude, however, that the legislative histories surrounding \u00a7\u00a7 45a-242 and 45a-243, as well as the legislative purposes underlying these enactments, are consonant with the inteipretation of the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d in \u00a7 45a-243 as a reason that is related to one\u2019s fitness or ability to perform its duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Prior to beginning our analysis of the legislative histories and statutory purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 45a-242 and 45a-243, we place our inquiry into the proper context with a brief review of the historical backdrop for these statutory provisions. Since their creation, \u201c[p]robate courts [have been] strictly statutory tribunals and, as such, they have only such powers as are expressly or implicitly conferred upon them by statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>261 Conn. 585, 596, 804 A.2d 170 (2002). In 1800, as the legislature began to define more precisely the scope of jurisdiction for courts of probate, a statutory provision was enacted that allowed a probate court, in certain instances, to remove a fiduciary from its position. See General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 371. Specifically, the legislature authorized the removal of a fiduciary following a deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>mination that such fiduciary was incapable of administering its trust, had neglected its duties, or had committed waste. General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 371. The current version of this statutory provision is now codified at \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Furthermore, in Connecticut there has long existed a right for a party to appeal the decision or order of a court having jurisdiction over probate matters. See General Statutes (1808 Rev.) tit. XLII, c. 1, \u00a7 95 n.79. This right of appeal, however, always has been contingent upon a threshold showing of aggrievement. General Statutes (1808 Rev.) tit. XLII, c. 1, \u00a7 95 n.79. Without such a demonstration of aggrievement, the appealing party may not maintain an appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That broad right of appeal for an aggrieved party currently is codified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>at General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186. See footnote 2 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In a number of early cases, this court had the opportunity to analyze the intersection between these two statutory provisions, one allowing a party aggrieved in a probate matter the right of appeal, and the other conferring upon courts of probate the power to remove fiduciaries. See, e.g., <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Malcolm-Smith, </em>129 Conn. 67, 69, 26 A.2d 234 (1942); <em>Avery\u2019s Appeal, </em>117 Conn. 201, 205-206, 167 A. 544 (1933). \u201cThese cases held that a fiduciary was not aggrieved, in the absence of some demonstrated pecuniary loss, by impairment of potential future compensation or injury to his status in the community as a professional fiduciary.\u201d <em>Weill </em>v. <em>Lieberman, </em>195 Conn. 123, 126, 486 A.2d 634 (1985).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As mere removal from its position did not confer aggrievement upon a fiduciary, displaced fiduciaries generally were unable to bring appeals challenging their removals.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Following these decisions, in 1955, spurred on by the banking lobby, the legislature undertook consideration of House Bill No. 1591, which was entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Removal for Cause of Executors, Administrators and Other Persons Acting in a Fiduciary Capacity and Providing Such Fiduciary so Removed the Right of Appeal from the Order of Removal.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>House of Representatives, Representative Francis C. Cady introduced this bill as an enactment \u201cgiving the right of appeal to an executor, administrator or other fiduciary which [has been] removed for cause by order of [a] probate court.\u201d 6 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1955 Sess., p. 2299.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> House Bill No. 1591 subsequently was enacted as General Statutes (1955 Rev.) \u00a7 2942d, now codified at \u00a7 45a-243 (a). Since its adoption, \u00a7 45a-243 (a) has provided fiduciaries \u201cremoved for cause by a court of probate, as provided in section 45a-242\u201d with a right of appeal from the removal decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Thereafter, this court indicated that the stated purpose of this provision was to \u201cenlarge the rights of appeal of removed fiduciaries.\u201d <em>Weill </em>v. <em>Lieberman, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 126. In essence, this statutory provision was \u201cdesigned to put the aggrievement issue to rest\u201d; id., 126-27; and to confer statutory aggrievement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>upon fiduciaries removed for cause. See footnote 10 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Until 2001, this statutory scheme remained materially unchanged. In that year, however, the legislature considered a substantial revision to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) through Senate Bill No. 419, which was entitled, \u201cAn Act Concerning a Petition for Change in Trustee.\u201d With its genesis in the bank acquisition and merger phenomenon of the 1990s,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and in the failure of many older trust instruments to provide a means by which a fiduciary could be removed involuntarily,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the express purpose of the bill was to \u201cwiden the circumstances under which [a] Probate Court can relieve a fiduciary ... of [its] duties under a trust.\u201d 44 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 2001 Sess., p. 4720, remarks of Representative Arthur J. Feltman. Accordingly, P.A. 01-114 placed the previously existing grounds for the removal of a fiduciary within \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (1), and added subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) as new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>grounds for the removal of a fiduciary. See footnote 1 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In response to concerns that the bill as proposed would open the door to discrimination against state or national banks or banking associations simply because of their status as a successor fiduciary, Senate Bill No. 419 later was amended to include a provision barring discrimination against such an entity \u201csolely because it is a successor fiduciary . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-242 (a). As Senator Eric Coleman explained, \u201cthe whole purpose of the amendment is to make clear that mergers and acquisitions would not constitute . . . the substantial change of circumstances [that is] referred to in the bill.\u201d 44 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 2001 Sess., pp. 2015-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Notably, P.A. 01-114, although substantially revising \u00a7 45a-242 (a), did not alter the statutory text of \u00a7 45a-243. Furthermore, the legislative history surrounding P.A. 01-114 reveals no discussion of the proposed bill\u2019s impact upon \u00a7 45a-243, and indeed discloses no reference at all to \u00a7 45a-243 in the discussions surrounding the modification of \u00a7 45a-242 (a). Instead, following the enactment of P.A. 01-114, \u00a7 45a-243 (a) continues to provide, as it previously had provided: \u201cWhen any fiduciary has been removed/or <em>cause </em>by a court of probate, <em>as provided in section 45a-242, </em>the fiduciary may appeal from such order of removal in the manner provided in sections 45a-186 to 45a-193, inclusive. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Having reviewed the legislative genealogy of \u00a7\u00a7 45a-242 and 45a-243, we now turn to the interpretive issue presented in this appeal. Although, as previously mentioned, the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d in the text of \u00a7 45a-243 is ambiguous, the legislative purpose underlying \u00a7 45a-243, as well as the subsequent statutory development of \u00a7 45a-242, lead to the conclusion that the most reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 45a-243 is the reading that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>excludes from its ambit the removal of a fiduciary pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4). Accordingly, a fiduciary removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) has not been conferred with statutory aggrievement pursuant to \u00a7 45a-243 and may not maintain an appeal pursuant to that statutory-provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">As demonstrated, the statutory precursor to \u00a7 45a-243 was bom in response to several decisions of this court that had concluded that the mere removal of a fiduciary from its position did not aggrieve it in the classical sense and, therefore, such a removed fiduciary could not sustain an appeal under the general right of appeal statute, now codified at \u00a7 45a-186. At the time this right of appeal provision was enacted in 1955, a fiduciary was subject to removal only if it had become incapable of administering the trust, neglected its duties, or committed waste. General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 45-263. As classical aggrievement was lacking, the purpose of the appeal provision was to confer statutory aggrievement upon fiduciaries removed for those performance related reasons. Put differently, the spirit and import of the precursor to \u00a7 45a-243 was to allow a fiduciary, charged with ignominious wrongs bearing directly upon its fitness or ability to perform in its role as fiduciary, the opportunity to defend itself from such allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Over time, \u00a7 45a-242 and its statutory ancestors have been amended to incorporate several additional grounds for the removal of a fiduciary, including the failure to furnish a court-ordered probate bond, now codified in \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (1), and the various justifications articulated in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of \u00a7 45a-242 (a). Although the grounds for removal have been supplemented, the language of the appeal provision has not been modified and, perhaps more importantly, the spirit of the provision has never been altered. All that is left, therefore, is to apply \u00a7 45a-243 to the modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u00a7 45a-242 in a manner that is both in harmony with the purpose behind the appeal provision and in keeping with the language of \u00a7 45a-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In this inquiry, it is critical to recognize that while the grounds for removal articulated in \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (1), and those qualitatively similar grounds as listed in \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (2) and (3), consist of factors inextricably intertwined with the fitness or ability of a fiduciary to perform its duties adequately, the grounds for removal as set forth in \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) are different in kind. In each of the grounds listed in \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (1), (2) and (3) , the basis for the removal of a fiduciary is something the fiduciary has done, or has failed to do, which adversely has impacted the administration of the trust that has been committed to its charge. The focus of the inquiry under \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4), however, is not so bound up with a showing as to the current fiduciary\u2019s insufficient performance. Rather, \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) indicates that a fiduciary can be removed, even if it adequately is performing its function as administrator, if removal: is requested by each beneficiary; would best serve the interests of the beneficiaries, as for example in an instance in which an alternative entity could <em>better </em>function as fiduciary, and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust; and an alternative entity is available to serve as successor fiduciary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under this provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sion, there need not be an allegation that a fiduciary is or has been performing inadequately. Rather, the focus of subdivision (4) is upon whether there is another entity that, for some reason, may perform better or provide different and more desirable benefits as administrator, or is otherwise better suited to serve as fiduciary for a particular trust.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Accordingly, the motivating purpose behind \u00a7 45a-243, that a fiduciary be afforded a right of appeal in order to defend itself from scurrilous allegations of misfeasance, nonfeasance, or inadequate performance, is absent from a removal that has been effected pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4). Given what we view as this unmistakable legislative purpose in affording removed fiduciaries a right of appeal, we conclude that the most reasonable interpretation of the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d in \u00a7 45a-243 is to provide a fiduciary, removed from its position for a reason that is related to its fitness or ability to perform its duties, with a right of appeal to defend itself from such allegations. As removal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) is not predicated upon reasons related to fitness or ability to perform, such a removal is not within the scope of \u00a7 45a-243.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The plaintiff contends, however, that to interpret the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d in \u00a7 45a-243 as a reason related to the fitness or ability of a fiduciary to discharge its duties would be to render that phrase superfluous to the statute, as it had existed prior to the enactment of P.A. 01-114. Put differently, the plaintiff notes that, prior to P.A. 01-114, all of the grounds for removal listed in General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 45a-242 (a) were related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the fitness or ability of a fiduciary to perform its duties. See footnote 1 of this opinion. As such, the plaintiff claims that if all of the grounds for removal under \u00a7 45a-242 (a) were \u201cfor cause,\u201d the use of the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d within \u00a7 45a-243 would have been mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Although we agree with this proposition to the extent that it asserts that, without legislative modification to \u00a7 45a-243, \u201cfor cause\u201d under \u00a7 45a-243 must mean the same after P.A. 01-114 as it did prior to the amendment, we do not agree that our reading of the phrase as related to the fitness or ability of a fiduciary to perform its duties renders the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d superfluous in the scheme as existing prior to P.A. 01-114. \u201c[I]t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature [does] not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kuehl </em>v. <em>Z-Loda Systems Engineering, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 525, 536-37, 829 A.2d 818 (2003). In this regard, it is important to note that \u00a7 45a-243 provides a right of appeal to a fiduciary removed \u201cfor cause ... as provided in <em>section 45a-242 </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Both before <em>and </em>after the enactment of P.A. 01-114, \u00a7 45a-243 referenced the preceding provision <em>in whole, </em>without a more pointed reference to any particular subsection or subdivision of \u00a7 45a-242. We also note that \u00a7 45a-242, and its statutory precursors dating back to the original passage of the provision in 1955, not only always has provided the particular grounds by which a fiduciary may be removed involuntarily from its position, in subsection (a) of the statute, but also, in subsection (b) of \u00a7 45a-242 and its earlier variations, has provided for the removal of a fiduciary by means of resignation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Our reading of the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d as a reason related to the fitness or ability of a fiduciary to perform its duties not only renders no portion of \u00a7 45a-243 superfluous following enactment of P.A. 01-114, but is also in keeping with a proper interpretation of the statute prior to P.A. 01-114. The phrase \u201cfor cause,\u201d as used in \u00a7 45a-243, means, as it always has, that a fiduciary removed for reasons related to its fitness or ability to perform has a right of appeal to clear its name from scurrilous or ignominious allegations. Prior to P.A. 01-114, the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d had distinguished removals pursuant to subsection (a) of \u00a7 45a-242, for which aright of appeal was afforded, from a resignation pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (b), for which no right of appeal was afforded. Essentially, the distinction precluded a fiduciary that had resigned its position from later changing its mind and seeking reinstatement by way of an appeal. Following the enactment of P.A. 01-114, the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d in \u00a7 45a-243 differentiates between removals pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (1), (2) and (3), which are all related to the fitness or ability of a fiduciary to perform and for which a right of appeal is afforded, from removals pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) or resignations pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (b), which are unrelated to a fiduciary\u2019s fitness or ability to perform and for which no right of appeal is afforded.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>While we conclude that a fiduciary removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) has not been conferred with statutory aggrievement to pursue an appeal under \u00a7 45a-243, our inquiry is not at an end. As previously noted, the early cases concluding that a fiduciary has not been classically aggrieved by its removal and may not maintain an appeal pursuant to the broad right of appeal from a probate decree now codified at \u00a7 45a-186 have since been questioned as having looked too narrowly upon the common law of aggrievement. See footnote 11 of this opinion and the accompanying text. Given this erosion, our conclusion that a fiduciary removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) has not been conferred with statutory aggrievement under \u00a7 45a-243 does not foreclose the possibility that such fiduciaries, under our current principles of classical aggrievement, may now maintain an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-186.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We conclude, however, that a fiduciary removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) is not, under our well settled standard with regard to classical aggrievement, an \u201caggrieved\u201d person pursuant to \u00a7 45a-186. See footnote 10 of this opinion. As previously mentioned, our early cases concerning \u201caggrievement\u201d within the context of an appeal from a probate decree required that, in order to be aggrieved, a party must demonstrate ii\\jurious impact upon a pecuniary interest. <em>Spencer\u2019s Appeal, </em>122 Conn. 327, 331-32, 188 A. 881 (1937); <em>Avery\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, 117 Conn. 205-206. This requirement could be satisfied either by a showing of a direct pecuniary interest in the decree, such as a creditor, legatee or heir-at-law would possess; <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Malcolm-Smith, </em>supra, 129 Conn. 69; or a showing that an entity was acting in a representative capacity for one whose interest was so affected. <em>Spencer\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">While we have abandoned the requirement of a pecuniary interest, either directly or in a representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>capacity; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 202; it has remained well settled that \u201c[a] grievance to one\u2019s feelings of propriety or sense of justice is not a grievance which gives a right of appeal.\u201d Id. Under our current formulation of classical aggrievement, an allegedly aggrieved party must have a \u201cspecific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of a decision . . . and . . . this interest [must have] been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d <em>Gladysz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">We have concluded that \u201c[o]ne serving in a fiduciary capacity has standing to appeal from any decree which adversely affects the interests of those for whom he is acting, if it is a part of his duty to protect those interests.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>supra, 175 Conn. 202-203. Moreover, with regard to the nature of the interest implicated, we also have concluded that \u201c[a]s long as there is some direct injury for which the plaintiff seeks redress, the injury that is alleged need not be great.\u201d <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 321, 439 A.2d 349 (1981). Accordingly, aparty sufficiently has demonstrated classical aggrievement upon a showing of direct injury to a legally protected interest, either in the sense of personal harm or harm to the interests of one for whom the party stands in a representative capacity, regardless of the extent of the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Turning to the plaintiff\u2019s asserted interest in this matter, we conclude that the plaintiff has not established a protected interest, either in a representative or personal capacity, such that it has been aggrieved by the order of the Probate Court removing it as fiduciary. In the representative sense, the order of the Probate Court, terminating the plaintiffs tenure as fiduciary, was an adjudication that the plaintiff was no longer to represent the interests of the defendants with regard to the trust. Therefore, following removal as fiduciary, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>may no longer seek to assert claims on behalf of the defendants. Rather, the interests of the defendants are now represented by their current fiduciary, Putnam, and standing to appeal decrees impacting those interests is now vested solely in Putnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">With no aggrievement in a representative capacity, the only means by which the plaintiff may be determined to have been aggrieved by the order of the Probate Court is by direct injury to a personal interest. We conclude that a fiduciary removed from its position pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) has no such direct harm to a personal and legally protected interest.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Unlike removals pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (1), (2) and (3), no harm to a fiduciary\u2019s reputation or standing in the community has been visited upon the fiduciary as a result of its removal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4). The interest asserted by the plaintiff in a personal capacity is, in essence, nothing more than a claim that, in the absence of inadequate administration of a trust committed to its charge, the plaintiff is entitled to the continuation of its tenure as fiduciary ad infinitum.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In the absence of inadequate performance, the plaintiff claims that it may not be removed from its position regardless of whether there exists another fiduciary who could better administer the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In the context of zoning and licensing appeals, we have concluded that \u201c[o]rdinarily, an allegation that a governmental action will result in competition harmful to the complainant\u2019s business would not be sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>to qualify the complainant as an aggrieved person.\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 301, 524 A.2d 636 (1987). We see no functional difference in the plaintiffs implicit claim in this appeal that, if it is performing adequately as a fiduciary, it should be left free from the rigors of competition in the marketplace. The plaintiffs asserted personal interest is simply an insufficient basis upon which classical aggrievement may be claimed. Accordingly, the plaintiff has not been classically aggrieved by its removal as fiduciary and may not maintain an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-186.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> Public Act 01-114, which was entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Removal of a Fiduciary,\u201d took effect on October 1, 2001, and substantially revised \u00a7 45a-242 (a). Prior to P.A. 01-114, General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) \u00a7 45a-242 (a) provided: \u201cIf any fiduciary becomes incapable of executing his trust, neglects to perform the duties of his trust, wastes the estate in his charge, or fails to furnish any additional or substitute probate bond ordered by the court, the court of probate having jurisdiction may, upon its own motion, or upon the application and complaint of any person interested or of the surely upon the fiduciary\u2019s probate bond, after notice and a hearing, remove such fiduciary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Following the enactment of P.A. 01-114, General Statutes \u00a7 45a-242 (a) now provides: \u201cThe court of probate having jurisdiction may, upon its own motion or upon the application and complaint of any person interested or of the surety upon the fiduciary\u2019s probate bond, after notice and hearing, remove any fiduciary if: (1) The fiduciary becomes incapable of executing such fiduciary\u2019s trust, neglects to perform the duties of such fiduciary\u2019s trust, wastes the estate in such fiduciary\u2019s charge, or fails to furnish any additional or substitute probate bond ordered by the court, (2) lack of cooperation among cofiduciaries substantially impairs the administration of the estate, (3) because of unfitness, unwillingness or persistent failure of the fiduciary to administer the estate effectively, the court determines that removal of the fiduciary best serves the interests of the beneficiaries, or (4) there has been a substantial change of circumstances or removal is requested by all of the beneficiaries, the court finds that removal of the fiduciary best serves the interests of all the beneficiaries and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the governing instrument and a suitable cofiduciary or successor fiduciary is available. A successor corporate fiduciary shall not be removed in such a manner as to discriminate against state banks or national banking associations, nor shall any consolidated state bank or national banking association or any receiving state bank or national banking association be removed solely because it is a successor fiduciary, as defined in section 45a-245a.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Summarizing this amendment, P.A. 01-114 placed the previously existing grounds for the removal of a fiduciary within subdivision (1) of \u00a7 45a-242 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>(a), and also added several new grounds for removal, which are listed in subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of \u00a7 45a-242 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-243 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen any fiduciary has been removed for cause by a court of probate, as provided in section 45a-242, the fiduciary may appeal from such order of removal in the manner provided in sections 45a-186 to 45a-193, inclusive. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person aggrieved by any order, denial or decree of a court of probate in any matter, unless otherwise specially provided by law, may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court.

The plaintiff first claims that the common and ordinary meaning of \u201c \u2018for cause\u2019 \u201d is \u201c \u2018for a good or adequate reason.\u2019 \u201d As such, the plaintiff asserts that satisfaction of the various factors enunciated in \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4)\u2014unanimity among the beneficiaries, the furtherance of the best interests of the beneficiaries, the lack of frustration as to any material purpose of the instrument, and the availability of a suitable successor fiduciary\u2014is such a removal \u201cfor cause\u201d -within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-243 and, therefore, a fiduciary has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>standing to appeal its removal. The second claim of the plaintiff is that even if \u201cfor cause\u201d as used in \u00a7 45a-243 is interpreted, as the defendants suggest, as removal for a reason related to the ability or fitness of a fiduciary to perform, removal effected pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) constitutes such a determination as the subdivision authorizes removal only \u201cwhere the terms of the trust are not being effectively carried out in some manner,\u201d and that conclusion is necessarily a finding that the fiduciary has been performing inadequately.</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">We note the considerable relatedness between the plaintiffs first and second claims. In both claims, the assertion of the plaintiff is that removal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) is a removal \u201cfor cause\u201d within the scope of \u00a7 45a-243. As the two claims both require an interpretation of the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d in \u00a7 45a-243 and an inquiry into the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) and 45a-243, we see no reason to differentiate analytically between the two claims and, therefore, we will focus on the claims as presenting one issue for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">The plaintiff also advances a third claim\u2014that the trial court improperly relied upon the factual findings of the Probate Court and engaged in a premature review of the merits of the plaintiffs claim in its determination that the plaintiff lacked standing to appeal its removal as fiduciary. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the trial court, in concluding that the plaintiffs removal was not \u201cfor cause\u201d and therefore did not fall within the ambit of \u00a7 45a-243, improperly relied upon the Probate Court\u2019s factual finding that the plaintiff had not been removed by reason of its conduct or an inability to perform its duties. It is undisputed, however, that the Probate Court removed the plaintiff as fiduciary pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) and that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs appeal was based upon its interpretation of \u00a7 45a-243 so as to exclude appeals challenging removals pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4). Accordingly, we find no merit in the plaintiffs contention that the trial court impermissibly relied upon the factual findings of the Probate Court in dismissing the plaintiffs appeal. The conclusion of the trial court was based upon its threshold determination of standing and did not include a review of the merits of the plaintiffs claim or the findings of the Probate Court. As such, the sole issue for resolution in this appeal is whether a removal effected pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4) is appealable under \u00a7 45a-243.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\"> We are, of course, aware that our legislature recently has enacted Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-154), which provides: \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.

In this instance, the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d has been defined in various sources as supportive of both the plaintiffs somewhat capacious interpretation\u2014that of a \u201cgood or adequate reason,\u201d and the defendants\u2019 interpretation\u2014that of \u201ca reason that is relevant to ability and fitness to perform one\u2019s duty\u201d and which connotes either misfeasance or nonfeasance. Etymologically, the word \u201ccause\u201d is derived from the Latin term \u201ccausa,\u201d which has been defined, in harmony with the plaintiffs interpretation, as a \u201cground [or] justificatory principle,\u201d and also, in a manner supportive of the defendants\u2019 interpretation, as areason relating to one\u2019s \u201c[responsibility [or] blame . . . .\u201d Oxford Latin Dictionary (1984).

Furthermore, while Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) now defines \u201cfor cause\u201d as \u201c[f]or a legal reason or ground,\u201d earlier versions also defined the phrase as \u201caffecting and concerning ability and fitness of [an] official to perform [the] duty imposed on him\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979); and \u201c[cjonduct indicating unworthy or illegal motives or improper administration of power [and] . . . misfeasance or nonfeasance . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In addition, we are mindful that our legislature has used the phrase \"for cause\u201d in myriad instances within our General Statutes and that various state entities also have employed the phrase numerous times within the administrative regulations implementing these statutory enactments. Our review of these authorities indicates that the phrase \u201cfor cause\u201d has been used interchangeably as meaning either \u201ca good or adequate reason\u201d or \u201ca reason related to the fitness of an individual to perform assigned duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">For instance, General Statutes \u00a7 17a-ll (h), as amended by Public Acts 2003, No. 03-278, \u00a7 52, provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon motion of any interested party in a Probate Court proceeding under this section, the probate court of record may transfer the file <em>for cause </em>shown to a probate court for a district other than the district in which the initial or permanency hearing was held. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)

(3) has been discharged <em>for cause </em>as set forth in [General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B)], the Job Center shall notify the referring local General Assistance office of such information. . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) In turn, General Statutes \u00a7 31-236 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn individual shall be ineligible for benefits . . . (2) . . . (B) if . . . the individual has been discharged or suspended for felonious conduct, conduct constituting larceny of property or service . . . larceny of currency . . . wilful misconduct in the course of the individual\u2019s employment, or participation in an illegal strike . . . .\u201d The intersection between these provisions of the General Statutes and the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies therefore demonstrates that the meaning of \u201cfor cause\u201d in the context of \u00a7 31-236 (a) (2) (B) is most reasonably understood as \u201ca reason that is relevant to ability and fitness to perform one\u2019s duty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\"> Although now included within \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (1), prior to 1980, the ground for displacement authorizing the removal of a fiduciary that had failed to furnish a court-ordered probate bond was not a part of the original statutory scheme. This particular ground for removal was added to the scheme with the enactment of Public Acts 1980, No. 80-227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> \u201cAggrievement\u201d is a concept similar, but not identical, to the requirement that a party must have standing in order to raise a particular claim or maintain a particular cause of action.

Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Aggrievement exists in two forms: statutory and classical aggrievement. \u201cStatutory aggrievement exists by legislative fiat, not by judicial analysis of the particular facts of the case. In other words, in cases of statutory aggrievement, particular legislation grants standing to those who claim injury to an interest protected by that legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy </em>v. <em>New London, </em>265 Conn. 423, 430-31, 829 A.2d 801 (2003). Classical aggrievement, in contrast, requires an analysis of the particular facts of the case in order to ascertain whether a party has been aggrieved and, therefore, has standing to appeal. \u201cWe traditionally have applied the following two part test to determine whether [classical] aggrievement exists: (1) does the allegedly aggrieved party have a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of a decision; and (2) has this interest been specially and irvjuriously affected by the decision.\u201d <em>Gladysz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 256.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> We note that the requirement that, in order to be aggrieved, a party must demonstrate a personal pecuniary interest has since been abandoned. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>175 Conn. 200, 202, 397 A.2d 101 (1978). We also are mindful that the principles of aggrievement applied in these early cases since have been questioned as possibly having \u201ctaken too narrow a view of the common law of aggrievement.\u201d <em>Weill v.

It is completely . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>unfair that a fiduciary . . . should be subjected to the disgrace of removal without having any means of clearing ... its name.

With regard to the choice of the phrase \u201cany fiduciary\u201d by these legislators, we note that, at the time this bill was under consideration, the only grounds for removal of a fiduciary were an inability to administer the trust, neglect and waste. General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 45-263. As such, it would be intellectually disingenuous to extrapolate out from these legislators\u2019 use of the capacious term \u201cany\u201d in order to rely upon these statements to support the proposition that \u00a7 45a-243 applies to any fiduciary removed for any reason, including those removed pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b263-6\"> Linda Dow, counsel to the Probate Court administrator\u2019s office, appearing in support of the proposed legislation, stated: \u201c[OJver the last ten years, a series of Connecticut banks were either declared insolvent or for other reasons, were acquired by larger banks. There are many . . . estates in Connecticut in which the testator . . . had selected a small hometown bank as Trustee, recognizing both the local personnel and reasonable fees. But at the time of the death of the testator, that local bank no longer existed. The law clearly provides that in [the] event of an acquisition, the acquiring bank will succeed to the fiduciary appointments of the failed or merged bank. This leaves many beneficiaries of trust[s] ... in the untenable position of having large out-of-state corporate trustee[s] handling their family trust, while paying fees that the . . . beneficiaries feel are very unreasonable.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 9, 2001 Sess., pp. 3073-74.

We are not persuaded. While it may be true that removal under subdivision (4) of \u00a7 45a-242 (a) may be warranted because of inadequate administration, such a claim is more likely to be brought pursuant to subdivision (1), a provision that allows removal for incapacity or neglect, or subdivision (3), a provision that allows removal for unfitness, unwillingness, or persistent failure effectively to administer the corpus. If inadequate performance is the basis for the removal petition, such a claim is more likely to be brought under one of these provisions as they do not require unanimity among the beneficiaries, a showing that removal does not conflict with a material purpose of the trust, or a showing that a successor fiduciary is available\u2014 all of which are required in a petition brought pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242 (a) (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> For instance, as the defendants here claimed, while the plaintiff was not an ill-performing fiduciary, the choice to remove it as fiduciary was beneficial to the trust and the defendants as there was a successor fiduciary that provided more personalized fiduciary services and charged lower fees, and whose appointment served the goals of increased convenience and efficiency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45a-242 (b) provides: \u201cThe court of probate, after notice and hearing, may accept or reject the written resignation of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>fiduciary, but such resignation shall not be accepted until such fiduciary has fully and finally accounted for the administration of such fiduciary\u2019s trust to 1he acceptance of such court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b269-6\"> Furthermore, we disagree with the concession made by the defendants\u2019 counsel at oral argument before this court that, as the removal of a fiduciary can be accomplished only pursuant to \u00a7 45a-242, the use of the phrase \u201cas provided in section 45a-242\u201d in \u00a7 45a-243 is superfluous. Again, in accordance with the tenet of statutory construction that no word or phrase in a statute be read as superfluous, we read this clause in \u00a7 45a-243 as a reference to the procedural means of removal enunciated in \u00a7 45a-242 that a removal may be initiated by the court\u2019s \u201cown motion or upon the application and complaint of any person interested or of the surety upon the fiduciary\u2019s probate bond, [and may be effectuated] after notice and hearing . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-242 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> As it is not implicated by this appeal, we express no opinion as to whether a fiduciary that has been removed from its position in violation of the antidiscrimination provision of \u00a7 45a-242 (a) possesses statutory aggrievement to maintain an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-243, or satisfies the standard for classical aggrievement and may maintain an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 45a-186.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> In these circumstances, we do not view the plaintiffs expectation as to future compensation for continued service as fiduciary as an adequate basis upon which classical aggrievement may be conferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
