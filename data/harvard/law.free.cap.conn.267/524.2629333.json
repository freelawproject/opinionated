The sole issue raised by this certified appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that a surety bond furnished in accordance with \u00a7 14-52 does not provide indemnity for that portion of a civil judgment against the dealer incorporating an award of attorney\u2019s fees or an award of punitive damages. We agree with the Appellate Court that attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages fall outside of the indemnification provisions of \u00a7 14-52 and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The following relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cThe underlying event in this case involved the plaintiff [Roxann Ames] and A.P.L. Auto Consulting, Inc., also known as Discount Auto Sales, a used automobile dealer (dealer). In 1995, the plaintiff purchased a motor vehicle from the dealer. Over protest by the plaintiff, in 1997, the dealer repossessed the vehicle. As a result of the repossession, the plaintiff filed an action [in 1997] against the dealer, alleging, [inter alia], breach of contract and unfair trade practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The plaintiff demanded statutory, actual, punitive and treble damages. [In 1998] [t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>court rendered a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff after the dealer failed to appear and awarded damages in the amount of $20,286.40 plus costs of $280.60. The award included [treble damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-564<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and $1000 in attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u201cSubsequently, the dealer went out of business and failed to pay the judgment. Pursuant to \u00a7 14-52, however, the dealer had obtained a surety bond for $20,000, which was issued by Western Surety [Company (Western Surety)] ,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the expiration of the 180 day waiting period of General Statutes \u00a7 52-400e,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> [the defendant, the commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner)] invoked the surety bond on the plaintiffs behalf. The commissioner noted the court\u2019s prior award of damages, but found that the plaintiff [had] suffered actual damages of $5650, an amount consisting of her down payment, financing payments] and costs. The commissioner then concluded that the balance of the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages was not \u2018recoverable under the subject bond,\u2019 as set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u00a7 14-52, and thus ordered Western Surety to pay $5650 to the state of Connecticut for the benefit of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff filed a petition for reconsideration, which the commissioner denied. The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In affirming the decision of the commissioner, the [trial] court concluded that \u00a7 14-52 . . . precludes an award of punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor </em>Vehicles, 70 Conn. App. 790, 792-93, 802 A.2d 126 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 804. Specifically, the Appellate Court concluded that the term \u201cany loss,\u201d as used in \u00a7 14-52 (b) (4), is \u201cboth generalized and ambiguous, and susceptible on its face to several different interpretations.\u201d Id., 798. The Appellate Court examined the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the surety bond clause of \u00a7 14-52 (b), as well as its relationship to similar legislation, and concluded that the legislature did not intend for the term \u201cany loss\u201d to encompass attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages. Id. In particular, the Appellate Court noted that the pertinent legislative history indicates an intent by the legislature to provide <em>some, </em>rather than complete, recourse for victims of fraudulent practices by motor vehicle dealers. Id., 798-99. The Appellate Court concluded that such recourse is limited to money that actually is <em>owed </em>to the consumer, and does not include any associated expenses or penalties. Id., 799-800. With regard to the plaintiffs claim for attorney\u2019s fees, the Appellate Court observed that, because Connecticut adheres to the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d which precludes the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>of express statutory or contractual language providing for such fees; e.g., <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 72-73, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997); the absence of such language in \u00a7 14-52 was a factor that weighed heavily against the plaintiffs interpretation of that statutory provision. <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 70 Conn. App. 800. Finally, the Appellate Court relied on the fact that a similar statute, namely, General Statutes \u00a7 14-176,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides that a person seeking to obtain a certificate of title to a motor vehicle may be required to furnish a surety bond when title is in question, expressly authorizes the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees against the bond, thereby indicating that if the legislature also had intended for \u00a7 14-52 to encompass attorney\u2019s fees, the legislature would have said so explicitly as it did in \u00a7 14-176. Id., 800-801.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-52, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees against the surety bond issued by . . . Western Surety . . . ?\u201d <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor </em>Vehicles, 261 Conn. 923, 806 A.2d 1058 (2002). We answer the certified question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We begin our review of the plaintiffs claim by noting that \u201cthe general purpose of a suretyship contract is to guard against loss in the event of the principal debtor\u2019s default. . . . [T]he obligation of a surety is an additional assurance to the one entitled to the performance of an act that the act will be performed. . . . [T]he liability of sureties is to be determined by the specified conditions of the bond .... [W]hen a bond is required by statute, a court will read the statute into the contract between the principal, surety and obligee.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southington v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>254 Conn. 348, 358-59, 757 A.2d 549 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Because this issue raises a question of statutory construction, our review is plenary. E.g., <em>Thames Talent, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>265 Conn. 127, 135, 827 A.2d 659 (2003). As with all such questions, we look first to the language of the statute. Id. General Statutes \u00a7 14-52 (b) provides in relevant part that each applicant for a used car dealer\u2019s license shall furnish a surety bond in the amount of $20,000 \u201cas indemnity for any loss sustained by any person by reason of . . . such licensee going out of business. . . .\u201d The bond is to be executed in the name of the state for the benefit of any aggrieved party, and the commissioner shall determine, after a hearing, the amount to which that aggrieved party is entitled under the bond. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-52 (b) (4). The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tiff asserts that she is entitled to recover not only actual damages but also punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees under the bond. In support of her contention, she claims that the term \u201cany loss\u201d contained in \u00a7 14-52 (b) (4) \u201cis an all encompassing term which contains no hint of an exception.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We agree with the Appellate Court that the term \u201cany loss,\u201d as used in \u00a7 14-52 (b) (4), is facially susceptible to more than one interpretation. See <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 70 Conn. App. 798. \u201cIn inteipreting statutes that contain the word \u2018any,\u2019 we have recognized that \u2018any\u2019 can have a variety of meanings. . . . The word \u2018any\u2019 can be used to denote \u2018all,\u2019 \u2018every,\u2019 \u2018some\u2019 or \u2018one.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Industrial Risk Insurers </em>v. <em>Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection &amp; Ins. Co., </em>258 Conn. 101, 117, 779 A.2d 737 (2001). \u201cIts meaning in a given statute depends upon the context and subject matter of the statute.\u201d <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>214 Conn. 407, 428, 572 A.2d 951 (1990). Similarly, \u201c \u2018[l]oss\u2019 has been held synonymous with deprivation, detriment and injury. ... It is a generic and relative term.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>184 Conn. 607, 613, 440 A.2d 810 (1981). We therefore must look to the particular statutory context in which the term \u201cany loss\u201d is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201cA fundamental tenet of statutory construction is that statutes are to be considered to give effect to the apparent intention of the lawmaking body.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 309, 592 A.2d 953 (1991). \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1. Inasmuch as \u00a7 14-52 is not \u201cplain and unambiguous,\u201d we look to other factors relevant to our inquiry into its meaning, including the legislative history of the statute, the circumstances surrounding its enactment and its purpose. E.g., <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 310. We are mindful, moreover, that, \u201c[i]n determining whether ... a statute abrogates or modifies a common law rule the construction must be strict, and the operation of a statute in derogation of the common law is to be limited to matters clearly brought within its scope.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rumbin </em>v. <em>Utica Mutual Ins. Co., </em>254 Conn. 259, 265, 757 A.2d 526 (2000). Thus, \u201c[n]o statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import [and ... a statute] is not to be construed as making any innovation upon the common law which it does not fairly express.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>230 Conn. 427, 433, 646 A.2d 85 (1994). \u201cWe recognize only those alterations of the common law that are clearly expressed in the language of the statute because the traditional principles of justice upon which the common law is founded should be perpetuated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rumbin </em>v. <em>Utica Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u201cThe common law rule in Connecticut, also known as the American Rule, is that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 93-94, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994). \u201cBecause we must respect the legislative prerogative of choosing the special circumstances under which [attorney\u2019s fees] awards may be made . . .' we require a clear expression of the legislature\u2019s intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>create a statutory exception [to the rule].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 94. Examples of such clearly articulated statutory exceptions to our common-law rule include General Statutes \u00a7 14-106b (d) (in action to recover damages for odometer tampering, defendant shall be liable for, inter alia, \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d), General Statutes \u00a7 14-145c (allowing \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d in action to recover damages for improper towing or removal of automobile by owner or lessee of private property), General Statutes \u00a7 52-240a (if court determines that claim or defense in product liability action is frivolous, it \u201cmay award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d to prevailing party), General Statutes \u00a7 52-251b (a) (in action brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-58 to recover damages for deprivation of civil rights, court may award prevailing party, inter alia, \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d), and General Statutes \u00a7 52-25Id (a) (in civil actions to establish paternity or in certain actions to establish, modify or enforce child support orders, \u201cthe court may allow the state, when it is the prevailing party, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d). Thus, it is apparent that \u201cwhen the General Assembly want[s] to authorize the award of attorney\u2019s fees it kn[ows] how to do it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>supra, 94. Section 14-52, however, is devoid of any express language authorizing an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In the absence of such language, we will not presume that the legislature intended for \u00a7 14-52 to operate in derogation of our long-standing common-law rule disfavoring the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The plaintiff asserts that \u00a7 14-176<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides support for her contention that attorney\u2019s fees fall within the purview of \u00a7 14-52. On the contrary, we agree with the Appellate Court that \u00a7 14-176 militates <em>against </em>the construction of \u00a7 14-52 advanced by the plaintiff. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u00a7 14-176, a person applying for a certificate of title to a motor vehicle may be required to post bond as a condition of receipt of the certificate. General Statutes \u00a7 14-176 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe bond shall be in an amount equal to twice the value of the vehicle as determined by the commissioner and conditioned to indemnify any prior owner and lienholder and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle . . . against any expense, loss or damage, <em>including reasonable attorney\u2019s </em>fees, by reason of the issuance of the certificate of title . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff contends that because the legislature has deemed attorney\u2019s fees to be included within the phrase <em>\u201cany </em>expense, <em>loss </em>or damage\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 14-176, the legislature also intended that attorney\u2019s fees shall constitute a component of the term \u201cany loss\u201d contained in \u00a7 14-52. (Emphasis added.) We disagree:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">First, the plaintiffs contention is contrary to the principle that, \u201c[w]here a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed. . . . That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because [t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717, 674 A.2d 845 (1996). Moreover, as we have explained, the construction of \u00a7 14-52 urged by the plaintiff contravenes the principle that, when an entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees is claimed, we require a clear expression of the legislature\u2019s intent to create an exception to our long-standing common-law rule barring the recovery of such fees. E.g., <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Gar-nett, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 93-94. Finally, it is reasonable to presume that the legislature considered attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>fees to be an \u201cexpense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14-176, rather than a component of any \u201closs\u201d or \u201cdamage,\u201d because attorney\u2019s fees are a cost, or expense, frequently associated with litigation. See, e.g., <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 832, 614 A.2d 414 (1992) (noting that \u201c[l]itigation expenses may include . . . [inter alia] attorney\u2019s fees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The plaintiff also contends that the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 14-52 is inconsistent with our holding in <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 596, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989), in which we concluded that arbitrators have authority to award attorney\u2019s fees under the provisions of Connecticut\u2019s Lemon Law. See generally General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-179 through 42-190. The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Maiocco </em>is misplaced. In <em>Maiocco, </em>the issue was not whether attorney\u2019s fees are permitted under the Lemon Law; they clearly are, and we cited to \u201cthe four separate statutory areas involved in the overall Lemon Law apparatus that [expressly] authorize payment of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>supra, 586. The sole issue we addressed, rather, was whether a Lemon Law arbitrator is authorized to award such fees in the absence of explicit provisions in the Lemon Law providing such authorization. See id., 580. After reviewing the relevant statutory language, history and purpose, we concluded that the legislature intended to authorize Lemon Law arbitrators to award attorney\u2019s fees. Id., 596. <em>Maiocco </em>is therefore inapposite inasmuch as it involved the question of <em>who </em>is authorized to award attorney\u2019s fees under the Lemon Law rather than <em>whether </em>such an award is authorized thereunder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>We also reject the plaintiffs claim that she is entitled to recover punitive damages against a surety bond furnished in accordance with \u00a7 14-52. In particular, the plaintiff seeks indemnification under \u00a7 14-52 for the treble damages that she was awarded pursuant to \u00a7 52-564. An award of multiple damages, however, is an extraordinary remedy that is available only when the legislature expressly provides for such damages by statute. E.g., <em>DeMilo </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>189 Conn. 671, 675-76, 458 A.2d 362 (1983); <em>Alaimo </em>v. <em>Royer, </em>188 Conn. 36, 43, 448 A.2d 207 (1982). Accordingly, as with attorney\u2019s fees, we require explicit statutory language to support an award of punitive damages. Put simply, just as the legislature knows how to authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees when it wishes to do so; see <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 94; it also knows how to authorize an award of punitive damages. E.g., General Statutes \u00a7 4d-39 (c) (in action by attorney general to prosecute violation under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4d-36, 4d-37 or 4d-38, court may \u201caward [inter alia] punitive damages\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 16-8d (b) (in action by employee alleging retaliation for disclosure of substantial misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in management of, inter alia, public service company, court \u201cmay award punitive damages\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-550 (e) (\u201cpunitive damages may be assessed\u201d in civil action in which there is finding of wilful or reckless deprivation of rights under patients\u2019 bill of rights implemented in accordance with \u00a7 19a-550); General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a (b) (in action alleging retaliation against employee for filing workers\u2019 compensation claim, \u201ccourt may . . . award punitive damages\u201d). Because \u00a7 14-52 makes no mention of punitive damages, the plaintiff cannot prevail on her claim that she may recover such damages under \u00a7 14-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Finally, as the Appellate Court explained; see <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 70 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>App. 798-99; the legislative history of \u00a7 14-52 supports the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to authorize the recovery of either attorney\u2019s fees or punitive damages against a surety bond furnished pursuant to \u00a7 14-52. In 1984, the legislature amended \u00a7 14-52 to \u201crequire applicants for motor vehicle dealer or repair licenses to post surety bonds executed in the name of the state in order to provide security for those consumers who are provided services by those individuals.\u201d 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1984 Sess., p. 2708, remarks of Representative Christine M. Niedermeier; see Public Acts 1984, No. 84-508. In explaining the purpose and need for the amendment, Representative Niedermeier explained: \u201c[V]ery often motor vehicle repairers and others go out of business and they at that point owe money to various consumers, and there is no avenue for recovery. These bonds would provide <em>some </em>financial security to enable consumers to obtain <em>reimbursement </em>for <em>money owed </em>to them.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 27 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 2709. It is unlikely that a surety bond that was intended to provide <em>\u201csome </em>financial security\u201d to consumers in the form of <em>\u201creimbursement </em>for <em>money owed </em>to them\u201d; (emphasis added) id.; also was intended to indemnify consumers for attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages. Indeed, the fact that the bond amount was set at $5000 in 1984 and only raised to $20,000 in 1993 to adjust for inflation; see 36 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1993 Sess., p. 3219, remarks of Senator Winthrop S. Smith, Jr.; underscores this point; had the legislature intended for the dealer\u2019s bond to indemnify consumers beyond their actual or compensatory damages, the legislature likely would have mandated a significantly larger bond, as it has done in other statutory contexts. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 8-25 (a) (authorizing planning commission to accept surety bond in amount sufficient to secure \u201cto the municipality the actual construction, maintenance and installation of . . . improvements and utilities\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>approved by commission in accordance with plan to subdivide land); General Statutes \u00a7 49-41 (a) (certain state or municipal construction contracts shall include provision requiring person or entity performing contract to furnish surety bond for full amount of contract price \u201cfor the protection of persons supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of work provided for in the contract for the use of each such person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The plaintiff finally argues that public policy considerations militate in favor of her proposed construction of \u00a7 14-52. The plaintiffs primary contention in this regard is that the statutory suretyship created under \u00a7 14-52 is intended to protect consumers and, therefore, should be construed broadly to accomplish its purpose. We agree with the plaintiff regarding the beneficent purpose of \u00a7 14-52. For the reasons that we already have articulated, however, we are not persuaded that it is susceptible to the interpretation urged by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The determination of whether reasons of public policy exist to expand the reach of \u00a7 14-52 to encompass attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages is for the legislature, not this court, to make.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A_J\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-52 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No person, firm or corporation may engage in the business of the buying, selling, offering for sale or brokerage of any motor vehicle or the repairing of any motor vehicle without having been issued either a new car dealer\u2019s, a used car dealer\u2019s, a repairer\u2019s or a limited repairer\u2019s license. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">\u201c(b) . . .

The cases cited by the plaintiff are unavailing, however, because they involve statutory provisions that bear no material similarity to \u00a7 14-52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> We note that, at least with respect to her claim for attorney\u2019s fees, the plaintiff relies largely on <em>State ex rel. Webb </em>v. <em>Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., </em>956 S. W.2d 272 (Mo. App. 1997) <em>(Webb). </em>Unlike \u00a7 14-52, however, the Missouri automobile dealer bond statute at issue in <em>Webb </em>required an injured party to obtain a final judgment against the dealer from a court of competent jurisdiction before the bond could be invoked. Id., 275; see Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 301.560.1 (4) (Cum. Sup. 1993). In holding that attorney\u2019s fees were recoverable under the Missouri statute, the Missouri Court of Appeals reasoned: \u201cThe statute which requires the bond, and specifies what the bond must cover, contemplates that the injured party will necessarily incur attorney fees in obtaining the required judgment against the dealer. . . . Consequently, it is clear that the parties intended that attorney fees be a \u2018loss\u2019 subject to the bond\u2019s indemnity.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Webb </em>v. <em>Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 275. Inasmuch as \u00a7 14-52 permits an aggrieved party to raise a claim directly with the commissioner, the plaintiff derives no support from the rationale underlying the court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Webb.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> Our interpretation of \u00a7' 14-52 also is supported by the Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty, \u00a7 73, pp. 290-91 (1996) (\u201c[wjhen the secondary obligation is a legally mandated bond, that obligation does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>include any penalties imposed on the principal obligor for failure to fulfill the underlying obligation unless the secondary obligation so provides\u201d), and by what appears to be the weight of authority on the issue.
