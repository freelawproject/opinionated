The case was tried before a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff, Kevin Daley, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment rendered in accordance with the verdict,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming that: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the prior consistent statement; and (2) this abuse of discretion constituted harmful error. In response, the defendant contends that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the prior consistent statement. We agree with the defendant, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The record reveals that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 15, 1993, a one car accident caused extensive damage to a utility pole in Orange, and left the attached utility lines hanging low over the roadway. The plaintiff, along with several other Southern New England Telephone Company (telephone company) employees, was dispatched by the telephone company to reset the pole and fix the wires. The defendant, a police officer for the town of Orange, was assigned to monitor traffic at the worksite. Prior to the completion of the road crew\u2019s work, the defendant left the worksite. After the defendant had departed, a tractor trailer driven by William McClintock passed by the worksite and snagged the overhanging utility wires. The resulting tension caused a utility pole to come crashing down on the plaintiff, causing him severe physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">At trial, the defendant introduced testimony from McClintock as to the location of the telephone company road crew at the time of the accident. On cross-examination, the plaintiff impeached McClintock\u2019s testimony through a prior inconsistent statement and through a suggestion of recent contrivance. See footnote 6 of this opinion. On redirect examination, the defendant, over the objection of the plaintiff, was allowed to introduce a prior consistent statement given by McClintock in order to rehabilitate his credibility. The prior consistent statement was McClintock\u2019s testimony in a deposition that had been taken four years after the accident had occurred, while he was named as a defendant in the present case. See footnote 1 of this opinion. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant. The trial court accepted the jury\u2019s verdict, denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict, and rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cIt is well settled that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are entitled to great deference. . . . The trial court is given broad latitude in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will not disturb such a ruling unless it is shown that the ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>262 Conn. 11, 28-29, 807 A.2d 955 (2002); <em>Pestey </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>259 Conn. 345, 368-69, 788 A.2d 496 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>252 Conn. 318, 326, 746 A.2d 761 (2000). \u201cEven when a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is deemed to be improper, we must determine whether that ruling was so harmful as to require a new trial. ... In other words, an evidentiary ruling will result in a new trial only if the ruling was both wrong and harmful. . . . Finally, the standard in a civil case for determining whether an improper ruling was harmful is whether the . . . ruling [likely] would [have] affect[ed] the result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ryan Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>M &amp; G Associates, </em>266 Conn. 520, 530, 832 A.2d 1180 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Concerning the admissibility of a prior consistent statement, the \u201cgeneral rule is that a party cannot strengthen the testimony of his own witness by showing that he has made previous statements to the same effect as his testimony .... <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hartford Dredging Co., </em>73 Conn. 182, 188, 47 A. 125 (1900). [This court] recognized in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Ganezer, </em>137 Conn. 415, 78 A.2d 539 [1951], that prior consistent statements may be admitted in certain limited situations and that the determination of this issue is left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>169 Conn. 161, 168, 362 A.2d 808 (1975).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>179 Conn. 1, 18, 425 A.2d 924 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Section 6-11 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence sets forth three limited situations in which the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>consistent statement of a witness is admissible: \u201cIf the credibility of a witness is impeached by (1) a prior inconsistent statement of the witness, (2) a suggestion of bias, interest or improper motive that was not present at the time the witness made the prior consistent statement, or (3) a suggestion of recent contrivance, evidence of a prior consistent statement made by the witness is admissible, in the discretion of the court, to rebut the impeachment.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 77, 530 A.2d 155 (1987) (recognizing same three exceptions at common law prior to adoption of Code of Evidence). In the present case, the plaintiff claims that the trial court abused its discretion because McClintock\u2019s prior consistent statement does not fall within any of the three exceptions set forth in \u00a7 6-11 (b). We disagree, and we conclude that McClintock\u2019s statement properly was admitted under subdivision (3) of \u00a7 6-11 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Before turning to the specific claims raised by the plaintiff, we first must address the defendant\u2019s claim that the plaintiff failed to articulate properly at trial the basis for his objection and, therefore, he failed to preserve the record properly for appellate review. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u201cThe standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. This court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. ... In order to preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. ... In objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a reviewable ruling. . . . Once counsel states the authority and ground of his objection, any appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>will be limited to the ground asserted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Technologies Corp. </em>v. <em>East Windsor, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 30; see Practice Book \u00a7 5-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Our review of the record indicates that the plaintiff made an objection that, while not the most artful, sufficiently alerted both the trial court and the defendant to the precise nature of the objection. When the defendant began to ask questions about McClintock\u2019s prior deposition, the plaintiff indicated that he would like to object at sidebar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the sidebar had concluded, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>questioning of the witness once again reached the point where the deposition was being explored, the plaintiff stated, \u201cYour Honor, for the record, I object.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff properly preserved the record for appeal, and we will review his claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting McClintock\u2019s prior consistent statement under \u00a7 6-11 (b) (3) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">During his cross-examination of McClintock, the plaintiff highlighted the fact that McClintock\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the initial statement that he gave to an insurance investigator shortly after the accident had occurred. In addition, the plaintiff suggested that McClintock had contrived his testimony after conferring with the defendant\u2019s attorney that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>morning, prior to his taking the witness stand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order to rebut this suggestion of recent contrivance, the defendant introduced, over the plaintiffs objection, testimony that McClintock had given in a pretrial deposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tion. In that deposition, while under oath, McClintock testified just as he had at trial\u2014that he saw workers drinking coffee at the scene immediately prior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Before we address the defendant\u2019s claim, we first reemphasize that the Connecticut Code of Evidence, as adopted by the judges of the Superior Court in 1999, was intended to restate, in codified form, \u201cConnecticut case law regarding rules of evidence as rules of court . . . .\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 1-2 (a). As Justice Borden has explained, the Code of Evidence is a \u201c \u2018code\u2019 in the sense of a set of general statements of rules embodied in the prior case law, without, however, being an attempt to restate every nuance, exception and different application of the rules of evidence expressed in that case law. That is why the Commentary accompanies each section, because that Commentary points to the general case law that the Code attempted to codify.\u201d D. Borden, \u201cThe New Code of Evidence: A (Very) Brief Introduction and Overview,\u201d 73 Conn. B.J. 210, 212 (1999). Furthermore, unlike in other situations, \u201cin adopting the Code the Judges formally adopted the Commentary as well. . . . Thus, the Code must be read together with its Commentary in order for it to be fully and properly understood.\u201d Id., 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The plaintiff claims that <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 98, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983), requires that a trial court, before it may admit a prior consistent statement to rebut a suggestion of recent contrivance, must find: \u201c(1) that the prior statement was made at a time when it would have been natural to make it, independent of its potential use in court; and (2) that the witness has been impeached by a suggestion of recent fabrication.\u201d We disagree with the plaintiffs characterization of the precedential value of <em>Ouellette.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">In <em>Ouellette, </em>after a trial to a jury, the defendant was found guilty of risk of injury to a child. Id., 85. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>appeal, the defendant claimed, among other things, that the trial court improperly admitted prior consistent statements as constancy of accusation evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 86. Although <em>Ouellette </em>did not involve a suggestion of recent contrivance, this court noted that \u201c[b]ecause the rationale of the constancy of accusation exception so clearly suggests the recent contrivance or fabrication exception, there is no analytical reason to approach them differently.\u201d Id., 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Turning to its analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim, this court set forth a new two part test governing the admissibility of prior consistent statements offered either to rebut a charge of recent contrivance or as constancy of accusation evidence. That test, supported by citations to two Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions, stated that a prior consistent statement is admissible to rebut a charge of recent contrivance or as constancy of accusation evidence when the trial court finds: \u201cfirst that the statement was made at a time when it was natural to make it; [and] second that the witness has been impeached by a suggestion of recent contrivance.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because that test had not been applied to the constancy of accusation evidence, the court held that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>was error to admit it, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Id., 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Thus, after <em>Ouellette, </em>it appeared that the two part test was applicable to the analysis of prior consistent statements offered as constancy of accusation evidence or to rebut a suggestion of recent fabrication. Since <em>Ouellette </em>was decided, however, this court has modified the application of that test. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>219 Conn. 283, 289, 592 A.2d 943 (1991), this court reviewed <em>Ouellette </em>and concluded: \u201cWhile phrased in terms of a rule to be applied in future cases involving constancy of accusation evidence . . . the [test] announced in <em>Ouellette </em>was not essential to the outcome of that case. . . . Consequently, the [test] was merely dictum, without the force of precedent insofar as proper constancy evidence is concerned.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">After concluding that <em>Ouellette </em>was not binding precedent, this court then declined formally to adopt the two part test. This conclusion was supported by three reasons. First, its adoption \u201ceffectively would overrule a long line of precedent in the constancy of accusation context with which that dictum directly conflicts.\u201d Id. Second, \u201ccontrary to the dictum in <em>Ouellette, </em>the term \u2018natural\u2019 as employed in our prior caselaw was not connected to any preliminary issue of admissibility for the trial court\u2019s resolution.\u201d Id., 290. Finally, \u201cagain conflicting with the dictum in <em>Ouellette, </em>the significance of the timing of a victim\u2019s report of the incident traditionally was a matter to be considered by the jury, exclusively, in evaluating the victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d Id., 291. For all of those reasons, this court \u201cdiscard[ed] the dictum in <em>Ouellette </em>to the extent that it pertains to constancy of accusation evidence . . . .\u201d Id., 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">At the present time, therefore, the two part test set forth in dictum in <em>Ouellette </em>has been rejected for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>stancy of accusation evidence, but, as the plaintiff in the present case suggests, it may be applicable to prior consistent statements offered to rebut a suggestion of recent fabrication. In order to resolve this confusion, we take this opportunity expressly to \u201cdiscard the dictum in <em>Ouellette </em>to the extent that it pertains to [prior consistent statements offered to rebut a suggestion of recent contrivance], and we reaffirm our precedents prior to <em>Ouellette </em>that leave the evaluation of the timing of a [witness\u2019 prior consistent] statements and any \u2018naturalness\u2019 thereof in the hands of the jury.\u201d Id. In reaching this conclusion, we are persuaded that all of the rationales set forth in <em>Parris </em>are equally as applicable to the recent contrivance exception as to the constancy of accusation exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In addition, we note that the two Pennsylvania cases cited by <em>Ouellette </em>lend no support to the first prong of the two part test: that a prior consistent statement offered to rebut a charge of recent contrivance must be \u201cmade at a time when it was natural to make it . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 99. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>490 Pa. 544, 558, 417 A.2d 173 (1980), the Pennsylvania court merely stated that \u201c[i]t is settled that prior consistent statements are admissible if relevant to rebut a suggestion of recent fabrication.\u201d The second case cited by <em>Ouellette, </em>as well as by <em>Byrd, </em>is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>394 Pa. 588, 603, 148 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 844, 80 S. Ct. 97, 4 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1959), in which the only relevant statement is that \u201c[e]vidence of consonant statements, if admissible, are admissible only in rebuttal and then only for the purpose of showing that that which the witness now testifies to has not been recently fabricated and not for the purpose of proving the truth of the present testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Having concluded that the dictum in <em>Ouellette </em>is not applicable to our analysis, we once again state that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>when a suggestion of recent contrivance has arisen,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the determination of whether to allow the introduction of a prior consistent statement for rebuttal purposes is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (b) (3); <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>179 Conn. 1, 18, 425 A.2d 924 (1979). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n stating that evidence of a witness\u2019 prior consistent statement is admissible \u2018in the discretion of the court,\u2019 Section 6-11 stresses the broad discretion afforded the trial judge in admitting this type of evidence.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11, commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In the present case, the trial court acted well within its discretion in allowing the defendant to introduce prior deposition testimony to rebut a suggestion that McClintock contrived his testimony after talking to the defendant\u2019s attorney on the morning of his testimony. This testimony was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted but, rather, for the limited purpose of rehabilitating McClintock\u2019s credibility,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which had been impeached by virtue of the plaintiffs suggestion that he had contrived his testimony after a conversation with the defendant\u2019s attorney that morning. By introducing McClintock\u2019s prior consistent statement, the defendant sought to establish that McClintock had given similar testimony before the alleged conversation with the defendant\u2019s attorney had occurred. McClintock\u2019s deposition testimony was made prior to the time of suggested contrivance, was consistent with his testimony at trial and, therefore, was, within the trial court\u2019s discretion, an appropriate source of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The plaintiff claims, however, that since McClintock was named as a defendant at the time of the deposition, he was biased against the plaintiff, and, therefore, his deposition testimony was an inappropriate source of rehabilitation. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (b) (2) (allowing use of prior consistent statement to rebut \u201ca suggestion of bias, interest or improper motive <em>that was not present at the time the witness made the prior consistent statement\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). This claim improperly conflates the requirements of subdivisions (2) and (3) of \u00a7 6-11 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Under subdivision (2) of \u00a7 6-11 (b) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, a prior consistent statement must have been made before the bias, interest or improper motive arose in the witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>178 Conn. 564, 570-71, 424 A.2d 266 (1979). Subdivision (2), however, is not applicable to a prior consistent statement offered to rebut a suggestion of recent contrivance. In the present case, the plaintiff clearly suggested that McClintock had contrived his testimony after talking with the defendant\u2019s attorney on the morning he took the witness stand; see footnote 6 of this opinion; thereby implicating subdivision (3) of \u00a7 6-11 (b). Any consistent statement given by McClintock prior to that morning, namely, the time of suggested contrivance, became an appropriate source of rehabilitation, regardless of whether McClintock may have been biased or had an interest at the time of that prior statement due to his status as a defendant. Any bias that McClintock harbored at the time of the deposition, which was taken four years prior to the trial, is irrelevant to the determination of whether he contrived his testimony after talking with the defendant\u2019s attorney that morning, prior to his taking the witness stand.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u201cAs Justice Story explained: \u2018[W]here the testimony is assailed as a fabrication of a recent date ... in order to repel such imputation, proof of the <em>antecedent </em>declaration of the party may be admitted.\u2019 <em>Ellicott </em>v. <em>Pearl, </em>[35 U.S. (10 Peters) 412,439, 9 L. Ed. 475 (1836)].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Tome </em>v. <em>United States, </em>513 U.S. 150, 156, 115 S. Ct. 696, 130 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1995). The rationale behind this statement is that \u201c \u2018[a] consistent statement, [made] at a time prior to [the suggested time of contrivance] will effectively explain away the force of the impeaching evidence; because it is thus made to appear that the statement in the form now uttered was independent of the discrediting influence.\u2019 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. 1972) \u00a7 1128, p. 268.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vines, </em>71 Conn. App. 359, 371, 801 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 939, 808 A.2d 1134 (2002). In the present case, McClintock\u2019s prior consistent statement dispels the plaintiffs charge that he had contrived his testimony after talking with the defendant\u2019s attorney that morning, prior to his taking the witness stand. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse the discretion afforded to it by \u00a7 6-11 (b) (3) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence in admitting McClintock\u2019s prior consistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> The plaintiff originally brought a negligence action for personal injuries against the following defendants: George Geane, William McClintock, Anthony Cuzzo, Eagle Leasing Company, the town of Orange, Sorenson Trucking Company, Michael Okrent and Elliot Okrent.

Because we conclude that the statement properly was admitted under \u00a7 6-11 (b) (3), we need not address these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-5\"> On direct examination of McClintock, the following exchange occurred between Stephen Fogerty, the defendant\u2019s attorney, and the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">\u201c[Fogerty]: Did you see\u2014Did you see any [telephone company] employees as you approached the intersection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201c[McClintock]: Yes. They were either behind the left first truck or the left second truck, I\u2019m not even sure, and they all had coffee cups in their hands, or at least the first two that I noticed. I believe there was a group of four of them back there. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">Subsequently, on cross-examination, the following colloquy occurred between Michael Stratton, the plaintiffs attorney, and McClintock:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">\u201c[Stratton]: Sir, in your [prior inconsistent] statement you actually\u2014 There\u2019s no mention in here about [telephone company] guys eating donuts by the side of the road, are there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">\u201c[McClintock]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-11\">\u201c[Stratton]: There isn\u2019t, is there?

Therefore, within <em>Ouellette, </em>there are two different versions of the test set forth: one linking admissibility to a statement\u2019s potential use in court, and one not. Compare id., 98 (with qualifying phrase) with id., 99 (without qualifying phrase). For two reasons, we conclude that the second formulation, without the qualifying phrase, is the operative test. First, the test with the qualifying phrase is not supported by citations to any legal authority, while the test without the qualifying phrase is supported by citations to two Pennsylvania Supreme Court cases. Second, the test without the qualifying phrase is the version that has been cited subsequently by this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>219 Conn. 283, 288-89, 592 A.2d 943 (1991) (citing, yet declining to apply, version without qualifying phrase).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b430-6\"> Although the suggestion of recent contrivance was explicit in the present case, we note that it may also arise by implication. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 804-805, 709 A.2d 522 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> It is well settled that \u201c[w]here the prior consistent statement becomes admissible, it may not be used as substantive evidence of the facts contained therein, but only to rehabilitate the credibility of the witness which has been attacked.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (83-FG), </em>190 Conn. 715, 728, 463 A.2d 533 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>178 Conn. 564, 569, 424 A.2d 266 (1979); see also Conn.
