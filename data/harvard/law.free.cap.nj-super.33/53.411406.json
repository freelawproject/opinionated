J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AbR\">This is an auto accident case, raising a question of evidence. The question is this: did the trial court err in admitting the testimony of a witness, Eichard Ilollyer, that perhaps a minute before the accident and about three-quarters of a mile away from it, he was passed by a car which he described as \u201csimilar\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s car and which was then proceeding toward the scene of the accident at a speed quite a bit faster than 45 miles per hour? A verdict of no cause for action was returned. Plaintiff appeals. We are concerned only with the objections raised in the trial court as to this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Plaintiff was driving his black Oldsmobile at night north on Eoute 25 in Woodbridge, N. J., when it hit defendant\u2019s trailer in the rear as the tractor-trailer, which also had been going north, endeavored to make a* left turn off the highway. Ilollyer, likewise bound north in his car, arrived at the place of the accident, perhaps a minute or so after being passed by the car above mentioned. In fact his was the first northbound car to stop at the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>No question is raised as to the admission of a lay opinion oil the matter of speed and identity. <em>Gretowski v. Hall Motor Express, </em>25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>192, 196 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953); 7 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), </em>\u00a7 1977 <em>et seq. </em>But much stress is put upon the fact that Hollyer did not definitely identify the plaintiff\u2019s car. When he was asked \u201cWhy did you give the driver [of the truck] your name?,\u201d Hollyer answered \u201cWell <em>the </em>car had passed me earlier.\u201d Later when cross-examined by counsel for the other side, he said \u201cI thought it was the same car.\u201d At another point he testified that it was \u201csimilar\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s car and that it was \u201ca black sedan or a black closed car\u201d \u2014 a description applicable to plaintiff\u2019s auto. However, though he had an opportunity to see the auto, he could not testify to its make, nor could he say under oath that the car which passed him was the plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">On the question of plaintiff\u2019s speed at the time of the collision, there was circumstantial evidence apart from Hollyer\u2019s testimony \u2014 including skid marks 87 feet long leading up to the place on the highway where the rear of plaintiff\u2019s car came to rest after the accident. Besides there was proof that Hollyer\u2019s car hit the 10-ton tractor-trailer so hard as not only to push it 15-20 feet westerly into the southbound lane and knock off completely its rear right wheels but also to demolish entirely the front of plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Upon inspection, the question at hand breaks up into three points, and each point rests, it will be found, upon a proposition of law of a rather fundamental character. There is, first, a question as to whether testimony as to identity is admissible even though it is not definite; second, a question as to whether the speed of a car at one place is evidentiary as to its speed at another place; and, third, a question involving both identity and speed, namely, whether the testimony thereof was inadmissible because it was too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The first point is that the testimony was not admissible because the car which passed Hollyer was not definitely identified by him as the plaintiff\u2019s car. But a witness\u2019s testimony may be admissible, though he is not positive. Where (as here) a witness\u2019 has actually observed a fact, but there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>has been some deficiency in the observation or in his recollection of it, the lack of definiteness on his part goes to the weight of his testimony, not to its admissibility. <em>2 Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 658(1), 659, 660; 3 <em>Ibid. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>727, </em>728; see 7 <em>Ibid. </em>\u00a7 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">This is settled law in nearly all jurisdictions, and a few cases will serve to illustrate the point. <em>Craig v. State, </em>171 <em>Ind. </em>317, 86 <em>N. E. </em>397, 400 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1908); <em>State v. Richards, </em>126 <em>Iowa </em>497, 102 <em>N. W. </em>439, 440 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1905) ; <em>Commonwealth v. Cunningham, </em>104 <em>Mass. </em>545 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1870); <em>Commonwealth v. Kennedy, </em>170 <em>Mass. </em>18, 48 <em>N. E. </em>770, 772 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1897); <em>People v. Stanley, </em>101 <em>Mich. </em>93, 59 <em>N. </em>W. 498, 499 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1894); <em>Auerbach v. United States, </em>136 <em>F. 2d </em>882, 885 <em>(C. C. A. </em>6, 1943); <em>Fryer v. Cathercole, </em>4 <em>Ex. </em>262, 154 <em>Eng. Rep. </em>1209 <em>(Ex. </em>1849); <em>L. R. A. </em>1918A 713-719; <em>4 A. L. R. </em>979; <em>cf. State v. Young, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>501, 507 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1922); <em>Eberle v. Stegman, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>879 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1923); <em>Gretowski v. Hall Motor Express, </em>25 <em>N. J. Super. </em>192, 196 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">On the first point, then, the testimony of a witness may be admissible though he is not definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">The second point has to do with the matter of relevancy, namely, whether the speed of plaintiff\u2019s auto at one place on Boute 25 is evidentiary as to its speed at another place three-quarters of a mile away and perhaps a minute later.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The fundamental proposition involved here is that all relevant evidence is to be admitted unless some specific rule forbids it. <em>In re Vince, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>443, 457 (1949); <em>Uniform Rules of Evidence </em>approved 1953 by American Bar Association, American Law Institute and National Conference on Uniform State Laws, <em>Rule 7(f); Model Code of Evidence, Rule 9(f) </em>1942; <em>Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence </em>(1898), 265, 269, 530. By relevant evidence is meant any evidence having a tendency in reason to prove a matter in issue. <em>Rule </em>1, <em>Uniform Rules </em>and <em>Model Code, supra; Feickert v. Feickert, </em>98 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>444, 452 <em>(Ch. </em>1926); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Fishman v. Consumers Brewing Co., </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>300, 302 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">It might be noticed that Wigmore (1 <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a728, but see \u00a7 10) and some authorities disagree with the fundamental proposition above stated, holding that evidence to be admissible must have, not merely relevancy, but \u201clegal relevancy.\u201d Evidence, Wigmore goes on to say, cannot be submitted to a jury unless it has a higher degree of probative value than would be asked in ordinary reasoning. New Jersey does not accept this concept of legal relevancy, and it has been rejected by the <em>Uniform Rules </em>and the <em>Model Code. Morgan Model Code, supra, pp. </em>31-34; <em>James, </em>29 <em>Cal L. Rev. </em>689 (1941); <em>Trautman, </em>5 <em>Vanderbilt L. Rev. </em>385 (1952); <em>cf. Montrose, </em>70 <em>L. Q. Rev. </em>527, 555 (1954). As stated in the <em>Model Code, supra, p. </em>178, \"it would be as futile as it would be unwise to attempt to prescribe measurements of logical value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In the instant matter we must ask ourselves, then, whether there is such a possibility of continuity in speed on Route 25 under the circumstances here that proof of speed at one place could be said to have any tendency in reason to prove the speed at the other place. Under circumstances comparable in a measure, such testimony has been held relevant. <em>State v. Weiner, </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>46, 48 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1925); see <em>Baus v. Trenton and Mercer County Traction Corp., </em>102 <em>N..J. L. </em>1 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1925), affirmed 102 <em>N. J. L. </em>at <em>page </em>712 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Plaintiff cites eases to the contrary, but they will be found to represent a minority view. 2 <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 382, <em>n. 10. </em>It may be helpful to list authorities having some pertinency here. <em>Jennings v.

Ct. </em>1945), distinguishable and somewhat criticized by Wigmore in 2, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 661, <em>n. </em>7; <em>cf. Gerhart v. East Coast Coach Co., </em>310 <em>Pa. </em>535, 166 <em>A. </em>564 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1933); <em>Ronning v. State, </em>184 <em>Wis. </em>651, 200 <em>N. W. </em>394 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1924) criticized by 2 <em>Wigmore, supra, </em>\u00a7 382, <em>n. </em>10, as \u201cunsound\u201d; <em>cf. People v. Curtis, </em>217 <em>N. Y. </em>304, 112 <em>N. E. </em>54, 56 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On the second point \u2014 having in view especially that the accident happened quite soon alter Hollyer saw the car \u2014 \u25a0 we think there was relevancy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The third point of the case goes to the remoteness of Hollyer\u2019s testimony. The proof as to speed, under the circumstances here, three-quarters of a mile from the collision, was in some degree remote; but, as the above cases cited on the point of relevancy establish, the admissibility of such proof as this lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion. However, Hollyer\u2019s indefiniteness on the matter of identity adds to the testimony another item of none too strong probative force. It may be said, then, that a certain remoteness as to the matter of speed is compounded with a certain remoteness as to the matter of identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">A trial judge in his discretion may exclude evidence if he finds its probative usefulness is substantially outweighed by the risk that it will lead to either undue prejudice, undue consumption of time, confusion of issues or unfair surprise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>an adversary. <em>Dolan v. Newark Iron &amp; Metal Co., </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>450 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>Alcott v. Public Service Corporation, </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>482, 485 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1909); <em>Rule </em>45, <em>Uniform Rules of Evidence; Rule </em>303, <em>Model Code, supra. </em>The rule is said to apply only to evidence that is remote or of comparatively slight probative force. See <em>McElroy, Model Code, p. </em>364; <em>Morgan, id., p. </em>14; comments to rules cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">However a trial judge\u2019s decision on the exercise of this discretion is not reversible, unless it appears manifest that he has made a mistake. <em>Bradley v. Cleary Co., </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>338, 341 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914); <em>Bosze v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>1 <em>N. J. </em>5, 10 (1948); <em>cf. Smith v. Smith, </em>17 <em>N. J. Super. </em>128 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We come then to the point at hand. We have found Hollyer\u2019s testimony to be relevant, though somewhat remote as to the matter of speed and somewhat clouded by the indistinctness of his identification of plaintiff\u2019s car. Our inquiry under the principle stated must be whether in admitting the testimony, there was a risk of unjust prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s case which substantially outweighed the probative usefulness of the testimony; and, further, whether the trial judge, who is entrusted with a discretion in the making of such a determination, committed manifest error. In our appraisal of this testimony we find no manifest error. The point therefore falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
