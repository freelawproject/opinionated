Kastner, Hine's prior attorney, jointly appeal various entries of the Ross County Court of Common Pleas. Appellants have set forth six assignments of error challenging the propriety of the trial court's ruling on the parties' motions for summary judgment, Appellee Citibank, N.A.'s motion for directed verdict, and the parties' motions for sanctions. Upon review of the record, we find merit to the first assignment of error. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b62} On April 4, 2016, Citibank, N.A., successor to Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. (hereinafter \"Citibank\"), filed a complaint on a credit card account debt, alleging Katherine Hine owed the sum of $ 15,013.83. Attached to the complaint was a Sears Mastercard account statement in the name of Katherine Hine and addressed to her at 189 E. Water Street Rear, Chillicothe, Ohio. The due date of the amount due was November 13, 2015. The statement also reflected an interest rate of 25.24% on all regular purchases. This appeal challenges various trial court rulings and involves a voluminous trial court record, all of which arose from what appeared\n   at the outset to be a \"rather straightforward collections case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} On May 4, 2016, Katherine Hine filed a motion to dismiss the complaint by and through her attorney, David L. Kastner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other assertions, she argued that Citibank had no standing to establish its right to collect on the Sears credit card account. Citibank filed a Brief in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. Hine filed a reply brief. The trial court denied Hine's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b64} Suffice it to say, there were numerous filings in the underlying proceedings, which necessitated responsive pleadings from the adverse party. While we set forth an outline of the proceedings here, in the interest of brevity, we will set forth additional pleadings and dates in the body of this opinion, where pertinent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b65} On September 6, 2016, Hine filed a Jury Demand. On October 18, 2016, the court filed a pretrial conference Order which explicitly stated at the last paragraph: \"The Court directs that the attorney or attorneys who will try this case shall be present at the pretrial.\" Attorney Kastner later filed a Motion to Convert December 2016 Pre-Trial Conference to Phone Conference. The trial court granted Kastner's request. Subsequent to the telephone pre-trial conference, the court filed an entry scheduling a jury trial date of August 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b66} Citibank filed notices of the depositions of Hine and another person, Karen Stanley. Hine subsequently filed a \"Notice Re Court's Scheduling.\" This pleading sets forth 12 paragraphs of information for purposes of \"notice for the record.\" Hine advises of the intent to appeal the court's orders compelling the depositions of Ms. Stanley and herself. Several pertinent paragraphs are set forth as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"3. The aforementioned orders were never sent to co-counsel Robert Fitrakis, evidently because this court did not instruct the clerk to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   5. Without an extensive amount of prior notice, co-counsel has long been unavailable for hearings on Tuesdays and Thursdays because of his teaching responsibilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   7. The court's scheduling of May 2 was done without consulting with co-counsel's schedule. Co-counsel and counsel share the representation. The undersigned generally does not make court appearances in this case due to his responsibilities with contract work involving the U.S. military.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b67} On April 26, 2017, Hine, through Kastner, filed a Motion for Stay to the Trial court, pending her appeal, supported by affidavits from Stanley, Kastner, and herself. On May 4, 2017, the trial court overruled the motion for stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hine's appeal to this court was eventually dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citibank N.A. v.

In the motion, Attorney Fitrakis advised he was engaged \"ostensibly\" because Attorney Kastner was unavailable to attend a previous hearing\n   and that he had not been engaged for future activity. Attorney Fitrakis attached an email from Attorney Dirisamer asking him to \"clarify the nature of his representation,\" as Karen Stanley had advised that Kastner and Fitrakis were her attorneys and Attorney Kastner had further advised he \"would not be appearing in Ross County for any proceedings related to this matter * * * due to the biased nature of the Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b69} On June 21, 2017, both Citibank and Hine filed motions for summary judgment. On July 12, 2017, Attorney Darren L. Meade filed a notice of appearance of co-counsel on behalf of Ms. Hine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b610} On August 1, 2017, the trial court issued decisions on the pending motions for summary judgment. The trial court found as a matter of law that Citibank had standing to bring its action. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to Citibank on the issue of standing and denied Hine's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b611} On August 2, 2017, Attorney Paul N. Garinger filed a Notice of Appearance as co-counsel on behalf of Citibank. On August 2, 2017, Attorney Kastner filed a Motion to Withdraw as counsel. On August 3, 2017, Hine formally waived her appearance at the jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b612} The jury trial commenced on August 3, 2017. Steven Sabo, assistant vice-president of Citibank, testified he is a primary custodian of Citibank's business records. He reviews the business records and has reviewed the records of Katherine Hine. He testified Citibank maintains records from accountholders, merchants, and credit bureaus. All information is stored electronically and Sabo has access to the computer system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b613} Sabo identified Exhibit 1 as a true and accurate copy of a credit card agreement, dated 2010, existing between Citibank and Appellant. The card agreement, a 16-page document, governs the use of the account. Sabo testified the document would have been sent to Appellant on or about October 2010. Sabo testified he had verified that Appellant received the card based on its code with a number that he cross-referenced to the actual card product based upon Citibank's electronic storage system. Specifically, he testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Systemically, there's no record of ever turned down [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] coming back, so I would have to say yes, every payment- - every billing statement was sent to Ms. Hine.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b614} Exhibit 2 was identified as a card agreement from 2004. Sabo testified Exhibit 2 was kept in the regular practice of Citibank. Exhibit 3 was identified as 367 pages of duplicated billing statements sent to Appellant on a monthly basis and created by Citibank in the ordinary course of its business. Sabo testified he maintained these records in the course of his job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b615} Exhibit 3, page 110, was a copy of a billing statement dated November 16, 2010. It was addressed to Appellant. It showed a previous balance of $ 49.00 and payment received of $ 49.00, bringing her account balance to zero. Sabo testified that Exhibit 3 demonstrated that Appellant used the credit card after she received the October 2010 card agreement (Exhibit 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b616} Exhibit 4 was identified as 90 pages of copies of payments that Citibank received throughout the years of the account. The exhibits showed copies of a payment coupon which Citibank would prepare as part of its monthly statement to be returned with the payment. The exhibit also showed copies of checks Citibank received as payment. These documents were also maintained in the ordinary course of business. Sabo explained he had actually observed the process of Citibank's\n   receiving payment, making copies of checks, and electronic storage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b617} Sabo testified the last statement Appellant received on December 17, 2014 reflected an account balance of $ 13,025.96. He also identified the last billing statement sent to Appellant dated October 16, 2015, which showed a total new balance of $ 15,013.83 and included interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b618} On cross-examination, Sabo admitted he does not have any personal experience with Sears' internal business practices. Sabo testified that the Citibank account was branded with Sears on Citibank's own card. He admitted the account was not originated by Citibank so he does not know what the application looked like or what the interest rate was. The account was acquired by Citibank. Citibank does not have the origination records. To his knowledge, the account with Sears was opened in August 1994.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b619} Sabo testified that Citibank does not have any card agreement or other record of Appellant's signing an agreement for a specified interest rate or a specified rate of late fees. However, he further testified such an agreement \"does not exist within the credit card industry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b620} After Citibank presented its evidence and rested, Hine moved for a directed verdict pursuant to Civ.R. 50. The Court overruled the motion. Hine elected not to present evidence and rested. Citibank subsequently moved for a directed verdict. After considering the arguments of counsel, the trial court sustained Citibank's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b621} On September 8, 2017, Hine filed \"Defendant's Notice RE Pro Se Status &amp; Discharge of Counsel.\" She explained she had discharged her counsel and intended, for the time being, to represent herself. Underneath the signature line, she listed the East Water Street Rear, Chillicothe address. On the same date, Hine filed Defendant's Response to Plaintiff's Sanctions, Costs &amp; Interest Motions. The trial court scheduled a hearing on sanctions for October 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b622} The sanctions hearing took place on October 19, 2017. Thomas Spetnagel, an experienced litigation attorney in Ross County, testified as an expert witness on behalf of Citibank. In his direct testimony, along with explaining what materials and documents he had reviewed and the opinions to which he arrived, Spetnagel commented:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"I then reviewed the court document, [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] the court document, to my dismay, I found that there were 172 filings with the clerk's office in what appeared to be a rather straight forward collection case on a charge account, over 150 of them were filed by counsel in the case alone. * * * In the words of one person, a discovery nightmare, * * *. There's nothing novel about the underlying case and if I were given this timesheet for a case that didn't go off track and wasn't a train wreck, I would have been unwilling to come into the courtroom. * * * I don't think it's the novelty of the case that's driven anything that comes into this-involving this case.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b623} The trial court discussed the pleadings with counsel, specifically noting problems with discovery Hine did not answer, objections she did not fully explain, the conflicting addresses Hine gave and the attempt to depose her, concluding: \"There was a lot of time wasted, a lot of argument wasted on getting the defendant's deposition scheduled. * * * That didn't happen because of the defendant's failure to cooperate.\" The trial court found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"All of the problems, all of the discovery issues that were contested and were big problems in the case which warranted a\n   lot of time * * *. The court finds that based upon the defendant and defense counsels, except Mr. Meade, action in this case that the plaintiff is entitled to sanctions as a result of the plaintiffs proceeding with the trial which was made necessary by the actions of the defendant. The defendant didn't appear for trial by the way.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b624} On November 15, 2017, the trial court granted Citibank's motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b625} On December 15, 2017, Katherine Hine and David Kastner jointly appealed the interlocutory entries and final entry of the court. Where pertinent, additional facts will be set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"I.

Hine asserts that Citibank failed to establish standing to bring suit because there is no evidence that Citibank acquired, through merger or otherwise, a transfer of Hine's original Sears credit card and any associated contract rights. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment and later, a directed verdict in favor of Appellee.

Hine cites the OCC document as being the identical document proffered in other recent Ohio litigation involving Sears credit card accounts allegedly acquired by Citibank. Hine directs our attention to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Citibank N.A. v. Rowe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-523\">\n    2013-Ohio-523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a Ninth District case in which the appellate court, upon examination of the identical document, concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"* * * CRA Decision # 117, dated November 2003, indicates the OCC's approval of Citibank USA, N.A.'s application \"to purchase substantially all of the assets of Sears National Bank, [N.A.]\" However, the letter states that, upon receipt of the required documents from Citibank USA, N.A., the OCC would \"issue a letter certifying consummation of the transaction.\" The letter further states that \"[i]f the asset purchase is not consummated within one year from the approval date, the approval shall automatically terminate, unless the OCC grants an extension of the time period.\" Thus, the OCC letter does not confirm that Citibank USA, N.A. purchased the assets of Sears National Bank, N.A., it merely confirms that the OCC granted approval for such a transaction to take place.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b635} We agree with Hine's argument, in part, and disagree with the trial court's finding that the documentation demonstrates Citibank's actual acquisition of Hine's Sears account. Our examination of the \"Merger Documents\" attached to Sabo's affidavit as Exhibit A, reveals that part of Exhibit A is CRA Decision # 117, November 2003. This document reflects that \"on October 16, 2003, the OCC approved the application of Citibank USA, National Association, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to purchase substantially all of the assets of Sears National Bank, National Association, Tempe, Arizona.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The conclusion\n   of the letter reiterates that the application was approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b636} Our review of the record reflects that the singular subject of CRA decision # 117 is the application of Citibank USA National Association\n   <em>\n    to acquire\n   </em>\n   Sears National Bank assets. The CRA decision references\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   OCC Control Nr. 2003-ML-02-008. According to the Office of the Comptroller, United States Department of the Treasury website, each\n   <em>\n    application\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) or notice is assigned an OCC control number that is a unique identifier. When requesting information or discussing the application or notice with the OCC, it is helpful to reference the control number.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://www.occ.gov/topics/licensing/corporate-activities-weekly-bulletin/index-weekly-bulletin.html.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b637} The next document within Exhibit A merger documents is a letter from the OCC, captioned \"Corporate Decision # 2006-08,\" with a date of August 3, 2006. The beginning of the letter indicates the subject is the \"[a]pplications by Citibank, N.A., Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. and certain affiliates to internally reorganize and consolidate certain banking and credit card operations.\" This section also lists several Application Control Numbers, however, the above Control No. 2003-ML-02-008, as referenced in CRA decision # 117 above, is not included. This letter contains a list of applications approved and in Paragraph 11, our attention is called to the \"Application to merge Citibank USA, National Association, 701 East 60th Avenue, Sioux Falls, South Dakota (a national credit card bank not limited to CEBA activities) and Citibank (Nevada) National Association (\"CBNV\") with and into Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. (2006-ML-02-0011).\" Nowhere in the August 3, 2006 letter is Control No. 2003-ML-02-008 or Sears identified or referenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b638} While as in the\n   <em>\n    Rowe\n   </em>\n   decision cited above, the above documents demonstrate that Citibank\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to acquire the credit card accounts of Sears, and that Citibank's application was approved, there is no further documentation to prove that the acquisition\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   took place. Corporate Decision # 2006-08, upon close scrutiny, does not provide a link between Control No. 2003-ML-02-008, Citibank's application to acquire the Sears assets, and\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   acquisition. Exhibit A also attaches a document captioned \"Certificate of National Bank Merger\" which indicates that on July 1, 2011, Citibank (South Dakota) National Association into Citibank National Association. The above documents demonstrate that the application to merge Citibank USA, National Association and Citibank (Nevada) National Association with Citibank (South Dakota) N.A. was approved. However, as in\n   <em>\n    Rowe,\n   </em>\n   there is no further documentation to demonstrate that Sears was in actuality a part of Citibank, N.A. at the time of the 2011 merger. Therefore, we would agree with Hine that Citibank failed to prove acquisition of her Sears credit card account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b639} However, while Citibank has failed to prove it acquired Hine's Sears credit card account, we conclude that Citibank, N.A. does have standing to bring the suit against Hine by virtue of its own agreement with Hine in 2010. We next examine Exhibit B, \"The Card Agreements.\" The first document attached as Exhibit B is a 2004 card agreement identifies Citibank USA, N.A. as the issuer of the account. The second paragraph of the card agreement mentions Sears, Sears Roebuck and Co., \"Sears purchase,\" \"Sears transaction\" and \"Sears entity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b640} Also attached to Exhibit B is a 2010 card agreement identifying Citibank\n   (South Dakota), N.A. as the issuer. The body of the card agreement does not mention Sears but the bottom of each page of the agreement contains the words \"Sears Mastercard.\" In the first paragraph of the 2010 card agreement it states: \"This card agreement is your contract with us. It governs the use of your card and your account.\" The third paragraph of the card agreement also provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \"You must use your account in accordance with this Agreement. * * * This Agreement is binding on you unless you close your account within 30 days after receiving the card and you have not used or authorized use of the card.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b641} Hine also asserts that while her use of the credit card may be evidence of some sort of agreement, there is no evidence of the terms of the original Sears credit card. We agree that evidence of the original terms of an agreement alleged to be between Sears and her is absent from the record. However, it does appear that Citibank, N.A. and Hine entered an agreement in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b642} After Hine received the 2010 Card Agreement from Citibank, N.A., she subsequently used it to make charges that are the subject of this collection action. \"Credit card agreements are contracts whereby the issuance and use of a credit card creates a legally binding agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The Card Agreement issued in 2010 identifies Citibank, N.A. as the issuer. The agreement explicitly states in the first paragraph that \"[t]his is your contract with us.\" Further, the agreement explicitly advises that Hine must close the account in 30 days or the contract will be binding upon her. The Account Statements attached as \"Exhibit C,\" and the Account Information showing payments made, attached as \"Exhibit D,\" reflect activity on the account after October 2010 when the account had actually achieved a zero balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b644} Under this assignment of error, Hine has also argued that Citibank, N.A.'s witness Sabo, both in motion practice and at trial, was not competent to testify. Civ.R. 56(E) states: \"Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.

Nor does it appear that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Sabo's testimony and supporting documentation into evidence. Sabo testified the account statements were mailed to addresses provided by Hine and the account information reflects activity in the way of both charges and payments. We find there is no evidentiary dispute that Hine used the Citibank,\n   N.A. credit card.

What remains consistent throughout the account statements is the fact that Sears MasterCard is printed at the top of each account statement, and that the payment information reflects that Karen Stanley (Hine's personal friend, spiritual advisor, and paralegal) continued to pay on the Sears-branded Citibank account \"4036\" until after March 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b656} In Defendant's Second Set of Responses to Plaintiff's First &amp; Second Set of Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents &amp; Requests for Admission, Hine gave these responses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Request for Admissions No. 1\n   </em>\n   : Admit that you opened an account with Sears for an extension of credit, now owned by Citibank.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \"* * * It appears that I had several accounts with Sears' Credit Card Services, including the one that is the subject of this litigation.

Despite the conflict in the actual account numbers, Hine has not provided any evidence in the record that Citibank has attempted to collect on the wrong account. Hine admits she once had several accounts with Sears, including the one at issue in this case. Although she denied Citibank's ownership of the account, as set forth above, we have found that Hine and Citibank had entered into an agreement, based on the October 2010 Card Member Agreement. The payment\n   information in the record shows payment until after March 2015. Hine's direction to Karen Stanley demonstrates payments ceased on the account which Citibank seeks to collect after March 2015. Based on this evidence, we sua sponte find despite the conflicting account numbers, Citibank is seeking to collect on the correct \"Sears branded\" credit card account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b658} Based on the above, we find no merit to Hine's argument that Citibank, N.A. had no standing to bring suit against her.

On appeal, Hine argues that Citibank did not prove that the right to charge interest exceeding the statutory amount. For the reasons which follow, we agree with Hine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b660} Under Civ.R. 50(A)(4), the court should grant a motion for directed verdict if \"the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party.\" \"A motion for directed verdict does not present a question of fact or raise factual issues, although the trial court is required to review and consider the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Berry v.

The same rationale and result applies to Capital One's claimed over limit fees and late fees. Capital One has not shown specific fees which were terms of a contract between it and Heidebrink.

However, under\n   <em>\n    Yager,\n   </em>\n   monthly statements are not sufficient evidence of a written contract.

Stanley and Katherine Hine, to be conducted in the Ross County Law Library. On February 21, 2017, Hine, through her counsel, filed a Motion of Defendant &amp; Karen L. Stanley for Protective Order. The motion was supported by the\n   Affidavit of Karen L. Stanley. The motion advised that Ms. Stanley had served as a paralegal under Attorney Kastner in Hine's case and argued that Ms. Stanley was bound by attorney-client privilege as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   \"Besides being on defendant's legal defense team, Ms. Stanley is a friend of the defendant and sometime spiritual advisor. Ms. Stanley appears to have been targeted because she has signed some checks which referenced a different account than the one alleged in the Complaint or checks that referenced an alleged account that there is no reason to believe was ever owned by plaintiff. Her affidavit makes it clear that she has never had communication with plaintiff Citibank, as its attorney claims to want to discover. The only possible purposes of this subpoena are harassment of non-party Stanley and defendant, or a fishing expedition that the non-party, Ms. Stanley, should not have to fund. * * * Non-party Stanley should not have to review multiple years' worth of e-mails, notes, or other documents, in order to determine when she communicated with plaintiff and the degree to which any such communication came within the attorney-client or clergy privilege.

The statements I have made in response to the plaintiff's interrogatories and documents requests are true and accurate. I do not have the financial ability to leave my home in Uruguay and do not believe that given the ongoing political situation and level of violence in the U.S. currently that it would be physically safe for me to do so.

The order explicitly stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   \"Defendant Katherine Hine is ordered to sit for a deposition, to be taken via electronic means to be selected by Plaintiff's counsel, but not to include SKYPE, at Plaintiff's costs, on or before May 31, 2017.

In it, counsel argued that while Karen Stanley appeared for her deposition, Attorneys Kastner and Fitrakis failed to appear on her behalf, in violation of the court's previous April 12, 2017 order granting Plaintiff's Motion to Compel. On May 22, 2017, Attorney Kastner filed a \"Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Motion for Sanctions &amp; Objections to False Statements &amp; Innuendoes in the Record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   {\u00b688} On June 7, 2017, Citibank, again noticed the deposition of Karen L.

On September 1, 2017, Plaintiff filed \"Citibank's Second Supplemental Motion for Sanctions.\" The trial court eventually scheduled October 19, 2017 as the date to hear all motions for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   {\u00b690} At the October 19, 2017 sanctions' hearing, Plaintiff's counsel, Robert C. Folland and David J. Dirisamer, attended in person and presented arguments on behalf of Plaintiff. No other attorneys or parties attended the hearing. Ms. Hine called the Court and reiterated a previous written request to participate by phone. Her request was denied. However, the record reflects she was allowed to listen to the proceedings via the cell phone of a personal representative, Debra McCabe. Additionally, Plaintiff presented the testimony of Attorney Thomas M. Spetnagel, Sr., a local Chillicothe practitioner, as to the reasonableness of the hours spent on the matter by Plaintiff's counsel and as to the reasonableness of the hourly rate charged by Plaintiff's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   {\u00b691} Attorney Spetnagel testified he is licensed in the State of Ohio, U.S. District Court for the Southern District, Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court. He has practiced law for nearly 42 years in Ross County. He testified his review of the court docket indicated there were 172 filings in what appeared to be a \"rather straightforward collections case.\" He also reviewed Ohio R. Prof Conduct 1.5, R.C. 2323.51, and related case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Sanction award for claimed trial preparation expenses.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   {\u00b692} The trial court awarded Citibank $ 18,150.00 for trial preparation expenses. Hine argues there is no evidence that either Attorney Kastner or she committed sanctionable conduct. Hine asserts they have been sanctioned due to: (1) Appellant's exercising her right to a jury trial; (2) unfounded accusations of \"name-calling\"; and, (3) unfounded accusations that Hine and her attorney created needless delay in this matter. For the reasons which follow, we disagree with Hine's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   {\u00b693} Attached as Exhibit A to Citibank's Second Supplemental Motion for Sanctions is an email from Katherine Hine to Karen Stanley. When Ms. Stanley's deposition took place, she confirmed receipt of the email from Hine. The March 30, 2015 email reads in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   \"Hey, Karen: I wanted to let you know that we may as well stop paying the\n   Sears' charge card. I just cancelled it. * * * As far as I'm concerned, we can stop paying the idiots. Yes- I know my credit rating will be shot-but-you know-it probably already is. Eventually I think I may make a deal with them on the balance after (if) we sell 116. * * * Maybe now we could pay down the other card a little bit more if need be. Yes-eventually they will sue me, but that's o.k. I should be able to find a way to defend it or at least stall until 116 hopefully sells. They may try to contact you, but you have my permission to hang up on them. * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   {\u00b694} On the hearing date, Attorney Folland presented the court with an affidavit which had previously been attached to the Second Supplemental Motion for Sanctions. The affidavit states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   44. I spent 45.8 hours preparing for and attending trial, including pre-trial filings such as a trial brief, jury instructions, witness and exhibit lists, a motion in limine and motions to quash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   48. Mr. Garinger spent 26.8 hours preparing for and attending trial, including pre-trial filings such as a trial brief, jury instructions, witness and exhibit lists, a motion in limine and motion to quash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   {\u00b695} The trial court's entry states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   \"Plaintiff is granted attorney fees of $ 18,150.00 incurred in preparation for, and for attending, the trial of this matter. Plaintiff's costs of trial preparation and appearance at trial were increased by the action of Ms. Hine and Defendant's counsel Davis [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Kastner, to obstruct and delay this matter, including actions in discovery and in failing to attend Court hearings and the trial in this matter, in violation of Civil Rule 11 and Ohio Revised Code 2323.51. The Court awards Plaintiff attorney fees only for the two attorneys who attended the trial, Robert C. Folland and Paul N. Garinger. Darren Meade is not liable for amounts awarded herein. The Court finds that time spent by Mr. Folland and Mr. Garinger preparing for and attending trial was reasonable. Thus, the Court awards Plaintiff attorney fees for the 45.8 hours spent preparing for, and participating in, trial by Mr. Folland and the 26.9 hours spent preparing for, and participating in, trial by Mr. Garinger. The Court awards Plaintiff attorney fees for both time spent by Mr. Folland and Mr. Garinger at Mr. Garinger's charged rate in this matter of $ 250.00 per hour. Thus, Plaintiff is awarded $ 11, 450.00 in attorney fees for Mr. Folland's time in preparing and participating in trial. * * *\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   {\u00b696} Attorney Spetnagel testified that he had reviewed the time expended and charges for trial preparation, as set forth in paragraphs 44-53 of the affidavit. He found the time and attorney fees to be reasonable. Having reviewed the entire record in this matter, we do not find the trial court's award of $ 18,150.00 in sanctions against Appellant and Attorney Kastner for attorneys' fees to be an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   {\u00b697} Paragraph 54 of the First Amended Complaint alleges that Hine made payments until March 2015. The March 30, 2015 email in which Hine advised Karen Stanley to stop paying on the credit card, verified by Karen Stanley in her brief deposition, essentially constitutes an admission that Appellant owed the debt herein to Citibank. To thereafter deny she owed the debt caused unnecessary delay, needless increase in the cost of Citibank's litigation, and was not supported by a good faith argument. We find Appellant's defense to be frivolous conduct under\n   R.C. 2323.51. Additionally, the email shows her intent to deliberately \"stall\" the proceedings, i.e. \"sanctionable conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   {\u00b698} Attorney Kastner's duty under Civ.R. 11 was to sign all pleadings, motions, and documents in the case, certifying good ground to support Appellant's defense and certifying the case filings were not interposed for delay. If Appellant did not absolutely direct her attorney to \"stall\" the proceedings, as of the time she provided the email in discovery, Attorney Kastner certainly knew or should have known her defense was meritless and she was using counsel to file unnecessary pleadings for purposes of delay. In this case, the record reveals, until his discharge by Appellant, Attorney Kastner signed all pertinent pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   {\u00b699} Given the amount of the judgment for money's owed on Hine's credit card in this matter, the fees awarded for purposes of sanction are extraordinary. However, given this record, the expert testimony as to the reasonableness of the hours spent and fees charged, and the court's findings, we do not find the court abused its discretion. We find no merit to the argument that there was no evidence of sanctionable conduct justifying the fee award for trial preparation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Fee awarded for Attorney Garinger's participation at trial.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   {\u00b6100} A portion of the attorney fee award, $ 6,700.00, was in conjunction with Attorney Paul Garinger's participation at trial. Hine argues Attorney Garinger participated due to the \"lead attorney's lack of experience.\" Hine points out that sanctions are intended for sincere ethical breaches and are not to be used as punitive measures. She concludes that this portion of the award against her is an abuse of the court's discretion. Again, we disagree with Hine's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   {\u00b6101} The October 19, 2017 sanctions hearing transcript reveals Attorney Folland addressed the issue of Attorney Garinger's participation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   \"* * * Your Honor, with respect to that * * * after the first trial had ended, I had mentioned to you that this was the first time I had ever been in front of a jury and kind of enjoyed the process. The fact of the matter is I'm in court probably three or four days a week. The reality of a commercial litigation practice is it's very rare that you would have a jury with respect to that. * * * the aspect that was novel for me would have been the jury aspect of it. Everything else is something I've done many, many, many times, including the examination of the witnesses and the like, and what that - - the net result of that was asking Mr. Garinger to attend trial with me. I think it certainly justified having two attorneys present for the matter with the jury. * * * Mr. Garinger, for example, did the voir dire and assisted with all issues relating to jury instructions and the like, and that's why I asked him to get involved because those are areas where I don't have the same expertise that he does * * *.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   The Court: You mentioned that this was a jury trial. I've reviewed the file and it appears that the defendants requested the jury, is that your understanding?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   Mr. Folland: Yes, it is, your honor. Plaintiff did not request a jury in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   {\u00b6102} Thereafter, the trial court's entry on sanctions further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   \"Plaintiff is awarded $ 6,700.00 for Mr. Garinger's time in preparing for and participating in trial. Plaintiff is not awarded any additional costs or expenses incurred in preparing for, and participating in trial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   {\u00b6103} Again, based on our thorough review of the record, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion with regard to the portion of the sanctions award which was directed to Attorney Garinger's $ 6,700.00 fee. Attorney Spetnagel testified as to the reasonableness of the time spent and hours charged in this matter. We do not view the sanction as a punitive measure directed at Appellant's exercising her right to a jury trial. Appellant Hine, herself, is an attorney. Rather, both Attorney Kastner and Ms. Hine knew or should have known of the risk of interposing unnecessary delays in court proceedings involving a debt she apparently knew she owed. Again, we find no merit to Hine's argument as to the portion of the award for Attorney Garinger's preparation and participation at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Sanction awarded as a result of the failure to take Hine's deposition.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   {\u00b6104} Hine also argues the trial court abused its discretion as a result of failed efforts to take her deposition, and in the absence of any sanctionable conduct on her part. For the reasons which follow, we disagree. The \"failed efforts to take Hine's deposition,\" is more aptly characterized as Hine's repeated failure to comply with court orders. Again, based on the entire record of pleadings and transcripts which wholly demonstrate in and of themselves a successful effort to thwart and delay these proceedings, the March 2015 email provided in discovery succinctly summarizes the entire delay tactic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   {\u00b6105} As indicated above, in the email, Hine acknowledged the debt she owed, in addition to an admitting that she intended to \"stall\" the proceedings. Attorney Folland's affidavit attached to his motion for sanctions sets forth in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   34. Ms. Hine failed to appear for her deposition on June 16, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   35. I spent a total of 3.9 hours working on matters related to Ms. Hine's scheduled June 16, 2017 deposition and the subsequent Supplemental Motion for Sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   36. Mr. Dirisamer spent a total of 10.9 hours working on matters related to Ms. Hine's scheduled June 16, 2017 deposition and the subsequent Supplemental Motion for Sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   38. Thus, the total amount incurred by Citibank for attorneys' fees and costs related to Ms. Hine's failure appear for her deposition on June 16, 2017, as ordered by the Court's April 12, 2017 order, is $ 4,318.63.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   {\u00b6106} Citibank also requested charges related to mileage costs, court reporter costs, and transcript of Ms. Hine's June 16, 2017 deposition. Attorney Spetnagel testified he had reviewed the firm billing as related to the attempt to depose Katherine Hine, and based on the amount of time set forth in Folland's affidavit, paragraphs 33-39, he found the amount of time expended was reasonable and the charges were reasonable. Factually, the trial court found as follows as relates to Hine's efforts to avoid deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   \"Plaintiff is granted attorney fees of $ 4,266.20 for the failure of Ms. Hine to attend her deposition on June 16, 2017. Ms. Hine's deposition was noticed in accord with the Court's April 12, 2017 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion to Compel. That order required Ms. Hine to sit for an electronic deposition, in a manner selected by Plaintiff, in Uruguay in May, 2017. If Ms. Hine did not sit for an electronic deposition in Uruguay in May, 2017, Ms. Hine was required to appear for a deposition in June, 2017 in Chillicothe, Ohio, at a time selected by Plaintiff. Ms. Hine did not sit for an electronic deposition in Uruguay in May,\n   2017, and did not appear for her noticed deposition in Chillicothe, Ohio, on June 16, 2017. The amount awarded to Plaintiff represents only the attorney fees incurred by Plaintiff, and does not include any other costs or expenses incurred by Plaintiff.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   {\u00b6107} We find no merit to Hine's argument that she did not commit sanctionable conduct. We further find the trial court did not abuse its discretion with regard to the fee awarded as sanction for Hine's failure to comply with the trial court's orders and allow Citibank to depose her in either in Uruguay or Ross County, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   {\u00b6108} Based on the foregoing, we hereby overrule Hine's third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR SIX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   {\u00b6109} We have already addressed the propriety of the trial court's sanctions awards above. Under this assignment of error, Hine generally argues that: (1) she was denied her right of due process to an impartial finder of fact; (2) she and her attorney were the subject of disparate treatment from the Plaintiff attorneys; and (3) the record in this matter shows evidence of bias. Hine cites Judge Nusbaum's rulings and comments from 8/1/17; 8/3/17; 8/8/17;10/19/17; 11/8/17; and 11/15/17, arguing that the rulings \"cast new light on the degree to which appellants could have reasonably ever expected unbiased rulings based on the merits rather than Nusbaum's clearly growing dislike of appellants and their criticism.\" She further cites the \"savage nature\" of Judge Nusbaum's rulings which reasonably give the appearance of judicial bias. Hine asserts: \"[T]he circumstances of what the public would certainly see as judicial bias may or may not have anything to do with Nusbaum's ties to Matthew Schmidt, as explained in the Affidavit of Disqualification.\" Hine concludes: \"Whatever the reason, Due Process was seriously undercut.\" For the reasons which follow, we find no merit to these contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Due Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   {\u00b6110} A fair trial in an impartial tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\n   <em>\n    In re Murchison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333990\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/133/#p136\">\n    349 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333990\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/133/#p136\">\n    75 S.Ct. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%20942\">\n    99 L.Ed. 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1955).\n   <em>\n    Cooke v.
