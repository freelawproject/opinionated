TEMPEL, Respondent\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  Supreme Court Case No. 19S-DI-445\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Supreme Court of Indiana.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Filed September 6, 2019.\n </decisiondate>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-5\">\n   Published Order Approving Statement of Circumstances and Conditional Agreement for Discipline\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   Pursuant to Indiana Admission and Discipline Rule 23 (12.1)(b), the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission and Respondent have submitted for approval a \"Statement of Circumstances and Conditional Agreement for Discipline\" stipulating agreed facts and proposed discipline as summarized below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    Stipulated Facts:\n   </strong>\n   In September 2018, pursuant to a guilty plea, Respondent was convicted in Marion County of two misdemeanor counts of operating a vehicle while intoxicated (\"OWI\"). Respondent has a prior conviction for OWI in Boone County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Respondent has no prior discipline and has voluntarily taken several measures since his arrest in Marion County to respond to his misconduct, including entering into a long-term monitoring agreement with JLAP. Respondent's criminal probation and JLAP monitoring agreement include among other things the use of a SoberLink device for real-time alcohol monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Violation:\n   </strong>\n   The parties agree that Respondent violated Indiana Professional Conduct Rule 8.4(b), which prohibits committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on Respondent's trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Discipline:\n   </strong>\n   The Court, having considered the submission of the parties, now approves the following agreed discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For Respondent's professional misconduct, the Court\n   <strong>\n    suspends Respondent from the practice of law for a period of 90 days, beginning on the date of this order, all stayed subject to completion of at least one year of probation under a JLAP monitoring agreement\n   </strong>\n   . The Court incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of probation set forth in the parties' Conditional Agreement, which include among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   (1) Respondent shall abstain from the use of alcohol or any other mind-altering substances for the duration of his probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n    (2) Respondent shall commit no violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct or commit any criminal act during his probation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n    (3) Respondent shall pay all costs of compliance associated with the terms of probation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n    (4) If Respondent violates the terms of his probation, the stay of his suspension may be vacated and the balance of his stayed suspension may be actively served without automatic reinstatement.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Notwithstanding the expiration of the minimum term of probation set forth above, Respondent's probation shall remain in effect until it is terminated pursuant to a petition to terminate probation filed under Admission and Discipline Rule 23(16).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The costs of this proceeding are assessed against Respondent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    All Justices concur, except Rush, C.J., who would reject the conditional agreement, believing that a period of active suspension and a longer term of probation are warranted given the endangerment involved in the Marion County criminal case.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
