(\"ATD\") appeals from the judgment of the Medina County Court of Common Pleas. This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} ATD is an employer participating in the State Insurance Fund under the Ohio Workers' Compensation System. In 2008, one of ATD's employees filed a First Report of Injury with the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation alleging he was injured while employed at ATD. The employee sought treatment at Medina General Hospital and was seen by a certified nurse practitioner who was collaborating with physician Defendant-Appellee Francine Terry, M.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} When, after conservative treatment, the employee continued to be experiencing pain, the nurse practitioner \"rubber-stamped\" Dr. Terry's signature on a form requesting that the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation approve an MRI for the employee. The MRI was approved and additional findings were noted on the MRI. Thereafter, the nurse practitioner \"rubber-stamped\" Dr. Terry's signature onto another form requesting that the Ohio Bureau of Worker's Compensation allow additional conditions. The additional conditions were allowed. At the time, the employee had not been seen by Dr. Terry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} The employee was separated from his employment in April 2009. He subsequently sought and received Temporary Total Disability Compensation. ATD later discovered that the employee was working while claiming to be disabled. The matter was investigated and the employee's physicians were interviewed. The Industrial\n   Commission vacated the additional allowances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b65} In July 2017, ATD refiled a complaint against Defendant-Appellant Medina Hospital and Dr. Terry. ATD asserted that the documentation submitted by Medina Hospital and Dr. Terry contained \"false, fraudulent, deceptive and misleading information in that they appear to reflect opinions as to causation reached by a physician based on actual medical evidence, when in fact they were founded upon nothing more tha[n] a standard office protocol, unsupported by any medical evidence.\" ATD maintained that, as a result of the additional allowances, ATD incurred costs and expenses defending the employee's claim that it would not have incurred had it received accurate information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b66} ATD alleged two claims: one for \"Breach of Statutory and Regulatory Duties\" pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A), and one alleging fraudulent misrepresentation. Medina Hospital and Dr. Terry filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings. Therein, they asserted that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the first count because Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A) did not provide ATD with a private cause of action and because the claim was barred by res judicata based upon the trial court's ruling in prior litigation, which terminated when ATD voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit. ATD opposed the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b67} Ultimately, the trial court granted Medina Hospital's and Dr. Terry's motion. The trial court found that Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A) did not provide ATD with a private right of action. The entry included language pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b68} ATD has appealed, raising a single assignment of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN GRANTING APPELLEES' MOTION FOR PARTIAL JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS ON THE FIRST COUNT OF AUTOMATION'S COMPLAINT \"BREACH OF STATUTORY AND REGULATORY DUTIES\" ARISING OUT OF OHIO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE 4123-6-20(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b69} ATD argues in its sole assignment of error that the trial court erred in granting the motion for partial judgment on the pleadings as Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A) does provide for a private right of action for ATD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b610} Civ.R. 12(C) states, \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" \"Under Civ.R. 12(C), dismissal is appropriate where a court (1) construes the material allegations in the complaint, with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, in favor of the nonmoving party as true, and (2) finds beyond doubt, that the plaintiff could prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\" (Internal quotations and citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Merryweather Mgt., Inc. v.

Among the regulations in the chapter is a regulation that provides for the decertification of a \"non-facility provider who has failed to comply with a workers' compensation statute or rule.\" Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-02.7(A). In addition, Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6.02.7(C)(6) provides that the administrator of the bureau of workers' compensation\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   may proceed directly to the enrollment termination and/or decertification of a provider for violation of * * * [a]cts of intentional misrepresentation, misstatement, or omission of a relevant fact or other acts involving false, fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading information on reports, information, and/or documentation submitted by the provider, the provider's employees, or the provider's agents to the bureau, industrial commission, claimant, employer, or their representatives, MCO, QHP, or self-insuring employer in connection with a workers' compensation claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b617} Another regulation provides that \"[b]y signing the provider application and agreement or recertification application and agreement, the provider agrees to, and the bureau may refuse to certify or recertify or may decertify a provider for failure to * * * [c]omply with the workers' compensation statutes and rules and the terms of the provider application and agreement or recertification application and agreement.\" Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-02.3(D)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b618} While the plain language of the regulation itself does not indicate a legislative intent to either create or deny a private cause of action, when the enabling statutes and other regulations in the chapter are considered as well, we cannot say there is any indication of a legislative intent to create a private remedy under Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A) for employers like ATD. Instead, the legislature authorized the bureau to administer the HPP and the administrator to develop standards for penalizing health care providers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4121.441(A) ; R.C. 4121.441(A)(1)(l). Pursuant to that authority, the drafters of the regulation charged the bureau with evaluating provider compliance with the rules and created a penalty for a provider's non-compliance with the regulations in the\n   chapter, and in particular acts involving misrepresentations on documentation; that penalty, enforced by the bureau, is a refusal to certify or recertify a provider or an order to decertify a provider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-02.7(A),(C); Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-.02.3(D)(10). Given that the drafters of the regulations specified consequences for the failure to comply with the rules, we presume that they likewise could have outlined a private remedy had they intended one. Here, they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b619} We note that, in its reply brief, ATD asserted other statutes supported that the legislature intended for it to have a private cause of action for violations of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A). Notably, however, ATD did not raise those arguments in the trial court. This Court has long held that arguments not made in the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens v. Stevens\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Medina No. 17CA0084-M,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019-Ohio-264\">\n    2019-Ohio-264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20360497\">\n    2019 WL 360497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13. One of those arguments was that R.C. 4121.444 supported that the legislature intended for ATD to have a private cause of action for violations of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A). Even if we were to consider R.C. 4121.444, we note that R.C. 4121.444(D) only expressly authorizes the attorney general and self-insuring employers to bring an action to enforce the section. Thus, ATD has not demonstrated that R.C. 4121.444 evidences a legislative intent for a private cause of action for violations of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A) for an employer participating in the State Insurance Fund, like ATD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b620} Finally, we cannot say that it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to infer a private cause of action for employers like ATD for violations of Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-20(A). As noted by the Supreme Court,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [t]he [Managed Care Organization (\"MCO\") ] program was created as part of an overall plan, enacted by the General Assembly in R.C. 4121.44 and 4121.441, to more efficiently manage the medical aspects of workers' compensation claims. A committee composed of individuals from business, labor, medical providers, and the BWC staff designed the major components of the HPP, including the MCO program.

The BWC authorizes the release of state funds to pay the medical claims. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-6-043(A); 4123-6-045(A).
