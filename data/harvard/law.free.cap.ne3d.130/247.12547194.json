He was subsequently charged with three misdemeanors: (1) driving under suspension, a first-degree misdemeanor under R.C. 4510.11, (2) failure to stop after an accident, a first-degree misdemeanor under R.C. 4549.02, and (3) failure to maintain reasonable control of a vehicle, a minor misdemeanor under R.C. 4511.202. The driving-under-suspension charge was resolved through a plea agreement. The other two charges proceeded to a bench trial, and White was found guilty of both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   Relevant to this appeal is the judgment of conviction entered for the failure-to-maintain-control conviction. In sentencing White, the trial court had the authority to impose a financial sanction, such as a fine of up to $150, or up to 30 hours of community service, but it was not required to impose either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a)(v) (\"the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this section.

We disagree. First, such an interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the statute, which uses the permissive term \"may\" and reiterates that the sanction is not required by including the conditional clause \"[i]f the court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions.\" The concurring opinion does not accept the ordinary meaning of \"may,\" and it glides by the conditional clause without mentioning its conditional nature. Second, nothing in the provisions stating that community service may be imposed \"in lieu of\" a financial sanction, R.C. 2929.27(D) and 2929.28(B), alters the plain meaning of R.C. 2929.28(A) or suggests that community service is required if a court chooses not to impose a financial sanction. Finally, the concurring opinion's argument that the key portion of the statute is its reference to the trial court \"imposing a sentence\" is novel but unconvincing. It requires one to believe that in the remainder of R.C. 2929.28(A) the legislature said one thing (\"may sentence the offender to any financial sanction\") when it really meant another (\"may sentence the offender to\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    any financial sanction\n    <em>\n     or community service\n    </em>\n    \").

This, he argues, is contrary to the terms of R.C. 2929.28(A), which explicitly makes the imposition of a fine discretionary, providing that \"the court imposing a sentence * * * for * * * a minor misdemeanor[ ]\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this section\" (emphasis added).\n    <em>\n     See also\n     <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20N.E.3d%20913\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"If the court\n    <em>\n     in its discretion\n    </em>\n    imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,\" certain enumerated sanctions [emphasis added] ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 11}\n    </strong>\n    The state disagrees. According to the state, the First District's decision does not require a fine to be imposed. It requires simply that a trial court include language in the judgment entry clearly establishing that it has decided how to exercise its discretion concerning a sentence. For example, the state suggests that if the court wishes to decline to impose a fine, it may include language such as \"$0 fine,\" \"no fine,\" \"waive fines,\" or \"remit fines.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 12}\n    </strong>\n    White counters that the imposition of costs in the judgment entry indicates that the trial court made a decision on a sentence and simply declined to impose\n    a fine. He further argues that requiring a trial court to specifically state \"$0 fine\" or similar language would be \"frivolous\" and that nothing in the Revised Code or Crim.R. 32(C) requires any notation of what sentence the court chose\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    to impose. Only an actual sentence must be stated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 13}\n    </strong>\n    We agree with the state.

We recognize that the judgment of conviction here imposed costs, omitted any reference to a fine or community service, and stated that the sentence was stayed pending appeal.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Initially, there is the problem of ambiguity. The judgment's reference to a stay-\"STAY OF SENTENCE GRANTED PENDING APPEAL\"-is ambiguous. What is stayed? Costs are not part of the sentence, but the court may have meant that the payment of costs was stayed pending appeal. Additionally, the entry's silence regarding a monetary or community-service sentence may imply that the court had exercised its discretion to decline to impose a sentence. But implication is not enough. A trial court's decision to exercise its discretion not to impose a sentence should not be communicated in the judgment of conviction passively-let alone ambiguously-through suggestion or by implication. Permitting such a practice would undermine the purpose of Crim.R. 32(C), which we have recognized is \"to ensure that a defendant is on notice concerning when a final judgment has been entered and the time for filing an appeal has begun to run,\"\n    <em>\n     Lester\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 10. To ensure that the defendant is on notice of when the time to appeal has begun to run, and to avoid disputes regarding the same, clarity is required.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 15}\n    </strong>\n    We therefore reiterate our holding in\n    <em>\n     Lester\n    </em>\n    concerning the essential elements of a final, appealable judgment of conviction, and we further hold that a trial court's decision to exercise its discretion not to impose a monetary or community-service sentence must be clearly communicated in the text of the entry. No magic words are required, and there is no requirement that a fine or other sanction be imposed before it may be waived. The trial court's decision not to impose a sentence must simply be clear in the entry. For example, in this case, it would have been sufficient for the trial court to state in the entry \"no fine,\" \"fine waived,\" \"$0 fine,\" or similar language.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State v.

For example, he argues that defendants will be unable to have their convictions sealed unless they are fined and that defense counsel will be required to act against their clients' interests by requesting a fine, lest their clients be denied appellate review. He also asserts that all defendants convicted of minor misdemeanors who were not explicitly ordered to pay a fine will be able to claim that a valid sentence has not yet been entered and that therefore, because of unreasonable delay in sentencing, they are entitled to reimbursement of any money they paid in costs. These arguments all fail for the same reason: they wrongly assume that the trial court is effectively required to impose a fine for a minor-misdemeanor conviction. As explained above, that is not correct. Furthermore, going forward, a court that\n    chooses not to impose a sentence for a minor misdemeanor need only make that clear in the judgment of conviction; so long as it does so, none of these alleged harms can arise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 17}\n    </strong>\n    Consequently, the First District correctly dismissed White's appeal for lack of a final, appealable order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 18}\n    </strong>\n    For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the First District Court of Appeals dismissing White's appeal for lack of a final, appealable order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    French, Welbaum, DeWine, Donnelly, and Stewart, JJ., concur.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Kennedy, J., concurs in judgment only, with an opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Jeffrey M.
