The sentencing entry imposes reimbursement costs in the amount of $ 732.80 for Appellant's prosecution, supervision, and confinement, as well as fees authorized by R.C. 2949.14 and 2947.23. (1/23/18 J.E. p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} Appellant asserts that the trial court committed plain error when it imposed reimbursement costs as a part of his sentence without first determining his ability to pay. He further asserts that the trial court erred when it failed to notify him that he is prohibited from ingesting or being injected with any drug of abuse, and that he would be subject to random drug testing during his incarceration. Because the trial court did not commit plain error, we affirm the judgment entry of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} At the sentencing hearing on January 22, 2018, the trial court completely omitted any reference to Appellant's obligation to refrain from illegal drug use, or that he would be subject to random drug testing, while incarcerated. However, the trial court did inform Appellant that he would \"be ordered to reimburse the State and county for the costs associated with [his] confinement and prosecution.\" (1/22/18 Sent. Hrg. p. 6). No contemporaneous objection was made to the trial court's omission regarding illegal drug use, random drug testing, or the imposition of the costs of prosecution and confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} Review of felony sentences is governed by R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Joseph\n   </em>\n   Court reasoned that a criminal defendant has the right to be present at every stage of his trial, and, further, that Joseph suffered prejudice because he was denied the opportunity to claim indigency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Here, the trial court notified Appellant at the hearing that the costs of his prosecution and confinement would be imposed as a part of his sentence.

The majority of the Districts that have considered the issue have concluded that the failure to provide any admonition regarding drug use and/or notification regarding drug testing does not constitute reversible error. The First, Second, Third, Fifth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Districts have agreed that the requirements in subsection (f) were intended to facilitate the drug testing of prisoners, not to create substantive notification rights.
