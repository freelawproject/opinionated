R.C. 4511.093(B)(3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Under this provision, if a traffic camera records a violation and the officer present does not issue a ticket under division (B)(2) of this section, the local authority may only issue a ticket under R.C. 4511.096 to 4511.0912.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellants assert R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) is simply a process provision that prevents local authorities from issuing two citations for the same offense and requires local authorities to issue traffic-camera citations in accordance with other sections of the Ohio camera law. Appellants generally state that this provision establishes a uniform scheme to ensure that traffic cameras operate properly and that violations they capture are processed under uniform, clear standards from which admissible evidence is derived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellee counters, asserting that this provision was invalid because R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) incorporates 4511.0912, which was invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Dayton.\n   </em>\n   In invalidating R.C. 4511.0912, the\n   <em>\n    Dayton\n   </em>\n   court eliminated the requirement that an officer be present at the location of the traffic camera. Appellee concludes that R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) thus cannot stand as a result. Appellee also generally argues that the provision merely limits municipal power without serving an overriding statewide interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Here, we first note that we sever all statutory language which became invalid in\n   <em>\n    Dayton\n   </em>\n   and that this severance applies throughout this opinion. As a result, what remains of R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) essentially states that if the municipality does not issue a ticket under R.C. 4511.093(B)(2), then the municipality \"may only issue a ticket in accordance with sections 4511.096 to 4511.0912.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 40} We find this remaining language limits appellee's municipal power, and that it serves no statewide purpose aside from loosely mandating policy which may or may not be enforced uniformly. Specifically, the mandatory \"may only\" language severely limits the way in which the municipality can issue a ticket. We are not persuaded by appellants' stated purpose or concerns regarding uniformity of traffic-camera law and, accordingly, hold that R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) fails to satisfy the third prong of the general-law test of\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Appellants next argue R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) establishes a rule to govern citizens and local authorities on the issuance and contesting of traffic-camera citations. Appellants argue that citizens and local authorities alike must abide by this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Appellee contends the phrasing of R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) is not directed toward citizens but, rather, is directed and applied solely and expressly to municipalities that enacted traffic-camera laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 43} We find R.C. 4511.093(B)(3), like those statutes invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Dayton\n   </em>\n   , interferes with municipal power by not prescribing a rule of conduct on citizens generally. The language is directed to the municipality and its officers, not citizens. Thus, we hold R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) fails to satisfy the fourth prong of the\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   general-law test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Overall, R.C. 4511.093(B)(3) satisfies the first and second prongs of\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   , but not the third and fourth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 45} 2. R.C. 4511.096\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Under division (A) of R.C. 4511.096, an officer must examine evidence of an alleged traffic law violation recorded by the device to determine if a violation has occurred, and if the image shows a violation, contains the date and time of the violation, and clearly shows the license\n   plate, the officer may use lawful means to identify the owner. Under division (B), the fact that a person or entity is owner of a vehicle is prima facie evidence the person or entity was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation. Under division (C), within 30 days of the traffic law violation, the local authority may issue and send by regular mail a ticket charging the owner, and the ticket must comply with R.C 4511.097. Lastly, division (D) provides that a certified copy of the ticket, sworn to or affirmed by an officer, including by electronic means, and the recorded images produced by the traffic camera, is prima facie evidence and is admissible in a proceeding for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellants generally assert R.C. 4511.096 is a process provision that requires local authorities to examine evidence, to determine if a violation occurred, to identify and notify driver or owner of the violation, and to properly fine and commence the administrative process against the person or entity held responsible. Appellants further argue this statute establishes uniform standards for the admissibility of evidence derived from traffic cameras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Appellee contends this statute reveals appellants' attempt to micromanage municipalities that have enacted traffic-camera laws, and that the statute and its parts merely limit municipal power rather than serve an overriding statewide interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 49} We find the language of R.C. 4511.096 limits appellee's municipal power, as it attempts to control and dictate to the municipality the way in which it must act with regard to citing citizens with citations derived from traffic cameras. Moreover, we find the provision does not serve an overriding statewide interest. Therefore, we hold that R.C. 4511.096 fails to satisfy the third prong of the general-law test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellants also argue R.C. 4511.096 establishes rules to govern both citizens and local authorities on the issuance and contesting of traffic-camera citations.

We agree the\n   <em>\n    thou-shalt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    thou-shalt-not\n   </em>\n   language of the statute is directed to municipalities rather than Ohio citizenry generally.

Under division (B), a local authority must process a ticket and shall send the ticket by ordinary mail to the owner of the vehicle, and there are further details of what the local authority must ensure the ticket contains. Under division (C), a local authority must send a ticket within 30 days after the violation. And lastly, under division (D), the local authority may elect to send by ordinary mail a warning notice instead of a ticket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Appellants argue R.C. 4511.097 is a process provision that establishes a uniform scheme to ensure that violations\n   caught by traffic camera are processed under uniform, clear standards.

Under division (B), a local authority that receives an affidavit or a notification from an owner may send a ticket that conforms with R.C. 4511.097(B) to the designated party, and the local authority must send the ticket to the designated party by ordinary mail within 21 days after receipt of the affidavit or notification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Appellants argue R.C. 4511.098 is a process provision that establishes a uniform scheme to ensure that violations caught by traffic camera are processed and challenged under uniform, clear standards and contesting procedures.

The hearing officer then must issue a written decision imposing liability for the violation on the owner and submit it to the local authority and the owner.

Under division (B), a manufacturer of a traffic camera must provide the local authority with a certificate of proper operation that attests to accuracy, and in the division there are two requirements listed for every camera that is considered mobile. Under division (C), if three conditions are met, the local authority cannot issue a ticket based on evidence recorded by a camera where a vehicle makes a turn-on-red-signal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Appellants generally assert that R.C. 4511.0911 is a maintenance and certification provision that establishes a uniform scheme to ensure that the traffic cameras utilized are reliable and accurate, and that division (C) specifically establishes uniform standards for the admissibility of evidence to ensure turn-on-red-signal violations are processed and addressed under uniform, clear standards and processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 91} Appellee contends divisions (A) and (B) merely limit municipal power by interfering with the contractual relationship between the manufacturer and municipality, and that division (C) limits municipal home-rule power by placing unnecessary constraints on and micromanaging municipal affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 92} We agree with appellee, and find divisions (A) and (B) limit appellee's home-rule authority by mandating that the municipality contract for a service from the manufacturer for which the municipality may or may not have otherwise contracted. There is no overriding statewide interest to place such constraints on the contractual relationship between the municipality and manufacturer. Additionally, we find the language of division (C) limits appellee's authority because it is solely aimed at micromanaging the administrative affairs of the municipality. Therefore, we hold that R.C. 4511.0911 fails to satisfy the third prong of the general-law test of\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 93} Appellants further argue generally that R.C. 4511.0911 establishes a rule to govern citizens and local authorities on the issuance and contesting of traffic-camera citations.

We find no clear application of the language outside of this directing action, and find that R.C. 4511.0911(C) interferes with home-rule authority by not prescribing a rule of conduct on citizens generally because the provision is directed at local authorities.
