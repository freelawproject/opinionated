Pierce appeals the November 3, 2015 judgment entry of the Meigs County Common Pleas Court. Appellant had previously entered guilty pleas to felonious assault, aggravated burglary, and violation of protection order. On appeal, Appellant asserts that (1) the trial court erred in imposing sentence because his sentence is void, in part; and (2) the trial court erred by denying his motion for judgment on the pleadings. Upon review, we find Appellant's first assignment of error has merit. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the trial court, as to the sentence, and remand the matter for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} On June 22, 2015, Appellant was indicted on five counts: (1) felonious assault, R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) ; (2) aggravated burglary, R.C. 2911.11(A)(2) ; (3) child endangering, R.C. 2919.22(A) ; (4) disrupting public services, R.C. 2904.04(A)(1); and (5) violating a protection order, R.C. 2919.26 or 3113.31. The indictment stemmed from events which occurred on or about June 1, 2015, when Appellant was alleged to have entered a dwelling where his ex-partner (the mother of his children) and another male were sleeping and inflicted injury on the male. Appellant subsequently entered pleas to felonious assault, aggravated burglary, and violating a protection order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} The October 30, 2015 sentencing transcript reflects the parties presented the trial court with a plea agreement. The trial court explained to Appellant that it was not bound by the sentencing recommendation and also stated its intent to follow the Plea Agreement. The State then summarized the Plea Agreement on the record and Appellant's counsel acknowledged it was set forth correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} The transcript also reflects the trial court engaged in required colloquy as to Appellant's constitutional rights and voluntariness of his pleas. The court then announced its intention to proceed to sentencing\n   unless there was an objection. Appellant's counsel made no objection and actually requested the court to proceed to sentencing. The judgment entry of sentence is file-stamped November 3, 2015. The entry contains the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The Court has considered the record, any oral statements, any victim impact statement, any plea agreement, any victim approval, and\n   <em>\n    any pre-sentence report prepared\n   </em>\n   , as we as the principles and purposes or sentencing under Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.11, and has balanced the seriousness and recidivism factors Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.12.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The relevant portions of Appellant's sentence are set forth as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, that the Defendant be sentenced to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction for a period of thirty-six (36) months for Count Five, Violating a Protection Order, * * * a felony of the third degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, as to Count One, Felonious Assault * * * a felony of the second degree and Count Two, Aggravated Burglary, * * * a felony of the first degree, that the Defendant be sentenced to five (5) years of community control, with an underlying sentence of five (5) years on each count.

The Court makes the appropriate findings to impose said consecutive sentences as required by Section 2929.14(C)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court, additionally and specifically, finds that, pursuant to Revised Code Section 2953.08(D)(1) that said sentence is an agreed sentence and therefore is not appealable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   It is further Ordered, as a special condition of community control, that the Defendant successfully complete the SEPTA Program. The Defendant shall enter the SEPTA program within thirty (30) days of his release from prison herein. * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It is further Ordered that the Defendant have no contact with the victims * * * or their families, * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * * Count One, post release control is mandatory for a period of five years.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b65} The record indicates on December 13, 2017, Appellant filed a Motion to Vacate Void Judgment. In the motion, Appellant argued the community control sanctions imposed in 2015 on counts one and two are void pursuant to the Supreme Court of Ohio's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Anderson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4353992\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/143/173/\">\n    143 Ohio St.3d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-2089\">\n    2015-Ohio-2089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20N.E.3d%20512\">\n    35 N.E.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   explicitly held that a trial court is not authorized to impose a no-contact order in addition to prison sentences. On February 8, 2018, Appellant filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, asking the trial court to rule on his Motion to Vacate Void Judgment. In a February 20, 2018 entry the trial court pointed out that Appellant voluntarily pleaded to all counts and ultimately concluded the Motion to Vacate was time-barred. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I. \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SENTENCING DEFENDANT/APPELLANT ISAAC J.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   PIERCE TO TERMS OF COMMUNITY CONTROL WITHOUT A PRE-SENTENCE INVESTIGATION REPORT AND CONSECUTIVE TO A PRISON SENTENCE, AS SUCH, PART OF APPELLANT'S SENTENCE IS VOID.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   II.

Although he seeks to render his sentence void, his \"Motion to Vacate Void Judgment\" does not claim denial of constitutional rights and thus we do not consider it under the standard of review appropriate for post-conviction motions for relief. Appellant argues his sentence is void because the trial court failed to obtain and consider a pre-sentence investigation report, pursuant to R.C. 2951.03(A)(1), which provides that \"[N]o person who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony shall be placed under a community control sanction until a written presentence investigation report has been considered by the court.\" The determination of whether a judgment is void is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He also asserts that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anderson, supra,\n   </em>\n   his consecutive sentence of community control after the completion of his prison sentence is void. We begin with his first argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b610} In this case, although the judgment entry of sentence states Appellant's sentence was considered pursuant to \"any pre-sentence investigation report prepared,\" the transcript itself does not indicate a pre-sentence investigation was ordered or considered by the trial court. Indeed, the transcript reflects that Appellant's counsel did not object to proceeding to sentencing on the same day that Appellant entered his pleas. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Klein, supra,\n   </em>\n   this court held that Klein's community control sentence on an attempted tampering with evidence conviction was contrary to law and not authorized by law, rendering the sentence void, where the trial court did not consider a presentence investigation report before imposing sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21, 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b611} \" 'In general, a void judgment is one that has been imposed by a court that lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the case or the authority to act.

The state has argued that based on R.C. 2951.03(A)(1) and Crim.R. 32.2, a community-control sentence is always subject to a presentence investigation and that a trial court that fails to order a presentence investigation is not authorized to place an offender on a community-control sentence. Reluctantly, we must agree. R.C. 2951.03(A)(1) specifically states that \"[n]o person who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony shall be placed under a community control sanction until a written presentence investigation report has been considered by the court,\" and Crim.R. 32.2 states that \"[i]n felony cases the court shall * * * order a presentence investigation and report before imposing community control sanctions or granting probation.\" These provisions are simply too clear to ignore.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b617} Therefore, in\n   <em>\n    Klein,\n   </em>\n   we concluded that the Supreme Court Ohio \"evidently agrees with the argument that 'a trial court that fails to order a presentence investigation is not authorized to place an offender on a community-control sentence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Klein\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 19 ;\n   <em>\n    Amos,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.

Here, the trial court did not consider a presentence investigation report before imposing sentence, and thus the sentence was not authorized by law. The original community control sentence is consequently void.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b618} In Appellant's case, the State has argued that Appellant's sentence of community control without the benefit of a pre-sentence investigation report is not subject to review because it is an agreed sentence. The State in\n   <em>\n    Cupp, supra,\n   </em>\n   argued similarly. In the context of a post-release control issue, Cupp argued his sentence of post-release control was void\n   because when the trial court originally imposed post-release control, it did not provide a proper notification in the final judgment. The State argued that pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), Cupp was not permitted by law to challenge his sentence because (1) the sentence was jointly recommended by the parties, and (2) the sentence was authorized by law. We disagreed and held at \u00b6 27 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"Our recent cases illustrate that sentences that do not comport with mandatory provisions are subject to total resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nor can agreement to such sentences insulate them from appellate review, for they are not authorized by law. We hold that a sentence is \"authorized by law\" and is not appealable within the meaning of R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) only if it comports with all mandatory sentencing provisions. A trial court does not have the discretion to exercise its jurisdiction in a manner that ignores mandatory statutory provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As in\n   <em>\n    Cupp,\n   </em>\n   the State's contention about the agreed nature of Appellant's sentence has no merit. Appellant's sentences to community control with first obtaining and considering a pre-sentence investigation report renders his community control sentences void. Appellant cannot agree to waive his right to appeal a void sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b620} Here, the State also points out that Appellant did not voice any objection to proceeding to sentencing without having a pre-sentence investigation report prepared and considered. Therefore, the State argues, Appellant has waived any issue as to the lack of a pre-sentence report. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Klein,\n   </em>\n   defense counsel did not object to the trial court's failure to consider a presentence investigation report prior to sentencing him to community control. However, we found no merit to the waiver argument in that context as well. We concluded: \"Nonetheless, \"[a] sentence not authorized by statute * * * cannot be imposed because it is included in a plea agreement, or because defense counsel failed to object at the sentencing hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Klein,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20, quoting\n   <em>\n    Stump,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-1487\">\n    2014-Ohio-1487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b621} For the foregoing reasons, Appellant's first and second assignments of error are sustained. Appellant's sentences of\n   community control on count one, felonious assault, and of community control on count two, aggravated burglary, are contrary to law and are also not authorized by law because the trial court failed to consider a pre-sentence investigation report prior to imposing community control. Therefore, the sentences are void and must be vacated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judgment of the trial court imposing community control sentences on those counts is also vacated. As such, this matter is remanded for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b622} We have considered Appellant's assignments of error jointly. Our resolution of Appellant's first assignment of error as to the issue of the pre-sentence investigation report is dispositive of this matter. We need not address his second argument regarding the consecutive nature of his sentence as that issue has been rendered moot. We therefore decline to address the second assignment of error. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence as stated herein and remand this matter for re-sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs in Judgment and Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Abele, J.: Concurs in Judgment Only.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Counts three and four were dismissed without prejudice, pursuant to the plea agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Outside the context of a direct appeal, R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) governs our review of his sentence.
