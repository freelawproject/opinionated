Appellant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In this case, we address whether appellant's failure to raise the issue of a defective indictment until after the jury was empaneled waives all but plain error review; whether the indictment's failure to identify an underlying offense and/or the mens rea of that underlying offense amounts to a defect; and if so, whether the filing of a bill of particulars that identified felonious assault as the predicate offense, remedied any defect. As set forth below, we answer all three questions in the affirmative. That is, under a plain error review, the bill of particulars in this case cured the otherwise defective indictment and provided adequate notice of the underlying offense supporting appellant's murder charge. We also find that appellant's conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the court's order of restitution was proper. Accordingly, the trial court's November 9, 2017 decision is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The state presented evidence that appellant, aged 19, shot and killed \"S.H.,\" aged 16, on the afternoon of June 11, 2017, in the street next to Sherman Elementary School, in Toledo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The victim's friend, \"A.J.,\" testified that, on the day of his murder, the victim texted her and asked her to meet him on the school playground. A.J. met him there, and the two talked while seated on a bench, located inside a fenced area of the school's playground. Within ten minutes, three \"boys,\" all of them unknown to A.J., rode up on their bikes. The victim got up from the bench and, walking backward with his eyes on the boys, exited the gate. The victim then turned and began to run across Peck Street, which borders the school. A.J. watched as appellant, who was in the middle of the street, \"pulled out a gun and shot [the victim].\" The victim \"fell immediately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant was the last to pedal away, and before he did, he looked directly at A.J., who remained near the bench. A.J. testified that appellant \"was standing up on the bike almost like dropping a gun while he was looking at me.\" A.J. could not recall what appellant was wearing, except\n   to say that he was not wearing a hat. After they were gone, A.J. flagged down the driver of a car to ask for help, and the driver called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer Gary Bunting and his partner were the first to respond to the dispatch. When Bunting turned his patrol car onto Peck Street, he saw a person standing in the middle of the road flagging him down and another person lying near the curb, on his left side, face up, close to the intersection of Peck and Walnut Street. Bunting testified that the victim was alive, but non-responsive. \"Within a minute,\" an ambulance arrived, and the victim was transported to the hospital, where he died later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Toledo Police Detective Jeffery Jackson, who works in the scientific investigations unit, processed the crime scene and took photographs. When he arrived at the scene, about 3:15 p.m., he collected evidence, including a fired 9 millimeter shell casing that police found on the sidewalk, near the intersection of Peck and Walnut Streets. Later, Jackson attended the autopsy and observed bullet fragments that were removed from \"inside the victim's skull.\" According to the coroner, who testified, the bullet entered the back of the victim's skull and exited on the opposite side. The actual bullet was not recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The police viewed videos captured by three surveillance cameras that were in the area. The first video, taken by a camera attached to the school, shows the victim walking backward, exiting the playground through the gate. A second or two later, three males on bikes follow him. All four then moved out of view of the camera. The second video, taken from a private residence on a nearby street (Locust), shows two boys on bicycles riding down the road, followed ten seconds later, at 2:32:12 p.m., by a third boy, who was later identified as appellant. The third video is similar to the second, taken around the same time, from a front porch of a home on Peck Street and shows the same two boys on bikes, followed seconds later by appellant. After appellant and his friends biked out of view, two police cars can be seen driving down Peck Street, toward the school (in the opposite direction of the bikers), in response to the 911 dispatch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Portions of the videos were released to the public, and \"within a few days\" the three young men on bicycles were identified as appellant, Omar Sykes, and Antonio Scott. A warrant was issued for appellant, and a photo array, that included appellant's picture, was shown to A.J. on June 27, 2017. A.J. identified appellant as the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Detective Anderson interviewed appellant at 10:00 p.m. on July 3, 2017, after his arrest. The interview was played for the jury. When asked if he knew why a warrant had been issued for his arrest, appellant asked if it had something to do with \"the bike situation.\" Det. Anderson responded that appellant was there because of \"the thing that happened at Walnut and Peck * * * near Sherman School.\" Appellant asked, \"I'm here because I'm a witness, right?\" Anderson told appellant that the police had viewed videos and talked to \"eye-witnesses\" including \"Sykes.\" At that time, Anderson provided appellant with his Miranda rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During the course of the interrogation, appellant admitted that he had been with Sykes and Scott; that they were on their bikes; that he had seen the victim near the playground; and that the victim was with a \"female.\" Appellant told the detective that he tried to talk to the victim, but the victim \"got up and walked away.\" He maintained that \"that's when somebody shot him.\" Appellant heard a gunshot, but he did not see the shooter, because he was facing the victim and watched him fall\n   after being shot. Appellant confirmed that he was the last of this friends to bike away. He maintained that he was fixing his bike chain, which caused him to be momentarily delayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant admitted that he had, in the past, \"fought it out\" with the victim over something the victim said about one of appellant's friends, but ever since then, their relationship was \"cool,\" and appellant \"had no trouble with the man.\" Appellant maintained his innocence, throughout the interrogation. When it ended, the police notified appellant that he would be charged with murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The victim's mother, \"F.H.,\" testified that her son and appellant had gone to Sherman Elementary School together and that there was \"bad blood\" between them. Sometime in 2016, appellant knocked on the door of her home and asked to see the victim. Outside, the victim and appellant exchanged words. When F.H. went to see what was going on, she observed appellant put his fists up in the air, as if to fight. Appellant told F.H., \"no disrespect, but they telling me your son want to fight me.\" F.H. told appellant not to listen to what others were saying and then told appellant to leave. As he did, appellant told the victim, \"I catch you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} After her son's murder, F.H. captured several \"screen shots\" from appellant's Facebook page. Five days before the murder, a post appeared on appellant's page that said, \"[g]ot this big o ruger 40 shots clip im going to blame it on em,\" followed by several emojis (i.e. pictures), including two gun emojis. A \"ruger\" is a type of firearm. During his interrogation with the police, appellant was shown the post, and he did not deny that it was his. Two additional posts appeared the next day, now four days before the murder. One said, \"[i]f you know Rambo is a hoe drop a like comment or emoji.\" Evidence introduced at trial established that the victim's street name was \"Rambo.\" The other post that day said, \"Life's not fare im trying kill something purg.\" [Sic].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Excerpts from jail house phone conversations between appellant and third parties were played for the jury. In the first, on July 9, 2017, appellant asked an unidentified woman, who called appellant \"baby,\" for a \"favor\" which consisted of deleting all of his Facebook posts. Appellant explained that, \"I don't want Facebook no more.\" Three days later, appellant asked the same woman whether she had \"deactivat[ed]\" his Facebook account yet. The woman answered that she had not, due to a lack of internet access. Appellant responded that she should \"get around wifi quick * * * cuz that shit not * * * no joke.\" In the two other calls, appellant can be heard talking to his mother and then an unidentified female, which the state alleged was evidence that appellant was attempting to create an alibi for himself at the time of the murder. The audio quality of the last two phone calls was poor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Following a three day trial that began on October 16, 2017, a jury returned a guilty verdict, and the trial court ordered a presentence investigation. On November 9, 2017, the trial court sentenced appellant to prison \"for a period of Life with parole eligibility after having served a full 15 years in prison.\" The court ordered an additional mandatory prison sentence of three (3) years for the gun specification, to be served consecutively, for a total mandatory prison term of 18 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Through appellate counsel, appellant assigns the following errors by the trial court for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </strong>\n   : The indictment was defective such that appellant's Due Process rights pursuant to Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7 10 and the Fifth\n   Amendment to the U.S. Constitution were violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </strong>\n   : Appellant's conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, and appellant is entitled to a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </strong>\n   : The trial court erred in imposing restitution because it failed to consider, on the record, whether appellant had the ability to pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    The bill of particulars cured the defective indictment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In his first assignment of error, appellant claims that his indictment on the charge of murder was defective because it failed to \"identify the predicate offense and the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of the predicate offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Crim.R. 12(C) provides that \"[p]rior to trial, any party may raise by motion any * * * objection * * * that is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue. The following must be raised before trial: * * * (2) Defenses and objections based on defects in the indictment * * *.\" Appellant claims that he \"challenged the indictment before trial. (TT., p. 83).\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} That part of the transcript cited by appellant establishes that defense counsel objected to the inclusion of a particular\n   <em>\n    jury instruction,\n   </em>\n   not to the indictment. Specifically, defense counsel indicated that he would object to an instruction of the term \"knowing\" because, \"neither the element of knowingly nor the greater charge of felonious assault is set forth in the indictment.\" Even if the objection could be characterized as one involving the indictment, it would be considered untimely. Counsel raised the objection during a recess on the first day of trial, after the jury was impaneled but before opening statements. A failure to make a Crim.R. 12 motion until after the jury is empaneled waives the objection.\n   <em>\n    State v. Boaston,\n   </em>\n   6th Dist.

The bill of particulars specified that the predicate offenses were those charged in counts one, two and three of the indictment, i.e. possession of heroin, trafficking in heroin, and illegal manufacture of drugs, as well as the uncharged offenses of marijuana possession and trafficking. The court of appeals found that the bill of particulars, which was filed three months before trial, cured the indictment's defect and provided the defendant with \"ample time to prepare a defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 27} More recently, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The indictment tracked the specific statutory language of the kidnapping offense, R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) (which prohibits restraining another's liberty \"[t]o facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter\"), but it did not specify the predicate offense. The bill of particulars alleged that the defendant \"cause[d] serious physical harm to the victim,\" but it too failed to identify a predicate offense by name or statutory number. Nonetheless, the court found that the language of the bill of particulars \"effectively\" identified felonious assault, \"the only other felony in the indictment, [as] the predicate offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. The court concluded that, based on the indicted offenses, the applicable statute, the lack of an objection, the bill of particulars, and the record from the guilty plea, the defendant's due process rights had not been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Unlike the indictments in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Baker,\n   </em>\n   the indictment in this case charged no other offenses which could arguably have put appellant on notice as to what the predicate offense was. Like those cases, however, the state filed a bill of particulars, which states, in part, \"To wit: Darnell Bryant-Bey did cause the death of [S.H.] as the proximate result of committing or attempting to commit an offense of violence that was a felony of the second degree, namely\n   <em>\n    felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2)\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Because the bill of particulars identified the underlying offense, by name and by number, we find that it was sufficient to remedy the indictment. Given the timing of when it was filed, i.e. the first day of trial, it failed to provide advance notice to appellant of the predicate offense. While far from desirable, we cannot say that it nullifies the curative effect of the bill of particulars, however, for two reasons. First, as appellant repeatedly argues, his appeal \"is not based on notice or lack thereof.\" Second, the state identified felonious assault as the predicate offense, on the record, before trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all of these reasons, we find that the bill of particulars cured the indictment's failure to identify a predicate offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellant also complains that the indictment \"contains no mens rea for the offense.\" The same argument was raised in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Horner,\n   </em>\n   the defendant was indicted on two counts of aggravated robbery, as set forth in R.C. 2911.01(A)(3), which provides that \"[n]o person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall * * * [i]nflict, or attempt to inflict, serious physical harm on another.\" The defendant in that case argued that the indictment was insufficient because \"a culpable mental state was not included in the indictment.\" The court noted that that the aggravated robbery offense does not include proof of a mental state but that the predicate offense, i.e. R.C. 2913.01, does.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. The court held that \"[a]n indictment that charges an offense by tracking the language of the criminal statute is not defective for failure to identify a culpable mental state when the statute itself fails to specify a mental state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at paragraph one of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In this case, appellant concedes that felony murder is a strict liability offense, i.e. it does not include a mental state. He argues, however, that the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Horner\n   </em>\n   does not apply because the statutes are different. He claims that the aggravated robbery statute in\n   <em>\n    Horner\n   </em>\n   \"specifically refers to the underlying offense (a theft offense), [which] itself includes a mens rea\" whereas the felony murder statute in this case \"refers to no particular predicate offense,\" other than a general reference to \"an offense of violence that is a felony of the first or second degree * * *.\" R.C. 2903.02(B). Appellant continues, \"an indictment [of a strict liability offense] indicating no predicate offense, contain[s] no mens rea for the jury, thereby violating the defendant's right to a prosecution by grand jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The state counters that\n   <em>\n    Horner\n   </em>\n   \"is not limited to statutes in which the [indicted] offense refers to a predicate offense by name, and appellant has offered no language from the case that limits the holding in such a fashion.\" We agree. In addition, to the extent that appellant suggests that the predicate offense in\n   <em>\n    Horner\n   </em>\n   makes specific reference to a mens rea, we note that it does not. That is, no mens rea is set forth in the predicate offense, i.e. R.C. 2913.01(K). Similarly, in the instant case, no mens rea is set forth in the bill of particulars; only reference to \"felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2)\" is made. Returning to the court's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Buehner,\n   </em>\n   that an indictment need not identify the elements of a predicate offense, we find that, because the felony murder statute does not require proof of a mental state, the absence of any reference to a mental state does not render the indictment defective.\n   <em>\n    Buehner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5585659\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/110/403/\">\n    110 Ohio St.3d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-4707\">\n    2006-Ohio-4707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=853%20N.E.2d%201162\">\n    853 N.E.2d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 12 ;\n   <em>\n    Horner\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Our decision comports with other similar cases.

While a sentencing court is not required to hold a separate hearing when determining whether to impose a financial sanction under these provisions, the record must contain some evidence that the court considered the offender's present and future ability to pay such a sanction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We look to the totality of the record to determine whether the requirement has been satisfied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellant claims that \"the record does not show that the trial court considered appellant's future ability to pay when it imposed restitution at the sentencing hearing.\" Appellant cites his indigency and minimum 18 year prison sentence as evidence that he has no ability to pay restitution in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Prior to ordering restitution, the trial court stated that it had \"carefully reviewed\" appellant's PSI. The PSI indicates that appellant does not have a high school degree and that his only known employment history involved temporary landscaping work that was court-ordered while appellant was on probation as a juvenile. On the other hand, appellant was shown to be physically strong and in seemingly good health. Although he will not be released from prison before he is 38 years old, there is nothing in the record indicating he will be unable to gain employment at that time. We find that the trial court's determination, that \"[d]efendant found to have, or reasonably may be expected to have, the means to pay restitution\" is not plain error.\n   <em>\n    Accord,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As noted by the state, the determination that a defendant is indigent for purposes of appointed counsel is separate and distinct from a determination that the person is indigent for purposes of paying a mandatory fine or financial sanction.\n   <em>\n    State v.
