It submitted a site plan to the city's planning commission, which rejected the plan. Thereafter, Kent Investors submitted a revised site plan, which the planning commission again rejected. Kent Investors filed an administrative appeal with the Portage County Court of Common Pleas, which set a briefing schedule. After briefing had commenced, eight nearby property owners sought to intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By a judgment entry filed September 27, 2017, the trial court denied the motion to intervene. By a judgment entry filed September 29, 2017, the trial court reversed the planning commission's denial of approval for the revised site plan, and ordered the project to go forward pursuant to that plan. The reason for the denial was that the board members who rejected the plan did so for reasons not contained in the zoning code, and admitted this on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b62} Appellants, the property owners timely noticed this appeal, assigning three errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"[1.] The trial court abused its discretion by determining that appellants' motion to intervene was not timely filed and did not comply with the other requirements of Civ.R. 24(A) and (C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"[2.] The trial court abused its discretion by holding that appellants lacked standing to intervene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [3.] The trial court abused its discretion when it reversed the decision of the Kent Planning Commission to deny the site plan.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} We commence our analysis by considering the third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b64} A court of appeals reviews the judgment of the trial court in an administrative appeals case to discover, whether as a matter of law, the trial court's judgment is supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Dinardo v.

Similarly, we hold that a board of zoning appeals cannot ignore the zoning code, and reject a site plan subjectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b66} This disposition of the third assignment of error renders the first and second moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b67} Further, a review of the record reveals that the property owners never sought or received a stay of the trial court's judgment, either in that court or this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b68} March 27, 2018, Kent Investors moved to dismiss this appeal as moot. Attached to its motion is the affidavit of Gary O'Nesti, project manager for the subject development. In his affidavit, Mr. O'Nesti avers that Kent Investors commenced construction of the development March 5, 2018, and that the footers were completed March 26, 2018. Photographs of the construction are attached to the affidavit as exhibits. In its motion, Kent Investor points to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Smola v. Legeza\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.

The appeal is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b613} At this juncture, the property owners only potential remedy lies in having the Supreme Court of Ohio overturn the law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Dinardo\n   </em>\n   , or possibly, by way of writ, since, absence a reversal of the law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Dinardo\n   </em>\n   , no legal remedy remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b614} Appellee's motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   TIMOTHY P.

The opinion should be limited to this analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nextel W. Corp. v. Franklin Cty.
