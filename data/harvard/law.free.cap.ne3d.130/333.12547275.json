For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case stems from an incident in March 2018 in which a freezer malfunction at one of defendants-appellees University Hospitals Health System, Inc.'s (\"UHHS\") facilities caused the destruction of a number of human eggs and/or embryos being stored at the facility. The Pennimans allege that one or more of their cryogenically preserved embryos were destroyed as a result of the malfunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Pennimans filed two separate actions in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court against UHHS and related entities. Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-18-894396 is an action for money damages. Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-18-895503 is an action in declaratory judgment, in which the Pennimans seek \"a declaratory judgment * * * that the life of a person begins at the moment of conception, declaring that the legal status of an embryo is that of a person; and for costs incurred herein.\" UHHS subsequently moved to consolidate the two cases. The Pennimans objected to consolidation. The trial court granted UHHS's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 4} UHHS filed a motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). The Pennimans objected to the motion. The trial court granted UHHS's motion to dismiss finding that the Pennimans' complaint did not state a claim under Ohio law. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Pennimans raise one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I.

The Pennimans claim that a real controversy exists as to the legal status of embryos that is justiciable in character. The trial court disagreed, finding that \"an embryo that has not been implanted into the uterus does not constitute a 'distinct human entity' and thus is not entitled under the law of Ohio to the rights and protections of a person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The term embryo is not well-defined under Ohio law. The embryos at issue in this case were cryogenically preserved, or frozen, embryos. Some states refer to embryos that have not yet been implanted in the uterus as pre-embryos.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Rooks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20CO%2085\">\n    2018 CO 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571228\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/429/579/\">\n    429 P.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). There is no contention that an embryo that has not yet been implanted into the uterus cannot, on its own, become a child. In other words, medical intervention is necessary in order for a pre-implanted embryo to form into a child. In\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

For ease of discussion, because the contract between the Pennimans and UHHS referred to \"embryos,\" and because the parties have chosen to use the term \"embryo,\" we refer to the word \"embryo\" throughout this opinion to refer to pre-implanted embryos in general and the Pennimans' pre-implanted\n   cryogenically preserved embryos specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} R.C. 2901.01(B) defines a \"person\" as \"i. An individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, and association; ii. An unborn human who is viable.\" R.C. 2901.01(B)(1)(a). R.C. 2919.19(J) defines an \"unborn human individual\" as \"an individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth.\" R.C. 2919.19(B) defines a \"fetus\" as \"human offspring developing during pregnancy from the moment of conception and includes the embryonic stage of development.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The Pennimans argue that the trial court incorrectly relied on criminal code sections to determine whether an embryo is a person, but themselves rely on R.C. 2919.19 to support their claim that an embryo is a person. The Pennimans contend that because R.C. 2919.19(J) defines an \"unborn human individual\" as \"an individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth,\" the life of a person begins at the moment of conception. What the Pennimans miss is that while an \"unborn human individual\" under Ohio law begins at the moment of conception, in order for an unborn human to constitute a \"person\" under the statute, the unborn human must be viable. Ohio law defines \"viable\" as \"the stage of development of a human fetus at which there is realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing of life outside the womb with or without temporary artificial life-sustaining support.\" R.C. 2901.01(B)(1)(c)(ii). An embryo does not fit within this definition. As the trial court in this case concluded: \"If a nonviable fetus is not a distinct human entity, then certainly an embryo which has not been implanted into the uterus, and which accordingly is not even as yet a fetus, cannot be found to be more than that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Two other statutes, which the parties referenced but the trial court did not rely on, R.C. 2307.11 and R.C. 1.59, define a \"person,\" in part, as an \"individual.\" The Pennimans argue that because the term \"individual\" is not further defined, \"it is reasonable to believe that embryos are included within this definition of a person.\" Appellant's brief, p. 13. The Pennimans cite no authority for their argument and we find it unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The state legislature has not extended the rights of the fetus to an embryo.

As mentioned, in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the touchstone \"is the viability of the child, for a nonviable fetus is not a distinct human entity with rights that can be enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Pennimans suggest that because\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   determined that the deciding factor in the rights of an unborn child under the wrongful death act is the viability at the time of injury, this court should consider the viability of an embryo at the time of injury to the embryo. According to the Pennimans, while viability of a fetus is determined as being the stage of development at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing life outside the womb, R.C. 2901.01(B)(1)(c)(ii), the determination for the viability of an embryo is different. According to the Pennimans, Wendy Penniman's doctors made the determination that her embryos were viable before they froze them: \"Since only three embryos were frozen, it is clear that at the time of Appellant's treatment, her\n   doctors made the determination of which embryos were viable [and] [t]hose viable embryos were subsequently frozen for later use.\" Appellant's brief, page 17. Thus, the Pennimans argue, if we were to follow the logic in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the determining factor for deciding the rights of an embryo should be the viability of the embryo at the time of injury to the embryo. We disagree; the Pennimans provide no authority for their attempt to redefine and expand the definition of viability in the context of personhood and we find their argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} As mentioned, this is a case of first impression in this state.

According to the husband, the contract was unconstitutional pursuant to the 13th Amendment. The court disagreed, noting that \"[c]ourts have not afforded frozen embryos legally protected interests akin to persons,\" and, further, that the trial court's treatment of the embryos as property was not an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57, 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Thus, no court in Ohio has extended the rights of a viable fetus to a nonviable fetus, let alone an embryo that has not yet been implanted into the uterus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Additionally, contrary to the Pennimans' argument, existing statutory definitions of a person do not conflict with each other and thus collectively do not create ambiguity over whether an \"embryo\" is a \"person\" under Ohio law. Statutes mentioned throughout this opinion define terms in a way that give certain unborn humans specific protections under Ohio law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2901.01(B) ; R.C. 2919.16(M). None of these statutes extend those protections to embryos. In other words, the General Assembly has adopted statutory provisions to protect certain rights possessed by unborn children and has historically defined who possesses the rights it has conferred. The legislature has not extended those rights to embryos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} By way of illustration, when the General Assembly intends to refer to unborn children as persons, it does so by expressly adding them to a definition that already includes individuals.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2901.01(B)(1)(a)(i) (defining person to include \"an individual,\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2901.01(B)(1)(a)(ii) (defining person also to\n   include \"[a]n unborn human who is viable\"). There is no conflict between a statute defining a \"person\" as including \"individuals\" and one that defines this same term as including \"an unborn human who is viable.\" Additionally, we find no conflict between defining an \"unborn human\" as \"an individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth\" and limiting personhood to an \"unborn human who is viable.\" A broad definition of an \"unborn human\" does not require an equally broad definition of its legally protected rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Neither have Ohio courts afforded frozen embryos legally protected interests akin to persons.\n   <em>\n    Cwik\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

It is undisputed, however, that the pre-implanted embryos being stored at UHHS's facilities were not capable of independent survival. We reject a cause of action for wrongful death on behalf of an embryo and instead defer to the legislature for any substantial expansion of the scope of liability under Ohio's wrongful death statute - Ohio law does not allow a cause of action based upon the alleged wrongful death of an embryo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Thus, the trial court correctly concluded that an embryo that has not been implanted into the uterus of a woman does not constitute a \"distinct human entity\" and is therefore not entitled to the rights and protections of a person.

In other words, the trial court declared the rights of the parties upon the motion to dismiss filed under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). This was error. As the majority notes, the answer to the relief sought may well be a novel issue under Ohio law. If that is the case, the parties are entitled to fully litigate the matter to conclusion, one that is not amenable to the summary proceeding provided through Civ.R. 12(B)(6). The declaration of rights, if indeed the plaintiffs are entitled to any, is premature based on the procedural posture of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Although that would resolve the pending appeal, it should be noted that the trial court and the majority claim that R.C. 2901.01(B) controls the outcome. Under the plain language of that statutory section, however, the legislature unambiguously declared that the definition of \"person\" provided in R.C. 2901.01(B)(1) is limited in usage and only applies to any section contained in Title 29 of the Ohio Revised Code \"that sets forth a criminal offense.\" That section is inapplicable to the current dispute. Applying the criminal definition of \"person\" to this civil matter contravenes the unambiguous language of the statute. We should not put words in the legislature's mouth. For example, and in contrast to the criminal definition of \"person,\" R.C. 2721.01 provides its own circular definition of \"person.\" \"As used in [R.C. Chapter 2721], 'person' means\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   , partnership, joint-stock company, unincorporated association, society, municipal corporation, or other corporation.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=499%20N.E.2d%205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Had the legislature intended for R.C. 2901.01(B)(1)(a)(ii) to apply for the purposes of civil or declaratory actions, it could have included that language in the relevant statutory sections. We must be mindful that just as the Ohio Supreme Court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Werling v. Sandy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818851\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/17/45/#p46\">\n    17 Ohio St.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20N.E.2d%201053\">\n    476 N.E.2d 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985), that \"the definition of a word in a civil statute does not necessarily import the same meaning to the same word in interpreting a criminal statute[,]\" the converse of that statement is equally true. Courts should not rely on the definition of a word in a criminal statute to necessarily import the same meaning in the civil sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Likewise,\n   <em>\n    Jones v. MetroHealth Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548106\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/633/\">\n    2017-Ohio-7329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548106\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/89/633/\">\n    89 N.E.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 101 (8th Dist.), offers limited support for the majority's decision. In\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   it was undisputed that the viable, unborn child asserting the lack of informed consent claims had the independent right to seek redress for injury caused by negligence. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   did not test the breadth of what constitutes a \"viable, unborn child\" for the purposes of negligence actions through the crucible of advocacy in the action asserting the unborn child's rights. Further,\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   relied on R.C. 2919.16(M) - that section is limited to defining the term \"viable\" \"[as] used in sections\n   <em>\n    2919.16\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2929.18\n   </em>\n   of the Ohio Revised Code.\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2919.16. Again, we cannot universally apply criminal statutes, especially those limited to defining to scope of criminal behavior, to all common law and statutory claims in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 37} And finally, any reliance on the statutory sections setting forth claims for wrongful death is well outside the scope of this appeal. The trial court made no such\n   declaration, and according to the complaint for declaratory relief, the plaintiffs are seeking a broad declaration without limitation or for any explained purpose. Although the complaint claims \"certain controversies\" exist surrounding the question of whether life begins at conception, there is no indication that plaintiffs are seeking to assert a wrongful death action on behalf of an embryo pending that declaration. Under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), courts are limited to reviewing the allegations of the complaint. The complaint for declaratory relief in this case does seek a declaration that the embryos have an independent cause of action for wrongful death intended to be filed upon conclusion of the declaratory relief action. Thus, the majority's rejection of that claim is outside the scope of the current litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Nevertheless, any declaration of the rights in this case goes to the merits of the parties' dispute, which the trial court impermissibly resolved through the summary proceedings. The trial court may dismiss a declaratory judgment action under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) if it concludes that there is no real controversy or justiciable issue between the parties, or the declaratory judgment will not terminate the uncertainty or controversy under R.C. 2721.07. Because the trial court resolved the ultimate issue presented in the complaint for declaratory relief upon the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, reversible error occurred. I would reverse the decision of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
