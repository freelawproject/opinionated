Fling appeals from the trial court's judgment in favor of Daniel in an action seeking a declaratory judgment that he has an easement for use of a spring and related water supply system on her property and an injunction prohibiting her from restricting his access to the water. Fling maintains that the trial court erred when it found that he does not have a prescriptive easement, that Ohio does not recognize easements by estoppel, and if it does, he does not have an easement by estoppel. However, the trial court's determination that Fling failed to establish the adversity element for a prescriptive easement is not against the manifest weight of the evidence because the evidence shows his parents' use of the water supply system was permissive. And although we conclude that Ohio recognizes easements by estoppel, the trial court's determination that Fling failed to establish such an easement is not against the manifest weight of the evidence because the evidence does not show that Fling's parents contributed to the installation and maintenance of the system in reliance on a purported easement. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} Fling's parents, William Fling (\"William Sr.\") and Juel Fling (\"Juel\"), formerly owned what we will refer to as the \"Fling Property.\" Daniel's father, Albert Fling (\"Albert\"), was the brother of William Sr. and formerly owned what we will refer to as the \"Daniel Property.\" Before 1962, water on the Fling Property\n   came from a pond, a cistern, and purchase. In 1962, the brothers decided to develop a spring on the Daniel Property. They installed a collection tank, water line, and electric pump on the Daniel Property and split the water line so one line ran to the Fling Property and another to the Daniel Property. The spring supplied water for both properties, which contained residences, farm buildings, and livestock operations. During their lifetime, the brothers performed repairs on the water supply system but had no written agreement regarding the spring or system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} Albert died, and Daniel and her sisters obtained title to the Daniel Property. In August 2000, William Sr., Juel, and Daniel executed an \"Agreement/Contract for Water Supply\" prepared by Juel. They agreed that \"a water supply\" on the Daniel Property currently provided water to both properties, that it would be used \"only for residential purposes,\" that the \"[w]ater lines, etc.\" from \"the source to the split\" would be maintained and repaired \"50/50 by the owners,\" and that the lines to each residence would be \"repaired and maintained 100% by each property owner.\" The agreement stated it would be in effect \"as long as either\" William Sr. or Juel \"resides at\" the Fling Property. In 2005, William Sr. died. In 2016, Juel died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} Fling does not live on the Fling Property but has rented out the house on it. He has operated an event barn on the property and currently operates a veterinary clinic there. Fling wanted to perform maintenance on the water supply system and improve it; however, he wanted to formalize his rights to the water supply before making these investments. In 2017, he had an attorney prepare a proposed waterline easement, which angered Daniel's husband and caused him to have the water line to the Fling Property cut and capped. Fling ran a water line to the Fling Property from other property he owns but wants to sell and estimated it would cost $ 35,000 to $ 40,000 to install a direct line from the county water supply to the Fling Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b65} Fling filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that he has an implied, prescriptive, equitable, or other easement regarding the spring, reformation of deeds to include the easement, and an injunction to prohibit Daniel from restricting his water access. After a trial, the court held that Fling \"has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that there is an easement for use of the water supply from the spring * * * and he is therefore not entitled to injunctive [relief] or to declaratory judgment on any of his claims.\" It found Fling did not have an implied easement because the parties' properties were not united in ownership prior to the construction of the water lines. It also held that Fling did not have a prescriptive easement because his parents' use of the spring was not exclusive and was permissive rather than adverse. The trial court noted the facts were \"somewhat analogous\" to those in\n   <em>\n    Yeager v. Tuning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"975225\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/79/121/\">\n    79 Ohio St. 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20N.E.%20657\">\n    86 N.E. 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908), and held that William and Albert had a \"parol agreement\" which was a \"revocable license.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b66} The trial court also found \"the Ohio Supreme Court has not recognized easements by estoppel.\" It observed that in\n   <em>\n    Kallner v.

The trial court determined\n   <em>\n    Yeager\n   </em>\n   \"remains the law of this state.\" However, it noted \"there are a number of appellate courts including the Fourth District that have allowed the argument of easement by estoppel despite\n   the holding in\n   <em>\n    Yeager\n   </em>\n   .\" But \"[e]ven if there is a cause of action of easement by estoppel in this state,\" Fling \"did not prove the elements\" because \"there is no evidence that [his] parents expended money on the water system in reliance upon their belief that there was an easement.\" Rather \"this was joint use by family members by agreement and at mutual expense.\" Thus, the trial court granted judgment in favor of Daniel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.
