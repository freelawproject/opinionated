GRENDELL, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   {\u00b61} Plaintiff-appellant, Shepherd of the Valley Lutheran Retirement Services, Inc., d.b.a. Shepherd of the Valley Howland Nursing Facility, appeals the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common\n   Pleas, granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, Richard Cesta, Executor of the Estate of Rose Cesta. The issue before this court is whether Shepherd of the Valley's claims against the Estate of Rose Cesta are barred by R.C. 2117.06(B). For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b62} On August 31, 2017, Shepherd of the Valley filed a Complaint in the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas against Cesta, Executor of the Estate of Rose Cesta, asserting that, at the time of Rose Cesta's death on May 15, 2016, she was indebted to Shepherd of the Valley in the principal amount of $ 24,867 \"for room, board, and health care related services rendered while a resident at the Plaintiff's nursing care facility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b63} On January 18, 2018, Cesta filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. On February 20, 2018, Shepherd of the Valley filed its Brief in Opposition. On March 1, 2018, Cesta filed a Reply to the Brief in Opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b64} On March 15, 2018, the trial court issued a Judgment Entry, granting Cesta's Motion for Summary Judgment. The court determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Rose Cesta died on May 15, 2016. At the time of her death, she was a resident of Plaintiff's long-term care facility located at 4100 North River Rd. NE[,] Warren Oh 44481. On November 14, 2016, attorney Jeffery Sobeck filed an application to be appointed as Special Administrator of the Estate of Rose Cesta. At the same time, Mr. Sobeck submitted a claim to the Trumbull County Probate Court regarding the alleged debt at issue in this case. Though he applied to be appointed as Special Administrator on November 14, 2016, he was not appointed by the Probate Court until November 21, 2016. Subsequently, Richard Cesta applied to be appointed as the executor of Rose's estate in accordance with Rose's will. The Court then revoked Mr. Sobeck's letters of authority and appointed Richard as executor on June 20, 2017. Upon appointment as executor, Richard rejected the Plaintiff's claim for the debt. Because Plaintiff believes it still has a valid claim, it filed suit within two months of Richard's rejection of the claim in accordance with Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2117.12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Rose passed away on May 15, 2016. Under R.C. 2117.06(C), the claim was required to have been filed by Plaintiff by November 15, 2016. Defendant argues that the claim is untimely because the special administrator was not actually appointed-- and the claim [was] not formally presented-- until November 21, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   By statute, the Plaintiff had six months to make application to appoint a special administrator to pursue its claim. Such application is not an unduly burdensome or time consuming pursuit. Because the Plaintiff waited until the 11th hour, the claim was untimely filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b65} On April 12, 2018, Shepherd of the Valley filed a Notice of Appeal.

Thus, the Ohio nonclaim statute is 'self-executing' as that term was described in\n   <em>\n    Pope\n   </em>\n   and is not subject to the due process requirements\n   of\n   <em>\n    Mullane\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Phar-Mor, Inc.

The claim in\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, was compromised by the state's inaction and dilatory conduct.

Rather, the \"unusual circumstances\" of the present case \"warrant the application of equitable principals, rather than a black-and-white application of R.C. 2117.06.\" Appellant's brief at 25.

Shepherd of the Valley failed to embrace the statutory requirements in that it did not present its claim in writing to the executor and/or administrator of the estate. The fact that there was no executor or administrator to whom a claim could be presented does not excuse the failure. As noted above, \"it is incumbent upon [the claimant], if no administrator has been appointed, to procure the appointment of an administrator against whom he can proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Wrinkle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1766538\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/174/233/\">\n    174 Ohio St. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20N.E.2d%20587\">\n    188 N.E.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at paragraph two of the syllabus. Nor is Shepherd of the Valley's failure excused by the fact that an administrator must be appointed by the probate court. In the present case, the probate court appointed an administrator seven days after being petitioned to do so. Shepherd of the Valley had actual knowledge of Rose's death (she was a resident of Shepherd of the Valley Howland Nursing Facility at the time of her death) and so had one hundred and eighty days to procure the appointment yet chose to wait until the one hundred and seventy-ninth day to petition the probate court and did not seek an expedited appointment. \"If a creditor fails through indifference, carelessness, delay, or lack of diligence to identify the administrator or executor, or to procure the appointment of one so that a claim can be presented, the law should not come to the creditor's aid.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280883\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/368/\">\n    150 Ohio St.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280883\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/368/\">\n    2017-Ohio-1410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20N.E.3d%201242\">\n    81 N.E.3d 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b627} Shepherd of the Valley also relies on the case of\n   <em>\n    Gerhold v.
