Hodges (\"appellant\") appeals from a judgment entry of the Pickaway County Court of Common Pleas granting a divorce from her former husband, Mark W. Hodges (\"appellee\"). Appellant contends that the trial court erred by (1) failing to award spousal support for an indefinite time period; and (2) failing to reserve jurisdiction to modify the spousal support award. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse in part, and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} Appellant and appellee were married on December 11, 1993, and have two sons born the issue of the marriage. One son is emancipated, while the other is a high school student. The couple separated in August 2016. Appellant testified that she did not ask for a divorce, and did not want a divorce, but on December 6, 2016, she filed for divorce at appellee's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} At the time of the final divorce hearing appellant was approximately 55 years old; and appellee was approximately 48 years old. At the time of separation and divorce both parties were in good health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} Appellee is a medical doctor with a base salary of $ 190,000. In 2016, he earned bonuses totaling $ 11,200. At the time of the final divorce hearing he anticipated making between $ 8,000 and $ 10,000 in bonuses for 2017. Appellee also receives additional income in the amount of $ 500 per month as the medical director of a nursing home. In contrast, appellant last worked outside of the home in the late 1990s as a medical assistant with the Red Cross. Appellant is a Licensed Practical Nurse (\"LPN\") and has kept her LPN license and continuing education requirements current, even though she has not worked full-time in the medical field since the 1990s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b65} In 1999, shortly after the birth of their eldest son, the couple agreed that appellant should cease working in the medical field in order to work as a \"stay at home\" mother. Since that time, appellant has only worked sporadically, doing work at appellee's medical practice as \"office manager\" from time to time. Specifically, appellant testified that she only worked at\n   the office if one of appellee's employees called off work, and that she was also responsible for paying the office bills. In all, appellant estimated that she worked approximately an hour a week in the medical practice; and earned compensation at the rate of $ 200 every two weeks and payment into a retirement account. Appellant held the title of office manager until 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b66} Following a hearing at which both parties testified, a magistrate's decision was released in December 2017. Of relevance to the instant appeal, the magistrate recommended that the parties be granted a divorce on the ground of incompatibility, and that appellant be awarded spousal support in the amount of $ 3,000 per month beginning January 1, 2018 and continuing for the next 84 months. The magistrate's decision also recommended that: \"This Court should not reserve jurisdiction to make modifications to this spousal support award.\" Both parties filed objections to the magistrate's decision. The trial court issued a decision on the objections to the magistrate's decision in February 2018, ordering that appellant should receive spousal support in the amount of $ 4,000 per month, but likewise setting a termination date for such support following 84 months. These findings were later incorporated by the trial court into a Decree of Divorce entered on May 9, 2018. The Decree of Divorce also states that: \"This Court shall not reserve jurisdiction to make modifications to this spousal support award.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b67} Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b68} Appellant assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Assignment of Error No. 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Trial Court erred in its Divorce Decree by ordering that spousal support would terminate after 7 years, rather than being an award for an indefinite duration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Assignment of Error No. 2:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Trial Court erred by refusing to reserve jurisdiction to make modifications to the spousal support award.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b69} In her first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred and abused its discretion by only awarding her spousal support for 84 months, as opposed to an award for an indefinite period. Appellant claims that the facts of the instant case fit squarely within the holding of\n   <em>\n    Kunkle v.

Specifically, she asserts that she and appellee were married for a long time, that she is of advanced age, and she has been a \"homemaker spouse\" who has had \"little opportunity to develop meaningful employment outside the home.\" For the following reasons, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b616} In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , appellant is in her mid-fifties and is a LPN. Appellant is in good physical and mental health, and nothing in the record indicates that her physical, mental, or emotional condition would impede her ability to work. The parties' minor child is nearing the legal driving age, and will be emancipated within a few years. The trial court could reasonably conclude that she has the potential to become self-supporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b617} In its decision on the objections to the magistrate's decision, the trial court determined that appellant would probably need \"to take some refresher classes to pursue re-employment as an LPN\", but that \"[t]his should not take her long to do\", and \"with a little refreshing she has an excellent opportunity to make at least $ 30,000.00 a year as an LPN.\" We do not believe that it is unreasonable for the trial court to infer that appellant could once again develop meaningful employment. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist. Scioto No. 96CA2434,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20441847\">\n    1997 WL 441847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 (Aug. 4, 1997), a trial court may properly \"induce the payee spouse to improve his or her prospects for employment through education and training rather than to remain a burden on the payor spouse on a long-term basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b618} While the parties' marriage was of a long duration\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , we do not believe that appellant was solely a homemaker-spouse with little opportunity to develop meaningful employment. Rather, appellant is a LPN, worked in the medical field for most of the 1990s, and was employed sporadically in appellee's medical practice since then. Appellant has kept her license current and has taken the required continuing education. Appellee testified that on days that appellant filled-in at his medical practice, she performed the same duties and tasks that his medical assistants perform. The trial court apparently believed that appellant's prior work history and her status as a LPN gave her \"the resources, ability and potential\" to become self-supporting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b619} Appellant also notes that there will be a several year gap in between the cessation of spousal support and when she may begin receiving full social security retirement benefits. However, this alone does not constitute an abuse of discretion where the payee spouse is employed or has the potential to become employed.\n   <em>\n    Lojek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-5156\">\n    2010-Ohio-5156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 63. Furthermore, appellant was awarded approximately $ 283,000 in retirement accounts through the trial court's property distribution; and will be receiving one-half of the sale proceeds from the marital home once the parties' minor child graduates high school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b620} Finally, appellant asserts that the trial court ignored or gave \"unacceptably short shrift\" to the statutory factors set forth in R.C. 3105.18(C)(1) when determining to limit the duration of spousal support to 84 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b621} As explained,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we believe that the trial court's decision and judgment entry, along with the record of the proceedings, reveal a basis for the court's decision limiting the term of spousal support to 84 months. Although the trial court did not list and comment upon each and every one of the statutory factors, or how it weighed or considered each factor, the record reflects that the trial court fully considered the factors set forth in R.C. 3105.18 and based its award of spousal support upon those factors. Thus, we believe that the trial court had a sufficient basis for limiting the term of spousal support to 84 months, and provided sufficient detail to enable us to review the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b622} As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Griffith v.

Moreover, we note that appellant is in her mid-fifties and appellee is approaching age fifty and, although they do not suffer from major medical problems at the present time, they could encounter such problems over the next seven years. Additionally, it is possible that either parties income or employment could vary in the future, or that the value of the retirement accounts or marital home could fluctuate in the coming years. Given these\n   factors, we conclude that the trial court's refusal to reserve jurisdiction over the spousal support award is an abuse of discretion. Appellant's second assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b631} In sum, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in all respects except for its failure to reserve jurisdiction to modify the spousal support award upon a showing of a change of circumstances. That portion of the trial court's judgment expressly stating that it does not reserve jurisdiction to modify the spousal support award is reversed and vacated.
