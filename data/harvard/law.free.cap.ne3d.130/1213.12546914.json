Huntley (\"Doug\") (collectively \"Appellants\") appeal the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of Peter Ballatan. Appellants raise two issues on appeal, which we restate as whether the trial court erred in denying their motion for summary judgment and granting Ballatan's motion for summary judgment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [2] On September 28, 2007, Ballatan obtained a judgment in the amount of $125,438.43 against Joanne Huntley (\"Joanne\") in a civil case, Cause No. 49D03-0403-PL-000625 (\"Cause 0625\"). The judgment represented lost rental income and travel expenses incurred by Ballatan in a real estate dispute with Joanne. At the time of that dispute, Joanne owned four parcels of land in Indianapolis, Indiana: 460 North Kealing Avenue; 6464 Brookville Road; 5235 East Washington Street; and 5269 East Washington Street (collectively, \"Properties\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [3] However, while Cause 0625 was pending, Joanne purported to grant mortgages on each of the Properties to her son, Doug. The mortgages were executed on March 1, 2007, via three mortgage documents. The mortgage documents consist of pre-printed forms with blank spaces for the parties to insert the requisite information. Each document consisted of one substantive page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [4] Joanne and Doug completed the documents by hand and had them notarized. The mortgage documents indicate that Joanne agreed to pay Doug $80,000.00 secured by the Kealing Avenue property, $250,000.00 secured by the Brookville Road property, and $500,000.00 secured by the two Washington Street properties (hereinafter collectively, \"Huntley Mortgages\"). Each document states that Joanne \"mortgage[s] and warrant[s] to Paul Douglas Huntley\" the Properties. (Appellants' App. Vol. II at 131, 134, &amp; 137.) The boilerplate language of each document states\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   the mortgagor expressly agree [sic] to pay the sum of money above secured, without relief from valuation or appraisement laws; and upon failure to pay any one of said notes, or any part thereof, at maturity, or the interest thereon, or any part thereof, when due, or the taxes or insurance as hereinafter stipulated, then all of said notes are to be due and collectible, and this mortgage may be foreclosed accordingly. And it is further expressly agreed, that until all of said notes are paid, said mortgagor will keep all legal taxes and charges against said premises paid as they become due, and will keep the buildings thereon insured for the benefit of the mortgagee, as h [sic] interest may appear and the policy duly assigned to the mortgagee, to the amount of [redacted] [sic] Dollars, and failing to do so, said mortgagee, may pay said taxes or insurance, and the amount so paid, with per cent interest thereon, shall be a part of the debt secured by this mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [5] In his affidavit designated at summary judgment, Doug averred Joanne \"mortgaged to me the properties ... in exchange for me taking care of her living expenses, including making monthly payment to her lender for her personal residence in Johnson County, ensuring that all property taxes, insurance and her other daily living expenses were paid timely.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108 \u00b6 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about August 27, 2008, Joanne transferred ownership in the Properties from herself as an individual to herself as trustee of the Joanne B. Huntley Trust. The purported mortgage interests conveyed by the Huntley Mortgages were not recorded until October 15, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [6] On February 17, 2011, Doug paid Joanne $30,000.00, and Joanne transferred her ownership interests in the Properties to Doug, who purchased the Properties for investment purposes. On May 22, 2017, Doug transferred his ownership interest in the Properties to Drake Investments, LTD. Doug is the president of Drake Investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [7] On September 7, 2017, Ballatan filed his complaint to renew and foreclose judgment lien against real property from\n   Cause 0625. Doug asserted in his affidavit that he did not know about Ballatan's judgment in Cause 0625 until Ballatan filed suit on September 7, 2017. Joanne died on September 25, 2017. She did not make any payment to Ballatan toward satisfaction of the judgment before her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [8] Ballatan moved for summary judgment on April 3, 2018. Appellants responded to Ballatan's motion for summary judgment and cross-moved for summary judgment on June 2, 2018. The trial court held a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment on September 25, 2018. The trial court issued findings, granted Ballatan's motion for summary judgment, and denied Appellants' cross-motion for summary judgment on October 23, 2018. The trial court ordered the Properties be sold and the proceeds used to satisfy the sums due to Ballatan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Discussion and Decision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [9] When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the trial court: whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Monroe Guar.

The Huntley Mortgage documents refer to notes evidencing these debts, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellants' App. Vol. II at 131, 134, &amp; 137 (\"[M]ortgagor expressly agrees to pay the sum of money secured, without relief from valuation or appraisement laws; and upon failure to pay any one of said notes, or any part thereof...then all of said notes are to be due and collectible.\")), but Doug did not designate the notes purportedly referred to in the Huntley Mortgage documents. Instead, Doug's affidavit and his averments in his appellate brief reveal the true nature of the debts - the mortgages were not meant to secure monetary loans he gave to Joanne; rather, the amounts listed represented expected future expenses Doug would incur in covering Joanne's living expenses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants' App. Vol II at 108 \u00b6 7.)\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [18] Like in\n   <em>\n    SPCP Group, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the Huntley Mortgage documents fail to accurately describe the debt. The Huntley Mortgage documents describe the debt in a misleading and deceiving manner because, on their face, Joanne \"expressly agree[s] to pay the sum of money above secured.\" (Appellants' App. Vol. II at 131, 134, &amp; 137.) However, Joanne did not owe money to Doug; Doug was paying Joanne's future living expenses. Further, the Huntley Mortgage documents do not include a date of repayment as required by Indiana Code section 32-29-1-5. Therefore, one cannot tell from looking at the Huntley Mortgage documents when Doug's purported mortgage interest in the Properties was scheduled to expire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Canaday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3092476\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/376/260/#p270\">\n    376 B.R. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270 (Bankr. N.D. Ind. 2007) (listing failure to include the date of repayment secured by a purported mortgage in the mortgage instrument as one of the reasons a purported mortgage did not satisfy the requirements of the statute). In short, the descriptions of the debts in the Huntley Mortgage documents are inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [19] Next, we evaluate whether the inaccuracies are sufficiently material to mislead or deceive as to the nature and amount of the debt. The Huntley Mortgage documents make no mention of Doug's agreement to cover his mother's living expenses in exchange for mortgage interests in the Properties. Further, the\n   Huntley Mortgage documents do not connect the debts described therein with the expenses intended to be incurred in covering Joanne's living expenses. The descriptions of the debts are so vague that they do not preclude Joanne and Doug from substituting other debts for the debts described. Thus, the inaccuracies contained in the Huntley Mortgage documents are materially misleading regarding the nature and amount of the debt, and we therefore hold the Huntley Mortgages are invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SPCP Group, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7217399\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/934/771/#p772\">\n    934 N.E.2d at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding plaintiff could not foreclose on mortgage because it contained an inaccurate and materially misleading description of the debt it purported to secure).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Bona Fide Purchaser Status\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [20] Nevertheless, we must still evaluate whether a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether Doug and/or Drake Investments were bona fide purchasers when they took ownership of the Properties.
