We agree with the Appellate Division that, under the circumstances presented in this case, jurisdiction cannot be exercised over Brown under well-established due process precedent because he lacks minimum contacts with this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Charles Brown, a federal firearm licensee, was authorized to sell handguns only in Ohio and only to Ohio residents, which he primarily accomplished through retail sales at gun shows held in various locations in Ohio. Brown did not maintain a website, had no retail store or business telephone listing, and did no advertising of any kind, except by posting a sign at his booth when participating in a gun show. In a series of transactions in 2000, Brown sold handguns to James Nigel Bostic and his associates. Prior to the transaction involving the gun at issue here, Brown consulted with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to ensure its legality. For each transaction, the necessary forms required by the ATF were properly completed and submitted, the purchaser passed the required Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background check before the firearms were transferred, Brown verified that the purchaser had government-issued identification demonstrating Ohio residency, and notification of the purchases was timely sent to local law enforcement and the ATF as required by the federal Gun Control Act (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 USC \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). During the transactions, Bostic indicated he was in the process of becoming a federal firearms licensee and was acquiring inventory for the eventual opening of a gun shop. Instead of opening a shop, Bostic brought the firearms to New York, illegally reselling one of the handguns to a Buffalo gang member. That gang member then used the handgun in a shooting that caused injury to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this personal injury action against, among others, Beemiller, Inc., an Ohio corporation and federally licensed firearms manufacturer, MKS Supply, Inc., an Ohio corporation and a federally licensed wholesale distributor of firearms, and Brown. Only Brown contested personal jurisdiction. Supreme Court, among other things, initially granted Brown's motion to dismiss the action (2011 N.Y. Slip Op. 34303[U],\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2013286044\">\n    2011 WL 13286044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Sup. Ct., Erie County 2011] ) but the Appellate Division reversed, holding in relevant part that plaintiffs made a\n   sufficient showing of personal jurisdiction to warrant further disclosure (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3489859\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/143/\">\n    100 A.D.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3489859\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/143/\">\n    952 N.Y.S.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [4th Dept. 2012] ). After extensive discovery, Brown moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, again asserting a defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. Supreme Court denied the motion. The Appellate Division reversed, granted the motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint as against Brown (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20A.D.3d%20148\">\n    159 A.D.3d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20N.Y.S.3d%20276\">\n    72 N.Y.S.3d 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [4th Dept. 2018] ). Although the Appellate Division credited plaintiffs' argument that jurisdiction could be exercised under CPLR 302, New York's long-arm statute, it nonetheless reversed based on its conclusion that plaintiffs\n   failed to establish the requisite minimum contacts under the due process clause. Plaintiffs appealed to this Court as of right on that substantial constitutional question and we now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When the defense is timely asserted, a New York court may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary unless two requirements are satisfied: the action is permissible under the long-arm statute ( CPLR 302 ) and the exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaMarca v. Pak-Mor Mfg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    95 N.Y.2d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    713 N.Y.S.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    735 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2000] ). If either the statutory or constitutional prerequisite is lacking, the action may not proceed. Due process requires that a nondomiciliary have \"certain minimum contacts\" with the forum and \"that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\" (\n   <em>\n    International Shoe Co. v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    326 U.S. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    66 S.Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157001\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/326/310/#p316\">\n    90 L.Ed. 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1945] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted] ). Thus, this constitutional mandate likewise encompasses two requirements and jurisdiction may not be exercised unless both are present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With respect to due process, \"[a] non-domiciliary tortfeasor has minimum contacts with the forum State ... if it purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State\" (\n   <em>\n    LaMarca,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    95 N.Y.2d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    713 N.Y.S.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    735 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotations marks and citations omitted] ),\" thus invoking the benefits and protections of [the forum state's] laws\" (\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

In asserting jurisdiction, plaintiffs rely on the fact that firearms sold by Brown in Ohio eventually reached New York and claim that Brown should have had a reasonable expectation that this would happen based on conversations in which Bostic said he planned to open a shop in Ohio and \"wouldn't mind having a shop in Buffalo.\" We agree with the Appellate Division that this evidence falls short of demonstrating purposeful availment. The facts of this case stand in contrast to those in\n   <em>\n    LaMarca\n   </em>\n   , wherein jurisdiction was properly exercised over a defendant that, in addition to advertising nationwide, initiated a business relationship with a New York-based distributor in order to sell products in New York (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    95 N.Y.2d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    713 N.Y.S.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    735 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Brown offered uncontradicted evidence that Bostic, who resided in a neighboring Ohio town, represented to Brown that he had applied for an FFL - a license that would, once acquired, permit him (like Brown) to sell handguns only in Ohio to Ohio residents. Despite\n   Bostic's stated aspiration to open a gun shop in Buffalo, the record is devoid of evidence supporting plaintiffs' theory that, merely by selling handguns to Bostic, Brown intended to serve the New York market. Even if Bostic indicated that there was a chance that he may - at some undefined point in the future - transport the firearms to New York, Brown cannot be said to have \"forged [constitutionally\n   sufficient] ties with New York\" as there is no evidence that he \"took purposeful action, motivated by the entirely understandable wish to sell [his] products here\" such that he availed himself \"of the privilege of conducting activities within\" New York (\n   <em>\n    LaMarca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    95 N.Y.2d at 216-217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    713 N.Y.S.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1188965\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/210/#p214\">\n    735 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks and citations omitted];\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701990\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/277/#p285\">\n    571 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Even assuming Brown possessed such a belief, knowledge that goods might end up in New York is not the equivalent of purposeful availment. Moreover, the record shows that Brown consulted the ATF prior to making the sales in question - conduct hardly consistent with the theory that Brown and Bostic had entered into an illicit distribution arrangement to sell guns on the New York black market.

Brown, a federal firearms licensee, purchased some of these Hi-Point pistols from MKS Supply and re-sold them in Ohio through his company Great Lakes Products (\"GLP\"). From May to October 2000,\n   at various gun shows in Ohio, Brown sold 182 handguns to Bostic and his two associates, all Ohio residents.

To aid the legislature in amending the long-arm statute, a study was conducted by the Judicial Conference on the necessary revisions to CPLR 302 (11th Ann Report of N.Y. Jud Conf, at 132-139; 12th Ann Report of N.Y. Jud Conf, at 339-344). The new provision was designed to be \"\n   <em>\n    well within\n   </em>\n   constitutional bounds\" (12th Ann Report of N.Y. Jud Conf, at 341 [emphasis added] ), and subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of CPLR 302(a)(3) \"were deliberately inserted\" to achieve that goal (\n   <em>\n    Ingraham v.

Hence, \"[t]he purpose of sub[paragraphs] (i) and (ii) is to ensure the fairness of asserting jurisdiction over nondomiciliaries whose out of state acts cause local injuries\" (Vincent C. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, 302:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our rules of construction reinforce the underlying intent of CPLR 302(a)(3). As a general matter, \"courts must avoid, if possible, interpreting a presumptively valid statute in a way that will needlessly render it unconstitutional\" (\n   <em>\n    Overstock.com, Inc. v.

In line with this general rule, when our long-arm statute is interpreted, whether federal due process may be offended should be considered to \"avoid grave doubts concerning [the statute's] constitutionality\" (\n   <em>\n    Fantis Foods v.

To support this holding, the dissent, as did the Appellate Division, limits its analysis to a calculation of the revenue generated by Brown from his Ohio sales to Bostic and his associates. The dissent concludes that regardless of whether one examines the proportion of Brown's sales (roughly one-third of his sales for the relevant period) or the total dollar value of his sales, \"the result is the same\"-subparagraph (i) is satisfied (dissenting op. at 546, 106 N.Y.S.3d at 253, 130 N.E.3d at 849). The dissent's calculation of Brown's Ohio sales to other Ohio residents\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   includes no sales by him to New York residents or the New York market. This application of the statute is inconsistent with the legislative intent, the structure of the statute, and its prior application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As this Court has made clear, \" CPLR 302(a)(3)(i) necessitates some\n   <em>\n    ongoing activity within New York State\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Ingraham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165818\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/592/#p596\">\n    90 N.Y.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165818\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/592/#p596\">\n    665 N.Y.S.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165818\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/592/#p596\">\n    687 N.E.2d 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [some emphasis supplied] ). This approach is grounded in the plain text of the statute. The first three clauses in CPLR 302(a)(3)(i) allow for jurisdiction when the defendant \"regularly [1] does or [2] solicits business or [3] engages in any other persistent course of conduct\" in the State. These clauses address whether defendants have, of their own volition, engaged in regular or persistent activity in New York such that they have established sufficient contacts with this State (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   12th Ann Report of N.Y. Jud Conf at 343; Vincent C. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, CPLR 302:12). Thus, for example, courts have found that a \"long-term apartment rental\" by a business in New York can \"constitute a persistent course of conduct by the firm\" (\n   <em>\n    Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez &amp; Rodriguez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11385907\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/305/120/#p126\">\n    305 F.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 [2d Cir.2002] ). Personal engagement in business transactions in New York also regularly meets the requirements of the first three clauses of CPLR 302(a)(3)(i) (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Granada Television, International, LTD. v. Lorindy Pictures International, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759706\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/606/68/#p72\">\n    606 F.

However, his nebulous remarks to Brown, that he was \"planning on possibly opening\" or \"wouldn't mind having\" a store in New York at some unspecified point in the future, are not enough to attribute this regular course of conduct to Brown (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birmingham Fire Ins.

To exercise long-arm jurisdiction over Brown based only on his Ohio sales to Bostic and his associates, all Ohio residents, would contravene the emphasis placed on fairness to the non-domiciliary when subparagraph (i) was crafted (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   12th Ann Report of N.Y.

Put simply, Brown does not have sufficient contacts with this State to make it reasonable to subject him to jurisdiction under the substantial revenue clause of CPLR 302(a)(3)(i) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Siegel &amp; Connors,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Prac%20%C2%A7%2088\">\n    N.Y.

The dissent posits that because Brown sold firearms to Bostic and was told by Bostic that he and his associates might open a store in Buffalo, \"Brown served the New York market\" (dissenting op. at 550-551, 106 N.Y.S.3d at 256, 130 N.E.3d at 852).

The bullet that struck plaintiff entered his stomach, and closing the wound required 22 stitches. Plaintiff, a promising student, could barely walk when he was released from the hospital, and those injuries sidelined a basketball career that included plaintiff's consideration as an NCAA Division I prospect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The gun used in that shooting was manufactured by defendant Beemiller, Inc. (Beemiller), which was doing business as Hi-Point and which was both an Ohio corporation and licensed by the federal government to manufacture the weapon in question. Beemiller sold that gun to defendant MKS Supply, Inc. (MKS), which in turn sold it to Great Lakes Products (Great Lakes). That latter entity was owned and operated by Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For his part, Brown sold that gun and other firearms at gun shows in Ohio in and\n   around 2000.

All of those purchases were cash transactions, and all of the guns obtained from Brown in Ohio were transported to and sold illegally in Buffalo. One of those weapons-which was part of an 85-gun bulk sale-made its way to defendant Cornell Caldwell, who used it to shoot plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   From those facts and allegations arose three sets of charges. Caldwell pleaded guilty to assault in the second degree - a class C violent felony - based on his participation in the incident in which plaintiff was shot. Bostic, in turn, pleaded guilty to federal trafficking crimes based on his participation in the scheme through which Caldwell obtained the gun that he used to shoot plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 USC \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [a][1][A] [unlawfully dealing in firearms and, in the course thereof, unlawfully transporting the firearms in interstate commerce];\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 USC \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [a][5] [unlawfully transferring firearms to individuals who were residing in a state other than that in which the defendant was residing] ).

The analysis of this romanette turns on the meaning of the word \"substantial,\" which has been subject to both a \"proportion\" test and a \"quantity\" test (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Siegel &amp; Connors,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Prac%20%C2%A7%2088\">\n    N.Y.

As noted, the record reflects, among other things, that Brown sold a significant number of guns to Bostic and Bostic's associates in 2000, that those guns were used and consumed in New York State, and that those sales constituted approximately one-third of Brown's total sales in that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In reaching a different result, the judges concurring with the majority conclude that plaintiffs' allegation that Brown\n   derived \"substantial revenue\" from New York based on his Ohio sales to Bostic and Bostic's associates does not permit the exercise of long-arm jurisdiction over Brown because Brown also did not engage in a regular course of conduct within New York State (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   concurring op. at 535-536, 106 N.Y.S.3d at 245-46, 130 N.E.3d at 841-42). That conclusion conflates what the legislature has said are to be separate analyses under romanette (i) of CPLR 302(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Specifically, the judges who concur with the majority imply that a single business transaction that yields \"substantial revenue from goods used or consumed ... in this state\" ( CPLR 302[a][3][i] ) does not permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction if that substantial revenue is not also the product of a \"regular course of conduct in this state\" (concurring op. at 537, 106 N.Y.S.3d at 246, 130 N.E.3d at 842 [internal\n   quotation marks omitted] ). In CPLR 302(a)(3), however, the legislature separated degree of revenue from constancy of conduct when it provided that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary who, among other things, \"engages in any ... persistent course of conduct[ ]\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   derives substantial revenue from goods used ... in th[is] state\" ( CPLR 302[a][3][i] [emphasis added] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Ingraham v.

There, we considered the \"regularly [doing] or solict[ing] business\" clause of romanette (i) and concluded that, to satisfy such criterion, the party seeking to obtain jurisdiction must show \"something more than the 'one shot' single business transaction described in CPLR 302(a)(1)\" (\n   <em>\n    Ingraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165818\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/592/#p596\">\n    90 N.Y.2d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165818\" index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/592/#p596\">\n    665 N.Y.S.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165818\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/592/#p596\">\n    687 N.E.2d 1293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Here, by contrast, \"substantial revenue\" does not measure the\n   <em>\n    frequency\n   </em>\n   of contacts between a defendant and this state, but the\n   <em>\n    size\n   </em>\n   of even a single association between that defendant and this forum. The fact that a defendant's conduct that generates \"substantial revenue\" is not continual, enduring, or repeated does not exempt that defendant from long-arm jurisdiction under CPLR 302(a)(3)(i). Rather, where sporadic use or consumption of goods in New York State yields \"substantial revenue,\" the legislature has provided that the beneficiary of such revenue may be subject to statutory long-arm jurisdiction - even if the income-producing activity is not \"regular[ ]\" or \"persistent\" ( CPLR 302[a][3][i] ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   concurring op. at 537, 106 N.Y.S.3d at 246, 130 N.E.3d at 842).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, because the parties do not dispute that the preliminary conditions precedent to a finding of jurisdiction\n   (namely, a tort occurring outside the state causing injury to person or property inside the state) have been met, satisfaction of the \"substantial revenue\" factor alone is sufficient to establish long-arm jurisdiction pursuant to CPLR 302(a)(3)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Whatever one's conclusion under romanette (i), the facts here easily satisfy the \"interstate or international commerce\" prong of romanette (ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the latter romanette, personal jurisdiction may be exercised over a non-domiciliary when, among other things, such party (1) \"expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in the state\"; and (2) \"derives substantial revenue from interstate or international commerce\" ( CPLR 302[a][3][ii] ).

That is, \"[t]he nonresident tortfeasor must expect, or have reason to expect, that [its] tortious activity in another State will have direct consequences in New York\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165818\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/90/592/#p596\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   It is hard to imagine that Brown did not \"expect or should [have] reasonably expect[ed]\" his sales to Bostic \"to have consequences in this state\" ( CPLR 302[a][3][ii] ). Brown's commercial relationship with Bostic was not an isolated transaction. Over the course of six months, he sold a total of 182 handguns to Bostic and his associates on six different occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Indeed, on October 8, 2000, Brown sold 85 Hi-Point handguns to Bostic and Upshaw, which Brown described as \"the biggest sale\" he had \"ever made in ten years of owning a federal firearms license and 25 [years] of being in the business.\" To facilitate that transaction, Brown telephoned a contact at the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) to confirm whether he was obligated to do anything out of the ordinary given the large, cash-only sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   A review of the transactions in chronological order is enlightening. On May 27, 2000, according to Brown, Bostic told Brown's father-in-law that Bostic \"was planning on possibly opening up a couple gun shops in the future, possibly two, one in Columbus, Ohio, and one in Buffalo. Brown met Bostic for the first time on June 24, 2000, and Brown stated that, during that meeting, Bostic \"said his plans were to open up a shop in Columbus, Ohio, somewhere.\" At that meeting Bostic also \"talked\" to Brown \"about being from Buffalo\" and, in Brown's words, \"wanting - you know, he said he wouldn't mind having a shop in Buffalo.\" In the same conversation, Bostic told Brown that Bostic \"had been out to other retail stores and ... was kind of looking around and seeing how they laid their stores out that type of thing.\" That meeting also saw Brown discuss with Bostic \"a lot of different items with regard to a retail store opening,\" including \"how many guns [Bostic] should ... start with\" and what \"would be a good mix\" of inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On October 5, 2000, Upshaw telephoned Brown seeking to purchase from Brown 85 firearms at a gun show to be held a few days later. That request prompted Brown to seek direction from the ATF. In communicating with that bureau on October\n   6, 2000 about Upshaw's purchase request, Brown related that \"they\" - namely, Bostic and Upshaw - \"planned on opening a store in Ohio, one in Buffalo.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Brown, of course, had every incentive to accurately describe the proposed purchase to the federal official - the point of that conversation was to get the proverbial\n   \"green light\" for the sale based on what Brown told the ATF. Based on those representations Brown received approval to make the sale, and based on that approval Brown sold Upshaw 85 firearms in the aforementioned cash transaction on October 8, 2000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At bottom, the record clearly reflects that Brown \"knew that [the guns were] likely to end up in New York\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Siegel &amp; Connors,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Prac%20%C2%A7%2088\">\n    N.Y.

However, Brown's June 24, 2000 interaction with Bostic was simply marketing to someone who sought to distribute Brown's inventory in New York State. In that meeting, which he thought to have lasted for \"probably 45 minutes,\" Brown \"share[d] [with Bostic] some of [Brown's] knowledge and experience about being a gun dealer.\" By Brown's own admission, Bostic told Brown that Bostic was \"from Buffalo\" and \"wouldn't mind having a shop in Buffalo.\" Critically, before the sale of the weapon that was used to shoot plaintiff, Brown also knew that Upshaw and Bostic had a business link and, in Brown's words, that \"\n   <em>\n    they planned on opening a store ... in Buffalo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that evidence, and given the large quantity of guns that Brown sold to Bostic and his associates,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the only reasonable conclusion is that Brown served the New\n   York market (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darienzo v.

We respectfully disagree.

The Supreme Court has explained \"[j]urisdiction is proper ... where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a substantial connection with the forum State\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p480\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p480\">\n    at 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p480\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks omitted] ).

The record reflects that Brown marketed to Bostic as a New York State businessperson in an effort to move Brown's inventory. At his deposition, Brown acknowledged that Upshaw was with Bostic when Brown met with Bostic at a June 2000 gun show, that Upshaw knew about the stores that Bostic intended to open, and that Brown knew that Upshaw planned to open the stores with Bostic. At the same meeting, Bostic and Upshaw collectively purchased 13 guns from Brown; five were purchased by Bostic, and eight were bought by Upshaw. Brown \"had some assumptions\" that Bostic and Upshaw were partners at that time and, as of September 2000, he thought that Bostic and Upshaw might be \"dealers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Brown also acknowledged that his interaction with Bostic included \"a lot of talk regarding ... a retail shop ..., how many [of the subject devices Bostic] should ... start with, [what] would be a good mix[, and] different items with\n   regard to opening a retail store.\" That conversation lasted \"probably 45 minutes,\" and the record reflects such dialogue occurred before the subject sale.\n   Consequently, Brown's sales to Bostic (in an enterprise that flirted with the bounds of legality, as evinced by Bostic's plea of guilty to federal crimes arising from these transactions) undoubtedly benefitted Brown by expanding his market beyond local purchasers to New York distributors. Brown purposefully derived benefit from the re-sale of guns Brown sold to people whom he knew to be New York distributors (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p480\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p480\">\n    at 473-474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p480\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Second, New York's interest in adjudicating this dispute is high. Plaintiffs are New York residents whose claims stem from serious injuries that occurred within New York as a result of the illegal trafficking of firearms into New York. Third, plaintiffs have a strong interest in adjudicating their claims in this state: they reside in New York and Williams was shot here. Fourth, resolving plaintiffs' claims against Brown in New York is the most efficient use of interstate judicial resources because plaintiffs have already alleged related claims against other defendants stemming from the same gun sales. Requiring them to initiate a separate parallel action in Ohio against Brown-who, irrespective\n   of this Court's decision, will remain involved in the New York proceeding as sole owner and CEO of MKS-will waste interstate judicial resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Fifth, and perhaps most significantly, subjecting Brown to jurisdiction in New York will \"further[ ] fundamental substantive social policies\" (\n   <em>\n    Asahi Metal Indus.

Principles of federalism and comity support exercising jurisdiction over dealers like Brown who supply the illegal interstate gun market. It will be for a trial on the merits (or, perhaps, multiple trials, conducted contemporaneously in New York as to the defendants remaining in this suit and in Ohio against Brown) to establish what Brown knew and whether-as plaintiffs have been allowed to plead (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3489859\" index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/143/\">\n    100 A.D.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3489859\" index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/143/\">\n    952 N.Y.S.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )- he violated federal law such as to give rise to tortious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   However, assuming plaintiffs will succeed on the merits, it is clear that New York has a very substantial interest in protecting its citizens by imposing tort liability on gun sellers who violate federal law. A recent study conducted by the Office of the Attorney General of New York State shows that \"law enforcement agencies ... frequently disrupt[ ] gun trafficking schemes that purchase firearms, predominantly handguns, in\n   states south of New York ... and that transport the weapons to New York markets\" (\n   <em>\n    Target on Trafficking: New York Gun Crime Analysis,\n   </em>\n   Office of the New York State Attorney General, available at https://targettrafficking.ag.ny.gov/ [last accessed Apr. 16, 2019] ). Downstate areas are supplied by a stream of trafficked firearms that flow into New York State along the Interstate 95 Corridor from states including Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. That steady stream of firearms flowing from those \"exporter\" or \"supplier\" states has been nicknamed \"the Iron Pipeline,\" and the Attorney General's study reflects that, at one point, approximately 75% of the likely-trafficked guns in New York City entered the state through that channel (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3489859\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/143/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Buffalo area, in turn, is supplied in trafficked weapons principally by guns sold in and moved from Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Ohio (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3489859\" index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/100/143/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). The flow of trafficked guns into New York State from all of the aforementioned states should come as no surprise. \"From New York's vantage point, the correlation between state and local laws and the source of trafficked guns is undeniable\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Gun laws in \"Iron Pipeline\" states and in Ohio are lax, while the gun control laws in New York State are strong. It follows that the direct links between those areas and New York State provided by, among other things, interstate highways, have made them \"become the source-of-choice among gun traffickers running guns into New York\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   That data contained in that study, of course, is insufficient to establish that Brown himself accepted the benefits of the New York State economy, or that this state was an anticipated marketplace for those weapons. That study, however, also reflects the obvious point that gun shows in states with weak gun control laws attract out-of-state buyers. This state is entitled to protect its citizens from the effects of those weak gun control laws by telling out of state gun sellers-including and indeed especially legitimate ones-that they must take every precaution to avoid supplying gun traffickers and will be held accountable when they negligently fail to do so. Under our federal system, Ohio is free to regulate firearms differently, but it has no legitimate interest in serving as a\n   marketplace for gun traffickers and those who seek to flout New York's laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    IV.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   All of the guns sold by Brown to Bostic and his associates were Hi Point 9mm semi-automatic pistols, which\n   plaintiffs have characterized as a \"Saturday Night Special\"-that is, as an \"inexpensive, low quality, easily concealable gun that has little or no sporting value or utility.\" Stated differently, and as accurately described by plaintiffs, those weapons \"are cheap, low quality, easily concealable guns that are disproportionately used by criminals and widely recognized as having little or no legitimate value or utility.\" In short, they are \"junk guns,\" practically purposed only to cause harm to other human beings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The shows at which Brown sold those weapons were held in Ohio, where gun control laws are less strict than the laws of New York. In point of fact, according to plaintiffs, in the 12 years leading up to the sale of the subject guns to Bostic, the ATF has determined that over 10,000 guns sold by Beemiller have been used in crimes. That figure, of course, represents only the guns the ATF was able to successfully trace following a gun crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Tracing of such weapons has also revealed that about 100 of the guns brought by Bostic into New York State were used for criminal purposes. News accounts of the wide-ranging and tragic consequences of Bostic's actions starkly portray the menace that he was to the Buffalo community:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   \"The crack of gunfire got louder and more frequent on Buffalo streets after [Bostic] illegally sold [the weapons he purchased at Ohio gun shows] on the city streets to any drug dealer, petty thief or gang member who wanted a cheap pistol.

And the violence continue[d] [unchecked through at least 2005]\" (\n   <em>\n    Gun by Gun: Five Years of Damage Done by Weapons James Nigel Bostic Bought from Ohio Gun Dealers,\n   </em>\n   Buffalo News, June 12, 2005, available at https://buffalonews.com/2005/06/12/gun-by-gun-five-years-of-damage-done-by-weapons-james-nigel-bostic-bought-from-ohio-gundealers/ [last accessed Apr. 4, 2019] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   This case cries out for the Court to simply apply the rule of law. Perversely, the Court's decision today elevates Ohio gun laws over our own.
