(\"MJM\"), appeals from the judgment of the Summit County Common Pleas Court\n   in favor of Appellees, Thomas Dickinson and Dickinson &amp; Wheelock PC (collectively \"the Dickinson defendants\"). For the reasons set forth below, this Court reverses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} On April 24, 2014, MJM, an Ohio corporation, entered into a written loan agreement and promissory note with David Sims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a citizen of Nevada who had business interests in Texas. Thomas Dickinson, an attorney licensed in Texas (\"attorney Dickinson\"), and Dickinson &amp; Wheelock PC, a law firm based in Texas (\"the Dickinson law firm\"), participated in the drafting and negotiating of various loan documents on behalf of Mr. Sims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} MJM loaned Mr. Sims $ 275,000, plus a $ 5,000 loan processing fee. To secure the loan, Mr. Sims, in his capacity as an authorized representative of Platinum Premier Corporation Limited (\"Platinum Premier Corp.\"), a Gibraltar entity, executed a security agreement in which Platinum Premier Corp. provided MJM with a first priority security interest in a yacht. Mr. Sims also provided MJM with a Platinum Premier Corporation Limited Officers' Certificate which certified that Mr. Sims was the president and chief executive officer of Platinum Premier Corp. Before entering into this loan, MJM requested, and its counsel received, an opinion letter from the Dickinson defendants, as counsel for Platinum Premier Corp., confirming the validity of the lien on the yacht. Mr. Sims subsequently defaulted on the note, and MJM sued Mr. Sims for breach of contract, fraud, and rescission and the Dickinson defendants for fraud/collusion and negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} After filing an answer, the Dickinson defendants moved to dismiss, or alternatively, for judgment on the pleadings, on three bases: 1) the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over the Dickinson defendants, 2) MJM failed to state a claim against the Dickinson defendants upon which relief could be granted, and 3) MJM failed to join necessary parties. Once the briefs were submitted, the trial court scheduled an evidentiary hearing as to the legal issue of personal jurisdiction. Following the hearing, the trial court dismissed MJM's complaint as to the Dickinson defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court certified that there was no just reason to delay an appeal of its order and stayed the remainder of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b65} MJM timely appeals from this judgment entry, asserting one assignment of error. The Dickinson defendants have also filed an assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MJM'S ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT INCORRECTLY GRANTED [THE DICKINSON DEFENDANTS'] MOTION TO DISMISS [MJM'S] COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b66} MJM argues that the trial court erred in dismissing its complaint against the Dickinson defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction.

The Dickinson defendants respond that they did not conduct any business in Ohio because they only provided legal services to Mr. Sims and Platinum Premier Corp. in Texas based upon Texas law and the only business relationship was between MJM and Mr. Sims/Platinum Premier Corp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b616} The complaint alleged that the Dickinson defendants provided an opinion letter to MJM which contained the following false statements: 1) the Dickinson defendants represented Platinum Premier Corp. with respect to the preparation of the security agreement between Platinum Premier Corp. and MJM, 2) the security agreement created a valid and binding obligation upon Platinum Premier Corp., and 3) the security agreement created a valid first priority security interest in the yacht in favor of MJM.

In these discovery responses, attorney Dickinson admitted that he sent the opinion letter via email to MJM's counsel, and the Dickinson defendants admitted that they had knowledge that MJM's counsel was located in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b619} The discovery responses contained copies of multiple emails between attorney Dickinson and MJM's counsel. The emails reflect attorney Dickinson was engaged with MJM's counsel in drafting and revising the various loan documents and the opinion letter. The opinion letter specifies that the Dickinson defendants \"participated in the preparation and negotiation of the [s]ecurity [a]greement and the other Loan Documents\" identified as the loan agreement and the promissory note. There is also an email from attorney Dickinson forwarding the executed agreements to MJM's counsel in Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b620} Additionally, there were emails from attorney Dickinson to MJM's counsel advising that it would be necessary to use the yacht, and not the oil field, as the collateral in the security agreement. Attorney Dickinson indicated in emails to MJM's counsel that he \"believe[d] the solution [was] to accept a lien on [the yacht]\" as opposed to the oil field because Mr. Sims \"[did] not own [the oil field] interests personally.\" Additionally, attorney Dickinson stated that the $ 275,000 lien on the yacht \"would be a first lien\" and the lien would be \"seriously over-secured\" because the yacht was \"worth $ 4 to $ 5 million.\" Attorney Dickinson represented in the\n   email that based upon his experience, \"[t]he perfection process in Gibraltar is not complex[,]\" as he \"just went through the process of getting a lien on [the yacht] (securing a $ 3 million dollar note) released last year.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b621} Also attached to the complaint were copies of the loan agreement, the cognovit note, and the security agreement. Each of these documents contained language that Ohio law would govern the documents. Further, the loan agreement indicated to whom any notices under that agreement would be sent. On behalf of Mr. Sims, both he and his counsel, the Dickinson defendants, were listed to receive such notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b622} Lastly, the complaint alleged that the Dickinson defendants agreed to record the security agreement, but had no intention of doing so. In the discovery responses, there is an email dated ten months after the loan documents were executed from another attorney at the Dickinson law firm to MJM's counsel explaining that the mortgage on the yacht had not been filed and asking to delay filing the same for another 60 days to allow Mr. Sims to come up with the funds to repay the promissory note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b623} While the evidence supports the Dickinson defendants' position that 1) they have no physical presence in Ohio, 2) they did not represent MJM, 3) the underlying loan transaction was between Mr. Sims and MJM, and 4) it was MJM who requested the opinion letter, there nonetheless was evidence that the Dickinson defendants transacted business in Ohio. For instance, the Dickinson defendants communicated by email with MJM's counsel, wherein they conducted negotiations, drafted and revised the agreements and the opinion letter, and forwarded the executed agreements and opinion letter to Ohio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diversa, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20200629\">\n    1996 WL 200629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

The opinion letter was on the Dickinson law firm's letterhead, which reflected a Texas address. Also, the opinion letter was signed by attorney Dickinson, who is an attorney licensed in Texas. With respect to tortious injury, MJM further alleged that MJM relied upon the false representations in the opinion letter and suffered actual damages in the amount of $ 313,000, plus interest, court costs, and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b628} In support of the elements of injurious purpose and reasonable expectation that someone would be injured in Ohio, MJM asserted that the Dickinson defendants \"intended for MJM [ ] to rely on [these] false representations\" when MJM decided whether to enter into the loan agreement with Mr. Sims. Moreover, the face of the opinion letter supports that MJM's reliance was reasonable because the letter was drafted at MJM's request and for its benefit only.
