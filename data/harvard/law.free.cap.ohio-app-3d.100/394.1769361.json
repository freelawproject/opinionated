(\u201cappellant\u201d), asserts that the trial court erred when it granted defendant-appellee Picker International, Inc.\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>On April 21, 1994, appellant, a New York-based company, filed a complaint stating that it was an employment agency and it was owed $25,000 from appellee for the placement of Monica Tulley. On May 20, 1994, appellee filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss on June 27, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201cThe trial court, presuming all factual allegations of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint to be true, as required by law, could not have properly dismissed plaintiff-appellant\u2019s complaint as failing to state a claim for which relief may be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Specifically, appellant maintains that: (a) it was not obligated to plead in its complaint that it was licensed in Ohio as a personnel placement agency pursuant to R.C. 4143.02(A); (b) it had no obligation to plead the filing of its fee agreement with the state of Ohio pursuant to R.C. 4143.13(A) with its complaint; (c) it had no obligation to plead operative facts demonstrating that R.C. 4143.13(C) applied to its claim with its complaint; and (d) it sufficiently pled its oral contract so as to give appellee fair notice of the nature of the claim against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">This court has held that a motion to dismiss made pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6), failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, \u201c \u2018tests the sufficiency of the complaint and cannot be used to terminate litigation upon its merits.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Weishaar v. Strimbu </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 276, 288, 601 N.E.2d 587, 595. Pursuant to Civ.R. 8(A), all that is required is a short, plain statement of the claim that will give the defendant fair notice of the plaintiffs claim and the grounds upon which it is based. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The Ohio Supreme Court has held in <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753, syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\u201cIn order for a court to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (Civ.R. 12(B)(6)), it must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery. * * * \u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Appellee claimed that appellant\u2019s complaint did not comply with the rules set forth in R.C. Chapter 4143. After a thorough review of R.C. Chapter 4143, we find that that section does not impose any additional pleading requirements above those mandated by the Rules of Civil Procedure. R.C. 4143.01 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The only section of R.C. Chapter 4143 that addresses the relationship of personnel placement services and employers is R.C. 4143.14(F). R.C. 4143.14(F) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>outlines under what conditions an employer is obligated to pay an \u201cagreed to\u201d fee to a personnel placement service if an applicant is terminated for lack of work. See <em>Le-Gals, Inc. v. Lee-Mar Steel Co. </em>(1985), 30 Ohio Misc.2d 5, 6, 30 OBR 142, 143, 506 N.E.2d 303, 304-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Furthermore, we hold that appellant\u2019s complaint did meet the requirements set forth in Civ.R. 8(A). Appellant\u2019s complaint stated that it was an employment agency seeking a fee in the amount of $25,000 for the placement of a particular employee of appellee. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-7\">Patton, C.J., Spellacy and James D. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
