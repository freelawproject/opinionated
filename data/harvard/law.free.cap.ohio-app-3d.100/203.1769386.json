Hoelzle-Sayre (\u201cappellant\u201d) appeals from a judgment of the Seneca County Court of Common Pleas granting the motion of plaintiff-appellee, Stan Sayre (\u201cappellee\u201d), for a change in custody of the parties\u2019 three minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Appellant and appellee were married September 30, 1978 and divorced November 16, 1990. Appellant was granted custody of the parties\u2019 children. On April 20, 1993, appellee filed motions for temporary relief, modification of custody, and a home investigation. Appellee alleged that the appellant had plans to relocate the children to another area and refused to enroll them in an accredited school. Additionally, appellee asserted that appellant failed to adhere to his visitation privileges. On April 29, 1993, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for temporary relief preventing relocation of the children and requiring compliance with visitation privileges. On May 12, 1993, the court ordered the home investigation which was completed and received by the court. In addition, on June 29, 1993, the court ordered testing of the children by a school psychologist. The written deposition of the school psychologist was filed on August 24, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">On August 26,1993, a hearing was held on appellee\u2019s motion for modification of custody. Appellant and appellee were present with their respective attorneys, Barbara Larick and B. Mark Davis. Prior to the presentation of testimony and evidence, the court acknowledged attorney Larick\u2019s motion for a continuance and withdrawal as counsel which was filed on August 26, 1993.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied the motion as untimely and \u201cnot well made\u201d pursuant to Loe.R. 24 of the Court of Common Pleas of Seneca County. The hearing proceeded; however, when the appellee tried to call the appellant as his first witness, she left the courtroom. At this point, attorney Larick renewed her motion to withdraw and the trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The appellee then presented testimony and evidence supporting his request to be designated residential parent and legal custodian of the children. In accordance with the testimony and evidence, including the court-ordered home investigation and school psychologist\u2019s deposition, the trial court found a significant change in circumstances and that the best interest of the children would be served by modifying the original custody award. Therefore, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion for a change in custody by designating the appellee as the residential parent and legal custodian of the children. The court also restricted appellant\u2019s visitation rights by prohibiting unsupervised visitation pending further hearing or order.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It is from this judgment that appellant asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by refusing a continuance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYR\">Assignment of Error No. 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred by allowing previous counsel to withdraw.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ac-dedup-0\">Assignment of Error No. 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred by going forward with the hearing in the absence of plaintiff and her counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">These three assignments of error are considered jointly because of their overlapping issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Appellant asserts that the court improperly granted attorney Larick\u2019s motion to withdraw without providing appellant with an opportunity to be heard. The appellant also contends that she was entitled to rely on representation from counsel upon leaving the courtroom. Finally, she asserts that, because the court allowed counsel to withdraw, the hearing should have been delayed to permit substitution of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The grounds for a continuance due to the absence of one party include the following factors: \u201cthe absence is unavoidable, and not voluntary; that his presence at the trial is necessary; that the application is made in good faith; and that he probably will be able to attend court at some reasonable future time.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Buck v. McCabe </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 535, 538, 24 O.O. 552, 553, 45 N.E.2d 763, 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Loc.R. 24 of the Court of Common Pleas of Seneca County specifically addresses the issue of attorney withdrawal. It provides, in part, that: <em>\u201c[ujnless otherwise ordered, </em>a trial attorney shall riot be permitted to withdraw at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>later than twenty (20) days in advance of trial or the setting of a hearing on any motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As indicated, the trial court retains, at its discretion, the authority to allow attorney withdrawal at other appropriate times.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Due to the withdrawal of her attorney, appellant asserts that the trial court should have postponed the hearing. However, a trial court has broad discretion whether to grant or deny a motion for continuance and the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Unger </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 65, 67, 21 O.O.3d 41, 42-43, 423 N.E.2d 1078, 1080. The trial court balances the court\u2019s interest in controlling its docket and the public\u2019s interest in an efficient judicial system with the possibility of prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>One factor the trial judge may consider is \u201cwhether the defendant contributed to the circumstance which gives rise to the request for a continuance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 21 O.O.3d at 43-44, 423 N.E.2d at 1080.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Appellant voluntarily left the courtroom after being summoned to the stand as appellee\u2019s first witness and clearly contributed to the circumstance upon which she is now appealing. Therefore, her unexcused absence fails to afford her grounds to object to the proceeding of the hearing. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by holding the hearing despite appellant\u2019s absence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For these reasons, we find appellant\u2019s first three assignments of error not well taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">Assignment of Error No. 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred by considering a written home-study report in the absence of sworn testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Appellant contends that consideration of the home-study report was contrary to evidentiary rules since the report was not formally moved into evidence, nor was it validated by a witness subject to cross-examination. Appellant sets forth R.C. 2317.39, 2317.36, and Civ.R. 75(D) as controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on R.C. 2317.36, which generally governs the admission of experts\u2019 written reports, is misguided. R.C. 2317.39 expressly provides for the use of court-ordered investigative reports as long as the report is made readily available to all parties prior to its consideration by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Appellant readily admits that the contents of the home-study report were made available to all parties; however, she interprets the final paragraph of the statute as mandating live testimony. Appellant\u2019s interpretation of this paragraph is misplaced. The statute specifically provides: \u201cThis section does not apply only to the utilization of the contents of such reports as testimony, but shall prevent any judge from familiarizing himself with such contents in any manner unless this section has been fully complied with.\u201d Thus, it is clear that this statute authorizes the court to admit such reports as testimony. See <em>Roach v. Roach </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 194, 200-201, 607 N.E.2d 35, 38-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In addition, Civ.R. 75(D) and R.C. 3109.04(C) provide for the admission of court-ordered investigation reports involving child custody and divorce matters. In pertinent part, they state that such reports \u201cshall be made available to either party [parent]\u201d and \u201cshall be subject to cross-examination by either party [parent] concerning the contents of the report.\u201d Since cross-examination of the parties concerning the contents of the report is clearly permitted, it is evident that the rule and statute import the use of such reports as testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In <em>Roach v. Roach, supra, </em>at 200, 607 N.E.2d at 39, the court found that the language of R.C. 3109.04(A) [sic (C) ] and Civ.R. 75(D) \u201cimplicitly confers upon the trial court the authority to admit custody-investigation reports into evidence.\u201d That court held that the implicit authority of R.C. 3109.04(A) <em>[sic </em>(C) ] and Civ.R. 75(D), supported by the explicit language of R.C. 2317.39, permits a trial court to consider court-ordered investigation reports as evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 200-203, 607 N.E.2d at 38-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Therefore, based on R.C. 2317.39, along with R.C. 3109.04(C) and Civ.R. 75(D), which govern the admissibility of court-ordered investigative reports, we find that the trial court did not err in considering the home-study report as evidence in the absence of sworn testimony. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">Assignment of Error No. 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in modifying the custody from mother to father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">Assignment of Error No. 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-11\">\u201cThe finding and judgment are contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">Assignment of Error No. 7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-13\">\u201cThe finding and judgment are against the weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-14\">The above assignments of error are being considered together due to their close relationship to each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>An appellate court, in reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision in a child custody matter, must uphold the decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Abuse of discretion constitutes \u201cmore than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 5 OBR at 482-483, 450 N.E.2d at 1142. This standard means that \u201c[t]he discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect.\u201d <em>Miller v. Miller </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846, 849. Consequently, it is improper for an appellate court to independently review the weight of the evidence in the majority of cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In the instant case, appellant argues that the court failed to substantiate its decision to award custody of the children to the appellee. In addition, the appellant asserts that the court failed to balance the advantages and disadvantages of changing the child\u2019s environment required by R.C. 3109.04(E)(l)(a)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Appellant cites R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a), which specifically sets out the standards for child custody modification. While the appellant concedes that the court made findings as to the change in circumstances and best interests of the children, required by R.C. 3109.05(E)(1)(a), appellant challenges the basis of the court\u2019s findings. Thus, appellant points to three issues regarding the dispute of these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">First, appellant states that the appellee\u2019s objection to home schooling was absolved since appellant was willing to enroll the children in a school. The record reveals that appellee\u2019s legitimate concern regarding home schooling of the children was substantiated by the deficient proficiency results on the exams completed by a school psychologist. This, alone, may constitute grounds for change of custody as custody may be modified in situations where a child\u2019s development will be affected by a condition in his present environment. <em>Gardini v. Moyer </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 479, 575 N.E.2d 423.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In <em>Gardini, </em>the court modified the custody order where a mother took the children out of public school and started to teach them at home regardless of the father\u2019s objections. A psychologist testified, in part, that the children would be harmed by the mother\u2019s decision to provide home schooling and the court found that there was sufficient evidence to determine that the children\u2019s present environment would affect their development. Consequently, the Supreme Court held that there was no abuse of discretion in changing the custody award. The case before us presents a similar issue and the trial court\u2019s decision was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>substantiated based on the school psychologist\u2019s evaluation of the children, as well as the testimony by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Second, appellant contends that appellee\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s health condition was without factual basis. Third, the appellant challenges the issue of appellant\u2019s cluttered house as a basis upon which to change custody. Regarding these contentions, it must be reiterated that the trial court has broad discretion in cases relating to custody of children. The trial court is in the best position to gain knowledge of the parties. <em>Trickey v. Trickey </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 9, 13, 47 O.O. 481, 483, 106 N.E.2d 772, 774. Furthermore, the trial court is delegated with the authority to decide \u201cdisputes of fact and weigh the testimony and credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Gardini v. Moyer, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 484, 575 N.E.2d at 427, citing <em>Pasqualone v. Pasqualone </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 96, 17 O.O.3d 58, 406 N.E.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In rendering its decision, the trial court held that there was enough evidence to warrant a change in circumstances and that the modification of custody would be in the best interests of the children. The trial court explicitly stated that it carefully evaluated \u201cthe evidence and testimony properly presented, including, but not limited to, the home investigation and the school proficiency examinations, conducted pursuant to court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Appellant also asserts that the trial court failed to find that it was more advantageous to change the children\u2019s environment as required by R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a), which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">\u201cThe court shall not modify a prior decree allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child, his residential parent, or either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. In applying these standards, the court shall retain the residential parent designated by the prior decree or the prior shared parenting decree, unless a modification is in the best interest of the child and one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">\u201c(in) The harm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of environment to the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">As stated above, the requirement applicable to this case is whether the court determined that the harm of changing the child\u2019s current environment is outweighed by the benefits of changing the environment. In particular, the issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>whether the court applied this balancing test absent any explicit language in the trial court\u2019s judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">A trial court\u2019s judgment entry \u201cmay be general,\u201d unless a party makes a request for separate \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Civ.R. 52. The court must make some finding, pursuant to R.C. 3109.04(E)(l)(a)(iii), that the harm is outweighed by the advantages of changing the environment. <em>Well v. Well </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 606, 609, 591 N.E.2d 843, 844. On the other hand, the judgment of the court \u201cwill not be reversed by a reviewing court\u201d if it is \u201csupported by some competent credible evidence going to all the essential elements of a case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>70 Ohio App.3d at 609, 591 N.E.2d at 845. More specifically, when reviewing the decision of the trial court, a reviewing court may make assumptions regarding the trial court\u2019s consideration of evidence and application of relevant statute requirements. <em>Whitmer v. Darrow </em>(Dec. 26, 1985), Summit App. No. 12130, unreported, 1985 WL 4735. The trial court analyzed evidence, including testimony of the appellee, the home investigation, and the school proficiency examinations, which contains sufficient competent evidence to find that the harm to the children, if they stay with the appellant, is outweighed by the advantages of giving custody to the appellee. Thus, it can be concluded that the trial court followed the dictates of R.C. 3109.04(E)(1)(a) and appellant\u2019s fifth, sixth, and seventh assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Having , found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in any of the particulars assigned and argued, the judgment of the Seneca County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-8\">Evans and Thomas F.
