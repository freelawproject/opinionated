These cases demonstrate the failure of discovery. Plaintiffs-appellants filed overbroad requests for discovery. Defendants filed for overbroad protective orders. The trial court, without deciding what was legitimately discoverable and what was not, put on overbroad protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>orders without giving any reason for doing so. Summary judgment was then granted and appellants took this appeal. We reverse, so that the rules of discovery can be complied with by everyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The facts in both cases are relatively simple. Kalb had an appendectomy. Ratliff had a right femoral-popliteal bypass. Complications arose and both parties sued their surgeon, Dr. Morehead, for malpractice. They also sued the hospital under a theory of negligent credentialing, <em>i.e., </em>the hospital negligently retained Morehead when it knew he was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The facts pertinent to case No. 93 CA 2178, 1995 WL 34795, <em>Kalb, </em>are as follows. On the morning of May 17, 1990, Kalb went to his family physician complaining of abdominal pain. His doctor, Dr. Collins, diagnosed the problem as appendicitis and sent Kalb to the emergency room of Scioto Memorial. When Kalb arrived, Dr. Morehead was summoned and he performed an emergency appendectomy. After the surgery, the abdominal pain continued and Kalb\u2019s temperature and blood pressure increased. There was some internal bleeding and, on May 24, 1992, a second surgery was performed. The pain continued and a third operation was necessary. He continues to have pain and it appears more surgery will be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The facts pertinent to case No. 93 CA 2179, <em>Ratliff, </em>are as follows. On September 7, 1990, Dr. Morehead performed a right femoral-popliteal bypass on Ratliff. Before the operation, Morehead told Ratliff he was going to use the saphenous vein from his lower right leg for the bypass operation. After the operation, Morehead told Ratliff he used the vein to complete the graft. More-head did not use the vein, but instead used Gortex, a manmade material. The procedure failed in less than four weeks, and Ratliff alleges his condition was worse than before the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Kalb and Ratliff sued Morehead under a theory of medical malpractice and sued Scioto Memorial, <em>i.e., </em>U.S. Health, under a theory of negligent credentialing. Both filed discovery requests for certain materials which are the crux of this appeal. Since the issues raised in both appeals are similar, <em>e.g., </em>requested materials and the court\u2019s lack of a rationale, and the arguments advanced are similar in substance, we have consolidated these appeals. We have also prepared an appendix of the discovery requests, which is attached to this opinion, so that each item requested can be considered independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">On January 22, 1992, when he filed his complaint, Kalb filed a Civ.R. 34 demand for production of certain documents from Dr. Morehead. Ratliff made a similar request. See Appendix. Kalb requested all medical, hospital, educational, training and financial reports and records related in any way to Dr. Morehead. He sought records from the Ohio State Medical Board, the Florida State Medical Board, the College of Medicine of the University of Florida, the Missouri State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Board of Registration for the Healing Arts, and the National Board of Medical Examiners. He also sought records from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of the State of New York, the State Education Department, Division of Professional Licensing Services, , Guernsey Memorial Hospital, the U.S. Health Corporation, Ridgeview Institute, Brawner Psychiatric Institute, Doyle 0. Snyder, M.D., Jesse B. Kellum, M.D., Ohio University, the Ohio State University, and the University of Illinois. Obviously, some of this appears to be discoverable, and some clearly is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On March 13, 1992, when the defendants filed their answers consisting of \u00e1 general denial, Morehead filed a request for a Civ.R. 26(C) protective order. He argued that it was not possible for him to obtain records possessed by other parties, and that the discovery requests, designed to annoy and embarrass him, constituted an undue burden. He also said the requested records were confidential and had no relevance to the issue of whether Scioto Memorial was negligent in hiring and retaining him.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On May 26, 1992, Kalb filed a Civ.R. 37 motion to compel discovery. In this motion, Kalb said the matters were relevant because Dr. Morehead misrepresented his qualifications and background to the Ohio State Medical Board and to Scioto Memorial. Specifically, Kalb said Morehead lost his medical license in Florida and was refused readmittance. He was drug- and alcohol-dependent and undergoing treatment, and that his admittance to practice in Ohio was probationary. Morehead had not completed certain fellowships, despite his representation to the contrary, and the Missouri State Medical Board refused to issue a license to Morehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">On July 9, 1992, the court granted Morehead\u2019s request for a protective order, but did not give any reasons for doing so, such as that the material requested was privileged, that to comply with the discovery request would be unduly burdensome, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">On March 3, 1993, Kalb filed a motion requesting additional discovery, such as copies of Kalb\u2019s consent form and a copy of Kalb\u2019s medical records. He also requested documentation that Morehead visited Kalb after the surgery, More-head\u2019s personnel file, Morehead\u2019s contract with U.S. Health, and documentation of Morehead\u2019s CME credits. Kalb also requested copies of the rules, regulations, and policies of Scioto Memorial, which set forth the procedures and requirements in granting or renewing clinical and surgical privileges to physicians, and which set forth the duties of the Medical Records Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">U.S. Health sent copies of Kalb\u2019s consent form and documentation that Morehead had visited Kalb after the surgery. However, U.S. Health said Kalb's medical records were not available. As to all other requested material, U.S. Health filed a motion for a protective order asserting various grounds. On April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>19, 1993, the court granted the protective order, again without saying why it was doing so. A similar course of events took place in the <em>Ratliff </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In <em>Kalb, </em>on June 30, 1993, U.S. Health filed a motion for summary judgment, and Morehead did likewise on July 7, 1993. On September 3, 1993, the court granted summary judgment to both defendants. On July 8, 1993, U.S. Health filed a motion for summary judgment against Ratliff, which was granted September 3, 1993. Morehead followed suit on August 31, 1993, and was granted summary judgment in his favor on September 28, 1993. Kalb and Ratliff timely filed notices of appeal and assign the following errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motions for protective orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">In their first assignment of error, appellants say the requested material was discoverable and the court erred by granting the defendants\u2019 requests for protective orders. The materials requested from the two defendants are different, as are the reasons advanced for seeking the protective orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">In an effort to show Morehead was not qualified to perform the operation and Scioto Memorial knew he was not qualified, Kalb requested information pertaining to Morehead\u2019s personnel file, Morehead\u2019s contract with U.S. Health, documentation of Morehead\u2019s CME credits, and copies of certain bylaws, rules, regulations, orders and policies of Scioto Memorial Hospital, to show that they had not been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">In response to the requests, Morehead asserts that they were irrelevant and unduly burdensome, while Scioto Memorial argues it is an attempt to violate the Peer Review Statute, R.C. 2305.25, and the requested material was not discoverable under R.C. 2305.251.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">In <em>Browning v. Burt </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 544, 613 N.E.2d 993, the Supreme Court stated that R.C. 2305.25 does not provide a hospital with immunity for negligence in granting or continuing staff privileges to an incompetent physician. See, also, R.C. 2305.25(E), which specifies that \u201c[n]othing in this section shall reheve any individual or hospital from liability arising from treatment of a patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">The purpose of R.C. 2305.25 is clear. The statute extends limited protection to those who provide information to certain review boards and committees to encourage the free flow of information without threat of reprisal in the form of civil liability. See, generally, <em>Jacobs v. Frank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 111, 573 N.E.2d 609. The statute also seeks to protect those serving on committees and committee employees for the obvious reason that it could be difficult to staff a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>committee without such protections. <em>Moore v. Burt </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 520, 645 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">R.C. 2305.251 is clear and unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201cProceedings and records of all review committees described in Section 2305.25 of the Revised Code shall be held in confidence and <em>shall not be subject to discovery </em>* * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">\u201c * * * Information, documents, or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as being unavailable for discovery or for use in any civil action merely because they were presented during proceedings of a committee nor should any person testifying before a committee or who is a member of the committee be prevented from testifying as to matters within his knowledge, but the witness cannot be asked about his testimony before the committee or opinion formed by him as a result of the committee hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The statute\u2019s protection is limited to protecting those who serve on review boards and those who provide information to review boards. <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">R.C. 2305.25 does not provide a hospital with immunity for negligence in granting or continuing staff privileges to an incompetent physician. <em>Browning, supra. </em>The requested material might be discoverable to show that Scioto Memorial knew, or had reason to know, Morehead was incompetent. Or the material might be protected and subject to a protective order under R.C. 2305.25. Since the trial court never ruled specifically on these competing claims, we have no way of knowing why the protective order was granted. See Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Kalb and Ratliff asked Dr. Morehead for all medical, hospital, education, training and financial reports and records related in any way to Dr. Morehead from the Ohio State Medical Board, the Florida State Medical Board, the College of Medicine of the University of Florida, the Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts, the National Board of Medical Examiners, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of the State of New York, the State Education Department, Division of Professional Licensing Services, Guernsey Memorial Hospital, the U.S. Health Corporation, Ridgeview Institute, Brawner Psychiatric Institute, Doyle O. Snyder, M.D., Jesse B. Kellum, M.D., Ohio University, the Ohio State University, and the University of Illinois. In the alternative, Kalb supplied release forms, to be signed by Morehead, for the enumerated institutions and individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">In response, Morehead moved for a protective order. He based his request primarily on the Peer Review Statutes and argued that Kalb and Ratliff were, in reality, attempting to circumvent the Peer Review Statutes in an effort to establish negligent credentialing. It is axiomatic that a party cannot do indirect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ly that which he could not do directly, and a protective order on that ground might be appropriate. There is no indication in the record, however, that the order was granted on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">While we note the limited applicability of the Peer Review Statute, we also note that some of the requested material may be subject to a protective order for other reasons. For instance, it appears Dr. Morehead was a patient at Brawner Psychiatric Institute about ten years before and, in all probability, those requested materials are completely irrelevant to his qualifications as a doctor. See Civ.R. 26(B)(1). It is the trial court\u2019s task to determine which material is properly discoverable and which is not. This was not done in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Morehead urges that we take judicial notice of <em>Veach v. Morehead, </em>No. 88-CI-119, Common Pleas Court of Scioto County, and argues that, under <em>Veach, </em>the court properly issued protective orders because appellants already had possession of most of the desired material. This, too, is a legitimate ground on which discovery might be denied, but with the record in its present state, this court can only guess at the basis for the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">We therefore find this first assignment of error is well taken, and we remand the cause with specific instructions as set out in the concluding paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to order production of the requested documents for an <em>in camera </em>inspection and preservation for the record on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">In view of our decision regarding the first assignment of error, the second assignment of error is well taken, and likewise will be dealt with in our order on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant U.S. Health Corporation of Southern Ohio\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendant Morehead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">When reviewing an order for summary judgment, we do not give deference to the trial court. In a case regarding the propriety of a summary judgment, our review is <em>de novo </em>in nature and we apply the same standard as the trial court. See <em>Tohline v. Cent. Trust Co., N.A. </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 280, 281, 549 N.E.2d 1223, 1226; <em>Howard v. Wills </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 133, 601 N.E.2d 515. In essence, we examine the materials before us and determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>\u201c(1) whether a genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) whether it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, the conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Tohline, supra, </em>48 Ohio App.3d at 281, 549 N.E.2d at 1226. See, also, <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 4 O.O.3d 466, 364 N.E.2d 267.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Summary judgment may not be granted before discovery is completed. In view of our holding on the first assignment of error, Kalb\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error are well taken and are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In addition to the above joint assignments of error, Ratliff assigns the following error:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Ratliffs Assignment of Error Number Three</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling plaintiffs motion to compel response to deposition questions of Bhagwan Satiani.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Ratliff took the deposition of Dr. Satiani, who performed an operation to correct alleged problems resulting from the operation at Scioto Memorial. Ratliff asked Satiani how many times he had corrected operations originating with Dr. Morehead. Satiani, over objection, said he wasn\u2019t sure but he believed it to be in excess of six. Ratliff moved the trial court to direct Satiani to provide the exact number on the grounds that it was evidence that Scioto Memorial had constructive knowledge of the quality of Morehead\u2019s work. Although it seems unlikely that any court would compel a witness to give a more exact answer than the witness is willing to give, the court refused to compel an answer without saying why it was doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The admission of evidence is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court and a reviewing court may reverse only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Peters v. Ohio State Lottery Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 296, 587 N.E.2d 290, citing <em>Renfro v. Black </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 27, 32, 556 N.E.2d 150, 155. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Wilmington Steel Products, Inc. v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 120, 122, 573 N.E.2d 622, 624; <em>State v. Moreland </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 61, 552 N.E.2d 894, 898; <em>State v. Montgomery </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 410, 413, 575 N.E.2d 167, 170; <em>State v. Xie </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 527, 584 N.E.2d 715, 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>EvicLR. 402 provides that all relevant evidence is admissible, and evidence which is not relevant is not admissible. <em>State v. Moore </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 531 N.E.2d 691; <em>Columbus v. Taylor </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 162, 529 N.E.2d 1382. However, Evid.R. 403(A) mandates the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. See <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 490, 597 N.E.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Ratliff also asked Dr. Satiani on deposition whether he had an opinion regarding the quality of care Dr. Morehead provided. Satiani said he would not answer unless he had legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">It is well settled in Ohio that in order to prevail in a medical malpractice claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate through expert testimony that, among other things, the tre\u00e1tment provided did not meet the prevailing standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">\u201cProof of the recognized standards must necessarily be provided through expert testimony. This expert must be qualified to express an opinion concerning the specific standard of care that prevails in the medical community in which the alleged malpractice took place, according to the body of law that has developed in this area of evidence.\u201d <em>Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 102, 592 N.E.2d 828, 832. See, also, <em>Bruni v. Tatsumi </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 127, 75 O.O.2d 184, 346 N.E.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">We have reviewed Satiani\u2019s deposition and find no error. Ratliff did not qualify Satiani as an expert witness. No foundation was laid for the basis on which Satiani premised his expert opinion. Any opinion Satiani would have regarding the care afforded by Dr. Morehead would thus appear to be non-expert opinion testimony. Again, however, we have no indication in the record as to why the motion to compel was not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Since this cause is to be remanded, however, Ratliff suffers no prejudice. He is still free to introduce expert witnesses, such as Satiani, to establish the prevailing standard of care and whether Morehead satisfied that standard. Ratliffs third assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Based on the foregoing the judgment of the trial court is reversed. This cause is remanded to the trial court with instructions to the trial court to rule on each of the requests for discovery listed in the Appendix of this opinion, and to state for the record in writing the reason for granting or denying discovery of each item listed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b734-12\">Peter B.

This Appendix has four parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">A. Ratliffs request for discovery from Morehead</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">B.

He argued that all requests should be denied on the grounds that the requested material was not germane to the issue of negligence or that the real reason for the requested material was an attempt to circumvent the state Peer Review Statutes. On May 27, 1992, Ratliff filed a motion to compel discovery pursuant to Civ.R. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">Although it appears that some of the items are not likely to be discoverable, some others might be. On July 2, 1992, Morehead answered Ratliffs request to compel discovery. He argued that the requests were irrelevant and did not address the issue of negligence. He also argued that the material requested pertained to another claim, <em>i.e., </em>against Southern Ohio Health, and was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>related to the suit against him. He also argued that the requested material was an attempt to circumvent the Peer Review Statute. On July 9, 1992, the court granted a blanket protective order for all materials requested. No reason was given for denying the request for discovery of any of these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">On March 3,1993, Ratliff filed a second demand for production of documents to Morehead, pursuant to Civ.R. 34, and requested the list below.

It answered the first question. As to the second question, it said discovery was not complete. It responded \u201cyes\u201d to question 9. It answered \u201cno\u201d to question 12, gave no response to question 13, and \u201cyes\u201d to question 14. It also answered questions 19, 20 and 21. To questions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,10,11,15,16,17 and 18, it responded with a memorandum requesting a protective order under the Peer Review Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">On July 7,1992, the court filed a judgment entry granting a protective order to U.S. Health as to questions 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10.

Also on March 31, 1993, U.S. Health supplied the following in response to Ratliffs motion for discovery. As to requests 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10, it asserted protection under the Peer Review Statutes. As to request 3, it supplied an advertisement. As to request 7, it supplied Ratliff\u2019s consent form.

Too broad and voluminous, irrelevant and not likely to lead to admissible evidence; Peer Review Statute. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in this set of interrogatories is again attempting to get information that he cannot get because of Peer Review privileges. It is also information that would require reviewing 800 to 900 surgeries per month line by line, reviewing the charts and following the patient\u2019s progress thereafter, and would be impossible to do within any reasonable limitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201c2.
