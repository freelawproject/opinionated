For the reasons that follow, we reverse and enter judgment for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">On April 21, 1986, appellant, an employee of LTV, was struck by a large steel panel and was pinned underneath. She was taken to the hospital for treatment of the injuries she sustained. Appellant\u2019s injuries were recognized by the commission for having suffered \u201cchest contusion, cervical and lumber myfascitis, <em>[sic </em>] contusion left forearm and contusion left leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">On April 26, 1988, appellant filed for additional recognition for a post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the injury she suffered on April 21, 1986. The commission referred appellant to a psychiatrist, Dr. Patricia Martin. Dr. Martin, after examining appellant, diagnosed her as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr. Walter Knake, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist who treated appellant in 1992, confirmed Dr. Martin\u2019s diagnoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The record shows that appellant was first diagnosed for the post-traumatic stress disorder on April 1, 1988 by Dr. David Fero.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The commission allowed appellant\u2019s claim for post-traumatic stress disorder. LTV challenged the claim, arguing that post-traumatic stress disorder is not a \u201cflow through\u201d disorder, but one which arises directly and independently from the fear-causing event itself, and therefore, not compensable. LTV, in its motion for summary judgment, also argues that since appellant\u2019s injury was a direct consequence of the 1986 injury, it was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Appellant assigns the following error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">\u201cIt was error for the Trial Court to grant LTV STEEL COMPANY\u2019S \u2018Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment\u2019 because it constitute [sic] a misapplication of the Workers\u2019. Compensation Law to disputed facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Appellant in her sole assignment of error argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on appellees\u2019 contention that her claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s interpretation implies that she knew of her condition five days after her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The applicability of R.C. 4123.84 to \u201cflow through\u201d conditions is set forth in the Ohio Supreme Court decision in <em>Clementi v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 342, 530 N.E.2d 909. The court held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">\u201cR.C. 4123.84 requires a claimant to file a motion for an additional allowance within two years of the time the claimant knew or should have known of the additional condition.\u201d See, also, <em>Edwards v. AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 119, 537 N.E.2d 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Applying <em>dementi </em>and <em>Edwards </em>to the instant case we must determine whether appellant knew or should have known of the psychiatric condition more than two years prior to April 26, 1988. We think not. Appellees base their argument on the fact that appellant mentioned in a deposition that she had dreams about the accident shortly after the injury. Even if we go by the deposition testimony, we still do not believe that the record supports appellees\u2019 contention that appellant knew more than two years before she filed her complaint. Appellees attempt to support their argument by the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">\u201cQ. How often do you think about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-14\">\u201cA. I be dreaming about it a lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-15\">\u201cQ. How long has that been going on that you have been dreaming about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201cA. I have been dreaming about that accident a lot of times, I mean almost ever since it happened I dream about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">\u201cQ. When you say almost ever since it happened, you mean like within the first few days after you come out of the hospital you started having dreams about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember, but I know I had dreams about it, but I don\u2019t know if it was the first couple of days when I come out of the hospital or when it was. All I know is I started having dreams about it, and it just scared me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\"><em>u % % </em>\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">\u201cQ. I know that they have a larry car up there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\u201cA. That\u2019s the larry car, yes. I got caught between the larry car and the railing to the systems, and it was just rolling me around in circles. It mashed my knees too. It had \u2014 my knees were bothering me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">\u201cQ. Did you have any kind of psychological disturbance from that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">\u201cQ. Is it your claim that it was the injury to your back that caused your psychiatric problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">\u201cMR. LAMPERT: Objection, ambiguous, which back injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">\u201cQ. The one in 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">\u201cA. The one in 1986?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-17\">\u201cA. No, I think it is being up under that steel that make me, you know, dreaming and when I go in the stores and you know like if I am reaching for something, I think being up under there, that steel, it frightened me so much, that is what made me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\">\u201cQ. The being frightened part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-19\">\u201cA. Yeah, but as far as you saying my back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-20\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-21\">\u201cA. My back bothering me anyways, it bothering me since I had this last accident, in 19 \u2014 not only my back, 1986, not only my back, I been getting headaches, and my shoulders and things be bothering me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-22\">\u201cQ. But you don\u2019t have the feeling that you worried yourself into a psychological problem because of your shoulder hurting you or your neck hurting you or your back hurting you, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-23\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\u201cQ. You don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cThe thing, as I hear what you are telling me, the thing that seems to be the big factor from what I have heard is your fear of being pinned down and the air being forced out of your body, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cQ. The fear that you have of being close to death because you were pinned down and the air was being forced out of your body, that seems to be the big thing that triggered your psychological problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">\u201cA. Well, I wouldn\u2019t say, you know, like you mean with my back and stuff bothering me, my back and head and shoulders and things? I don\u2019t understand what you are saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201cQ. Well what I\u2019m trying to ask you is in your own mind, have you been able to determine to figure out what it is that makes you have this problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">\u201cA. You think that by me dreaming and at the stores with the shelves are you trying to say that that is what is causing my back and things to hurt, too, or what are you trying to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">\u201cQ. No, I\u2019m asking you whether in your own mind you think \u2014 well, the reason that I keep thinking about this accident and having these fearful thoughts is because my back hurts so much?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">\u201cA. I think my back just \u2014 no, I be taking medication for my back and my head and stuff, I take medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u201cQ. So it is not because that hurts you so much that you have this problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-14\">\u201cA. It is not that, that \u2014 say that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">\u201cQ. It is not that your back hurts you that you have the psychological problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-17\">\u201cQ. It is not because of your head or your shoulder that you have the psychological problem in terms of the pain that you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-18\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t really understand what you saying, because seem like you are not saying it right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-19\">\u201cQ. How would you think that I should be saying it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-20\">\u201cA. Okay. To me, to me it is different because my psychological thing to me it comes from being up under that steel and that frighten me, that frightened me a lot, and to me my pain is different from my psychological, from my fear, it is not I feel my pain, it is not \u2014 no, no that is not why, unt \u2014 un.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201cQ. You have talked to Dr. Kanacki about what he thinks is the cause of your problem, your psychological problem, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201cA. I have told him what I am experiencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you what he thought it was, did he tell you a name to put on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201cA. No, he didn\u2019t put no name on nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cQ. Did Dr. Kanacki tell you what he thought was the cause of your psychological problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201cA. No, he didn\u2019t tell me what he thought, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201cQ. As you sit here right now, you don\u2019t have any problem with recognizing that there is a psychological problem, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u201cA. I do know I got a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">\u201cQ. When was it that you, as you recall, that you first realized that you had a problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">\u201cA. The first time I started dreaming about it, but I can\u2019t tell you the date. I can\u2019t tell you the time because I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">\u201cQ. Was it within a couple of months of the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-15\">\u201cA. Yeah, it was less than a couple of months because it started, I just started dreaming about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">We fail to find any answer in the deposition testimony to support appellees\u2019 claim that appellant knew about her psychological condition two years prior to filing her claim. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the dreams are signals of her condition, her testimony indicates that she started having dreams less than two months after the accident. If the accident occurred on April 21, 1986 and she filed her second complaint on April 26, 1988, on the strength of her discovery of her condition less than two months after the accident<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she was still within the two-year statutory limit. It is our conclusion that appellant\u2019s second complaint was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">Appellees advance a second argument that appellant\u2019s condition was not caused by her injuries but by perception of fear and could not qualify as a \u201cflow through\u201d condition. Appellees argue that appellant\u2019s condition is caused by mental stress and not by physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-18\">The settled law is that there must be an \u201cinjury\u201d in order to receive compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Rambaldo v. Accurate Die </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>Casting </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 281, 285, 603 N.E.2d 975, 978. In Ohio a worker who is disabled by a mental condition which was the result of a compensable work-related physical injury is entitled to compensation. <em>State ex rel. Anderson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 166, 16 O.O.3d 199, 404 N.E.2d 153. However, a mental condition caused solely by mental or emotional stress is not a compensable injury. <em>Rambaldo, supra; Hayes v. Toledo </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 651, 577 N.E.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>Rambaldo </em>involved a claim by an employee who charged that he suffered from major depression and mixed personality because his employer required him to do things which were dishonest or somewhat unethical. The Ohio Supreme Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">\u201cIn the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to recognize mental conditions caused solely by work-related stress as occupational diseases within the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, such mental conditions are not compensable as occupational diseases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Thus, in order to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a mental condition, the employee must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) there was an injury received in the course of, and arising out of, the employee\u2019s employment as defined by R.C. 4123.01(C); and (2) the work-related injury caused the employee to become dominated by a disturbance of the mind of such severity as to override normal behavior. See <em>Borbely v. Prestole Everlock, Inc. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 67, 565 N.E.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In the instant case, it is uncontroverted that appellant suffered an injury in the course of, and arising out of her employment. Appellees also did not challenge the report of Dr. Fero, who diagnosed appellant\u2019s condition as instructed by the commission. The report reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201cOur final diagnoses were Chronic Cervical Thoracic and Lumbar Myositis, and to this I added Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It was clear from the data we had accumulated that Ms. Banks was suffering with extreme anxiety and panic and that this was related to her experience of being injured and pinned and trapped by the panel and her fear at the time of that experience. To be fair there are other contributing factors including continuation on Valium over the year and one half which in my opinion would impede recovery. Also I believe Ms. Banksf] personality contributed to a predisposition to an anxiety disorder. But clearly [a] traumatic experience was the primary cause of both her anxiety disorder and her pain complaints, and the other factors only slowed or prevented her recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201cI believe Ms. Banks needs the help of a psychiatrist or psychologist experienced in treating anxiety disorders and chronic pain disorders. I would recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>mend Dr. Phillip Fischer as someone experienced in this fashion. I will be happy to provide a referral to Dr. Fischer or to another Doctor at the request of Ms. Banks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cDavid D. Fero, Ph.D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">Psychologist and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Clinical Director</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">Huron Hospital</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">Pain Management Center\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The plain reading of Dr. Fero\u2019s diagnosis shows that appellant\u2019s mental condition is directly linked to her April 21, 1986 injuries. If we accept appellees\u2019 reasoning, then workers\u2019 compensation is unavailable to an airline flight attendant who is injured in an airplane crash and. later develops a mental condition because of the crash even though she no longer suffers physical pain from the crash. Such a narrow holding will not comport with the psychiatric exception the law allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">We hold that the record supports appellant\u2019s claim as recognized by the commission that she suffers from compensable mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained. The trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of appellees is reversed, and judgment is entered for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-14\">Nahra, C.J., and M\u00c1tia, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-19\">.
