Haftkowycz, M.D., appeals in App. No. 66858 from the jury verdict/in favor of plaintiffsappellees Robin and Thomas Rechenbach on their complaint. Appellees also filed an appeal from the denial of prejudgment interest which was designated App. No. 66806; however, appellees have not presented any arguments supporting this appeal and it is therefore dismissed pursuant to Loc.App.R. 6(6). The facts relevant to defendant\u2019s appeal follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\">Robin Rechenbach (\u201cappellee\u201d) became a patient of appellant, an obstetrician and gynecologist, in 1989 after she became pregnant with her third child. Appellant monitored appellee\u2019s pregnancy; his partner delivered appellee\u2019s baby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>in January 1990. On February 27, 1990, appellee came to appellant\u2019s office for her six-week postpartum check-up. At that time appellant administered a PAP test to check for any abnormality in the cervical cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">A few days later, appellant telephoned appellee with the results of the PAP test. He told her the test indicated that some moderate dysplasia, that is, abnormality of the cells, was present in the cervix. Appellant informed appellee of the types of treatment available for the condition but recommended she undergo a biopsy before taking further action. Appellee agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">On March 26, 1990, appellant performed a cone biopsy on appellee. Before they left the hospital on that day, appellant spoke to appellee and Mr. Rechen-bach concerning the results of the biopsy. At that meeting, appellant recommended the treatment of appellee\u2019s dysplasia with a surgical procedure called laser ablation. During this treatment, the abnormal cells of the cervix would be \u201cburned\u201d away with a beam of intense light. Appellant recommended the surgery be done as soon as possible; therefore, while appellee was still at the hospital, the surgery was scheduled for April 19. On the same occasion, appellee was also scheduled for pre-admission testing (\u201cP.A.T.\u201d) to be done by the hospital staff on April 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Appellee appeared at the hospital on April 17 as arranged. The P.A.T. was performed and included a pregnancy test. However, appellee could not undergo the April 19 surgery as arranged since she discovered she was menstruating. In consultation with appellant\u2019s office staff, appellee\u2019s surgery was rescheduled for May 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">On April 26, appellee telephoned appellant\u2019s office to notify him that her baby would have to undergo cranial surgery. She requested her own surgery be postponed. Eventually, appellee\u2019s laser ablation surgery was scheduled for the afternoon of June 7, 1990. Appellee\u2019s P.A.T. was to be done in the morning of the same day. This time, the P.A.T. did not include a pregnancy test. Although appellant reviewed the P.A.T. prior to commencing surgery on appellee, he did not notice the absence of that particular test. He performed the laser ablation surgery as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Following the procedure, which was successful at removing the abnormal cells, appellant told Mr. Rechenbach that appellee might experience some mild cramping or bleeding as a result of the operation. Appellee returned home that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">However, while she experienced some cramping and bleeding the day after her surgery, by the following morning, the heavy flow and the odd appearance of the blood alarmed appellee. Appellee thought she might be pregnant; she therefore caused Mr. Rechenbach to obtain a home pregnancy test for her. The results of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>that test confirmed her suspicions. She telephoned appellant\u2019s office in the early afternoon to inform appellant of both the heavy discharge and the results of the home pregnancy test. Appellant spoke to her over the telephone and tried to calm her. He told her to go back to the hospital for a more reliable pregnancy test. Appellee did so that same evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">When appellant obtained the results of the test, he told appellee that the hormone levels indicated she was indeed pregnant. Since at that time it was Saturday evening, appellant decided appellee should have another blood test and an ultrasound examination on the following Monday. Appellee\u2019s bleeding continued throughout the intervening day.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Appellee spoke to appellant over the telephone soon after the ultrasound examination on June 12. Appellee was concerned about effects the surgical procedure she had recently undergone might have on her fetus. Appellant reassured her and told her to telephone his office the next morning to schedule further care. When she did so, appellee learned that the bleeding and discharge she had been experiencing indicated she had miscarried. Appellee did not thereafter return to appellant\u2019s office. Appellee later learned that although Mr. Rechenbach had had a vasectomy in early 1990, the procedure had not been successful; therefore, appellee\u2019s ill-fated pregnancy apparently commenced sometime in May 1990. During his testimony at trial, appellant admitted that had a pregnancy test been performed on appellee on June 7, 1990, it would have indicated a positive result.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">On September 30,1992, appellees filed a four-count complaint in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas against appellant alleging medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">In count one appellees alleged that prior to performing the laser ablation of the cervix on appellee Robin Rechenbach, appellant negligently failed to perform a pregnancy test, thereby \u201ccausing Robin Rechenbach to lose her child.\u201d Appellees claimed that as a result of appellant\u2019s negligence, appellee Robin Rechenbach suffered severe and permanent injury, including depression, loss of enjoyment of life, and \u201cgreat pain of body and mind\u201d and that she would continue to require medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In count two of their complaint, appellees based their medical malpractice claims upon the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>alleging that the injury suffered by appellee Robin Rechenbach was of a type which \u201cdoes not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">In counts three and four of their complaint, appellees asserted claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress and for loss of consortium on behalf of Thomas Rechenbach.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Pursuant to the requirements of R.C. 2309.01, later declared invalid by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Rockey v. 84 Lumber Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 221, 611 N.E.2d 789, appellees demanded judgment on their complaint \u201cfor compensatory damages in an amount in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars,\u201d prejudgment interest, costs, attorney fees, and other \u201cproper\u201d relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Appellant answered the complaint, admitting \u201ca pregnancy test was not performed immediately prior to the laser ablation\u201d but denying negligence and denying \u201cthat the absence of such a test in any manner causally brought about a termination of [appellee\u2019s] alleged pregnancy.\u201d After the discovery process, the case proceeded to jury trial on December 6, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Appellees called appellant as their first witness. On cross-examination, appellant was asked to read the office notes he had made concerning his patient appellee. In relevant part, appellant\u2019s testimony follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\"><em>\u201cA. \u201c </em>* * * We talked about when she conceived, and I told her there is no way to tell when this happened under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\"><em>(( </em># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\u201cQ. Go on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">\u201cA. \u201cHowever, if it happened after her 4/17 mentrual [sic ] period, then the <em>spontaneous abortion was certainly inevitable when the laser therapy was performed </em>due to the low quantitative level on 6/9. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">i&lt; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">\u201cQ. Just a few more questions, Doctor. To make sure we understand this, <em>Robin Rechenbach was [pregnant] on June 7th, was she not?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">\u201cA. <em>Yes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">\u201cQ. <em>No pregnancy test was performed </em>during that preadmission testing procedure <em>prior to the laser </em>ablation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-15\">\u201cA. On June 7th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">\u201cQ. \u2014on June 7th, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-17\">\u201cA <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-18\">\u201cQ. <em>You wouldn\u2019t have done the laser ablation procedure on June 7th if you knew she was pregnant?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-19\">\u201cA <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-20\">\u201cQ. And her miscarriage in this particular case began on what date? Can you tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-21\">\u201cA. I .can\u2019t tell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-22\">\u201cQ. Somewhere between 6/8 and 6/10?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201cA. There is no way to tell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">\u201cQ. But we know by <em>June 12th </em>she was experiencing a miscarriage or <em>the miscarriage was complete, is that correct?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\u201cA. <em>Yes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Appellees also testified in their own behalf and presented the testimony of Dr. Jon Hazen as an expert in gynecology. Dr. Hazan opined that appellant\u2019s failure to ascertain whether appellee was pregnant before performing laser surgery on her cervix was below the acceptable standard of medical care. Dr. Hazen also testified he could state with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that appellee\u2019s miscarriage began with the laser surgery. Finally, appellees presented the testimony of a psychiatrist who had treated appellee Robin Rechenbach for depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">At the conclusion of appellees\u2019 case, appellant moved for a directed verdict. Appellant\u2019s motion was made \u201cwith respect to the prayer of the complaint,\u201d counsel noting on the record for the first time that appellees had failed to amend the prayer to request a specific amount prior to trial as required by Civ.R. 54(C). The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">In his defense, appellant presented the testimony of two hospital nurses who admitted a pre-admission pregnancy test was not performed on appellee. However, on cross-examination appellant admitted it was his responsibility to review the P.A.T. prior to commencing surgery and that he had failed to do so in appellee\u2019s case. Moreover, neither appellant nor his expert, Dr. Laszlo Sogor, testified that appellant\u2019s actions in this regard met the acceptable standard of medical care. Appellant and his expert did, however, offer some testimony and evidence to dispute appellees\u2019 claim of a causal link between the laser surgery and the subsequent miscarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Following the presentation of appellant\u2019s evidence, appellant renewed his motion for a directed verdict. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Both parties had previously submitted proposed jury instructions for the trial court\u2019s perusal. At this juncture of the trial, appellant noted for the record his objection to any jury instruction on \u201cpermanent or future damages.\u201d The case then proceeded to closing argument. Over appellant\u2019s objection, counsel for appellees argued that if the jury found for appellees on their complaint, the damage award should be not \u201cless than one hundred thousand dollars\u201d to appellee Robin Rechenbach and \u201cnot less than twenty-five thousand dollars\u201d to appellee Thomas Rechenbach.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Following closing argument, the trial court proceeded to instruct the jury. With regard to damages, the trial court stated in pertinent part the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u201cIf you find for the plaintiff you will decide by the greater weight of the evidence an amount of money that will reasonably compensate the plaintiff for the <em>actual injuries and resultant damages </em>proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201cIn deciding this amount you will consider <em>the nature and extent of the injury, the effect upon physical and mental health, the pain and suffering experienced, </em>the ability or inability to perform usual activities, lost earnings, <em>and the reasonable cost of necessary medical and hospital expenses incurred.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201cFrom these you will determine what sum will compensate the plaintiff for injury to date, and in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cAs you know, the plaintiff claims that the injury will continue into the future, and will thus possibly incur future expenses, as well as pain and disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\"><em>\u201cAs to such future claims no damage may be found except that which is reasonably certain to exist </em>as a proximate result of the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\"><em>\u201cIf you find </em>from the greater weight of the evidence <em>that as a proximate result of the injury sustained the plaintiff has suffered some type of permanent or future disability, </em>which has been evidenced by way of an inability to perform the usual activities of life, such activities which had given pleasure to this particular plaintiff, <em>you may consider and make a separate award for such damages.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\"><em>\u201cWith regard to any future claims you are not to speculate. </em>The law deals in probabilities and not mere possibilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\"><em>\u201cIf </em>you find for the plaintiffs you will consider and include an amount that will reasonably compensate Mr. Rechenbach which you find resulted from a loss of consortium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">\u201cConsortium consists of services, sexual relations, companionship, comfort, solace, and love of the other spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\"><em>\u201cThere is no recognized unit value for pain and suffering and disability. </em>It is solely within your province, in the event you find for the plaintiff, to fix that sum.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">The jury rendered a general verdict in the amount of $110,000 for appellees on their complaint. Four interrogatories had been submitted to the jury; the jury\u2019s responses to these follow:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">\u201c(1) Was defendant negligent? Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">\u201c(2) Did defendant\u2019s negligence proximately cause damages to plaintiffs? Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-17\">\u201c(3) What sum do you award as damages on behalf of plaintiff Robin Rechen-bach? $80,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201c(4) What sum do you award as damages on plaintiff Thomas Rechenbach\u2019s loss of consortium claim? $30,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The trial court entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict on December 10, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Appellant presents.three assignments of error for this court\u2019s review which will be addressed in logical order.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">\u201cGiven the testimony that plaintiffs miscarriage could have resulted from any one of several causes, in failing to produce evidence excluding the effectiveness of those causes for which the defendant is not legally responsible, the plaintiffs have not sustained their burden of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Appellant argues that since some of the evidence adduced at trial indicated there may have been other \u201cpotential\u201d causes of appellee\u2019s miscarriage unrelated to the laser ablation surgery, appellees failed to sufficiently establish proximate cause, and that therefore, reversal of the jury\u2019s verdict is in order. Upon a review of the record, however, it is clear that appellant\u2019s argument is unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The Ohio Supreme Court has recently responded to a similar argument as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">\u201cAppellee [defendant] has accurately noted that appellants [plaintiffs] bear the burden of persuasion with respect to every aspect of their claim, including causation. Nevertheless, the <em>probability requirement applicable to expert opinion testimony is not limited to that adduced by appellants. </em>Inasmuch as the expression of probability is a condition precedent to the admissibility of expert opinion regarding causation, it relates to the competence of such evidence and not its weight. See <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 313, 533 N.E.2d 701, 714. Accordingly, <em>it is essential to focus on the quality of the evidence adduced regardless of the identity of its proponent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\"><em>\u201cIn </em>this regard, <em>appellee has confused the burden of persuasion, </em>which is generally borne by the plaintiff in a negligence action, <em>and the duty imposed upon the proponent of a fact to adduce competent evidence sufficient to establish its existence. The former burden was and continued to be the responsibility of the appellants. In order to present a jury question </em>and avoid a directed verdict, <em>appellants were required to satisfy the burden of production by establishing a prima facie case. </em>See 2 McCormick, Evidence (4 Ed. Strong Ed.1992) 425, Section 336. <em>This burden is satisfied by adducing competent evidence supporting the existence of a duty, breach of the duty, causation based on probability </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>and damages. Once a prima facie case has been demonstrated, the adverse party may attempt to negate its effect </em>in various ways. He may cross-examine the expert of the other party. He may adduce testimony from another expert which contradicts the testimony of the expert for his adversary. Further, <em>he may adduce expert testimony which sets forth an alternative explanation for the circumstances at issue. If this last approach is pursued, the evidence directed to the alternate explanation is governed by the same standard </em>of admissibility applicable to the evidence adduced by his adversary.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Stin-son v. England </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 451, 455-456, 633 N.E.2d 532, 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In this case, appellees made a prima facie demonstration of proximate cause. Appellant testified on cross-examination that he noted appellee\u2019s miscarriage was <em>\u201ccertainly </em>inevitable when the laser therapy was performed.\u201d Moreover, appellees\u2019 expert, Dr. Hazen, stated he believed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that appellee\u2019s miscarriage \u201cbegan with the surgery\u201d and that there was a <em>direct </em>causal relationship between appellant\u2019s failure to do a pregnancy test and appellee\u2019s miscarriage. This evidence was sufficient to sustain appellees\u2019 burden of proof of causation. <em>Stinson v. England, supra; Cooper v. Sisters of Charity </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 242, 56 O.O.2d 146, 272 N.E.2d 97; <em>Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 592 N.E.2d 828; <em>Bailey v. Emilio C. Chu, M.D., Inc. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 627, 610 N.E.2d 531; <em>Ryne v. Garvey </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 145, 621 N.E.2d 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Appellant\u2019s evidence did not negate appellant\u2019s prima facie case. He and his expert essentially testified that from fifteen to twenty percent of <em>all </em>pregnancies can miscarry. Although they opined that appellee\u2019s miscarriage was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d attributable to some cause other than the laser ablation surgery, in view of appellees\u2019 evidence to the contrary, this issue was for the jury to determine. <em>Stinson v. England; Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error lacks merit and is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s jury instruction permitting an award for future damages constitutes reversible error in that there is no evidentiary predicate in the record to substantiate such a recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Appellant argues the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. He contends the trial court\u2019s inclusion of an instruction on future damages \u201cinvited\u201d the jury to make an award for future damages. Appellant cites <em>Day v. Gulley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 83, 23 O.O.2d 382, 191 N.E.2d 732, in support of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The court stated the following in <em>Day v. Gulley, supra, </em>at syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cIn a personal injury action, <em>where the plaintiffs injuries are subjective in character </em>and there is no expert medical evidence as to future pain, suffering, <em>permanency of injuries </em>or lasting impairment of health, it is prejudicial error for the trial court to charge the jury in its general instructions that, \u201cin determining the amount of damages, the jury should consider the nature and extent of the injuries, whether or not the injuries are in all probability permanent or temporary only; the pain and suffering plaintiff has endured and with reasonable certainty will endure in the future.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Appellant comments extensively on appellees\u2019 failure to present expert testimony on the issue of future damages. The issue is not whether appellees proved any future damages, but whether they proved they suffered an \u201cobjective\u201d as opposed to a merely \u201csubjective\u201d injury so as to justify the jury's award. See, <em>e.g., Powell v. Montgomery </em>(1971), 27 Ohio App.2d 112, 118-119, 56 O.O.2d 279, 283, 272 N.E.2d 906, 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u201c[A]n injury is \u2018objective\u2019 when, <em>without more, </em>it will provide an evidentiary basis for a jury to conclude with <em>reasonable </em>certainty that future damages, such as medical expenses will <em>probably </em>result. See <em>Spargur v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>[1959], 109 Ohio App. 37 [10 O.O.2d 207, 163 N.E.2d 786].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The injury appellee Robin Rechenbach suffered as a result of appellant\u2019s negligence, <em>viz., </em>a miscarriage, is an \u201cobjective\u201d injury. The fact that pain and suffering are subjective <em>feelings </em>makes the injury itself no less objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In this case, both appellees testified concerning the pain and suffering they had experienced because of the miscarriage. Moreover, they also testified they continued to experience pain and suffering up to the time of trial. Their testimony was sufficient evidence to prove damages occurred as a result of the injury and were continuing. \u201cSince pain and suffering are subjective feelings, the injured person\u2019s testimony is the only direct proof of such damages.\u201d <em>Youssef v. Jones </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 500, 505, 602 N.E.2d 1176, 1179; <em>Turner v. Barrett </em>(1980), 68 Ohio App.2d 80, 22 O.O.3d 74, 426 N.E.2d 1193.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Considering the jury instructions as a whole, and in view of the fact that the interrogatory submitted to the jury concerning the damage award was not specific, and, furthermore, taking into account the nature of appellees\u2019 injury and the evidence of damages adduced at trial, this court cannot conclude the trial court erred in this matter. <em>Fischer v. Dairy Mart Convenience Stores, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 543, 602 N.E.2d 1204; <em>Fantozzi v. Sandusky Cement Prod. Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 601, 597 N.E.2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Therefore, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Appellant\u2019s final assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201cHaving neglected to specify her monetary damage request at least seven days before trial, the plaintiffs are barred from recovering damages in excess of $25,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Appellant argues appellees\u2019 failure to amend their complaint to request a specific damage award as required by Civ.R. 54(C) and R.C. 2309.01(D) mandates a limitation on the award. Appellant contends that since the only concrete figure named in appellant\u2019s complaint was $25,000, their recovery is limited to that amount. Appellant further contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rockey v. 84 Lumber Co., supra, </em>supports his argument. Based upon the language of that case, however, this court does not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">The <em>Rockey </em>court stated in pertinent part the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">\u201cPrior to enactment of [R.C. 2309.01], plaintiff had the option of filing an amended demand for judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 54(C). However, since plaintiff could specify an actual amount of damages in the original complaint under Civ.R. 8(A), which Civ.R. 8(A) requires plaintiff to do, he did not have to amend the demand for judgment at a later date. With the enactment of R.C. 2309.01, plaintiff is required to amend the complaint in order to state an actionable cause and comply with Civ.R. 8(A). <em>This additional requirement has led to harsh results in that plaintiff's who specify no actual damages in the original complaint, in an attempt to comply with R.C. 2309.01, face a judgment for zero damages when they do not later comply with the R.C. 2309.01 requirement that they amend the complaint. </em>Regardless of whether these situations are framed as failure to comply with Civ.R. 54(C) or as noncompliance with R.C. 2309.01, they are all <em>glaring examples of the inherent unfairness </em>which results from the R.C. 2309.01 requirement that plaintiff specify no damages in the original complaint when those damages are in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 224, 611 N.E.2d at 791.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rockey </em>obviously both contemplated and encompassed a situation such as that which occurred in this case. In <em>Rockey, </em>the court made it clear that plaintiffs were not to be faulted for their failure to amend their prayer for damages since they were attempting to deal with an \u201cinherently unfair\u201d scheme. This court finds support for such an interpretation in <em>Bobich v. Convenient Food Mart 3-109 </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 228, 611 N.E.2d 794; both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>fact situation and the argument raised in <em>Bobich </em>precisely parallel those of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Therefore, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error also lacks merit and is accordingly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The judgment of the trial court in App. No. 66858 is affirmed and the appeal in App. No. 66806 is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b525-7\">Nugent and Parrino, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b525-8\">Thomas J. Parrino, J., retired, of the Eighth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
