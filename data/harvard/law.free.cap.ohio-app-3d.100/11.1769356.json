The trial court concluded that plaintiff Yocono\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. had established, by clear and convincing evidence, that its use of the name \u201cYocono\u201d in connection with an Italian restaurant it operates had caused that name to acquire a secondary meaning. It further concluded that defendant\u2019s use of the same name in connection with his Italian restaurant was likely to cause confusion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>misunderstanding \u201cas to the affiliation, connection, or association\u201d between defendant\u2019s restaurant and plaintiffs restaurant. Defendant has argued (1) that the trial court incorrectly determined that the name \u201cYocono\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning; (2) that the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant intentionally appropriated plaintiffs reputation was against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (3) that the trial court incorrectly awarded attorney fees to plaintiff. Plaintiff has cross-appealed and has argued (1) that the trial court made mathematical errors in its calculation of the amount of attorney fees plaintiff was entitled to recover; and (2) that the injunction entered by the trial court was inadequate, both because it covered too small a geographic area and because it was ambiguous. This court affirms the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and reverses it in part. Defendant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled and that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment related to them is affirmed because (1) plaintiff presented sufficient evidence that the name \u2018Yocono\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning; (2) its finding that defendant had intentionally appropriated plaintiff\u2019s reputation was not against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (3) the trial court did not err in awarding plaintiff attorney fees. Plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of attorney fees plaintiff was entitled to recover. Plaintiffs second assignment of error, however, is sustained in part because the injunction entered by the trial court was ambiguous, and this matter is remanded for the trial court to clarify its injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Defendant Nunzie Yocono and his brother James Yocono opened an Italian restaurant on West Exchange Street in the city of Akron during 1974. They jointly operated that restaurant under the name \u2018Yocono\u2019s\u201d for a number of years. In approximately 1980, the brothers incorporated their restaurant business under the name \u2018Yocono\u2019s Restaurant, Inc.,\u201d with each of them owning half the outstanding shares. During 1982, James bought Nunzie\u2019s shares of Yocono\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. for $250,000, and Nunzie terminated his involvement with the West Exchange Street restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">During 1987, defendant opened an Italian restaurant named \u201cMarisa\u2019s Cafe Italia\u201d on West Market Street in the Montrose area, five miles from Yocono\u2019s. During July 1992, while defendant was out of town, his son, who was the manager of Marisa\u2019s Cafe Italia, decided to change its name to \u201cNunzie Yocono\u2019s Italian Restaurant.\u201d The son testified that he decided to do so as a birthday surprise for his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">As part of the name change, defendant\u2019s son had new signs placed on the restaurant building and along the street in front of it. On the new signs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d was printed in much larger letters than the other parts of the restaurant\u2019s new name. \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d was also printed on a different color background than the color used as background for the other words that made up the new name. As a result, the most noticeable part of the new name was the word \u201cYocono\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Defendant\u2019s son also prepared a new menu which was similar, both in appearance and content, to the menu that was in use at Yocono\u2019s. Among the sandwiches offered on the new menu was one identified as a \u201cYocono Burger.\u201d Yocono\u2019s has sold a sandwich identified as a \u201cYocono Burger\u201d for many years. In addition, defendant\u2019s son reprogrammed the cash register so that \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d was printed at the top of each receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Upon his return to Akron, defendant approved the various changes his son had made. He and his employees began answering the telephone by saying \u201cNunzie Yocono\u2019s,\u201d and he began advertising in the local newspaper under the name \u201cNunzie Yocono\u2019s.\u201d He also submitted ad copy for a telephone listing in the yellow pages under the name \u201cNunzie Yocono\u2019s Italian Restaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Employees of the original Yocono\u2019s began receiving questions and complaints regarding defendant\u2019s restaurant shortly after the name change. As a result, plaintiffs attorney sent defendant a letter in which he stated that the new name was causing confusion among Yocono\u2019s customers, leading them to believe that Yocono\u2019s had opened a second location, and asked him to stop using \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d as part of his restaurant\u2019s name:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u201c[T]he intention of this letter is to request that you change the name of your restaurant back to Marisa\u2019s or to some other name which is not confusingly similar to \u2018Yocono\u2019s.\u2019 We would advise that we have carefully researched the law and that we feel strongly that our clients have dominant rights for the use of \u2018Yocono\u2019s\u2019 in this area, and that your use is clearly an infringement and causing irreparable harm to them in connection with these rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">After a telephone conversation with plaintiffs attorney, defendant again changed the signs at his restaurant. The new signs identified it as \u201cNunzie\u2019s Italian Restaurant, owned by Nunzie Yocono.\u201d The first word, \u201cNunzie\u2019s,\u201d was emphasized in the same manner that \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d had been emphasized on the previous signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Plaintiff filed this action in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas on August 25, 1992. It averred that defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d was a deceptive trade practice in violation of R.C. 4165.02 and requested an injunction prohibiting him from continuing to do business under the name \u201cYocono\u2019s.\u201d Following a trial before a referee, the trial court granted plaintiff a permanent injunction prohibiting defendant from using the name \u201cYocono\u201d for various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>purposes associated with operating a restaurant. It also awarded plaintiff attorney fees of $8,221.50. Defendant timely appealed to this court and plaintiff cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">By its complaint in this action, plaintiff averred that defendant\u2019s use of the name \u2018Yocono\u201d was violative of R.C. Chapter 4165, Ohio\u2019s Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Generally, the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices Act is a codification of the common law. <em>Worthington Foods, Inc. v. Kellogg Co. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1990), 732 F.Supp. 1417, 1431. Further, it is substantially similar to Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, Section 1125(a), Title 15, U.S.Code. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, cases interpreting the Lanham Act or the common law of trademarks are relevant to analysis of claimed violations of R.C. Chapter 4165.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly determined that the name \u2018Yocono\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning. He has asserted that plaintiff was required to establish all the elements necessary for the relief it sought by clear and convincing evidence and that it failed to present sufficient evidence regarding \u201csecondary meaning\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The degree of proof a plaintiff must present in a deceptive trade practices case is not without some confusion. In <em>S. Ohio Bank v. S. Ohio Savings Assn. </em>(1976), 51 Ohio App.2d 67, 69, 5 O.O.3d 183, 184, 366 N.E.2d 296, 298, the First District Court of Appeals held that, when an injunction is the relief requested in such a case, clear and convincing evidence must be presented. If plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to prove its claim by clear and convincing evidence, it also carried the lesser burden of proving its claim by a preponderance. This court will, therefore, assume that the higher clear and convincing standard was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">The first step in determining whether a defendant may be prohibited from using a word for which trademark protection is claimed is to determine which of four categoiies that word falls into: (1) generic or common descriptive; (2) merely descriptive; (3) suggestive; or (4) arbitrary or fanciful. <em>Miller Brewing Co. v. Heileman </em>(C.A.7, 1977), 561 F.2d 75, 79, certiorari denied (1978), 434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 751, 54 L.Ed.2d 772. A generic or common descriptive term is not entitled to trademark protection under any circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Suggestive terms and arbitrary or fanciful terms are entitled to trademark protection without the need to show that they have a secondary meaning. <em>Id. </em>Words that are merely descriptive are entitled to trademark protection only if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>is shown that they have acquired a secondary meaning. <em>Id. </em>Personal names, like \u201cYocono\u201d in this case, fall within the merely descriptive category and, therefore, are entitled to trademark protection only if they have acquired a secondary meaning. See 1 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3 Ed.1994), Section 13.02[2]. Accordingly, the issue before this court in regard to defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is whether plaintiff proved by clear and convincing evidence that the name \u2018Yocono\u201d has acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In order to establish secondary meaning, plaintiff was required to prove that \u201cthe primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\u201d <em>Pizzazz Pizza &amp; Restaurant v. Taco Bell Corp. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1986), 642 F.Supp. 88, 92. In order for a personal name to have a secondary meaning, \u201cthe public has [to have] come to recognize the personal name as a symbol that identifies and distinguishes the goods or services of only one seller.\u201d 1 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3 Ed.1994) 13-5, Section 13.02[1],</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In <em>Pizzazz Pizza &amp; Restaurant v. Taco Bell Corp. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1986), 642 F.Supp. 88, the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Ohio recognized five factors relevant to a determination of secondary meaning: \u201c(1) the amount and manner of advertising; (2) the volume of sales; (3) length and manner of use; (4) direct consumer testimony and; (5) consumer surveys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. There was evidence before the trial court that related to each of the first four above factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Jamie Yocono, one of the managers of Yocono\u2019s, identified a number of advertisements that Yocono\u2019s had placed. In addition, she testified that it was a practice of the restaurant to contribute food to various organizations as a form of advertising. She identified records of a number of such donations, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">\u201cMy parents [James Yocono and his wife] don\u2019t believe so much in paying money to advertise as they do in letting the food speak for itself. So instead of giving a $25.00 donation to a group they\u2019ll give $25.00 worth of food to a group and let the food advertise itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Jamie Yocono also presented evidence regarding the volume of sales at Yocono\u2019s. Although that evidence was limited to 1992, it was sufficient to show that a large number of people have been exposed to the name \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d in connection with the restaurant on West Market Street because they had dined there. During the three-month period of July, August, and September 1992, for example, over 48,000 people dined at Yocono\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">The name \u2018Yocono\u2019s\u201d has been used in connection with the restaurant on West Exchange Street since it opened during 1974. Exclusive use for such a long time means that many people were exposed to it in that context, causing them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>associate it with that particular restaurant. One commentator has described how a restaurant\u2019s name acquires secondary meaning:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u201cIn the early stages of a business and prior to obtaining secondary meaning, there can be no likelihood of customer confusion, for by definition, the personal name signifies only the personal reputation of that person, not a business reputation in the nature of a trademark or service mark. * * * Seeing a sign announcing \u2018Al\u2019s Drive In,\u2019 the buyer knows only that someone named Al, out of all the Als in the world, is in business. If someone says \u2018Let\u2019s go to Al\u2019s,\u2019 the reaction may be \u2018Al who? Where?\u2019 But once Al\u2019s has become known to many people as designating a single source, then people will know exactly what is meant when someone says \u2018Lets go to Al\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d 1 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition (3 Ed.1994) 13-7, Section 13.02[3].</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Eighteen years of use of the name \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d in connection with the restaurant on West Exchange Street provided an opportunity to many people to come to recognize the word \u201cYoeono\u2019s\u201d as signifying that restaurant rather than just being a family name.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Plaintiff presented no evidence of customer surveys and the testimony of only one customer. That customer was not totally disinterested because he acknowledged that he sells insurance to James Yocono and his wife. He testified, however, that he had never met them because he conducted business with them only over the telephone. When he saw the signs at defendant\u2019s restaurant identifying it as \u201cNunzie Yocono\u2019s Italian Restaurant,\u201d he \u201cjust assumed that it was just an expansion.\u201d He learned differently when, while speaking to James Yocono\u2019s wife over the telephone about insurance, he congratulated her on the new restaurant. His testimony demonstrated that, at least for him, the name \u201cYocono\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning identifying the West Exchange Street restaurant. Upon seeing the new signs outside defendant\u2019s restaurant, his reaction was not that someone named Yocono had opened a restaurant; his reaction was that the restaurant on West Exchange Street had expanded to a new location.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The evidence plaintiff presented was sufficient to establish, by clear and convincing proof, that the name \u201cYocono\u2019s\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court\u2019s finding that he intentionally appropriated plaintiffs reputation was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In effect, he has argued that the trial court should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>accepted his son\u2019s testimony that he changed the name of the restaurant only as a birthday surprise and not as an attempt to appropriate Yocono\u2019s goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u201c \u2018[A] reviewing court can reverse a judgment upon an assignment of error involving the weight of the evidence only when the verdict is so manifestly contrary to the natural and reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence as to produce a result in complete violation of substantial justice * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royer v. C.R. Coblentz Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1977), 51 Ohio App.2d 17, 20, 5 O.O.3d 138, 140, 365 N.E.2d 889, 892, quoting <em>Jacobs v. Benedict </em>(1973), 39 Ohio App.2d 141, 144, 68 O.O.2d 343, 345, 316 N.E.2d 898, 901. The trial court\u2019s finding that defendant changed the name of his restaurant in an attempt to appropriate plaintiffs goodwill was not a violation of substantial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Defendant previously sold his stock in plaintiff, thereby giving up his right to participate in the goodwill that had been built in the name \u2018Yocono.\u201d He operated his own restaurant under a different name for five years before the name was changed, allegedly for the sole purpose of providing him a birthday surprise. Not only was the name changed, the signs that were posted displaying the new name appeared calculated to emphasize the word \u2018Yocono\u2019s,\u201d and the menus were changed, both in appearance and in content, to be more like those in use at plaintiffs restaurant. When plaintiff, through its lawyer, contacted defendant and expressed its concern regarding confusion it said was being caused by defendant\u2019s restaurant\u2019s new name, defendant changed his signs to remove some of the emphasis that had been placed on the word \u201cYocono,\u201d but he did not abandon his use of that word. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the change of defendant\u2019s restaurant\u2019s name was more than just a birthday surprise was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly awarded plaintiff attorney fees. Specifically, he has argued that plaintiff failed to \u201cprovide an expert to support its position,\u201d and there was no evidence supportive of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant had acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">R.C. 4165.03 specifically provides that an award of attorney fees may be assessed against a defendant for violation of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act \u201cif the court finds that the defendant has willfully engaged in the trade practice knowing it to be deceptive.\u201d As discussed above in regard to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant intentionally appropriated plaintiffs reputation was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence before the trial court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>defendant willfully engaged in the trade practice at issue \u201cknowing it to be deceptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Further, plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to establish the amount of fees awarded by the trial court, $8,221.50. In determining the amount a party is entitled to recover as allowable fees, a court must assess \u201c(1) the time and labor involved in maintaining [the] litigation, (2) the novelty, complexity, and difficulty of the questions involved, (3) the professional skill required to perform the necessary legal services, (4) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys, and (5) the miscellaneous expenses of [the] litigation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Montrie Nursing Home, Inc. v. Creasy </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 124, 128, 5 OBR 258, 262, 449 N.E.2d 763, 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Defendant produced an attorney who provided his opinion of what he considered a reasonable hourly rate in a deceptive trade practices case in view of the complexity of the issues and the degree of skill necessary to deal with those issues. He testified regarding the reputation of the law firm that represented plaintiff and about the fact that cases in which preliminary injunctive relief is sought, as it was in this case, may involve some degree of urgency.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Although, as discussed below in connection with plaintiffs first assignment of error, the records plaintiff presented in support of its claim for attorney fees were poorly kept, they were sufficient, when coupled with the trial court\u2019s opportunity to observe plaintiffs attorneys during trial, to support the amount awarded, roughly one-third the amount plaintiff had sought. There was sufficient evidence before the trial court for it to assess the amount of attorney fees to which plaintiff was entitled. Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of error is that the trial court incorrectly calculated the amount of attorney fees it was entitled to recover from defendant. As noted previously, the trial court awarded plaintiff attorney fees of $8,221.50. It had sought fees, however, totalling $24,490.10, the amount one of its employees testified it actually paid the law firm that had represented it.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The trial court awarded plaintiff less than it sought because (1) it calculated the amount to which plaintiff was entitled based upon an hourly rate of $125 rather than the $175 plaintiff\u2019s attorneys actually charged; (2) there were a number of errors in the bills paid by plaintiff; and (3) it determined that plaintiff was not entitled to recover attorney fees for time spent by its attorneys in pursuing part of the relief it had sought. Plaintiff has argued that the reduction was the result of \u201cmathematical errors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Plaintiffs own expert testified that a standard fee for the type of services provided by plaintiffs attorneys would have been within a range between $125 and $150 per hour as opposed to the $175 per hour actually charged by plaintiffs attorneys. The trial court had an opportunity to observe the quality of representation provided by plaintiffs attorneys and, among other things, to assess their efficiency. It did not abuse its discretion by determining that plaintiff should be entitled to recover fees based on an hourly rate of $125 rather than the higher amount its attorneys actually charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Plaintiff supported its claim for attorney fees with typed invoices from the law firm that represented it. Those invoices included neither an hourly rate nor the number of hours spent providing the billed services. Rather, they provided only a brief synopsis of claimed services provided, a date upon which those claimed services were allegedly provided, and a total monetary amount claimed as due. Plaintiff failed to provide any back-up materials for the invoices that would have assisted the trial court in evaluating them. Rather, plaintiffs attorneys annotated the invoices in pencil in an attempt to indicate the number of hours spent providing the services listed on each. When the written hourly amounts were multiplied by the $175 hourly rate the attorneys said they charged plaintiff, however, the resulting amounts did not match the totals billed on the invoices. In some instances, it appeared that plaintiff was overbilled, and, in some instances, it appeared that plaintiff was underbilled. The trial court concluded that plaintiff was overbilled for a total of 12.2 hours and underbilled for a total of 10.1 hours. The trial court added those two amounts together and found that the resulting 22.3 hours represented nineteen percent of the total number of hours for which plaintiff sought recovery, a number it set at 116 hours. The source of the number 116 is unclear from the record before this court. Based upon its calculation, the trial court reduced the amount to which plaintiff would have otherwise been entitled by nineteen percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The trial court\u2019s reduction based upon the overbilling and underbilling was not a model of mathematical clarity. If 116 hours represented the hours actually paid for by plaintiff, they would not have included the 10.1 hours for which it was underbilled and, mathematically, those hours should not have been deducted. As noted above, however, the source of the number 116 is unclear from the record before this court. Accordingly, this court cannot determine whether the trial court\u2019s reduction was in fact tainted by a mathematical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The trial court noted that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 records regarding the fees they charged plaintiff were deficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201cA significant amount of the Plaintiffs own hours, some 19%, of the 116 hours is vague and unclear and represents inaccuracies] or inconsistencies in the bookkeeping records maintained by Plaintiffs counsel. It is concluded that while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Plaintiffs counsel in [their] bookkeeping efforts did not undertake such inconsistencies with any design towards cheating, the fact remains that the bookkeeping records are at best grossly [imprecise], inconsistent, and otherwise poorly done and again would require the trier of fact to engage in gross speculation and conjecture about what was really intended by the disparity between the amount the client actually paid when the invoice was made and the subsequent hours calculated by Plaintiffs counsel when [they] sought to recompile the hours.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The burden was upon plaintiff to prove the amount of attorney fees to which it was entitled. Although the trial court\u2019s method of reducing the amount it awarded based upon the deficiencies in plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 billing records may not have been a model of mathematical clarity, any errors involved therein appear to have been a result of plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 billing deficiencies. This court cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in reducing the amount of fees to which plaintiff was entitled by nineteen percent based upon those deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Finally, the trial court reduced the amount of attorney fees to which it found plaintiff entitled because it determined that plaintiff had sought relief in addition to that to which it was entitled pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4165. Specifically, defendant had registered the name \u201cNunzie Yocono\u2019s Italian Restaurant\u201d as a trade name with the Ohio Secretary of State and plaintiff sought an order from the trial court to have that registration cancelled. The trial court determined that the attempt to cancel the trademark registration constituted thirty percent of the litigation. As a result, it reduced the amount of attorney fees to which it found plaintiff would have otherwise been entitled by thirty percent. This court cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in so reducing its award of attorney fees to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of attorney fees it awarded plaintiff. Accordingly, plaintiffs first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Plaintiffs second assignment of error is that the injunction entered by the trial court was inadequate, both because it covered too small a geographic area and because it was ambiguous. The injunction entered by the trial court was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">\u201cPlaintiff should have a permanent injunction awarded under 4165.03 baring Nunzie Yocono or any person or entity control[ing] or operating his business from using the name Yocono in any fashion, any advertisement, trade dress, signage and/or menus or business cards or other similar items associated with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Defendant\u2019s operation of his restaurant in Montrose or anywhere else within a 15-mile radius of the junction of State Route 18 (West Market Street) and the Akron City/Fairlawn border. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">A trial court\u2019s framing of an injunction will be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ramsey v. Edgepark, Inc. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 99, 583 N.E.2d 443. A trial court has not abused its discretion unless its ruling is \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142. Plaintiff has argued that, rather than the area covered by the injunction being limited to a fifteen-mile radius of the junction of State Route 18 and the Akron/Fairlawn border, it should have extended to all of Summit County and \u201cthe surrounding counties.\u201d Plaintiff, however, did not present clear and convincing evidence that the secondary meaning of the word \u2018Yocono\u201d extended to surrounding counties or, for that matter, throughout Summit County. Accordingly, this court cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting the geographic coverage of the injunction it entered to a fifteen-mile radius of the junction of State Route 18 and the Akron/Fairlawn border.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Plaintiff has also argued that the trial court\u2019s injunction was inadequate because it was ambiguous. Civ.R. 65(D) provides that an order granting an injunction must be specific:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cEvery order granting an injunction * * * shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">An injunction should be written in order that \u201can ordinary person reading the court\u2019s order should be able to ascertain from the document itself exactly what conduct is proscribed.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. of Cincinnati, Inc. v. Project Jericho </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 56, 60, 556 N.E.2d 157, 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Plaintiff has argued that the trial court\u2019s injunction was defective because \u201cthe exact geographical scope of the proposed injunction requires reference to a map, whereupon the defined circle may be drawn.\u201d Civ.R. 65(D)\u2019s prohibition of reference to other documents, however, relates only to the description of the acts prohibited, not to the geographic area in which those acts are prohibited. Any injunction of limited geographic scope must rely upon imaginary lines. In order to determine where those imaginary lines fall, it will always be necessary to consult a map. This is no more true for an injunction covering a circle with a fifteen-mile radius from a specific point than it would be for one covering Summit and the surrounding counties. Both would utilize imaginary lines. The only difference is that the trial court used an imaginary line that it established; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s suggested injunction would use imaginary lines established at the time the counties at issue came into existence. In either instance, it would be necessary to consult a map to determine the exact areas covered by the injunction. The trial court\u2019s injunction is not inadequate because of its geographic scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Plaintiff has also argued that the trial court\u2019s injunction is ambiguous because it is unclear whether defendant is prohibited from using the word \u201cYocono\u201d only in connection with a restaurant that is itself located within the geographic area of the injunction, or whether he is prohibited from using the word \u201cYocono\u201d within the geographic area of the injunction in connection with a restaurant regardless of where that restaurant is located. This court agrees that the trial- court\u2019s injunction is unclear. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained in part, and this matter will be remanded to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas for the limited purpose of permitting it to redraft its injunction to make it clear whether defendant is prohibited from using the word \u201cYocono\u201d within the area covered by the injunction to promote a restaurant located outside that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Defendant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. Plaintiff\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled and its second assignment of error is sustained in part. This matter is remanded to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas for the limited purpose of permitting it to redraft its injunction to make it clear whether defendant is prohibited from using the word \u201cYocono\u201d within the area covered by the injunction to promote a restaurant located outside that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-9\">Cook, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b55-10\">Baird, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b55-11\">Baird, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Since I believe that the injunction clearly applies, and is limited to, the use anywhere of the name in connection with the present restaurant, or one within the delineated territory, I do not believe that the judgment needs any clarification. Accordingly, while I concur in the balance of the opinion, I dissent from the remand for clarification.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
