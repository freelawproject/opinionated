(\u201cReading\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">On July 28, 1986, appellant was hired by Reading as a general accountant. Prior to being hired, appellant completed and signed an employment application that stated in part: \u201cI understand and agree that my employment is for no definite period and may, regardless of the date of payment of my wages and salary, be terminated at any time without any previous notice.\u201d Appellant also received a copy of Reading\u2019s Employee Handbook of Company Policy/Practices/Benefits (\u201cemployee handbook\u201d), which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">\u201cDismissal is the sternest form of discipline and generally is resorted to only in serious cases or when the other efforts fail to correct the conduct of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">\u201cThere are, however, certain causes that call for dismissal without prior warning. Among typical causes of such action are:</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">\u00ab * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-12\">\u201c4. Possession or use of illicit drugs or narcotics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">In 1992, Reading decided to implement a formal drug/alcohol screening policy (\u201cpolicy\u201d). In preparation for the implementation of the policy, all Reading personnel were invited to a drug awareness seminar. In addition, a book entitled \u201cAmericans for a Drug Free America,\u201d containing substance abuse information, was mailed by Reading to each employee\u2019s home before the plan went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">On September 8, 1992, during a meeting of all employees, Reading formally announced the introduction of its policy, which was to take effect on October 15, 1992. During that meeting, employees were encouraged to seek assistance or counseling if they were currently using illicit drugs. Employees were also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>informed that there would be no disciplinary action taken against them if they sought counseling before they were tested. Reading offered to pay for the counseling of any person who wanted or needed it. At no time did appellant request counseling or assistance. Appellant received a copy of Reading\u2019s policy, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">\n<em>\u201cPURPOSE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\"><em>a </em>\u2021 \u2021 sH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\"><em>\u201cReading Rock will not employ anyone who screens \u2018positive\u2019for illegal drugs </em>* * *.

The test was administered by Mercy Business Connection/Mercy Medi-Center. The urine specimens were analyzed by Roche Medical Laboratories. Fourteen employees, including appellant, tested positive for illicit drugs. Prior to the testing, Reading had made a corporate decision that any employee who tested positive would be discharged. Appellant was discharged on December 15, 1992. The other thirteen employees were discharged as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">On May 28, 1993, appellant filed suit alleging several claims against Reading in the trial court. On December 13, 1993, appellant\u2019s deposition was taken. During her deposition, appellant admitted smoking marijuana. Appellant testified that during the five-year period before she was tested in 1992, she would smoke marijuana on the average of ten times a month. Appellant further testified that the last time she smoked marijuana before Reading\u2019s random drug test was the weekend before October 15,1992. Appellant testified that she smoked marijuana on six or seven occasions during the course of that weekend. On March 30,1994, Reading filed a motion for summary judgment. On April 25,1994, appellant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On May 25, 1994, the trial court granted Reading\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing all of appellant\u2019s claims. An amended order sustaining Reading\u2019s motion for summary judgment (correcting a typographical error) was entered on June 3, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Appellant timely filed this appeal and raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that the drug policy did not create a contract right altering Seta\u2019s status as an employee-at-will and that she was terminated in violation of such a contract right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that Seta did not rely to her detriment upon the drug policy by altering her off-premises, off-duty activities to accord with the drug policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\u201cAssignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that Seta\u2019s off-premises, off-duty activities were not entitled to protection from unwarranted intrusion the [sic] through urinalysis screeing [sic] under the drug policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that Reading Rock\u2019s disclosure of Seta\u2019s \u2018positive\u2019 test for cannaboids in the drug testing conducted on December 3, 1992, to Gramza constitutes an unwarranted invasion of Seta\u2019s privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in overruling Seta\u2019s motion to strike the affidavit of James T. Lutz, M.D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Because appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error concern appellant\u2019s at-will employment status, we will consider appellant\u2019s first two assignments of error together. In these assignments of error, appellant contends that Reading\u2019s adoption of its policy and appellant\u2019s reliance on the policy altered her at-will employment status. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">Under Ohio law, an employment relationship, absent an agreement to the contrary, is regarded as an employment at will which can be terminated at any time by the employer. <em>Fawcett v. G.C. Murphy &amp; Co. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 245, 75 O.O.2d 291, 348 N.E.2d 144. Ohio courts have, however, recognized two exceptions to the employment-at-will doctrine. Employee handbooks, company policy, and oral representations may give rise to implied contractual provisions that alter the terms of an oral at-will employment relationship. <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 100, 104, 19 OBR 261, 264-265, 483 N.E.2d 150, 154. An employer\u2019s right to discharge an employee may also be limited by representations or promises made to the employee which fall within the doctrine of promissory estoppel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Under her first assignment of error, appellant argues that Reading\u2019s policy, which she describes as being an entirely separate document from the employee handbook and giving rise to entirely separate employment rights, creates an implied contract of employment. Appellant first contends that the policy, which outlines disciplinary rules and procedures, implicitly promised that employees who obeyed the policy\u2019s alcohol and illegal drug work rules would retain their employment. Appellant further contends that her continued employment after the policy went into effect constituted the necessary consideration to support an employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">Under the implied contract exception to employment at will, the provisions of an employee handbook will alter the terms of an at-will employment relationship only if the employer and the employee have agreed to create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>contract from the writing. <em>Tohline v. Cent. Trust Co. </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 280, 282, 549 N.E.2d 1223, 1226-1227. Both parties to an employment-at-will agreement must expressly agree to modify the employment relationship. <em>Humphreys v. Bellaire Corp. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1991), 764 F.Supp. 489, 493. In the absence of mutual assent, a handbook is simply a unilateral statement of rules and policies that creates no obligations or rights. <em>Tohline, supra, </em>48 Ohio App.3d at 282, 549 N.E.2d at 1226-1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Upon review of the record, we find that Reading\u2019s policy was simply an elaboration and the implementation of Reading\u2019s employee handbook, which expressly lists the use of illicit drugs as a cause for dismissal without prior warning. First, the existence of Reading\u2019s policy in and of itself does not alter the employment-at-will relationship. Such a system of discipline does not give the employee a contract right to remain employed unless the employee disobeys the rules: both employer and employee retain the right to terminate the employment for any or no reason. See <em>Peters v. Mansfield Screw Mach. Prod. Co. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 197, 200-201, 596 N.E.2d 1071, 1073-1074. Second, the provision in Reading\u2019s policy that \u201cthe Company reserves the right to modify this policy at any time\u201d implies that the disciplinary rules and procedures are not perpetual, but subject to whatever revision and amendment Reading deems appropriate. Given such unpredictability, it seems incongruous that Reading\u2019s policy could provide the basis for an implied contract of employment. See <em>Pyle v. Ledex, Inc. </em>(1988), 49 Ohio App.3d 139, 145, 551 N.E.2d 205, 211. Finally, appellant\u2019s continued employment after the policy went into effect did not alter her at-will status. There is no evidence of new or additional consideration given by appellant after Reading\u2019s adoption of the policy. The consideration for appellant\u2019s continued employment was the paychecks she received. We therefore find that Reading\u2019s policy did not give rise to an implied contract of employment. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Under her second assignment of error, appellant argues that summary judgment should not have been granted on her promissory estoppel claim. Appellant claims that Reading\u2019s policy contained the promise that no employee would be terminated except in strict compliance with the policy terms which, according to appellant, do not include off-work drug activities as a cause for discharge, and that she detrimentally relied on such promise by stopping the use of drugs after the policy went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Promissory estoppel applies to at-will employment agreements if the employer should have reasonably expected the employee to rely on its representations or promises, and if the expected action or forbearance actually resulted and was detrimental to the employee. <em>Mers, supra, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus. We find that promissory estoppel does not apply in the case at bar. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>First, an employer\u2019s threat to discharge an employee for violating disciplinary rules cannot be construed as a promise of job security if the rules are observed. Simply obeying the rules does not guarantee continued employment. In addition, the fact that certain acts are identified in Reading\u2019s policy as conduct that might lead to discharge does not indicate that these acts are the exclusive permissible grounds for discharge, especially in light of the language that \u201cReading Rock will not employ anyone who screens \u2018positive\u2019 for illegal drugs * * Second, we fail to see how appellant\u2019s reliance on the policy and her stopping the use of drugs was detrimental to her. As the trial court appropriately put it, \u201csuch forbearance did not act to her detriment, but to her benefit. It not only contributed to her good health, but also could very well have kept her out of jail * * *.\u201d Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Because appellant\u2019s third and fourth assignments of error concern invasion of privacy, we will consider these two assignments of error together. In these assignments of error, appellant contends that Reading violated her right to privacy on two occasions. The Supreme Court of Ohio first recognized a cause of action for invasion of privacy in <em>Housh v. Peth </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 35, 59 O.O. 60, 133 N.E.2d 340, paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201cAn actionable invasion of the right of privacy is the unwarranted appropriation or exploitation of one\u2019s personality, the publicizing of one\u2019s private affairs with which the public has no legitimate concern, or the wrongful intrusion into one\u2019s private activities in such a manner as to outrage or cause mental suffering, shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Under her third assignment of error, appellant argues that Reading\u2019s mandatory drug testing constituted an invasion of privacy. Appellant also argues that her dismissal was in violation of public policy protecting that right to privacy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">We first find that Reading\u2019s mandatory drug testing did not constitute an invasion of privacy. In <em>Groves v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1991), 70 Ohio App.3d 656, 591 N.E.2d 875, the Auglaize County Court of Appeals, dealing with a similar claim of invasion of privacy as a result of a drug test, held that drug testing by employers did not constitute an actionable invasion of an employee\u2019s right to privacy. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 591 N.E.2d at 878. In so ruling, the court of appeals relied on 62A American Jurisprudence 2d (1990) 683, Privacy, Section 61, which provides that \u201c[t]he courts appear to be supportive of employers\u2019 attempts to create a safe working environment by holding that drug-testing does not constitute an invasion of the employees\u2019 common law right to privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The logic of that statement appeals to us. Appellant contends, however, that the case at bar is governed by <em>Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Assn. </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 602, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 103 L.Ed.2d 639. Appellant cites <em>Skinner </em>for the proposition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>employer drag testing must pass a balancing test in which the employer\u2019s interest in its drug policy must be weighed against the employees\u2019 privacy concerns. <em>Skinner, </em>however, involved a Fourth Amendment violation claim. We therefore hold that the reasoning and the holding of <em>Skinner </em>are not applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We further find that appellant\u2019s discharge did not violate public policy. \u201cPublic policy warrants an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine when an employee is discharged or disciplined for a reason which is prohibited by statute * * <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, paragraph one of the syllabus. Public policy may also warrant an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine when the discharge is \u201cof equally serious import as the violation of a statute.\u201d <em>Shaffer v. Frontrunner, Inc. </em>(1990), 57 Ohio App.3d 18, 566 N.E.2d 193, paragraph two of the syllabus. In the case at bar, appellant\u2019s discharge did not violate any statute. Nor can we say that a discharge for screening positive for illegal drugs is \u201cof equally serious import as the violation of a statute,\u201d especially when appellant had adequate notice from the inception of her employment of Reading\u2019s stance against the use or possession of illegal drugs. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Under her fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that Reading\u2019s disclosure to Janet Gramza, a former employee of Reading and a friend of appellant, of appellant\u2019s discharge for failing a drug test constituted an invasion of privacy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">, Appellant\u2019s claim falls within <em>Housh\u2019s </em>second theory of invasion of privacy, \u201cthe publicizing of one\u2019s private affairs with which the public has no legitimate concern,\u201d also called the \u201cpublicity\u201d tort. In order for appellant to state a claim for which relief can be granted under this cause of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">\u201c(1) there must be publicity, <em>i.e., </em>the disclosure must be of a public nature, not private; (2) the facts disclosed must be those concerning the private life of an individual, not his public life; (3) the matter publicized must be one which would be highly offensive and objectionable to a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities; (4) the publication must have been made intentionally, not negligently; and (5) the matter publicized must not be a legitimate concern to the public.\u201d <em>Killilea v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 163, 27 OBR 196, 499 N.E.2d 1291, syllabus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-9\">\u201cPublicity,\u201d as used in the first prong, means \u201ccommunicating the matter to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge as opposed to \u2018publica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tion\u2019 [as used in defamation cases and] meaning any communication by the defendant to a third person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 499 N.E.2d at 1294.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Gramza stated in her affidavit that one week after appellant\u2019s discharge, she (Gramza) called Reading and asked to speak with appellant. The Reading telephone receptionist, who was aware that Gramza was a friend of appellant, informed Gramza that appellant had been discharged following a drug test. Gramza\u2019s affidavit states that the entire telephone conversation lasted no more than fifteen seconds. The receptionist\u2019s disclosure to one single person, Gramza, hardly fits the definition of publicity as stated in <em>Killilea. </em>We therefore .find that Reading\u2019s disclosure of appellant\u2019s discharge to Gramza did not constitute an invasion of privacy. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Under her fifth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in overruling her motions to strike the affidavits of James T. Lutz, M.D. Dr. Lutz is a medical doctor authorized to practice medicine in the state of Ohio and the medical director of Mercy Business Connection (\u201cMercy\u201d), which administered the drug testing of Reading\u2019s employees. On March 30, 1994, Reading filed Dr. Lutz\u2019s affidavit in support of its motion for summary judgment. On April 29, 1994, Reading filed a second affidavit by Dr. Lutz. Appellant contends that the affidavits fail to show that Dr. Lutz (1) had firsthand knowledge of the procedures followed by Mercy or by Roche Medical Laboratories with regard to appellant\u2019s urine specimen, and (2) was competent to testify on this matter pursuant to Civ.R. 56(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Civ.R. 56(E) sets forth the requirements for summary judgment affidavits and states that such affidavits \u201cshall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth facts as would be admissible in evidence and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Upon a review of the challenged affidavits, we find that they meet the requirements set forth in Civ.R. 56(E). We first find that Dr. Lutz\u2019s affidavits were based upon his personal knowledge. While Dr. Lutz did not witness firsthand the procedure followed with specific regard to appellant\u2019s specimen, Dr. Lutz manages and oversees the drug-screening program performed by Mercy for employers and has personally reviewed the individual drug-screening results of appellant. Dr. Lutz\u2019s opinion was based upon this information. We further find that Dr. Lutz was competent to testify. The affidavits identify both Dr. Lutz and his relationship to Reading through his position of medical director of Mercy, which administered the drug testing of Reading\u2019s employees. The affidavits further identify the basis of his knowledge of the facts to which he attested. Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>Jones, P.J., and William W.
