This Court has implicitly held that \u00a7 3B1.3 applies to embezzlement convictions. <em>See United States v. Ehrlich, </em>902 F.2d 327, 330-31 (5th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1069, 111 S.Ct. 788, 112 L.Ed.2d 851 (1991) (embezzlement conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656); <em>see also United States v. Christiansen, </em>958 F.2d 285, 287-88 (9th Cir.1992) (although embezzlement includes an element of breach of trust, the abuse of trust enhancement requires more culpable conduct than breach of trust and therefore \u00a7 3B1.3 applies); <em>United States v. Milligan, </em>958 F.2d 345, 347 (11th Cir.1992) (same); <em>United States v. Georgiadis, </em>933 F.2d 1219, 1225 (3d Cir.1991) (abuse of trust as defined by \u00a7 3B1.3 is not an element of embezzlement already taken into account under \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-23\">The application of \u00a7 3B1.3 is a sophisticated factual determination reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Ehrlich, </em>902 F.2d at 330. The enhancement encompasses two factors: (1) whether the defendant occupies a position of trust and (2) whether the defendant abused her position in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>941 F.2d 1300, 1304 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 648, 116 L.Ed.2d 665 (1991). To deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>mine whether the position of trust \u201csignificantly facilitated\u201d the commission of the offense, the court must decide whether the defendant occupied a superior position, relative to all people in a position to commit the offense, as a result of her job. <em>Id. </em>at 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The record establishes that Fisher\u2019s duties and responsibilities as head cashier went significantly beyond the duties of an ordinary bank teller. Her job was classified as a \u201cposition of trust;\u201d she supervised one cashier; she had the authority to get money out of the vault, requisition money, and cheek money; and she was subject only to monthly spot-checks. Significantly, after initially conducting several successful spot-checks, Fisher\u2019s supervisor stopped conducting the checks because she \u201ctrusted\u201d her, and Fisher did not begin embezzling until October, eight or nine months after she was promoted. The district court specifically determined that Fisher did not begin embezzling until she had learned the level of supervision and the level of reconciliation to which she was subject. The district court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous. <em>See Brown, </em>941 F.2d at 1304-05; <em>Ehrlich, </em>902 F.2d at 328, 330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
