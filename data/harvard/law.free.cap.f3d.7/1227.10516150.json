We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-15\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-16\">Lamaze, a resident of France, agreed to invest in New Orleans real estate with his friend, Vergne. They purchased a property on Esplanade Avenue. Each was to contribute $50,000 towards the purchase price; Lamaze, however, advanced Vergne\u2019s share because the latter lacked the necessary funds. It was agreed that Vergne would oversee the rehabilitation and rental of the property. This task apparently proved to be more formidable and costly than was foreseen. Additional funds were borrowed from financial institutions, including First National Bank of Commerce (FNBC). Lamaze advanced another $135,000 through Arcuda, Inc., a corporation which he had established for such purposes, and gave his personal guaranty on the FNBC loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-17\">When the loan became delinquent, FNBC initiated foreclosure proceedings and sued Lamaze on the guaranty. Lamaze counterclaimed against Vergne, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>an accounting and damages for breach of fiduciary duties. The property was sold and the proceeds were used to settle with FNBC. The personal claims against Lamaze were withdrawn. Lamaze tried his counterclaim against Vergne to a jury and recovered the original $50,000 loan (the sum advanced on the purchase price) and $73,600 in damages for breach of obligation. Vergne timely appealed the denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-18\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-19\">Vergne assigns two points of error. He maintains that Lamaze\u2019s claim for repayment of the $50,000 loan has prescribed and that Lamaze is not entitled to those funds advanced through Arcuda, Inc., a separate legal entity. Neither contention has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-20\">After receipt of the $100,000 from Lamaze in November 1981, Vergne executed a promissory note in the amount of $50,000. The note declares that it is payable upon either the sale of the Esplanade property or the refinancing thereof with a first mortgage of $100,000 or more. Lamaze, however, testified that he advanced Vergne\u2019s share of the purchase price with the understanding that he would be repaid within two or three months. The jury believed Lamaze and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>found that the loan became due in April 1982. Seizing on this finding, Vergne insists that Lamaze\u2019s November 1990 suit on the loan is time-barred by the five-year prescriptive period for promissory notes set forth in Louisiana Civil Code article 3498.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This argument misapprehends the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">That Vergne\u2019s note may have prescribed before Lamaze filed his claim did not affect the underlying obligation. The debt to Lamaze was not extinguished by the note.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Louisiana Supreme Court recently explained, a note or cheek acknowledging a debt will be deemed an implicit novation of the original obligation and the original prescriptive period will be replaced with the limitations period for notes and checks only if <em>\u201cthis interpretation is favorable to the creditor.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>When it is not, as here, the original prescriptive period prevails. \u201cThus, the appropriate prescriptive period following an acknowledgment is the longer of either the original prescriptive period or that applicable to a substituted obligation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The longer period in the case at bar is that applicable to the original debt in the posture established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">A loan between parties dealing at arm\u2019s length in a mercantile context is subject to a three-year prescriptive period.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A loan from one partner to another for partnership purposes, however, is governed by the 10-year prescriptive period for personal actions provided by Civil Code article 3499.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Partners deal with each other in an ongoing relationship. They routinely document and retain records of their dealings during the life of the partnership and accomplish settlement thereafter. These continuing circumstances warrant the allowance of more time for the assertion of claims arising from the partnership relationship than ordinarily would be accorded claims on debts arising in the course of transient commercial encounters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, even if prescription began to run in April 1982, the date which the jury found that the loan became due,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lamaze\u2019s 1990 claim was timely asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-13\">Vergne\u2019s second objection is equally unavailing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The $73,600 award represented damages for breach of fiduciary duty. Vergne owed that duty to the partnership and to Lamaze, his partner, not to Arcuda.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lamaze therefore was the proper plaintiff. The funds that Lamaze tranferred through Arcuda resulted in damages that he incurred by virtue of the breach,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but the claim was not for return of the funds <em>per se; </em>it was for his monetary loss. The fact that his monies were transferred through Arcuda is of no significance in the factual setting of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">.
