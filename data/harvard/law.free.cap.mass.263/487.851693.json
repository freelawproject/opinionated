The plaintiff testified that they \u201cseemed quite greasy to her\u201d; that she also observed a scratch or mark over the edge of the step where she slipped. A brother of the defendant, who worked in the store, testified that \u201che noticed plenty of grease on the sidewalk in front of the premises every day of the week\u201d; that customers were accustomed to go from the store to the office at the top of the steps to pay bills, and to see his brother when he was in the office. There was other evidence that there was grease on the floor; that beef, pork and poultry were carried in and through the store and poultry cleaned there.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">From this evidence it could be reasonably inferred that grease had been tracked from the store and sidewalk onto the stairs, rendering them slippery and unsafe to travel over. <em>Blease </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>232 Mass. 165. <em>Judson </em>v. <em>American Railway Express Co. </em>242 Mass. 269. It could have been found that the condition complained of had existed for such a period of time as to charge the defendant with liability. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>200 Mass. 445. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Middlesex &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>237 Mass. 291, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">It is not argued that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care; that question was for the jury independently of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
