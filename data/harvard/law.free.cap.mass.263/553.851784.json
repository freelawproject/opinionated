The motion of the door was that usual to opening doors, and would not justify an inference of want of repair or careless handling.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The judge was not in error in directing a verdict for the defendants. The accident was a mishap of travel not due to negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
