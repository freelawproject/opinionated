There was ample evidence of. the negligence of the defendant. <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>231 Mass. 243. <em>Kaminski </em>v. <em>Fournier, </em>235 Mass. 51. <em>Pawloski </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>253 Mass. 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">It could not have been ruled as matter of law that the burden of showing the contributory negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, which rested upon the defendant, had been sustained. <em>Gauthier </em>v. <em>Quick, </em>250 Mass. 258. <em>Davicki </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>250 Mass. 379. <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>250 Mass. 578. <em>Gaulin </em>v. <em>Yagoobian, </em>261 Mass. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">This is one of the cases where the presumption established by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, aids the plaintiff. <em>Mercier </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 397, 403, 404. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate might have relied to some extent on the expectation that the defendant would not run into him. The case is distinguishable from cases like <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>194 Mass. 242, <em>Will </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>247 Mass. 250, <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>250 Mass. 288, <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>250 Mass. 476, where the circumstances were such as to require the inference of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
