The evidence also warranted the special finding by the jury that the defendant signed a receipt in terms substantially as follows: \u201cReceived of Harry 0. Fisk Five hundred dollars ($500.) in part payment for lumber, farm and personal property bought by him off me at the auction or otherwise on November 19, 1919, as part purchase price of the farm and lumber for Seventy-one hundred dollars ($7100.) known as Fisk Farm as per auction bill. A mortgage to be taken back for one half the purchase price of farm and timber.\u201d The defendant' denied that he gave any receipt whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Arthur Fisk, a brother of both the plaintiff and defendant, and his wife, witnesses for the plaintiff, testified, \u201cthat they had seen the receipt claimed to have been given by the defendant to the plaintiff, about four weeks after the auction sale and remembered the substance thereof. On cross-examination they stated that the relations between them and the defendant and his family had always been friendly up to the time they were testifying and that there had been no trouble between them.\u201d The plaintiff testified under cross-examination that the only reason suit had not been brought earlier was because of the fact that he did not wish to bring suit while his mother was living, and that suit was brought about six months after his mother\u2019s decease.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">After the above testimony from Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Fisk had been introduced, the defendant, on the stand, was asked by his counsel: \u201cA short time after the death of your mother did anything occur which caused a change in your relationship between you and your wife, and Arthur and his wife?\u201d On objection the question was excluded, and the defendant\u2019s counsel offered \u201cto show by this witness that following the mother\u2019s death her will was filed which gave most of the property to this witness and a small amount to Harry and to Arthur; that Harry and Arthur entered into a contest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>will, and at the hearing on the allowance of the will both Arthur and his wife testified against the allowance of the will.\u201d The question was excluded subject to the exception of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"A5i\">After the testimony of the plaintiff as to his reason for not bringing the action earlier, the defendant\u2019s wife, called by the defendant,'was asked on direct examination the following question: \u201cAfter Grandmother Fisk died was there any trouble between your husband (the defendant) and Harry (the plaintiff) which caused a changed relationship between the two families?\u201d The question was excluded subject to the exception of the defendant, as was the following offer of proof: \u201cI offer to show that after the decease of Mother Fisk and upon the filing of her will which left practically every thing to Fred and little to Harry, a dispute arose. Harry contested the will, and after that dispute arose the first action for this cause was brought, and up to the time of the dispute over the will, the relationships between the two famihes had been as friendly as prior to the auction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The only exceptions saved by the defendant that are presented and argued on his brief are such as concern the offers of proof, which, the defendant alleges, would tend to show bias on the part of the plaintiff, his brother Arthur and Arthur\u2019s wife. All other exceptions taken at the trial are deemed to be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">It is elementary law that a witness in the discretion of the judge may be cross-examined as to collateral facts if they be of such a nature as to affect the credibility of that witness in a matter relevant to the issue on trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schaffner, </em>146 Mass. 512, 515. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Taunton Street Railway, </em>119 Mass. 91. It is also a general rule as to all collateral inquiries, whether relating to character or not, that the answers cannot be contradicted. \u201cIf a party cross-examines a witness upon a collateral matter, he must take the answer as it is given; he cannot contradict it, and thus r\u00e1ise an immaterial and foreign issue, of which the other party has no notice, and which he may not be prepared to meet.\u201d <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Kaiser, </em>149 Mass. 321, 322. In the case at bar the issues raised had no possible relation to the issues which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>were or might have been presented in the contest over the allowance of the will of the mother of the plaintiff and defendant. The evidence offered was within the discretion of the judge to receive or reject; and no error is perceived in his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
