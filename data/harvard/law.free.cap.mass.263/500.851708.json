He is, thus, forced to maintain that the evidence as matter of law established contributory negligence on Mrs. Sawyer\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">No good purpose is served by a statement of the testimony. There was contradiction. It is impossible for us to say that, as matter of law, the jury was bound by it to find the facts which the defendant relies on as proof that Mrs. Sawyer was careless. What she did, how she acted, whether she looked about with proper care or did not, can be determined only by knowing the amount of reliance to be placed upon the witnesses, and by appreciating properly the contribution of interrogating counsel and answering witness to the result. That is for a jury, not for judge or appellate tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">We agree with the trial j\u00fadge that the evidence did not, as matter of law, require a finding of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
