The appeal is signed \u201cBessie Hillson By Jennie Shapiro, Her mother and next friend.\u201d We assume that an appeal in this form is properly before us. See <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>256 Mass. 203. The divorce proceeding appears to have been properly served. Thereafter that court by order of Dolan, J., appointed one Joseph Samuels guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>ad litem </em>and investigator. It must be assumed that the person so appointed was a member of the bar. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 16; St. 1922, c. 532, \u00a7 6. A report signed by this person as \u201cGuardian ad Litem and Investigator\u201d was later filed of this tenor: \u201cAfter investigation of the above entitled matter, I find as a fact that the libellee was insane . . . , at the time of her marriage to the libellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">The appointment of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the libellee appears to have been regular and in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 15; c. 201, \u00a7 34. There is no reason why the same person may not rightly be appointed both guardian <em>ad litem </em>and investigator in a proceeding of this nature. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>represented the libellee. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>161 Mass. 315, 319. Having found facts which required his report to the court as above stated, there was no obligation that he thereafter contest the proceeding. No evidence is reported, and therefore all findings of fact warranting the action of the Probate Court must be presumed. No error of law is disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\n<em>Order denying the petition for revocation affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
