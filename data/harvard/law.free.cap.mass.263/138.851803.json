JThere was no evidence tending to show illegal sales of intoxicating liquor or unlawful traffic to and from the premises. The defendant offered testimony which, if believed, showed that he did not keep this liquor with intent to sell the same contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On this evidence with its permissible inferences a verdict of guilty of keeping intoxicating liquor with intent to sell the same contrary to law was warranted. The requested ruling for a verdict of not guilty was denied rightly. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahern, </em>228 Mass. 547. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozlowsky, </em>243 Mass. 538. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>258 Mass. 85.
