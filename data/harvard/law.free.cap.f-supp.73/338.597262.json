This beer was in imitation of beer manufactured in Budweis, an old city in Bohemia, which Conrad and plaintiff\u2019s predecessors' considered to be of a high quality. The beer was first put out as the product \u25a0 of Conrad and as such obtained a very considerable, although largely local, popularity. In 1883 Conrad gave the plaintiff a qualified right to put out this beer in the name of the plaintiff\u2019s company as then constituted, and later conveyed, by agreement in 1891, all his rights in the product, its trade marks and trade names.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">After the plaintiff acquired the right to put out \u201cBudweiser\u201d in it\u2019s own name, it advertised the product in numerous newspapers and magazines and otherwise in the United States, and as a result \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer soon became known and widely sold throughout this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-20\">In 1905 the defendant began the manufacture of a beer which it called \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d. In color it was an imitation of plaintiff\u2019s product, both beers being light yellow or strawcolored in similarity to those commonly brewed in Bohemia, and known in this country as \u201cPilsener\u201d beers. Before making this \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d the defendant had operated a brewery for a number of years. In putting out it\u2019s \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d, along with several other beers and malt liquors brewed by it, it\u2019s bottles were of a different color and form and had a different design on the labels than the bottles of \u201cBudweiser\u201d marketed by Anheuser-Busch.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-21\">Just why the DuBois Brewing Company used the term \u201cBudweiser\u201d in describing its new beer^seems reasonably obvious. It <em>it </em>alleged that the then president of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>pany, on a visit to Germany, had drank some of the beer brewed in Budweis, and considered it of high quality, and his opinion led to his naming the beer. It is quite possible that this allegation is true; but when it is remembered that the city of Budweis had only two breweries, one of medium size and the other small, and that only a very small amount of beer from Budweis had been imported into a narrow eastern seaboard; and that not one in ten thousand of the desired purchasers of the new beer had ever heard of the beer brewed in Budweis, but probably each one of them knew of the \u201cBudweiser\u201d made by Anheuser-Busch, one may be pardoned for more than a strong suspicion that 'the extensive advertising and quality of the Anheuser-Busch \u201cBudweiser\u201d were not ig-\u00ab nored in naming it. It is beyond dispute that the then president of the defendant and it\u2019s brewmaster had knowledge of the advertising, sales and consumption of Anheuser-Busch \u201cBudweiser\u201d prior to 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The defendant has not undertaken to deny the wide exploitation of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cBudweiser\u201d except as to degree, but denies the right to the use of the term as an exclusive trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">It asserts that the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d is geographic and descriptive and that no individual is entitled to use such a term for its exclusive use. This contention needs some qualification. If A and B were manufacturers in the City of X, A from prior use alone could not claim X as his trade mark as against B as his use would be geographic. In the instant case neither plaintiff nor defendant is a brewer of beer in Budweis, nor is either of them selling a beer that is descriptive of a product brewed only in Budweis and known as such to the world. Each of the parties herein has used the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d only as a trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The defendant further contends that Anheuser-Busch had no exclusive right to the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d in 1905 when it was first used by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">It is true that beer from Budweis had been brought into New York in small quantities from about the time Carl Conrad put his \u201cBudweiser\u201d on the market in 1876. What it was termed in Budweis does ne'e appear, but the importer termed it \u201cBudweiser\u201d, or beer made in Budweis. Other than this possibly contemporaneous use of the term Conrad and Anheuser-Busch had been considerably in advance of others who undertook to exploit it. At the present time all users of \u201cBudweiser\u201d as a trade name, other than the defendant, have been taken out of the picture by the plaintiff by means of legal actions, threats of legal actions or agreements. This was true in 1905 except as to the importer of \u201cBudweiser\u201d in New York and the Prospect Brewing Company of Philadelphia, which manufactured \u201cProspect Budweis Lager Beer\u201d and which continued until the Prohibition Act and was ended by it. Also may be excepted one William Wirtz who bottled a \u201cBudweiser Lager Beer\u201d in Newark. The period he was in operation is somewhat uncertain, but he may have operated as late as ,1905. Other than those mentioned all users of the \u201cBudweiser\u201d as a part of their trade name prior to 1905 were prevented from its further use. Some of the actions by which Anheuser-Busch or its predecessor obtained injunctions against alleged unfair users of the trade name, some of them prior to and some subsequent to 1905, are: Conrad v. Joseph Uhrig Brewing Co., 1880, 8 Mo.App. 277, Anheuser-Busch Brewing Ass\u2019n v. Fred Miller-Brewing Co. 87 F. 864; Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Budweiser Malt Products Corporation, D.C.1921, 287 F. 243 and 2 Cir., 1923, 295 F. 306; Anheuser-Busch v. Cohen, D.C.1930, 37 F.2d 393. These cases are cited to show that the plaintiff has asserted its right to the trade name \u201cBudweiser\u201d against various alleged infringers, and not as proof of the facts asserted in the opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">After Anheuser-Busch had extensively advertised its product and had secured a distribution in all sections of the United States, a number of brewers attempted to take advantage of the situation by putting \u201cBudweiser\u201d in their trade names. A trade name which has been used to the extent that it indicates to the general public that all goods bearing it are the manufactures of the original user, cannot be taken away by infringers. To give title to such a name the claimant must show that it has been long and continuously used, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>not necessarily to the absolute exclusion of all others. If its use has been substantially exclusive and so that the general public recognizes it, the trade mark is good. That absolute exclusive use is not necessary is recognized by the Trade Mark Act of July 5, 1946, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052 Paragraph 2(f) of which follows: \u201c(f) Except as expressly excluded in subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce. The Commissioner may accept as prima facie evidence that the mark has become distinctive, as applied to the applicant\u2019s goods in commerce, proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use thereof as a ma.rk by the applicant in commerce for the five years next preceding the date of the filing of the application for its registration\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It is asserted that the method by which the defendant put its beer on the market precluded any confusion by the public between it and the Anheuser-Busch beer. Defendant\u2019s beer was put out in an uncolored glass bottle, whereas the plaintiff\u2019s beer was in a colored glass bottle. The label on it\u2019s bottles had a different design and color than was borne by plaintiff\u2019s bottles, and each label was marked: \u201cOriginal DuBois Budweiser Beer\u201d and declared that the contents of the bottle had been manufactured by \u201cThe DuBois Brewing Company, DuBois, Pa.\u201d Defendant asserts that it, having so distinguished its beer from plaintiffs, is entitled to retain the \u201cBudweiser\u201d part of its trade name.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">When a geographic or descriptive name has been adopted by a manufacturer, the courts have consistently held that he is not required to discard it if he describes his product in such a way as will make certain that the public will not confuse it with the product of the original user of the name. As to this contention of defendant two matters must be kept in mind. The name must be used in a geographical or descriptive sense and not a mere trade name, and the use must be without unfair competition to avoid injunctive relief. The defendant was not offering for sale beer made in Budweis, nor could it have used \u201cBudweiser\u201d in the way of description. The term would mean nothing to the public unless considered as describing Anheuser-Busch beer. In seeking registration of a \u201cBudweiser\u201d trade mark defendant sought to apply the mark to ale and porter. This indicated that defendant was not using it to describe a type of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The plaintiff has offered a very considerable amount of testimony to establish unfair competition by defendant. Some of it may be subject to the severe criticism visited upon it by defendant\u2019s counsel, but not all of it. Perforce the Court must start with the fact that defendant knew that plaintiff\u2019s beer had been extensively advertised and widely distributed for many years under a trade name. That name, except as known from the advertisement and distribution of plaintiff\u2019s beer, was practically unknown in this country. When defendant used the trade name of another long in use as a part of its own name to designate its product, what was the natural result when retailers should handle defendant\u2019s beer? Some of them would deliver to the customer, on demand for \u201cBudweiser\u201d or \u201cBud\u201d (it\u2019s abbreviated common name), de-\u2019 fendants \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d. Was it not Budweiser? Credible witnesses have testified to such substitutions by retailer and wholesalers. And agents of defendant, seeking retailers as customers, were likely to, and in some cases have, suggested such substitutions as possible to their proposed customers. Such substitutions may not be prevented when draught beer was ordered at a bar, and confusion as to whose product it is may exist in the mind of a consumer even when defendant\u2019s \u201cBudweiser\u201d is offered to him in one of defendant\u2019s bottles upon an order for \u201cBudweiser\u201d or \u201cBud\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">In the instant case the Court has had little difficulty in determining that in 1905, when defendant adopted its trade name, the name \u201cBudweiser\u201d identified beer so marked to the general public as the product of Anheuser-Busch. The main doubt has arisen over defendant\u2019s allegations of laches and estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">In 1908 plaintiff brought substantially the same action against defendant as in the present suit. In 1909, with the consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>defendant, it discontinued the suit without prejudice and filed this action in 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Plaintiff excused the delay immediately following the discontinuance of the first action by reason of the illness of Adolphus Busch, its then president. Mr. Busch was ill when the original suit was begun. Until his death in 1913 he was not able to walk, but his mental faculties were unimpaired and he regularly attended to his business by means of a wheel-chair. Aft^r discontinuance of the suit he visited Germany on business trips, and undoubtedly could have testified in Pittsburgh or executed a deposition almost to the time of his death. As to the time between 1910 and 1919 plaintiff points to the approach of the Prohibition Amendment as a reason for its failure to proceed. Undoubtedly it had reason to fear prohibition, but it was not immediately impending in 1910, and between that year and the adoption of the Amendment plaintiff was engaged in trade mark proceedings in the Patent Office.. In the prohibition era the defendant continued to sell near beer and malt syrup under the \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d trade name. After the manufacture of beer became legal the plaintiff moved slowly in instituting the present action, suit not having been begun until 1940. Notice of intention to begin it, however, was given several years prior to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">While the delay in bringing the action has been great, it must not be forgotten that defendant faced the fact that suit might again be brought when it consented to the withdrawal of the 1909 action, and that since the withdrawal it had notice that plaintiff was not consenting to its use of the trade name. In 1919 it objected to defendant\u2019s application for a paper trade mark for \u201cBudweiser\u201d with other words accompanying it. But even without that notice injunctive relief to plaintiff is required by the finding of' unfair competition on the part of defendant. In the face of such a finding, delay as in suit does not prevent injunctive relief. Menendez v. Holt, 128 U. S. 514, 9 S.Ct. 143, 32 L.Ed. 526; Juan F. Portuondo Cigar Mfg. Co. v. Vicente Portuondo Cigar Mfg. Co. 222 Pa. 116, 70 A. 968; Grove Laboratories Inc. v. Brewer &amp; Co., 1 Cir., 103 P.2d 175. It may cause, an order for an accounting to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Plaintiff is entitled to a decree by which the defendant will be enjoined from the use of the term \u201cBudweiser\u201d, or \u201cBud\u201d, to describe beer manufactured by it, and will otherwise be protected in its use of its trade name. On account of the delay of plaintiff an accounting will not be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Let a decree in accordance with the foregoing opinion be presented, after due notice to counsel for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">1. Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated, plaintiff, is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Missouri,, with its principal office, place of business- and brewery in the City of St. Louis, Missouri, and is engaged in the manufacture and sale, inter alia, of beer, malt syrup and yeast. It was incorporated in 1925, and is the successor by assignment, of the business, properties and trade-marks of a corporation by the same name which was incorporated in 1875 under the name of E. Anheuser Company\u2019s Brewing Association;, the name of the latter corporation was changed to Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association in 1879, and again changed to Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated, in 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">2. DuBois Brewing Company, defendant, is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with its principal office, place-of business and brewery at DuBois, Pennsylvania. It was incorporated in 1895, and is engaged in the business of brewing and selling beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">3. The matter in controversy in this-action, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds the sum of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">4. About March 1, 1876, E. Anheuser Company\u2019s Brewing Association began to-manufacture for one Carl Conrad, trading-as C. Conrad &amp; Co., a wine and liquor merchant in the City of St. Louis, Missouri, and a dealer in beers imported from Europe, a. beer made according to the \u201cBudweiser process.\u201d The beer so manufactured for Conrad was sold by him under the name of \u201cCCC Budweiser Beer.\u201d Some time in the year 1877, Conrad commenced to use on bottles containing the beer so brewed for him a label, a copy whereof is shown in Defendant\u2019s Exh. 7 M\u2019s, whereon appeared,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>inter alia, the following: \u201cBudweiser Lager Bier. C. Conrad &amp; Co. Mainz, Geisenheim a/R &amp; St. Louis, Mo. We guarantee that this Beer is brewed especially for our own trade according to the Budweiser Process of the best Saazer Hope &amp; Bohemian Barley and warranted to keep in any Climate\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">5. The beer so manufactured by E. Anheuser Company\u2019s Brewing Association was sold by Carl Conrad under the name \u201cBudweiser Lager Bier\u201d from 1876 until 1883, during which period neither E. Anheuser Company\u2019s Brewing Association nor its successor, Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, sold any of said beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">6. The name \u201cBudweiser\u201d had been known to Carl Conrad and to Adolphus Busch, then President of E. Anheuser Company\u2019s Brewing Association, from a time long before March 1, 1876, as beer made by the brewers in the City of Budweis in Bohemia. Adolphus Busch had been familiar with the European Budweiser beer from at least as early as 1868 or 1869 and from a time prior to March 1, 1876, had been familiar with the process used in making beer at Budweis. Conrad, who had travelled in Europe prior to 1876, had learned there that the European \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer was considered by Europeans to be one of the finest beers made there.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">7. It was the purpose of Carl Conrad and E. Anheuser Company\u2019s Brewing Association that the beer brewed by the Association for Conrad should be similar in quality, color, flavor and taste to the \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer then being made in Bohemia.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">8. In or about the year 1883 plaintiff\u2019s predecessor acquired the right to use \u201cBudweiser\u201d from said Conrad. In 1891 a confirmatory assignment was executed by Conrad and his wife which transferred to plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, \u201call the right, title and interest which we or either of us may have acquired or in any way have or possess jointly or severally in the manufacture, production and sale of Budweiser Lager Beer, and in the good will of the business of C. Conrad &amp; Co. in Lager beer, as well as the sole right to the name, trade marks and labels used in connection therewith\u201d, together with certain federal trade-mark regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">9. Between 1891 and 1898 plaintiff\u2019s predecessor sold 785,970 barrels of \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">10. From 1898 the wide advertising and sale of \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor throughout the United States continued to grow; and the depositions and testimony of witnesses at the trial show that during at least fifteen years prior to 1905 plaintiff\u2019s predecessor made extensive sales of \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, New York, New Jersey and New England; prior to 1905, the money invested by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in advertising was spent in the main on \u201cBudweiser\u201d; and the advertising by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor of its beer under the mark \u201cBudweiser\u201d was circulated to millions of people each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">11. Following the extensive growth of the business of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and the establishment of a good will of great value in the designation \u201cBudweiser\u201d for beer, there appeared in the course of years a number of imitators who sought to take advantage of the celebrity of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark and of the valuable good will associated with plaintiff\u2019s mark by using the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d on beer not brewed by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, but plaintiff\u2019s predecessor objected promptly to all such uses, and prior to 1905 had succeeded in obtaining the discontinuance of all such infringements except in the instance of Prospect Brewing Co. of Philadelphia, which sola beer not brewed by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor marked \u201cBudweis\u201d to which infringement of its trade-mark \u201cBudweiser\u201d plaintiff\u2019s predecessor duly objected and which was discontinued at the outset of Prohibition when the Prospect brewery was padlocked by Federal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">12. During this period certain American importers who imported beer from the City of Budweis labelled such beer as \u201cBudweiser\u201d in a manner to which plaintiff\u2019s predecessor objected as infringing its trademark rights, but by an agreement with plaintiff\u2019s predecessor the breweries of Budweis in 1911 conceded the priority of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor\u2019s use of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u201cBudweiser\u201d as a trade-mark applied to beer in the United States and thus conceded the trade-mark rights of plaintiff\u2019s predecessors in the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d and agreed to use the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d only to describe the geographical origin of this beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">13. Long prior to June, 1905, the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning indicating the output of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor exclusively and the trade and public generally had come to use the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d and its abbreviation \u201cBud\u201d to designate the beer of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and of no one else.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">14. Continuously since prior to 1905, except while the national Prohibition law was in effect, plaintiff and its predecessor have manufactured and sold beer extensively throughout the United States under the \u201cBudweiser\u201d mark; and during Prohibition, from 1920 to 1933, sales of \u201cBudweiser\u201d near beer made by plaintiff and its predecessors exceeded 23,000,000 cases; during Prohibition, between 1921 and 1925, plaintiff\u2019s predecessor also sold over 21,-000,000 pounds of bulk and canned malt syrup under the \u201cBudweiser\u201d mark; and between 1925 and 1932 plaintiff sold over 37,000,000 pounds of \u201cBudweiser\u201d malt syrup in bulk and over 4,000,000 cartons of canned \u201cBudweiser\u201d malt syrup, such cartons containing 12 cans of 2i/\u00bf or 3 pounds per can; in addition, plaintiff\u2019s sales of yeast under the \u201cBudweiser\u201d mark from 1929 to 1946 exceeded 496,000,000 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">15. From Repeal in 1933 through 1946 the barrel equivalent of plaintiff\u2019s beer sold in bottles, on draught and in cans under the \u201cBudweiser\u201d mark amounted to 30,336,-506\u00a14 barrels.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">16. During Prohibition between 1918 and 1932 plaintiff and its predecessor spent over $6,000,000 advertising \u201cBudweiser\u201d malt syrup and \u201cBudweiser\u201d yeast; during the same period over $3,500,000 was spent by plaintiff and its predecessor in advertising near beer, and the greater portion of that amount was spent on advertising \u201cBudweiser\u201d near beer; during the period since Repeal, from 1933 through 1946, plaintiff has spent over $25,000,000 advertising its beer, and the majority of that amount has been spent on advertising of \u201cBudweiser\u201d' beer. During the same period plaintiff spent over $1,000,000 advertising \u201cBudweiser\u201d malt syrup and \u201cBudweiser\u201d yeast..</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">17. Such advertising by plaintiff and its-predecessor of its products sold under the mark \u201cBudweiser\u201d from 1918 to date, as-prior thereto, has been by means of newspapers, magazines, trade publications, billboards, outdoor signs, point-of-purchase advertising, and such media as the eight horse hitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">18. With the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic at the conclusion of World War I, the name of the City of Budweis was changed to Budejovice.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">19. For a short time after -Repeal, during. the years of 1934 and 1935, imported beer from Budejovice was sold in small quantities in this country along the Eastern seaboard under the name \u201cNazdar\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">20. Subsequently, the importers changed the label to \u201cImported Budweiser\u201d and small amounts of imported beer so labeled, which plaintiff contended violated the 1911 contracts, were sold in this country during the years 1936-1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">21. After protest by plaintiff in 1938, new agreements were executed in 1939 between plaintiff and the breweries at Budejovice by which the breweries at Budejovice discontinued all use of \u201cBudweiser,\u201d \u201cBudweis,\u201d \u201cBud\u201d or any confusingly similar term.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">22. The word \u201cBudweiser\u201d is not now and never has been used as the name of a type of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">23. Defendant began to use the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d in the phrase \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d in June, 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">24. At the time defendant began to use the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d it knew that the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d was the name of a brand of beer brewed by Anheuser-Busch.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">25. In October, 1905, counsel for plaintiff\u2019s predecessor demanded that defendant discontinue use of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d. A number of additional letters between., counsel for plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and defendant\u2019s counsel were exchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>26. Following the demand of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor that defendant discontinue the use of the word \u201cBudweiser,\u201d on March 1, 1906, Frank Hahne, defendant\u2019s then president, swore that his corporation was the owner of the trade-mark which defendant then sought to register in the United States Patent Office consisting of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d together with certain other words and figures, and that the class of merchandise to which said trade-mark was appropriated and upon which defendant used said trade-mark was \u201cLager Beer, Ale and Porter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">27. On November 8, 1906, plaintiff\u2019s predecessor filed opposition to defendant\u2019s application to register its trade-mark and defendant\u2019s president verified the answer to said opposition on December 14, 1906 in which answer defendant alleged, among other things, \u201cthat its trade-mark consists of the word \u2018Budweiser\u2019 in connection with the monogram \u2018D B Co\u2019, the name \u2018DuBois Brewing Co.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">28. On September 2, 1908, plaintiff\u2019s predecessor filed suit against defendant in the United States Circuit Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania for an injunction against the use of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">29. The 1908 suit was discontinued on consent of defendant\u2019s counsel on August <em>2, </em>1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">30. During the period 1908 through 1918 twenty-five states went dry by adopting state-wide statutes or constitutional prohibition; in the early years only a few states went dry at a time, but as the prohibition movement gathered momentum increasing numbers of states went dry each year, and in 1914, 1915 and 1917 four, six and seven states went dry respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">31. Defendant\u2019s sales prior to Prohibition under the label \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d were small and limited principally to the territory in Northwestern Pennsylvania and Buffalo, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">32. Prior to Prohibition, defendant spent very little money on advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">33. During Prohibition, defendant brewed a small amount of near-beer which it sold to a separate company called \u201cDuBois Products &amp; Cold Storage Company\u201d, which company in turn resold some of said near-beer under the label \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d and which company also sold malt syrup under the label \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d, which malt syrup it purchased from Sch\u00fctz Brewing Co. and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">34. Throughout the period of the existence of defendant\u2019s brewery it has remained and still is a small brewery.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">35. The barrel capacity of defendant\u2019s brewery has not been changed since prior to 1909. It has had the same size kettle continuously since that date. Prior to the present suit, the amount of beer labeled \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d brewed was only a comparatively small percentage of the total beer brewed. The bottled beer labeled \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d ran from less than 8% in 1933 to less than 12% in 1939, while the draught beer sold as \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d ran from less than 8% in 1933 to less than 30% in 1939. In 1939 the total sales of defendant\u2019s beer amounted to slightly more than 37,000 barrels, which is some 7,000 barrels less than the number of barrels sold by defendant in the year 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">36. After the repeal of Prohibition, defendant again began to sell its beer under the label \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d and began to expand its business into cities in which it had not sold its beer so labeled prior to Prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">37. Defendant usually invoiced its beer labeled \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d as \u201cBudweiser\u201d or \u201cBud\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">38. In writing letters to defendant\u2019s salesmen, defendant\u2019s sales manager referred to its beer labeled \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d as \u201cBudweiser\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">39. Defendant\u2019s distributors, in many instances, invoiced defendant\u2019s beer labeled \"DuBois Budweiser\u201d as \u201cBudweiser\u201d or \u201cBud\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">40. Many of defendant\u2019s wholesale distributors and retail dealers sold defendant\u2019s beer labeled \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d on calls for \u201cBudweiser\u201d or \u201cBud\u201d without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-20\">41. Members of the public, who for many years had believed the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d was a brand name for a beer put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>out by Anheuser-Busch, ordered \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer on draught and received beer from a tap on the handle of which were the words \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d, which beer they believed to be plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">42. Members of the public, when receiving defendant\u2019s beer \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d on calls for \u201cBudweiser\u201d draught beer were not likely to notice that the beer was taken from a tap labeled \u201cDuBois Budweiser\u201d or if they did notice such' fact, nevertheless were likely to believe that the beer was plaintiff\u2019s beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">43. In 1919 defendant was required to show cause why Opposition No. 322 should not be sustained. This was the opposition filed by plaintiff\u2019s predecessor to defendant\u2019s \u201capplication for registration of a trade-mark for lager beer, ale and porter filed March 19, 1906\u201d consisting in part of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d. Defendant thereupon appointed new counsel to prosecute and defend said opposition. Thereafter defendant\u2019s attorneys filed its argument and after due consideration the Examiner sustained the opposition of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and denied the defendant\u2019s application to register its claimed trade-mark which included the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">44. During the summer of 1910, while Messrs. Adolphus Busch, C. C. Conrad and Rudolph Knippenberg were in Europe, a settlement of the proceeding in the Patent Office was negotiated with Die Budweiser Brauberechtigten Burgerliches Brauhaus, and two written agreements were signed at Prague on September 28, 1910. Neither of these agreements was offered in evidence at the trial of this case, the plaintiff explaining that the agreements had been lost. However, a later agreement made between Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association and the Burgerliches Brauhaus dated September 4, 1911 (Plaintiff\u2019s Exh. 101-F), recites that it is executed and delivered \u201cpursuant to and in substitution for the aforesaid agreements of 1910.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">45. By the agreement of September 4, 1911, it was recited that Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association had paid to Burgerliches Brauhaus the sum of 82,500 Austrian kronen; in exchange therefor it was provided that Burgerliches Brauhaus agreed to and did withdraw its objections to the use by Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association of the name \u201cBudweiseP\u2019 as a trade-name or trade-mark on its beer, except in Europe, it being made clear that this license was not intended to permit the sale of the American-made beer as \u201cBudweiser\u201d in any European country, and that the right already possessed and enjoyed by Burgerliches Brauhaus to sell its \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer in the United States should continue. The agreement provided finally for the execution of the short document which had been filed in the Patent Office some months before on April 27, 1911, by which the application of Burgerliches Brauhaus to cancel Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association\u2019s trade-mark registration of July 23, 1907, was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">46. On August 19, 1911, AnheuserBusch Brewing Association entered into a similar written agreement, at Budweis, with the owners of another brewery at that place, \u2014 the \"Cesky Akciovy Pivovar v. Ceske Budejovicich\u201d (Plaintiff\u2019s Exh. 101-G). By this agreement the Cesky Akciovy Pivovar v. Ceske Budejovicich conceded that Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association might use the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d on beer sold by the latter in any part of the world outside of Europe, so long as it did not use the word \u201cOriginal\u201d in connection therewith; it also agreed to raise no objection to the use by Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association of its trade-mark of July 23, 1907. Like the Burgerliches Brauhaus, Cesky Akciovy Pivovar reserved to itself the concurrent right to use the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d on its product in the United States and elsewhere throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">47. As the agreements of September 4, 1911, and August 19, 1911, contemplated, the Burgerliches Brauhaus and Cesky Akciovy Pivovar sold their products as \u201cBudweiser\u201d beer, in the United States, from 1911 until the early part of 1939, except for the period of National Prohibition in 'the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">48. Under the agreements of 1910 and 1911 with the brewers at Budweis, the latter were free to sell their products as \u201cBudweiser\u201d in the United States; and after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the repeal of National Prohibition imported \u201cBudweiser Beer\u201d again appeared in the American market. The right of the Cesky Akciovy Pivovar to sell its beer as \u201cBudweiser\u201d in the United States was again recognized and conceded by the plaintiff in 1934, and thereafter and on August 10, 1937, the Cesky Akciovy Pivovar obtained registration in the United States Patent Office of a beer bottle label, which had been submitted to and approved by the plaintiff\u2019s executive Vice President, R. A. Huber, in 1934, and on which the principal inscription was the words \u201cImported Original Bohemian Budweiser Beer from Budweis City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">49. On September 27, 1938, plaintiff\u2019s board of directors adopted a resolution by which its executive officers were directed to effect shell adjustment and settlement and to take such legal and other action as might be necessary to eliminate the further use of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d by the DuBois Brewing Company and by the two brewers at Budweis. Pursuant to this resolution, legal counsel specializing in trade-mark litigation were consulted, and before any action against Du Bois Brewing Company was taken, two representatives of the plaintiff \u2014 one of its attorneys and the assistant to its Vice-President\u2014 were sent to Budweis with instructions and authority to negotiate agreements with the Burgerliches Brauhaus and the Cesky Akciovy Pivovar under which they would agree to discontinue in the United States the use of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d to describe their beer. After protracted negotiations which followed their arrival in Budweis in December, 1938, the two representatives of the plaintiff were able to negotiate the agreements desired. These agreements were reduced to writing and were made with both of the Budweis breweries and with a group of agents through whom the Cesky Akciovy Pivovar had exported its Budweiser beer to the United States, and sold it here. These agreements (Plaintiff\u2019s Exh. 101-H, 101-K and 101-M) were made between January 13, 1939, and March 7, 1939, and provided that the Budweis breweries and their agents should discontinue their use of the name \u201cBudweiser\u201d on their beer sold in the United States and its territories, in exchange for which the plaintiff paid them a total of $127,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">50. Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, after the death of Adolphus Busch in 1913, knew that defendant still continued to use the name \u201cDu Bois Budweiser\u201d on its beer; plaintiff itself was aware during Prohibition that the name was being used on near beer; and plaintiff learned in 1933, immediately after Repeal, that defendant had resumed the manufacture and sale of beer under the same name. Nevertheless at no time after the 1908 suit was discontinued in 1909 and until the present suit was filed in 1940 did plaintiff or its predecessor indicate to defendant that it still claimed to have sole right to use the name, or protest against defendant\u2019s using it, or suit to enjoin such use by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">51. All the labels which have been used by the defendant on its \u201cDu Bois Budweiser\u201d at any time since 1905, as well as the labels used on the \u201cDu Bois Budweiser Beverage\u201d during Prohibition, are totally dissimilar from any label which has ever been used by the plaintiff on its Budweiser beer, and the shape and color of the bottles which have been used by the defendant since 1905 have been entirely different from the shapes and colors of bottles which have been used to contain the plaintiff\u2019s Budweiser beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">1. Irrespective of its character as a technical trade-mark, the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d since long prior to 1905 has been and now is the trade-mark of the plaintiff by virtue of its association with the plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s predecessors, and with the products of the plaintiff, whereby the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d has become generally known throughout the United States to the trade and consumers as meaning the product of the plaintiff and of none other.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">2. The word \u201cBudweiser\u201d used on beer and related products is a true, arbitrary and distinctive trade-mark, and is the property of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">3. The word \u201cBud\u201d used on beer and related products is a true, arbitrary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>distinctive trade-mark, and is the property of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">4. Defendant\u2019s use of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d on beer and of the word \u201cBud\u201d in connection therewith infringes plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">5. Defendant\u2019s use of the word \u201cBudweiser\u201d on beer and of \u201cBud\u201d in connection therewith is without legal justification or excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">6. Plaintiff and its predecessors have been vigilant in protecting their rights and have not acquiesced in infringing uses of their said trade-mark by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">7. The use of the name \u201cBudweiser\u201d in former years to describe the place of origin of beer imported from the city of Budejovice, when the name of that city was Budweis, does not affect plaintiff\u2019s rights in its trade-mark \u201cBudweiser\u201d nor give to defendant the right to appropriate plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">8. The delay in securing relief from defendant\u2019s infringing acts does not deprive plaintiff of its right to protection, nor does it give defendant the right to continue its unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">9. The discontinuance of the suit of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor against defendant in the United States Circuit Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in 1909 does not estop plaintiff from obtaining relief here.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">10. From the beginning, defendant\u2019s use of the words \u201cBudweiser\u201d and \u201cBud\u201d has been with knowledge of the rights of plaintiff and of plaintiff\u2019s predecessors, and with the fraudulent purpose and intent of confusing and deceiving the public and of enabling defendant\u2019s product to be passed off as and for the product of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">11. Defendant\u2019s fraud, in continuing its infringement of plaintiff\u2019s rights after prompt notice and the supervening fraudulent acts committed by defendant bar defendant from claiming laches.</p>\n<p id=\"AXJ\">12. Plaintiff is entitled to an injunction prohibiting defendant from using the words \u201cBudweiser\u201d or \u201cBud\u201d or any confusingly similar word on or in connection with beer or on similar or related products.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
