The complaint contained no allegations respecting the existence of any custom, practice or contract to pay for time consumed in such activities. The defendant employer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action involved a claim for so-called portal-to-portal pay which has been outlawed and barred by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 252.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1003-15\">Vincent A.
