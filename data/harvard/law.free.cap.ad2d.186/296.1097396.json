Given defendant\u2019s use of drugs and alcohol, failure to cooperate in a substance abuse rehabilitation program and conviction of additional crimes while on probation, we cannot say that County Court abused its discretion in sentencing defendant <em>(see, People v Moore, </em>168 AD2d 739; <em>People v Bushey, </em>114 AD2d 690, <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d . 649).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Mikoll, J.
