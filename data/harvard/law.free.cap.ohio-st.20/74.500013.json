He said the de\u00ab fendant promised to pay the amount so soon as he could got a certain mill in operation, which was then in process of building; that he repeatedly afterward heard promises of a similar import. This witness said further that in the years *1845 and 1846 he was acquainted with the affairs of \u201c the Cincinnati and Presque Isle Mining Company,\u201d and that during said years the stock was in good repute, and the prospects of the company flattering; but that his information did not reach a subsequent period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">On the part of defendant, the depositions of Alvah Hand, William O\u2019Callahan, and Hugh O\u2019Birne wore read to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-9\">- <em>Hand </em>swore, in substance, that he was present at Detroit, in the early part of November, 1847, when defendant made to plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>iff two notes, for an amount something over $300; that these notes were given for stock in \u201c the Cincinnati and Presque Isle Mining Company of Lake Superior.\u201d At the time the notes wore given, witness supposed said stock to be of some value, but subsequent events had satisfied him that he was mistaken\u2014the stock was worthless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\"><em>O\u2019Gallahan </em>stated that he had learned from plaintiff, that defendant, Bradley, bad given him notes for stock in the \u201c Cincinnati and Presque Isle Mining Company;\u201d is acquainted with the nature of this stock, and considers it worthless. At the time of the execution' of said notes, and ever since, witness has regarded the stock as a humbug.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\"><em>O'Bine </em>testified that on November 9,1847, Spafford, the plaintiff, sold to Bradley, the defendant, 364 shares of stock in \u201c the Cincinnati and Presque Isle Mining Company.\u201d From conversation between the parties, he thinks one or more notes were given by defendant for said stock. There is no sale for said stock in the market, and there never has been to any great amount, within the knowledge of deponent, excejit between stockholders. It is the opinion of witness that said \u201c mining company \u201d was a swindling speculation of said Amos Spafford and other persons from Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">No other testimony was submitted on either side except the notes. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAa\">*The plaintiff took judgment for the amount of notes and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-9\">The defendant moved for a new trial, on the ground that the judgment was against law and evidence. The motion was overruled and exceptions taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-10\">At the May term of the Supreme Court for Hamilton county, A. d. 1850, this judgment was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the commercial court, for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-11\">The present writ of error is brought to the judgment of reversal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-12\">E.

There is not sufficient evidence that the notes were given for the consideration alleged by defendant..</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-6\">III. But to admit that the notes were given for the consideration alleged, it is not proved that there was no consideration in law, and in fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-7\">All the world over, the holder of the notes of a bank at the time it stops payment, bears the loss, although the bank may have been insolvent for months.

Per Spalding, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">In Markle <em>v. </em>Akron, 14 Ohio, 586, it was hold that \u201c when the facts are submitted to the court, instead of the jury, for decision, its judgment will not be reversed on error, though unsustained by the weight of evidence.\u201d And see Wright\u2019s S. C. 46, 673; Reynolds ot al. <em>v. </em>Rogers\u2019 Ex\u2019r, 5 Ohio, 171. The point thus decided seems to be modified by the act of March 12, 1845. In Kepner\u2019s Adm\u2019r <em>v. </em>Snively\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 19 Ohio, 296. it was held that where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>has been a motion for a new trial overruled, and a bill of exceptions taken, showing the evidence, whether the cause has been submitted to the court or jury, under said act of March 12, 1845, such case may be reviewed on error. A judgment will not be reversed because decided against the evidence, unless there is a motion for new trial. 19 Ohio, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">This act is construed in Baker <em>v. </em>Cory, 15 Ohio, 9, and Kepner\u2019s Adm\u2019r <em>v. </em>Snively\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 19 Ohio, 296.

No irreparable wrong can be done in *such a case, as it only compels the parties to retrace.their steps, and submit their proofs and allegations a second time to the same tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Hence, although by the terms of the statute the party supposing himself aggrieved would seem entitled to his writ of error, as well where a motion for a new trial is sustained as where it is refused, no case has occurred in practice where this court has seen fit to reverse the proceedings of a subordinate tribunal for the sole reason that it has, on motion, set aside a verdict as against evidence, and ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In the case at bar, the testimony is by no means of a preponderating and conclusive character. The members of this court would probably divide in opinion, if called to try the cause upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">A jury might, therefore, without any glaring impropriety, have returned a verdict for either party; and if the judge of the commercial court had seen proper, on reflection, to have set aside his own finding, and to direct a new trial, this court, most undoubtedly, would have refused to disturb his proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">What different bearing has the question before us been made to assume ?</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The judge of the commercial court refused to entertain the motion of defendant for a new trial, and entered up judgment for plaintiff upon the notes. Two judges of the Supreme Court, sitting for the county of Hamilton, deeming the evidence insufficient to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s claim, have set aside the judgment and directed a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Saying nothing about the perplexity into which the parties litigant would be thrown by a different course of procedure, I ask if it can be expected that we shall treat the proceedings of the Supreme Court for Hamilton county with less respect than that which we are at all times ready to extend to the action of the commercial court of Cincinnati ?</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">We would not have interposed our authority to prevent a second trial, if ordered by the commercial court, for the same *causo.</p>\n<p id=\"Amm\">We will not interfere to disturb the action of the Supreme Court, which has produced no other or different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">The judgment is affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
