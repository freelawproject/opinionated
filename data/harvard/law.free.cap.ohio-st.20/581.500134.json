Carneal, conveying, in the ordinary form of an absolute warranty deed, sundry city lots in Cincinnati, and an undivided half of a tract of land near the city, called the \u201c Hill Tract,\u201d the whole tract estimated to contain two hundred acres. The consideration named was $5,000, but no part of it was paid by Carneal, .or intended to be paid. Tho present controversy embraces only the undivided half of the <em>hill tract</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">On January 21, 1839, Thomas D. Carneal, by quitclaim deed, and for the consideration of one dollar, conveyed \u201c all the right, title, interest, claim and demand, which the said Carneal acquired in the premises, by virtue of the deed from William Irwin,\u201d to Nicholas Longworth. The latter now claims to be the absolute owner, while the complainants insist that he is merely a mortgagee, and that they have a right to redeem, upon the ordinary terms. The city lots were conveyed by Carneal to Archibald Irwin, and are not now in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">It appears that, in the year 1820, Wm. Irwin was indebted to the Bank of the United States to the amount of about $18,000, evidenced by notes, upon which Nicholas Longworth was indorser for his accommodation. For this debt the bank held a mortgage from Irwin, upon a large amount of real estate in and about the city of Cincinnati, which was then deemed, by all the parties in interest, as sufficient security for the claim. The land in controversy formed no part of the premises mortgaged to the bank. At this time, Longworth was the intimate friend and legal adviser of William Irwin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIu\">*In 1821, Irwin, being a surety on the official bond of one Smith to the government of the United States, and being apprehensive that a suit might be brought, which would affect his credit, and cause him temporary embarrassment, consulted Longworth as to what was best to be done. The nature of this interview will best appear from the principal answer of Nicholas Longworth, a portion of which is subjoined :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-9\">\u201c It was, I believe, early in the month of August, 1821, that William Irwin called on me, and stated that a suit was then pending, or that he daily expected one against him, as the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>of James Smith to the government, and which would bind up, if not sacrifice his property, when, in truth, nothing was due the government, as they expected soon to be able to show, and obtain a discharge; that, in the interim, he wished to convey his real estate to me, till he could get the claim settled. I suggested his conveying to his son Archibald. This he refused, saying it would at once be said to be fraudulent, and lead to bills in equity to set it aside. I then proposed that he should make the conveyance to Thomas D. Carneal, for the same object. This he refused, and more positively, saying that it would lead to the same result, and was to him more objectionable, as it would be doing indirectly what he refused to do directly. I then observed to Mr. Irwin that the conveyance could be made to Carneal, for my indemnity; but, if done, it must be <em>bona fide </em>and absolute, and with the distinct understanding that it was to remain for my indemnity, till the sum or sums it was to secure were paid and satisfied; for we all three might, and probably would be called on to answer a bill, setting up the conveyance as fraudulent. He observed that he expected it, that he wished it <em>bona fide, </em>and so arranged as to stand the test. He then asked me to draw the deed; said he would call and get it, have it executed and handed back to me to deliver to Carneal, and take the declaration of trust to meet my own wishes and views, and in a manner to be valid. He called for the deed, had it executed, and brought it back to me. I named the subject to Carneal, who *is about as negligent as myself, and the business rested till about the-day of March following, when Mr. Irwin called, quite out of humor, having learned from Carneal, or some other person, that the matter was not yet <em>closed; </em>though I had, for safety, given the deed for record within six months. I immediately called on Mr. Carneal at his residence at Elmwood, and drew up a declaration of trust, and handed it to him to sign. On reading it, and discovering that, after indemnifying me as the indorser of Mr. Irwin to the Bank of, tire United States, it was to go to secure his creditors generally, he objected to accept the trust, unless a special provision was made to secure the $2,912 loaned William Irwin to pay Johnson, and for which Mr. Irwin and Mr. Carneal were under pledge to give me a note\u2014Carneal as security. Although so to do was against my interest, 1 thought it reasonable, and, as a matter of necessity, not choice, drew up a new declaration of trust, with the provision, which he signed, and tho copy of which is hereunto attached. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>insertion, at the time, I suppose met the approbation, of Wm. Irwin, and was done by me under the discretion in me vested by Mr. Irwin.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">It seems that Carneal had previously agreed, verbally, to become surety for Irwin to Longworth, in $2,912, growing out of a transaction with one Johnson; and he refused to accept the trust, unless he, too, could be specially indemnified. The instrument then executed by Carneal, and called the \u201c First Declaration of Trust,\u201d is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\"><em>\u201c </em>This may certify, that whereas William Irwin has deeded to me the equal undivided moiety of a tract of land, lying east of Cincinnati, estimated to contain two hundred acres, situate in fractional section number five, township three, and second fractional range, and also the north half of lots number one, two, and three, in square number one, in that part of Cincinnati laid off by the United States; said conveyance has been made me m trust for the following purposes, and no other: Whereas, William Ii'win stands indebted to Nicholas Longworth in the sum of $2,912, for so much money by him paid *for said Irwin to John Johnson ; and whereas the said Nicholas Longworth stands as indorser for said Irwin in the Branch Bank of the United States, in Cin. cinnati, to a large amount, this may, therefore, certify, that I hold the same in trust; in the first place, to secure said Nicholas Long-worth in the repayment of the aforesaid, sum and interest from the-date; and, secondly, to indemnify and save harmless the said Nicholas Longworth, as the indorser of said Irwin; and, thirdly, the overplus to the creditors, if any, of the said Wm. Irwin; and, lastly, to account to said Wm. Irwin,-his heirs, executors, and administrators, for the remaining balance, if any, in my hands. If said Irwin should not pay said Nicholas Longworth the aforesaid' sum of money and interest yearly, within five years from this date, and pay the several notes in the branch bank, on which said Nicholas Longworth is indorser, or otherwise obtain his discharge from liability in the same, I am to sell the aforesaid premises at private sale, or public auction, for cash or on credit, at the discretion of said Nicholas Longworth, and apply the proceeds in the manner heretofore pointed out: First, the private debt of said Nicholas Longworth; secondly, the notes in the branch bank, on which said Nicholas Longworth is indorser of said Irwin; thirdly, to pay from the surplus, if any, other debts due by said Irwin; and, lastly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>to account to the said \"William Irwin, his heirs, executors, admin - istrators or assigns, for the remaining balance, if any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">\u201c Thomas D.

When he came to know them he was much offended. Harsh words passed between him and Longworth, and they never spoke to each other again. In their last interview, however, Longworth had proposed to \u201c cancel all transactions \u201d if Irwin would procure his release from the bank. This the bank refused. Carneal then interposed his friendly offices. He proposed to persuade Long-worth to let the property %-emain in him \u201c as further security to Longworth\u201d for his liability as indorser, \u201calone.\u201d To this Longworth assented, or, as he says, \u201c went a step beyond,\u201d by releasing Irwin from all other liabilities to him. Longworth drew a paper to this effect, which Carneal showed to Irwin, who agreed to the substance, but not to the. <em>\u201c </em>wording.\u201d Carneal drew another, which obviated Irwin\u2019s objection. It has no date, but was signed by Irwin and Longworth,' and left with Carneal for safekeeping. <em>JVo other person ever saw it </em>until it was exhibited in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-8\">This paper, called, by way of distinction, \u201cThe Second Declaration of Trust,\u201d reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-9\">\u201c The real estate transferred to Thomas D.

For, respondent having been (if not then) a director in the bank, he was apprehensive that Mr. Irwin would be less particular about paying it. I proposed that Mr. Irwin should have the Phillips claim prosecuted to judgment, and, when in judgment, assigned to me, on account of the Jabez Longworth money loaned him, to which they agreed, and it was inserted in the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-4\">\u201cAnd respondent did, as part of the same proposal, agree that tbe deed of trust to Carneal should continue for his indemnity as indorser in the Bank of tho United States alone, and should be given up whenever that debt was paid by Irwin, or respondent\u2019s release obtained. Mr. Carneal stated this arrangement to Mr. Irwin, who, he informed me, was highly pleased with it, and had requested him to have'it reduced to writing, to prevent future misunderstanding. It was drawn by Mr. Carneal, under the supervision of Mr. Irwin, and was by us signed, and by us left in the hands of Mr. Irwin for safe-keeping.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">On the death of Wm. Irwin, Carneal, the trustee, and White-man, the son-in-law, were appointed administrators, with the will annexed. Tho estate was probably insolvent, although no such return was made by the administrators; nor has there ever been any formal settlement of the estate by them. Longworth has never presented to them any account or vouchers for his claim against the estate. In the,meantime, the property mortgaged by Irwin to the United States Branch Bank, has been all sold, and left a deficit, which Longworth says amounted, with interest, on January 1, 1839, to $19,000. This amount he claims to have paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">On January 11, 1839, the heirs of Wm.

Pendleton, as to the manner in which the above order for a conveyance was obtained, and the purpose for which it was required. Carneal says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\"><em>\u201c </em>That order [to convey] was obtained through N. Gr. Pendleton, Esq., who acted, in the negotiation of compromise, as the friend of Mr. Archibald Irwin, and in this way. I said to Mr. Pendleton, Longworth and Irwin having agreed, I, as trustee, will not make the conveyance unless so ordered to do so by the heirs of Mr. William Irwin. <em>That order must be given for my safety. </em>Mr. Pendleton agreed with me in opinion\u2014agreed to obtain the order; it was obtained, and I made the conveyances accordingly, immediately after the order was given. ... At the time the order was given on me by the heirs of Mr. William Irwin, deceased, to make the deeds to Archibald Irwin and Nicholas Longworth, there was an unpleasant misunderstanding between Mr. Archibald Irwin and myself, or his brothers, Mr. William Irwin, or Mr. James E. Irwin; henee, I had no conversation with either, on the subject of the order, and, through Mr. N. G-. Pendleton, required the order of the heirs to make the deeds to Longworth and Archibald Irwin, before I would make the deeds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABKo\">^Archibald Irwin, in his deposition, says :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-11\">\u201c My brother William was fifteen years old in the January preceding the execution of that deed, and my brother James was thirteen years old in April of that year, 1821. They never had any means of knowing the trust under which the property was conveyed or holden, within my knowledge. I never talked with either of them of the trust deed subsequently. They knew, generally, that there was a controversy between Mr. Longworth and myself about some property, but they never knew anything about the details of that controversy from me. . . There was no personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>interview between Mr. Longworth, Mr. Carneal, and myself, in regard to the compromise, ly friend, Colonel Pendleton, passed between myself and Mr. Carneal, and Mr. Longworth. He, Colonel Pendleton, brought me a paper, which ho said Mr. Long-worth requested, or required I should sign, and asked me whether I thought my brothers would sign it. I told him that I had no doubt that they would sign anything that I would, adding that they had no interest, as I verily believed, at the time, that they had not. If I had not believed that my brothers had no interest, I should never have made the compromise......They had no knowledge that they had any interest in the trust property \u2014that I aim aware of; and I verily believe that they had no knowledge whatever that they had any legal claim. I never, as I have before stated, viewed them as having any rights. I considered that the property equitably and justly belonged to myself. I had no conversation with them prior to, and at the execution of the paper above referred to, to the best of my knowledge and belief, in relation to the subject. I did not go to them with the paper for their signatures. . . . Neither William nor James took any part in the compromise between Longworth and myself, that I knew of, except signing the paper. 1 have no knowledge, nor do I believe that they, at the time, had any knowledge of a receipt given to Carneal, by either Longworth or myself. . . . They had no knowledge, to the best of my belief, of the state of the ac-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">counts ^between the estate of their father, William Irwin, and Mr. Longworth; if they did, they knew more about it than I did myself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">N. G-. Pendleton says: \u201cBy the authority of Archibald Irwin, 1 informed Carneal, that, in order to settle their conflicting claims to the trust property, if he would convey to Irwin the lots on Fourth street, he might convey the country property to Long-worth. After some time, Carneal informed me that Longworth assented to their arrangement; but that he (Carneal), <em>for his security, </em>must have the assent of the heirs of William Irwin in writing. Such assent was procured, and thereupon Carneal convoyed the property according to the arrangement. ... To the best of my recollection, I had no conversation with William Irwin or with James F. Irwin with respect to the negotiation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-10\">Lewis Whiteman says that the administrators never considered that this \u201chill land\u201d constituted any portion of the estate, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>reason that Archibald Irwin insisted that his father had created .the trust in Carneal to secure him for debts and moneys which he had advanced and was bound to pay for William Irwin &amp; Son; and that Mr. Longworth claimed that the property conveyed was to secure him for his indorsements for William Irwin, and consequently that the whole would be absorbed in satisfying these several claims. . . . He says he has no recollection of holding any conversation with William Irwin and James E. Irwin on the subject of signing the paper. They were not present when witness signed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">The granting clause of the deed from William Irwin to Thomas L. Carneal is irregular in this, that it names \u201cWilliam Irwin\u201d as grantee, instead of Thomas D. Carneal. The <em>habendum, </em>etc., is \u201c to the only proper use and behoof of the said Thomas D. Carneal, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\">Longworth had taken possession of the property in controversy some ten years before he received his deed from Carneal. In July 1831, he wrote a letter to C. K.

That Longworth acquired from Carneal the exact title, and \u2022no more, which Carneal acquired from Irwin; so that Longworth became trustee, first, for his own indemnity, and secondly, for the representatives of Irwin, who yet have an equity of redemption not divested by foreclosure, conveyance, or lapse of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqBd\">II.

The order did not have the effect to release the equity of redemption of Irwin\u2019s heirs, because they were not aware of any such right. They signed it under 'the mistaken belief that they jjaid no interest in the property. 1 Story\u2019s Eq., secs. 122,140, 147; Farnam <em>v. </em>Brooks, 9 Pick. 212; Turner <em>v. </em>Harvey, 1 Jacob, 169 ; 4 Cond.

They executed the order in ignorance of the <em>material </em>fact, that they could have claimed a reconveyance by reimbursing Longworth for what he had paid to the branch bank. A circumstance, not only tending to <em>prove </em>their ignorance, but to <em>account </em>for it, is the false statement of a most material fact, contained in the recital of the order to convey. The statement is, that their father conveyed this property to Carneal \u201c in trust for the use of Archibald Irwin, to discharge the debts of William Irwin &amp; Son.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-7\">Again, the total want of consideration is a very pregnant circumstance.

Hunter argued, on the part of the complainants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b513-11\">I. That they were induced to give their order to the trustee, Carneal, to convey, in ignorance of their rights and of the truth of the facts upon which their rights depended, and by reason of an untrue (though not a fraudulent) representation of the facts embodied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>in the writing containing their order, in regard to the trusts under which Mr. Carneal in fact held the title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-4\">II. That there was not, in truth and fact, any contract or agreenient made between said Longworth and the heirs ; or *between him and the administrators of the estate of William Irwin, whereby they agreed to give, and he to receive, said lands in pa^H^ ment of his claims against said estate; and, <em>'\u25a0</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-7\">III. That if it had been so agreed, under a condition of igno-., ranee on the part of the complainants, as aforesaid, of their rights, and to their injury, a court of equity will, upon the equitable terms of full payment to the respondent of his demands, for the security of which the trust was created, let them in to redeem.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-8\">Y. Worthington, for defendant Longworth :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-9\">I. What was the effect of the deed to Carneal, without some declaration, in writing, executed by him, specifying the purposes for which he hold the lands convoyed to him ? There is no trust apparent in the deed, which puiqiorts to be in consideration of $5,000, which in fact was not paid. If the deed to Carneal was made by Irwin with intent to defraud his creditors, then it is within the statute of frauds, and void as to those creditors, but valid as to all other parties, and transmits the legal title to Carneal, beyond the control of Irwin or power of Longworth. Neither, if such be the purpose of the transaction, can coerce Carneal, at law or in chancery, to execute the trusts, for which ho had in writing declared he received the title to said lands. 18 Ohio, 418; 16 Ohio, 54; 15 Ohio, 430; 14 Ohio, 54 ; 10 Ohio, 162 ; 7 Ohio, pt. 1, p. 78 ; pt. 2, p. 70 ; 4 Ohio, 418; 3 Ohio, 527 ; 1 Ohio, 469. If, then, the deed was made with the intent to defraud creditors, without or with the declaration of trust, it transmits the legal title to the grantee beyond the control of the grantor, or of the beneficiaries in the declaration of trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-10\">If the deed was made, not with an intent to defraud creditors, but with intent that Carneal should in good faith hold the property on special trust to secure Longworth or Archibald Irwin, then the deed would transmit the legal title to Carneal, and he would hold the property in his own right, and *would be liable for 'the consideration expressed in the deed, unless he executed, in writing, a declaration in trust, as required by the statute of frauds. 4 Russell, 423; 9 Conn. 96 ; 6 Hill, 219; 2 Story\u2019s Eq., sec. 1199, n. 2; 2 Murphy, 279</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>It is true, implied or resulting trusts are raised simply by operation of law, and require no written declaration or written proof; but express trusts must be evidenced by writing, though they even be created by parol. 5 Ohio, 255 ; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 306.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-5\">We then conclude, the effect of the deed to Carneal, without the declaration of trust, signed by him, of March 16,1822, or some-other declaration'of trust signed by him, would be to transmit to him absolutely the lands thereby conveyed, and he would be liable only for the consideration money expressed in said deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-6\">II. What was the effect of the declaration of trust executed by Carneal, March 16, 1822? The deed vests in him the legal title, by virtue of which he could recover possession. 7 Ohio, pt. 1, p. 76 \u2014pt. 2, p. 70; 15 Ohio, 408. If, then, as we maintain, the deed and declaration of trust were intended to defraud the creditors of the grantor Irwin, he could receive no aidln chancery to enforce the trust, but would be repelled. The complainants in both bills\u2014his heirs at law\u2014are in no better condition than he was. 15 Ohio, 430; 4 Bibb, 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-7\">This brings us to consider the document executed by Irwin and Longworth, and deposited with Caracal. It is no part of the deed to Carneal, nor the declaration of trust executed by him. It is not under seal, and it is made at a different time. It is in fact a distinct and independent agreement, binding upon Longworth and Irwin alone. 3 Bibb, 10; 10 Ohio, 438; 5 Ohio, 518; 9 Conn. 378. After this arrangement, the property remained in Carneal in trust, as before, except so far as that arrangement changed the rights of Longworth ; but, as between the original parties, it did not purify the original grant and certificate of fraud, and make them valid. 5 Cowen, *571. The trust might have been abandoned and re-arranged. 10 Ohio, 232; 12 Ohio, 339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b515-8\">This point has no other bearing upon the case than this: If it does not purify the original arrangement, it does not enable the complainants to invoke the aid of the chancellor in the execution of the trust, any more than the original arrangement would, and presents no grounds for their aid, or to prevent their rejection from a court of equity. But if it does purify the original arrangement, and cleanse it of all fraud, and make it tractable in a court of chancery as to Longworth, upon the principles announced in 8 Ohio, 533, then the complainants may ask the enforcement of the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Can the complainants assume they executed the order of January 11,1839, without consideration and under a mistake?</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-5\">1. As to the consideration. The order is under seal, and a seal always imports a consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\">But it may be said, we can not go out of the order to show the inducement to its execution. We believe it is every day\u2019s practice between parties, to go back of a deed to ascertain the real consideration. You can not contradict the consideration expressed in the deed to have passed, but you can show a further or other consideration. 1 A. K. Marsh. 582; 2 Ohio, 185; 5 Ohio, 258. When fraud is charged, the whole matter is open for examination. 15 Ohio, 600.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-7\">These complainants are certainly charged with constructive, if not actual notice. The legal effect of notice, constructive or actual, is the same. 2 Hill, 461. They are chargeable with their ancestor\u2019s knowledge of the trust. 2 Ohio, 386; 6 Ohio, 238; 7 Ohio, 80, pt. 2; 8 Ohio, 221; 15 Ohio, 430.

Neither of them professed, at the time, to act in that character. Whiteman acted as an heir, and Carneal as a trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-18\">2. They neither acted together, nor in concert, at any stage of *the business; yet the office of administrator, though confided to two, is a <em>joint </em>office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>3. Archibald Irwin sent his receipt to Carneal on the back of the original order, and that suggested to Carneal the propriety of taking a receipt from Longworth also. But Whiteman did not even <em>know </em>of this transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-5\">4. The administrators did not consider this property as part of the assets of their intestate, and never acted in respect of it, consequently, as administrators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-6\">5. Carneal, the trustee, required the order of <em>the heirs </em>before he' would convey; and it did not <em>then </em>occur to him, strangely, that Whiteman\u2019s signature and his own, <em>as </em>administrators, would suffice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-7\">6. The administrators and Archibald Irwin never had any dealings or account between them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-8\">7.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP0\">The questions presented in this case derive their chief importance from the supposed magnitude of the property in controversy. They are not new, and, of course, not difficult of solution, if we give to them the same effect, whether applied to estates of two thousand or two hundred thousand dollars value.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">I shall first examine the objection started to the <em>deed </em>under which Carneal held the land in controversy. It is said that this deed, did not transfer the <em>legal title </em>in the premises from Irwin to\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u25a0Carneal, because, in the granting clause, it purports to be a conveyance from William Irwin to <em>\u201cWilliam Irwin,\u201d </em>and not to Thomas D. Carneal. The objection is not tenable. If we recur to the deed itself, it sufficiently appears, even in <em>the premises, </em>that Irwin had no intention of retaining the fee in himself. It purports to be an indenture made between \u201c William Irwin, of the first part,\u201d and \u201c Thomas D. Carneal, of the second part.\u201d It acknowledges a consideration of five thousand'dollars as paid by Thomas D. Carneal to the said William Irwin, from which consideration springs the grant made, nominally, to <em>William, Irwin, </em>but completely repudiating him as the \u201cholder of the legal title,\u201d in language that can not be misunderstood, and which follows the description of the lands thus: \u201c And all the estate, right, title, interest, claim and demand of him, the said William Irwin, of, in, and to the said premises and every part thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The parties to a deed must be truly and sufficiently described, but conveyances are good when made to a grantee by a certain-designation, without the mention of either the Christian or surname, *for \u201c <em>id est cerium, quod potest reddi </em>cerium.\u201d 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201c Astriet, literal, and grammatical construction of an instrument, in its various parts, <em>taken separately, </em>would sometimes be <em>absurd, </em>sometimes contradictory, and frequently unjust; because against the manifest intention of the parties. But a liberal consideration is to be had of <em>the whole instrument, </em>in relation to the subject matter, to discover what was the true intention of the parties.\u201d Sumner\u2019s Adm\u2019r, etc. <em>v. </em>Williams, 8 Mass. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Certainly, if we adopt these rules of construction the objection disappears, for no intelligent mind can read this whole instrument and be at a loss for the true intent and meaning of the parties. But in a more critical view of the subject, the deed we are considering is effectual to pass the fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">William Irwin could not convey to himself. The insertion of his name as the grantee is a nullity. The deed then stands as if no grantee was named in, the \u201cpremises,\u201d and where that is the case, one named in the <em>\u201chabendum\u201d </em>may take. 2 Hilliard on Real Prop. 355, sec. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">\u201c If one give or grant land, <em>habendum, </em>to B., and his heirs, and he is not named in the premises, yet this is a good deed to make an estate in fee simple.\u201d Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone, chap. 5, p. 75,</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Here, then, we have a deed, absolute on its face, conveying the land in controversy to Thomas D. Carneal. It is admitted that Carneal did not pay, and that he was never expected to pay one dollar of the consideration money, named in the deed to William Irwin, for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">He says, in his deposition, that William Irwin called upon him in the year 1821, and said to him: \u201cWith your consent, I shall make to you a deed for some lots in Cincinnati, and for my interest in a tract of land near this city, held jointly by Wm. H. Harrison and myself. Mr. Nicholas Longworth will prepare the deed and hand it to you, executed by me, and take *from you such a paper as will make the conveyance <em>bona fide </em>and stand good in law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">For what purpose was the deed made? In August, 1838, Nicholas Longworth made a voluntary affidavit, in respect to the particulars of this transaction, and the same is now produced as evidence in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In this affidavit Longworth says he is \u201c as positive as he can be of any fact, after the lapse of so many years, that the sole reason given by William Irwin to him for the conveyance, was to prevent, certain claims against Irwin &amp; Son from becoming a lien on said real estate, and for no other reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">This is somewhat variant from the reason assigned in his principal answer, which was, that Irwin feared the sacrifice of this property by means of a judgment about to be obtained against him by the government, as the surety of Smith. \u2022 It is a matter of no moment, however, so far as the decision in this case is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Either version, in connection with what Longworth further says in the same affidavit, will seem to satisfy a mind of less than ordinary quickness of apprehension, that Irwin wished to \u201c hinder and delay creditors; and that Longworth at first consented to make Carneal a trustee of the property, ostensibly for his benefit as an indorser at the bank, but in reality, to hold the same for the use of Irwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">The explanation of Longworth, as given in his affidavit, is this :</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">\u201c I then told him that, to stand the test, the conveyance must be bottomed on a real <em>bona fide transaction. </em>\u2018If I have anything to do with it, it must be so that if called upon we can answer under oath. I am your indorser to the Bank of the United States, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Lave your mortgage ; 1 do not ask or claim other security. If you wish, I am willing the property shall be deeded to Carneal to save me harmless from any eventual loss as your indorser to the bank. This can not be ascertained for years, and I will hold the property safe; but remember, *we may both bo called to answer under oath ; if so conveyed we must <em>distinctly understand </em>that it is to be held <em>bona fide </em>for that purpose, and that you hereafter wholly rely on my pleasure whether to let you use or dispose of any of the property or not.\u2019 <em>To this he readily assented.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We do not entertain a doubt that up to the moment of the execution of the \u201csecond declaration of trust,\u201d upon an exhibition of the testimony adduced in this case, a court of chancery would have given to the general creditors of .William Irwin the benefit of the property embraced in his deed to Carneal. We lay entirely out of view, then, the first \u201cdeclaration\u201d signed by Thomas D. Carneal, as well because it was part and parcel of a scheme to delay general creditors, not warranted by the law, as because it never received, in many of its important details, the sanction of William Irwin, and was finally abandoned by the parties in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Nicholas Longworth may not impeach this deed of August 13, 1821, for fraud. As a <em>quasi creditor </em>of the grantor, he chose, by joining in the second declaration of trust, to regard it as valid collateral security for the bank debt, and will be bound thereby. G. &amp; W. Renick <em>v. </em>Bank of Chillicothe, 8 Ohio, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We now \u201ctake our departure\u201d with a deed of the premises from Irwin to Carneal, and a written \u201c declaration of trust,\u201d signed by Irwin and Longworth and lodged with Carneal, specifying that the estate transferred by said deed to Carneal \u201c shall continue as collateral security for Nicholas Longworth\u2019s indemnity as indorser of William Irwin, in the Bank of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">This is \u201cplain sailing.\u201d The immediate and direct securities given to the bank by Irwin, and supposed to be ample, were to be first exhausted. In the event of a <em>deficit, </em>however, the land and town lots held by Carneal as a <em>naked trustee </em>were to be made available for its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">At this period it must have been considered by all the parties in interest, that there was a large resulting trust in William '\u00a1\"-Irwin. He could, at any moment, call for a reconveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of all the lands held by Carneal, by paying his bank debt, or by procuring the release of Longworth in some other way. If matters were pushed to extremities, it was believed that the property directly pledged to the bank would sell for enough, or nearly enough, to liquidate the whole claim, and leave <em>intact </em>the greater part of the trust property.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In 1824 William Irwin died, and from that period onward the equitable interest of Irwin and his heirs se'ems to have become obscure. The fee of the land was in Carneal, and from 1829 the possession and apparent ownership existed in Longworth. It is true that Archibald Irwin occasionally gave demonstration that Longworth was a usurper of his exclusive right. But for long years, and whilst these complainants were passing from childhood to manhood, no voice was heard to whisper that the personal representatives or heirs at law of William Irwin had any available interest in this great property. Longworth was in possession and claimed the whole. Archibald Irwin, although out of possession, claimed the whole, or at least the claims of each were predicated upon an alleged expenditure of money for William Irwin to so great an amount as to place the property entirely beyond the hopes of the administrators on the estate, saying nothing of the heirs and devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In this condition of things, some time in the year 1838, or in the beginning of 1839, Archibald Irwin, through his friend N. G. Pendleton, proposed to Nicholas Longworth a division of the trust property. The proposition was accepted, and Carneal, the trustee, agreed to convey the lands in conformity with their arrangement, if the heirs of William Irwin would sign an. order <em>for his safety. </em>Col. Pendleton, the common friend of Nicholas Longworth and Archibald Irwin, applied to the latter to ascertain if his brothers, the present complainants, would probably sign the order. Archibald replied that \u201cthey would sign anything that he would, but that <em>they had no interest.\u201d </em>The order was obtained and the deeds were made, by which ^Thomas D. Carneal conveyed to Nicholas Longworth all the interest in the \u201chill tract\u201d which he had acquired by virtue of the deed from William Irwin; and to Archibald Irwin all the interest in the city lots which he had acquired from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Before the execution of this quitclaim deed by Carneal to Long-worth, no one had the boldness to deny the existence of an out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>standing equity of redemption in the heirs of William Irwin. Whether the property was worth the serious exertion of the right when made subject to the somewhat magnified claims of both Nicholas Longworth and Archibald Irwin, is another and different question. Longworth himself admitted, in the most explicit terms5 in his letter to C. K. Smith, that the heirs of Irwin had \u201can equity of redemption \u201d in this property.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">How has the conveyance from Carneal affected this right ? So far as it concerns the interest of the children of Louisa Whiteman, deceased, the condition of things is not changed at all, except that Thomas D. Carneal has devolved his trust upon Nicholas Long-worth, who will be made answerable to these children in his stead. If, however, by any unforeseen reverses of fortune, Longworth should no longer possess the ability to respond to this class of <em>cestui que </em>trusts, we do not see how Carneal can escape liability for a palpable breach of the trust. As it respects the complainants, wo find nothing in their written order of January 11, 1839, which purports to convey to Longworth their equity in the property. \u2022Upon its face, the instrument -is nothing more than a safeguard to Carneal in executing deeds to Longworth and Archibald Irwin. He procured the order to be made, not to pass an equity from the heirs of Irwin to anybody, but <em>for Ms own safety </em>in conveying the fee of the land to Longworth and Archibald Irwin. He is author-' ized by the order, so far as the complainants are concerned, to make the deeds. If we travel outside of the order, and attempt to establish, by evidence aliunde, that the object had in view by the parties was to place the whole title to the \u201chill tract,\u201d legal *and equitable, in Nicholas Longworth, we shall ascertain, by the same species of evidence, what is equally fatal to his claim, to wit, that William -Irwin and James F. Irwin, the complainants, were not acting in this business of directing conveyances with that knowledge and understanding of their just rights which they should possess before they can be bound thereby. 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 331; 1 Story\u2019s Eq., sec. 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Not only was there an error in reciting, in the paper itself, the uses to which the estate had been subjected in the hands of the trustee; but, if we may believe the testimony, these complainants were taught to believe, by their elder brother, that they had no interest in the trust property. Under such circumstances, wo should feel bound to interfere and set aside the instrument, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>did, indeed, contain an express relinquishment of their equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In Evans <em>v. </em>Lewellyn, 2 Brown\u2019s Ch. 151, a conveyance was set aside as improvidently entered into, where the plaintiffs were uninformed of their rights, though there was no actual fraud or imposition. The authorities are numerous to this effect, and I shall only cite, in addition, the strongly marked case of Hallett et al. <em>v. </em>Collins, recently decided in the Supreme Court of the United States, and reported in 10 How. 174: \u201c The assignee obtained releases, for an inadequate consideration, from the heirs of Collins, who had just come of age, were poor, and ignorant of their rights. These releases were hold void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">We are entirely satisfied that the defendant, Nicholas Longworth, holds the premises commonly called the \u201chill tract,\u201d consisting of one hundred acres, more or less, of land, near the city of Cincinnati, as the same were conveyed to him by Thomas D. Carneal, in the character of a mortgagee, for the security of any unpaid balance of the debt due to the late United States Branch Bank, at Cincinnati, by William Irwin, deceased, upon which the said Long-worth was surety for said Irwin.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The complainants, as heirs at law of said William Irwin, ^deceased, have a right to redeem the premises upon payment of the mortgage debt and interest. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">A decree will be rendered accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-9\">Hitchcock, C.
