The record presents a very meager statement of the evidence in the court below. The bill of exceptions contains the charge of the court to the jury, which was reduced to writing by the judge, and in which the evidence, with the charge of the court upon it, is presented as follows: \u201cAccording to the uncontradicted testimony in this case, the merchants of New Hope usually procure their goods from Cincinnati, and the usual mode of carriage is by return market-wagons. Very few goods are carried to New Hope by any other mode of conveyance. The defendant has, according to the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Whiting, for twelve or thirteen years; and according to the testimony of Fox for nearly twenty years, been engaged in carrying marketing from New Hope and that neighborhood to Cincinnati, and bringing goods from Cincinnati to New Hope; and he, when about going to Cincinnati with marketing, frequently asked the merchants of New Hope for return loads of goods. If you find from the testimony that the defendant has been so engaged for several years, he should be held responsible as a common carrier, although he was a farmer, and carrying not his principal business.\u201d A verdict and judgment having been rendered in the court below against the defendant below, he now prosecutes this writ of error.. The principal errors relied on, and upon which the decision of this court is made, are, that the court erred in their charge to the jury, and in overruling motion for new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-5\">Sellers &amp; Marshall, for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\">We hold that when no special contract'is made defining the risk and liability of the carrier or the care and diligence to be *used, the custom of the place is understood to be the law of the case.

As to who are to be deemed common carriers and who not, the rules of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>crimination are thus laid down in Story on Bailments, sec. 495. \u201cIt is not (as we have seen) every person who undertakes to carry goods for hire, that it is deemed a common carrier. A private person may contract with another for the carriage of his goods, and incur no responsibility beyond that of an ordinary bailee for hire, that is to say, the responsibility of ordinary diligence. To bring a person within the description of a common carrier, he must exercise it as a public employment; he must undertake to carry goods for persons *generally; and ho must hold himself out as ready to engage in the transportation of goods for hire, as a business, not as a casual occupation.\u201d The same doctrine is substantially laid down by Chancellor Kent. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 597, 598. The ease of Sheldon <em>v. </em>Robinson, 7 New Hampshire, 157, is a case bearing a very close analogy to the one now before the court. In that case it was proved of the defendant (who was sought to be charged as a common carrier for a package of money that had been intrusted to him to carry for hire), that he was a stage-driver for a company who run a line of stages between Boston and Portsmouth; that he was constantly in the habit of cari-ying packages of money <em>for </em>hire, from one place to the other, for all persons who chose to employ him. The court in that case decided that the evidence did not make the defendant a common carrier, inasmuch as it did not show that that was his public employment, and that he undertook to carry money and goods generally; although it did show that he had taken all that was offered to him. The case of Hennel &amp; Short <em>v. </em>Pettijohn, 2 Harrington, 48, is a decision to the same effect. We think it will be found in most of the cases, where the question has arisen, that a clear distinction has been kept up between such persons as hold themsedves out to the world as engaged to carry goods generally, and at all times, and those who may occasionally, or in a single instance, undertake to carry for hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The common carrrior is regarded, in some respects, as a public employe; ho has hold himself out to the world as such, and hence he is required to carry all that may be offered to him, provided a reasonable compensation be tendered, and if he refuse, when ho has the convenience to carry, he will be liable to an action for such refusal. The reason of his being held to such rigid responsibility, in case the goods be lost, arises from his public character Having placed himself in the channels of commerce, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>undertaken to carry for the community generally, he necessarily has intrusted to his care the goods of those who can have no personal knowledge of his character, and who *have not the power to make any special contract with him. And were it not for these and similar considerations, we see no justice in holding a person who engages to carry goods to any more rigid responsibility for the loss of the goods, than any other bailee for hire. The general rule in reference to a bailee for hire\u2014that he is only answerable for the loss of the goods where he has been wanting in ordinary care and diligence\u2014is in most cases a reasonable and just one, and is only departed from in the case of a common carrier, on account of the peculiar relation that he has assumed to the community. Now we see no reason why the law applicable! to a common carrier should be applied to a farmer who makes a' personal application to a merchant for a load of goods, on his return trip from market. The merchant has it in his power to make such special bargain as he chooses, \u00e1s to what shall be the liability of tho farmer in case the goods are lost. The farmer has assumed no character to the community entitling him to peculiar confidence, and the merchant is left, as in ordinary cases, to an inquiry as to his character and qualifications. Nor do we suppose it would make any difference how many applications of this kind had been made by the party thus carrying, or to how many different persons they may have been made\u2014they would still remain so many special and individual transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In the case before us, as will be seen above, it is merely stated that the defendant, for a number of years, had been engaged in carrying marketing from New Hope and that neighborhood, to Cincinnati, and bringing goods from Cincinnati to New Hope, and that when about going to Cincinnati with marketing, ho frequently asked the merchants of New Hope for return loads of goods. The court charged the jury that if they found these facts to exist they should hold the defendant liable as a common carrier, although he might be a farmer, and carrying not his regular business. In this we think tho court of common pleas erred. There is nothing in this state of facts to show that the business of tho defendant was that of a common carrier, or that ho hold himself out to tho world as such. It is not stated *to whom the marketing and the goods that the defendant was in the habit of carrying belonged; we presume, however that the goods belonged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>to the merchants of New Hope and the neighborhood. Thia carrying, however, was only what every farmer would like to do* to earn something by getting a back load. Nor do we think that his frequently applying to the merchants of New Hope for a back load, at all alters the case. This was merely offering his services to the few merchants that resided in the village, and was not an offer to do business for the public generally. We have been referred to the case of Gordon <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 1 Watts &amp; Serg. 285, on the authority of which it is said the court of common pleas acted in making their decision. That case, wo think, sustains the ruling of the common pleas; but we think it opposed to the current of authorities on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The judgment of the common pleas will be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
