We claim-that the court erred in their instruction as to the advice of counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">After the main charge had been given, at the request of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the judge instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIf <em>\u25a0after </em>the advice of counsel, and before the delivering of the warrant, any new material facts came to the knowledge of the defendants, <em>tending </em>to lessen the <em>probability </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s guilt, and which were not communicated to the counsel for his further opinion, then the advice previously given could be no protection to the defendants for thus delivering the warrant, and further prosecuting the plaintiff.\u201d Stone <em>v. </em>Swift, 4 Pick. 389.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-7\">Henry B.

Beebe <em>v. </em>Bull, 12 Wend. 504.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-11\"><em>Bill of exceptions </em>\u201c <em>B&gt;.\u201d </em>The point made is this : The transcript of the justice shows the issuing of the warrant \u201cAugust 4, 1849,\u201d and its return of service, \u201c October 30.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-12\">The questions put to the witnesses (the Scotts), in Indiana, are as to the statements made by the defendants below, or one of them, while in Indiana in October, 1849, as to the commencement of the prosecution. And the answers show that <em>at that date, </em>according to the defendant\u2019s statements, the prosecution was not commenced, but would be as soon as they got back to Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-13\">It will be seen by proofs, that the warrant was not delivered to the constable for execution until October 26; at which time the defendant, who had been in Indiana, was present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-14\">The court, in charging the jury, held that the testimony now excepted to, was \u201c not sufficient to contradict \u201d the record of the justice. So far as counsel had claimed the evidence for this purpose, it was distinctly overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-15\">The evidence was, with special instruction, permitted to remain to the jury for other purposes claimed by the plaintiff below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>Bill of exceptions \u201c G.\u201d </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> No exception, in fact, was taken to the charge of the court, until after the verdlet was rendered by the jury ; nor until after the motion for new trial had been made. And, although on its face the bill does not specifically show <em>when </em>the exception was taken; and, although ingeniously dated \u201c November term, 1850,\u201d yet, that it was long subsequent to the rendition of the verdict, is shown by the Adates in the transcript of the journal entries,, and the filing of the several papers, viz : date of trial in transcript, December 23, 1850 ; date of filing motion for new trial, December 23, 1850 ; date of filing <em>bill of exceptions </em>\u201c <em>G,\u201d </em>January 24, 1851. It is further shown to have been subsequent to the verdict and motion for new trial, by the fact that the misdirection of the judge was not assigned as one of the causes for now trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">\u201cExceptions to the charge of the court to the jury can not be taken after the verdict.\u201d Anderson <em>v. </em>Hill, 12 Smede &amp; Marshall, 679; Brutton <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 3 Barr, 44; Read <em>v. </em>McAllister, 8 Wend. 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-6\">We also object to several of these specifications, upon the ground that no special request was made to the court, by the plaintiffs in error, to charge the law to be as claimed, on the particular point. It has been decided at this term, in the case of Jones <em>v. </em>The State of Ohio, that, to hold the failure of the court to charge upon particular points of law arising in the case a ground of error, the court should have been requested to instruct upon the point. The same doctrine is held in Law <em>v. </em>Merrills, 6 Wend. 268; 6 Cranch, 233; 2 Pet. 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-7\">We will, however, proceed to consider the several specifications made, and see if this exception be well taken. And,</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-8\">1. As to whether the court erred in their definition of <em>probable cause.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-9\">We refer to 12 Conn. 229; Willis <em>v. </em>Noys, 12 Pick. 324; Munn <em>v. </em>Dupont, 3 Wash.

The second objection to the charge of the court is, that <em>\u201c </em>the court erred in not instructing the jury whether the facts *relied on, to make out probable cause in law, do or do not amount to probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">This question has been repeatedly made to the courts of England and of the United States; and it has been invariably determined that, although there are some cases in which a judge may be expected to tell the jury whether or not the defendant had probable cause, yet, when it consists partly of matter of fact, and partly of matter of law\u2014and especially when the facts are, in whole or in part, deductions and inferences from circumstances, or are contested\u2014the question is, properly, and we may add necessarily, loft to the jury, under tho general instruction of the court, upon the law. James <em>v. </em>Phelps, 11 Adol. &amp; Ellis, 483; 39 E. Com. L. 150; McDonald <em>v. </em>Rooke, 2 Bing. N. C. 217; 29 Eng. C.

(pt. 1) 26; Dodge <em>v. </em>Brittain, 1 Meigs, 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">3. The third exception to the charge of the court is, that the court erred in not instructing the jury, that the binding over by the magistrate was <em>conclusive </em>evidence of probable cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-8\">The cases cited distinguish in unequivocal terms between <em>the judgment of a court of final jurisdiction, </em>and a binding over by an <em>examining court.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-9\">In Johnston <em>v. </em>Sutton, 1 Tenn. 505, 506, the ruling of the court in Reynolds <em>v. </em>Kennedy, is considered, and much qualified and weakened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-10\">Whitney <em>v. </em>Peckham, 15 Mass. 243, next cited by plaintiffs, was an action for malicious prosecution, in a case of assault and battery. The alleged prosecution was before a magistrate, who, under the laws of Massachusetts, had final jurisdiction to try and determine the ease. The justice found the party guilty, and assessed a fine against him; but, on <em>appeal, </em>*he was acquitted. It was held, that the justice \u201chaving <em>final </em>jurisdiction\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u25a0case, and having found the plaintiff guilty, there was conclusive evidence of probable cause. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">In the case cited from 14 Maine, 362, the justice had final jurisdiction, and that fact was relied upon by the counsel in the case, and doubtless influenced and controlled the decision of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">4. We come now to consider the fourth specification of error in the charge of the court below\u2014that the court erred as to the <em>advice of counsel.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">It is conceded, that to shield one\u2019s self by advice of counsel, a full, clear, and distinct statement of the facts, known to the prosecutor, must be made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">Can it then be pretended, that, after receiving this advice and taking out the warrant, and new <em>material </em>facts have come to his knowledge, the prosecutor will be protected against a subsequent delivery of the writ and arrest of the defendant, under the shield of advice obtained before the new matter came to his knowledge ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-9\"><em>Bill of exceptions UE.\u201d </em>It is contended by counsel for plaintiffs in error, that the court had no power to correct a mistake in their record, made at the same term, if it happen to be in a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-10\">It has been the frequent practice of the courts of this state to correct mistakes, or misstatements, in bills of exceptions. 10 Wend. 254.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-11\">We also refer to the following authorities:</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-12\">\u201cThe inferior court, at any time during the term, may supply a defect or omission in a bill of exceptions, by statement on the record.\u201d Givens <em>v. </em>Bradley, 3 Bibb, 195.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL5\">*\u201c If a bill of exceptions is taken to the ruling of the judge admitting certain evidence, yet, if no evidence is given under the ruling, the bill ought to be given up.\u201d Bunting <em>v. </em>Allen, 3 Harrington, 299.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\"> \u201c The question of probable cause is a mixed proposition of law and fact: whether the circumstances alleged to show it probable or not probable are true, and existed, is a matter of fact; but whether, supposing them true, they amount to a probable cause, is a question of law. It therefore falls within the legitimate province of the jury to investigate the truth of the facts offered in evidence, and the justice of the inferences to be drawn from such facts; whilst at the same time they receive the law from the judge that, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cording as they find the facts proved or not proved, and the inferences warranted or not, there was reasonable and probable ground for the prosecution or the reverse; and this rule holds, however complicated and numerous the facts may be.\u201d Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 45, citing Johnstone v.

It certainly gave notice to the party of an intention to take depositions in the suit then on trial, and it is difficult to see what inconvenience could arise from taking, on the same day, and at the same place, other depositions between other plaintiffs and the same defendants, if there was sufficient time to perform the whole work. If the rights of the party were-prejudiced by reason of the attempt to take too many depositions within a short space of time, the showing of that fact would have had weight with the court. In this case, the defendants paid no attention to the notice. They did not appear at all, and, of course had no reason to object that too much was sought to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">These formal objections, however, should have been noted upon the depositions, within the rules of court, to have *entitled them to any regard. They came too late, after the jury was impaneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">This bill of exceptions \u201cA\u201d also shows that the deposition was permitted to go to the jury, although objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel as containing incompetent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">By a subsequent entry upon the journal, the court corrected an error that had intervened here, and show that the deposition was-not, in fact, read as evidenee-in-ehief, at all, and but a single paragraph as rebutting testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">In bill of exceptions \u201cB,\u201d it is said that plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on cross-examination, put a question to the witness on the stand, upon-an assumption that had no existence in the testimony in chief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The language was this : \u201cYou have stated that John Marlow said it must have been the Scotts that had burned the wheat, and yon have also stated that it was pretty much in the mouth of everybody that it was the Scotts. I now ask you what reasons were mentioned by any of the persons alluded to, for suspecting the Scotts ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">It is objected that the witness had said nothing about any conversation except the one he himself had with John Marlow.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Wo have but a small portion of the testimony given to us in the ' bill of exceptions, but, upon the supposition that the counsel for plaintiffs in error is correct in his statement of what the testimony was, there could be no impropriety in allowing the question to be put. The witness was on his cross-examination, and consequently much latitude was allowed to the examiner. But aside from that, he had said that Marlow threw suspicion on the Scotts. The attorney of Marlow might, with propriety, inquire, what reasons were given at the time for such suspicions.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The charge of the court is contained in bill of exceptions \u201c C.\u201d The judge gives sundry definitions of the term \u201cprobable cause,\u201d as laid down by distinguished jurists, and then, after directing the jury to ascertain how far the facts are proved, says: <em>\u201c </em>Apply to them the test, the rule of law which I have laid down to you. Ask yourselves conscientiously\u2014\u2018Are the *facts and circumstances that we have found, so strong in themselves as to warrant an impartial, ingenuous, and reasonable man, of common capacity, with the caution usually exercised by such a man in the defendant\u2019s situation, but not under the influence of any improper motive, to <em>believe </em>the plaintiff guilty of the crime charged against him?\u2019 If they are sufficient to warrant that <em>belief, </em>in such a mind, that conclusion, when deliberately arrived at by you, will terminate your labors; and you will return to this court your verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u201c If your conclusion on the facts relied on to show the existence of reasonable or probable cause, shall be adverse to the defendants, your deliberations will proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">We have examined this whole charge with some care, and really can see no just cause for complaint by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">The judge has been somewhat diffuse in giving his views on \u201cprobable cause,\u201d but they do not substantially differ from the sensible and concise definition laid down by the court in Munn <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Dupont, 3 Wash. C. C. 37. \u201cWhat, thon, is the meaning of tho term \u2018probable cause?\u2019 We answer, a reasonable ground of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in the belief that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he is charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We are content to adopt this last, as the definition of what in tho law constitutes \u201c probable cause.\u201d There is no force in the objection that the judge did not instruct the jury that the facts relied on by defendants below, did, or did not amount to probable \u00abausc. \u201cProbable cause \u201d is a mixed question of law and fact; and if the facts are contested, the court must leave them to the jury with instructions as to what is \u201cprobable cause.\u201d It is insisted, in the third p[ace, that the judge committed an error in refusing to instruct the jury, that the \u201c binding ,over \u201d by the magistrate was conclusive evidence of probable cause. It is sufficient to say, that it is the opinion of this court that the judge went far enough when he said to the jury, that after an exhibition of the affidavit, warrant, and ^transcript of the justice\u2019s docket, showing that the accused was bound over to court, it was incumbent on the plaintiff below to show affirmatively that there was no reasonable or probable cause for the prosecution. The notion could not be countenanced for a moment, that a \u201c binding over to court\u201d by an examining officer merely, should be taken as conclusive evidence of probable cause. It was claimed in behalf of defendants below, that they acted under the advice of counsel in prosecuting the plaintiff. It appeared that the warrant was taken out on August 4, 1849, but the arrest was not made under it until the 30th day of the following October. The judge instructed the jury that \u201c if, after the advice of counsel, and before tho delivery of the warrant, new and material facts came to the knowledge of the defendants, tending to lesson the probability of the plaintiff\u2019s guilt, and which were not communicated to the counsel for his further opinion, then the advice previously given could be no protection to the defendants for thus delivering the warrant and further prosecuting the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">This is the fourth specification of error in the charge of the court, and we are clearly of opinion that the instruction was right. If, under the advice of counsel, a person swears out a warrant against his neighbor, and, before he causes the arrest, shall ascertain his innocence of tho charge, it will be difficult to see by what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>system of ethics he can be justified in'depriving that neighbor of his liberty, even though he was protected by professional advice,, in taking out the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In bill of exceptions \u201cD,\u201d it is said that John Marlow gave in evidence a transcript of a justice of the peace, showing that the criminal prosecution against him was commenced on August <em>4, A. d. </em>1849; that he then gave parol evidence tending to show that Jacob Ash had made declarations in Indiana, in the month .of October, setting forth that he had not then commenced his prosecution against Marlow, but should do so on his return to Ohio. This, it is claimed, is impeaching a record by parol evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The objection is really too trifling to merit serious refutation, *but it is very much in character with the rest of the case, as presented by plaintiffs in error. It became important to show that between the issuing of the warrant in August, and the arrest of the accused persons in October, the defendants below had become possessed of information that should have exonerated the plaintiff below from the charge preferred against him. The transcript of the justice was not impeached. The parol testimony was entirely consistent with the facts set forth in that documents It only served to show that Jacob Ash treated the prosecution as commenced at the time of the arrest, and not at the date of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In bill of exceptions \u201cE,\u201d complaint is made that the court caused an entry to be made on the record, doing away with the-force of bill of exceptions \u201cA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">This matter has been already noticed. The court retains full control over every part of its record until the close of the trial term, and may, on any day and at any moment, cause corrections to be made, to comport with truth and justice, as well in bills of exceptions as in their own journal, which is signed every morning by the president judge. We are satisfied that the trial below, although excessively tedious, was nevertheless fair in every particular, and that the rulings of the court were consonant to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
