The section included land on each side of the river Muskingum and on each side of Licking creek.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-9\">The town plat was exclusively confined to the east side of the Muskingum. Twenty lots were, however, subsequently laid out on the west side, and north of Licking, forming what is commonly called West\u2019Zanesvillo; and additions were made to the town, on the east side, by Mclntire and others, upon Congress land adjoining the section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-10\">An act to incorporate the town of Zanesville was passed January 21,1814.

Converse, for city of Zanesville :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-12\">I claim that the true construction of the will brings within tho range of selection by the trustees of the charity, the poor ^children of Zanesville as it now exists, and may hereafter extend itself; and that this bequest to purposes of general charity is not to be restricted to the territory that was included within the narrow limits of the corporation of Zanesville, as defined at the time of the death of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-14\">1. The language of the will itself, in the clause creating the charity, speaks that intent. The bequest is for the benefit of the poor children of the town of Zanesville generally, not only as the town chanced then to be, but as it might be in all future time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The original charter of the town, in force at the date of tho will, was \u201csubject to such alterations and regulations as the legislature might think proper from time to. time to make.\u201d The testator must, therefore, be taken to have contemplated the exercise of this power at some future day, by way of an enlargement of the limits. There are no restrictive words in the bequest, binding down the gift to the particular blocks or squares at that time embraced within the corporate limits of the town. The terms of the will are comprehensive and general. This bequest is not one that exhausts itself at once in persons particularly designated. The bequest is to the trustees, who are ascertained and certain\u2014the beneficiaries are not designated\u2014only a class, from which they are at a future time to be taken. The selection is lodged in the trustees. The only restriction is, that the beneficiaries shall be taken from among \u201c the poor children in the town of Zanesville.\u201d If, <em>at the time of </em>selection, those \u201c fixed upon \u201d as subjects of the testator\u2019s bounty, are \u201c poor children of Zanesville,\u201d the restriction is satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-5\">In the interpretation of charitable bequests, greater liberality of construction obtains than in cases of ordinary legacies. The construction that gives the limits of Zanesville as they are, or may be, as the limit of the range of this charity, is more reasonable than that which fixes as such limit unalterably the boundaries of Zanesville as it chanced to be at the date of the will or testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">2. If we look to the condition of things at the time of the execution of the will, and to the relation in which the testator *stood to Zanesville, it is very clear that any such restriction as limits this charity to a part only of what now constitutes or may at any time hereafter constitute Zanesville, is repugnant to the general intent of tho testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-7\">Parol evidence is admissible, to show the condition of things at the time of the execution of the will, and the relation of the testator to tho town of Zanesville. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Boys <em>v. </em>Williams, 2 Russ. &amp; Mylne, 689; S. C., 13 Eng. Cond. Ch. 232, 235; Tucker <em>v. </em>The Seamen\u2019s Aid Society et al., 7 Met. 205 ; 1 Jarman on Wills, 358, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>363; Gresley\u2019s Eq.

Mclntire owned other lands adjoining \u201c Zano\u2019s Grant,\u201d near to and adjoining Zanesville, which was laid out on said \u201cgrant.\u201d The testator evidently contemplated that the town would expand itself beyond the limits which served its municipal purposes prior to his death. He and others laid out additions after the making of his will. The fund which is to support this charity is yet to be increased by the provisions of the will, out of the proceeds of the testator\u2019s real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-6\">In view of all the facts, the construction claimed is the natural and obvious one. The liberal spirit in which the bequest was made, calls for the like liberal spirit in its administration. I invoke that construction of the will, which will widen, not narrow, the channel in which this munificent charity shall flow forever.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> See Hildebrand <em>v. </em>Fogle, 20 Ohio, 147. In Wigram on Extrinsic Evidence, in aid of the interpretation of wills, seven propositions are maintained as the results of principle and authority, and as illustrating the classes of cases-in which extrinsic evidence'may be received. It is said that \u201cevery claimant under a will has a right to require that a court of construction shall, by means-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of extrinsic evidence, place itself in the situation of the testator, the meaning of whose language it is called upon to declare.\u201d The authorities are referred to in notes. See 2 Hew Library of Law and Equity, 96; and see Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 300; 2 Just. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AV0I\">*Spalding, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL3\">The petitioners invoke the aid of this court in giving a construction to the wifi of John Mclntire, wherein a munificent bequest was made for the establishment of a school in the town of Zanesville, \u201c for the use of the poor children in said town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The single question raised and discussed is, whether the funds placed under the control of the president and directors of the Zanesville Canal and Manufacturing Company, for the support of such school, are so to be administered as to confine the benefit of them exclusively to poor children residing in the district which constituted the town of Zanesville, at the decease of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">It is a rule in equity, that a gift of real or personal estate; \u25a0either <em>inter vivos, </em>or by will, to promote education, is a charity. It is also considered as a settled rule, that such a gift to a charitable use is to receive a most liberal construction. It is not like penal enactments and contracts made in restraint of some general right, both of which are to be construed with the utmost strictness.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">If an act of the general assembly, passed in 1815, inflicted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>penalty upon any person who should vend spirituous liquors within the town of Zanesville, its operation would bo restricted to such offenses as might be committed within the corporate limits as they existed at that date. Such is the spirit of our decision made at this term, in Robert Hall <em>v. </em>The State of Ohio. So^ where the plaintiff sought to restrain the defendant from carrying on the profession of a surgeon-dentist in \u201cGreat Russell street,\u201d London, Malian <em>v. </em>May, 13 Meeson &amp; Welsby, 511. The defendant had bound himself not to practice in \u201c London.\u201d The city of London is an ancient city and county of itself, with well-defined limits\u2014\u25a0 and \u201cGreat Russell street\u201d is not within such city limits. The court said: \u201c Words were to be construed according to their strict and primary acceptation, unless from the context of the instrument, and the intention of the parties to be collected from it, they ^appear to be used in a different sense. London in its proper sense as the city of London, was intended, and not London in its popular or colloquial sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The difficulty that exists in the application of the bounty of John Mc-Intire, has arisen from the fact that when he made his will, and at the time of his decease, Zanesville had been erected into a town-corporate, with certain well-defined boundaries, which have been subsequently, from time to time, extended, until finally it has attained a city charter, covering a greatly increased territory and population. If there had been no act of incorporation whatever, and the people living upon \u201c Zane\u2019s Grant\u201d had con-i nuod to call their place of residence by that good old Saxon name, \u201ca town,\u201d the trustees of this charity would have had no trouble in designating its beneficiaries, . . . for a town is a town still, whether it \u201c consist of <em>twenty houses </em>or of <em>twenty </em>thousand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">So says the philologist, (Webster\u2019s Dict. Unabridged), and so says the jurist (8 Carrington <em>&amp; </em>Payne, 612), Pattison, Judge: \u201cI do not see how I can say that 1 town \u2019 is to have two different meanings. It is very difficult to define what is a town in ordinary meaning. It varies from day to day; by the erection of new houses.\u201d We think the increase in population, and the consequent extension in territorial limits of Zanesville, furnishes no sufficient reason for restricting the application of the Melntire school fund to the \u201cblocks and lots\u201d laid out and incorporated at the time of the testator\u2019s decease, if he did not thus limit his benevolence, by the precise lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>guago of his bequest. That he did not use words requiring at our hands such a restricted application, we are well persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The testator has directed in his will, that the rents, issues, and profits of his estate be appropriated by his trustees to the use and support of a school \u201c which they are to establish in the town of Zanesville, for the use of <em>the poor children in said town.\" </em>The advocates of strict construction claim that Mr. Melntire intended to confine the selection of the objects of his bounty to the corporation of Zanesville as it existed in 1815. *Has he said so in his will ? So far from it, ho has omitted to use the name given to that corporation by the act creating it, which was passed January 21, 1814, to wit, the \u201c Borough of Zanesville,\u201d and has used the words \u201c town of Zanesville,\u201d as we think in their old, popular, and colloquial sense, which would designate the cluster of log cabins first erected on the village-plat of John Melntire and Jonathan Zane, as well as the wide-spread city with its teeming jjopulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">If wo travel out of the will, however, and take a survey of the position that the testator occupied in respect to the inhabitants of Zanesville, at the time he conceived the generous purpose of making this bequest, every doubt, it seems to us, must be put at rest. This the law permits us to do. Tea, further\u2014\u201cit is obviously essential,\u201d says a learned elementary writer, \u201cthat the judicial expositor should place himself as fully as possible in the situation of the person whose language he has to interpret; and, guided by the light thus thrown on the testamentary scheme, he may find himself justified in departing from a strict construction of the testator\u2019s language, without allowing <em>conjectural interpretation to usurp the place of judicial exposition.\" </em>1 Jarman on Wills, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u201cAt an early day,\u201d says the counsel, \u201cJohn McIntire, the testator, and Jonathan Zane, boing the owners, as tenants in common, of the section of land known as \u2018 Zano\u2019s Grant,\u2019 on the Muskingum river, laid out, on a portion of said section, the town of Zanesville. Some time afterward they made partition, allotting to each in severalty, all the section except that part of it embraced within their plat of Zanesville. No partition of the lots in said town was made until after the death of Melntire, when it was effected upon the application of Zane. Melntire also owned other lands adjoining \u2018Zane\u2019s Grant,\u2019 near to, and some of them adjoining the town of Zanesville. He directed, by his will, his executors to sell, so soon after his death as they might think proper, all his real estate, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>that,part of it lying within \u2018Zane\u2019s Grant,\u2019 which last should be sold after the death of his wife. He directed that the proceeds of *such sales should be invested in a particular manner; and, upon the happening of the contingencies mentioned in the will, the rents, issues, and profits of all his estate were to bo appropriated to the support of his charity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Zanesville was then in its infancy. It was but beginning to grow; and it could not but have been contemplated by its original founder and proprietor, that it would, in process of time, expand itself greatly beyond the limits which, at that early day, served its municipal purposes. In fact, the bill shows that after the date of his will, to wit, on April 21, 1815, Mr. Mclntire laid out an addition to the town, and caused the plat to be recorded. His executors laid out another addition upon lands appropriated to this charity, subsequent to his death, but in pursuance of a plan formed by the testator himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">It further appears from the bill, that as early as 1809, Mr. Mclntire laid out'lots numbered one to twenty, inclusive, on the west side of the Muskingum River, calling them \u201c additional lots annexed to the town of Zanesvillea plat of which was recorded prior to the passage of the act of incorporation of the date of January 21, 1814.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">It seems that none of these last-mentioned additions to the town of Zanesville, laid out by Mr. Mclntire, and by his executor, are within the corporate limits of the <em>\u201c </em>Borough of Zanesville,\u201d as it existed at the death of the testator; and, of consequence, if the rule of strict construction prevails, the children of citizens living in those precincts, although never so poor, must be debarred the privilege of attending the school. We do not thus interpret the will of John Mclntire. His object was to create a perpetual fund, the magnitude of which would be commensurate with the growth of the place and the wants of the people, to supply the means of education\u2014not to the rich\u2014not to those in moderate circumstances \u2014but <em>to the poor children </em>in the town of Zanesville. A noble bequest! But could a heart .capable of such disinterested philanthropy, circumscribe, by mathematical lines, in the same town, the ^objects of its bounty ? More especially would the testator be supposed incapable of doing this in a growing manufacturing district, where the very class of people he is seeking by his bounty to elevate, are, by the pressure of circumstances, constantly forced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>back from the center to the circumference; where, and where only, their poverty will allow them to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>Wo </em>advise that the trustees of this charity be not restricted in the selection of the \u201cpoor children \u201d who are to be admitted into their school, by any arbitrary lines, whether of town corporate, borough, or city; but that the fund be administered according to the dictates of that enlarged philanthropy which we may suppose actuated its founder in making the bequest. In this spirit let the almoners of John Mclntire\u2019s bounty select the beneficiaries indiscriminately, from Zanesville, according to the popular acceptation of the term\u2014not Zanesville on the east of the Muskingum\u2014not Zanesville on the west\u2014not Zanesville as it was\u2014not Zanesville as it is ; but Zanesville as it may be found whenever the grateful \u2022duty is to be performed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
