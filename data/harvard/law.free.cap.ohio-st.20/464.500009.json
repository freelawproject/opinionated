There was no service of process upon the infant defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-8\">2. Tho personal representatives of William Cotterell were not made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-9\">3. The bond or agreement of Cotterell was nothing more than a security for the payment of the one hundred dollars; and thero was no finding by said decree of the amount duo thereon, and there was no day given for the payment of the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-10\">4. Tho decree does not find that the assignments of said bond, \u2022by Morris and Long, were, in fact, made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-11\">5. The decree does not find the execution and delivery of the \u2022bond by Cotterell to Morris.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-12\">6. If the bond had been properly executed, and the assignments, duly made, all that the complainant would have been entitled to by said decree would have been the amount specified therein, with interest; and a day should have been given for the payment \u2022of tho same, and, in default of payment, a sale of the land ordered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>*7. The decree does not find that the money due on said bond had not been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">8. The decree directed said infant defendants to convey said land, when William Cotterell had nothing but a life estate therein, by the will of Thomas Cotterell, and said defendants, by said will,, had the- fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-6\">9. No day was given said defendants to show cause against the decree, after their arrival at full age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-7\">Sundry depositions are introduced on either side, but if strictly admissible in a proceeding of this sort, they are of no essential importance, any further than to show the respective ages of the present complainants, Moses and John Cotterell, and the nature of the indebtedness of William Cotterell to Thomas Morris, at the time the bond was executed. It appears from the deposition of Joseph Cotterell, who was the brother of William Cotterell, deceased, that Moses Cotterell was born in the year 1824, and John in the year 1827. The bill of review was filed September 19, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-8\">On cross-examination by defendants in error, Joseph Cotterell was asked by them this question: Did not William Cotterell give Thomas Morris his interest in this land for his services in the case in which he was charged with killing his wife? To which the witness answered, that he understood he was to give him $100; and to secure that amount, he <em>signed </em>him his interst in the land. The will of Thomas Cotterell gives this land to his wife, Peggy Cotterell, for life; remainder to his son William, and his heirs. Peggy Cotterell lived to an advanced age, and died in 1847 or 1848.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-9\">Fishbaok, Swing &amp; Fishback, for complainants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-10\">I. It is the well-settled doctrine, both of English and American courts, that whenever the rights of infants are sought to be affected by proceedings in court, they must be brought before the court by actual or constructive process upon them, or publication of notice against them.

The <em>third </em>and <em>sixth </em>errors ar\u00e9 of the same character, and present the question :\u2014What was the true nature and character of the obligation from Cotterell to Morris? It was a mere security, in the character of a mortgage, for the payment of money ; and was so intended by the parties.

The <em>fourth, fifth, </em>and <em>seventh </em>errors are of the *samc character. The execution of the bond and the assignments thereof should have been duly proven, and those facts should have been specially found in the decree. The answer of a guardian <em>ad litem </em>is not binding upon infant defendants, and no decree can be pronounced on its admissions without service of process. Wright <em>v. </em>Miller, 1 Sandf.

Lowe, for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-7\">Errors 3, 6, and 7 do not exist in fact, because nothing was <em>ever due </em>on the bond\u2014there is no promise or obligation on the part of Cotterell <em>to pay </em>the $100 mentioned in it. The bond was never regarded between the parties to it, nor intended by them as a security for <em>the payment </em>of $100. Morris, with this bond in his possession, could not have sued Cotterell either on the bond or for his professional services. The tender of a deed would have discharged it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-8\"><em>A debt must exist </em>before it can be secured, and this instrument can not be considered a mortgage or a security until there *is Some debt to secure. The title-bond provides for nothing but the making of a deed; a court of equity could compel a conveyance, but not the payment of money. The principle sustained by the authorities is, that, if an instrument is given to secure a debt, it may be regarded as a mortgage ; but no such case is made out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-9\">As to the ninth error it is claimed that the decree did give three months to the minors, after arriving at the age of majority, to execute a quitclaim deed, and during that time they could show cause against the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-10\">The errors assigned relate, <em>first, </em>to the jurisdiction of the court over the infants at the time of decree; and <em>secondly, </em>to the character of the obligation upon which the decree was rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-11\">I. The original bill shows that a praecipe for a subpena, against all the defendants, was filed, and it was doubtless issued and served, though it does not appear in the record. In Trumpon <em>v. </em>Barton, 18 Grisw. Ohio, 425, the court say \u201c they would hardly reverse a former decree unless some benefit might by possibility result to those seeking it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b409-12\">II. The authorities cited do not sustain the position that this bond is a mortgage. There are authorities in point that it is not. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Walton &amp; Payne <em>v. </em>Coulston, 1 McLean, 120; 9 Pet. 62 ; 7 Cranch. 218, 237; 9 Ohio, 28; Glover <em>v. </em>Paine, 19 Wend. 518; Flemming <em>v. </em>Litton, Dev. &amp; Battel, 623; Sug. on Vend. 187; 5 Leigh, 434; Hickman <em>v. </em>Cantrell, 9 Yerg. 172; 1 Mad.

This bond was but a conditional sale, or rather a sale with a privilege to repurchase; within a given time, at a stated price.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-6\">Spalding, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arl3\">In the view wo take of this case, it only becomes necessary to notice the third ground of error, in the ^assignment of errors by counsel for complainants, to wit, that the agreement was nothing more than security for the payment of the $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">It is true that it nowhere appears among the papers that the infant heirs were served with process in the suit which so vitally affected their interests; and, under other circumstances, this omission would have received our serious consideration. As it is, the whole case will be made to turn upon the character of the instrument executed by William Ootterell to Thomas Morris, on April 7, 1829.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The court of common pleas of Clermont county, in making their decree, treated it as a conditional sale. In this we think they erred. The deed is in equity a mortgage. Upon its face it is really no more than a security for the payment of $100 in two years, although it commences with an undertaking to convey land-. This undertaking to make conveyance of the land, however, it must be remarked, is exceedingly limited. It is only in default of payment of the $100 by the time stipulated (two years), that the obligation to convey becomes absolute. How does this differ in effect from the ordinary mortgage deed? In the case of this latter instrument, the lands are first actually transferred with covenants of seizin and warranty; but then a simple condition is inserted, that if a certain sum of money be paid by the grantor to the grantee in a given time, the whole conveyance shall be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">In the agreement we are considering, there is only a promise for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>a deed, and then a stipulation that, if the money be paid in two years, this promise for a deed is not to be considered an absolute promise. In the language of the instrument: \u201c On default of payment of the above sum, at the time stipulated, then this obligation for the conveyance of the land aforesaid shall be absolute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Who can fail to see that the object of Thomas Morris, in taking this obligation from William Cotterell, was to obtain security for his debt? And if so, the instrument is a mortgage, no matter what shape it may have assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">*Chief Justice Buchanan, in Dougherty <em>v. </em>McColgan, 6 Gill &amp; Johns. 281, asserts this doctrine: \u201cWhenever the intention is to take a security for a subsisting debt, or for money lent, and to avoid or restrict the equity of redemption, chancery, seeking to protect the debtor against the rapacity of the creditor, and to do full and equal justice between the parties, will defeat such intention, by treating the transaction as a mortgage, and extending to the debtor the benefit of the equity of redemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">See also Page <em>v. </em>Foster, 7 N. H. 394, wherein the judge remarks : \u201cIf it was intended as a security, it is a mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">And so in Flagg <em>v. </em>Mann, 2 Sumn. 533, where Judge Story lays down the rule: \u201c If a transaction resolve itself into a security, whatever may be its form, and whatever name the parties may choose to give it, it is in equity a mortgage. If it be not a security, then it may be a conditional or an absolute sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">It is true that the agreement to convey the land is followed by a seeming alternative, to bo adopted by the obligor, at his option, within two years: \u201c Or I will pay to the said Thomas Morris $100 in two years,\u201d etc. But the legal effect of this phraseology is to create a defeasance, as much as if the words were, <em>\u201c </em>on condition,\u201d or \u201cprovided, however,\u201d etc. Chief Justice Shaw, in Nugent <em>v. </em>Riley, 1 Met. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Again, it is urged that this deed from William Cotterell to Thomas Morris was not a mortgage, inasmuch as there was no personal obligation given for any debt, from the former to the latter. This the law does not require. \u201cA mortgage is the conveyance of an estate by way of pledge for security of a debt, and to become void on the payment of it.\u201d 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 129. \u201cIt is none the less a mortgage because there was no collateral personal security for the debt taken at the time.\u201d Rice et al. <em>v. </em>Rice, 4 Pick. 349; Smith <em>v. </em>People\u2019s Bank, 11 Shep. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>If the claim of Morris to the $100 could have been enforced either <em>in personam </em>or <em>in rem, </em>it would have been *a subsisting debt between the parties, and the conveyance of land would be construed a mortgage. See Judge Story\u2019s opinion in 2 Sumner, 534, already cited. But, as the same learned judge remarks elsewhere, <em>\u201c </em>it is well known that courts of equity lean against construing contracts of this sort to be conditional sales; and, therefore, unless the transaction be clearly made out to be of that nature, it is always construed to be a mortgage.\u201d So Lord Hardwicke laid down the doctrine in Longuet <em>v. </em>Scawen, 1 Ves. 406, and it has never been departed from. The <em>onus </em>probandi, then, is on the defendants to establish it to be a conditional sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The assignees of Thomas Morris have given us no such proof. Nay, the very assignment of Morris to Moses Long contains no slight evidence that the assignor, himself an astute lawyer, was fully conscious that, although his contract for a conveyance had, by its terms, become absolute, an equity of redemption still subsisted in the heirs of William Cotterell. It makes a show of warranting a title to Long, his heirs and assigns, but winds up with this pregnant reservation: \u201c with the exception therei n mentioned.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">What need of alluding to the stipulation that the payment of a $100, if made within two years, would relieve the land, the time having elapsed, if the parties regarded the transaction as a conditional sale ?</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">On the whole, we are unanimously of the'opinion, without reference to the depositions, that the contract executed by William Cotterell to Thomas Morris, on April 7, 1829, was intended by the parties as security for the payment of a debt, and consequently, in equity, must be regarded as a mortgage. The decree of the court of common pleas of Clermont county is erroneous and will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The cause will be remanded to that court, with directions to take an account of the money due, by reason of the original debt of $100, and interest, and to charge said land therewith as upon a mortgage.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
