Leslie.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-8\">A mortgage of personal property under the statute of 1846 is \u201cabsolutely void\u201d as to other creditors of the mortgagor who assert their rights against the property after its execution, and before it is deposited with the recorder or township clerk.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-9\">Such a mortgage is not void in toto, by reason of an omission to make the deposit \u201c forthwith,\u201d but becomes effective whenever it is deposited. And in case of a temporary withdrawal of the paper from the recorder\u2019s office, the mortgagee will not be prejudiced by a levy made at the instance of another creditor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">Error to the court of common pleas of Muskingum county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-11\">The action was replevin, brought by Wilson, the plaintiff below, who is also plaintiff in error, against Leslie, to recover the possession of the following goods and chattels: One carriage with leather extension top, trimmed with red plush; one carriage with standing top; one dapple gray mare, called Sarah Thompson; one light gray mare, called Betsey Baker; two sorrel mares matched.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-12\">The bill of exceptions is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-13\">\u201cUpon the trial of this cause, in the court of common pleas, the plaintiff gave in evidence a mortgage of chattels from John Clements to him, dated March 12, 1851, and deposited with the recorder of Muskingum county (his office being kept in the township where the mortgagor and mortgagee resided) March 20, 1851, a copy of which mortgage, with the indorsement by the recorder, is attached hereto, marked \u2018A.\u2019 The plaintiff also gave in evidence the notes mentioned in the said mortgage, copies of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>are hereto annexed, marked \u2018B;\u2019 and gave evidence tending to show that the debts therein mentioned wore justly due to him. Ho also proved that about the hour of three p. m. of April 1, 1851, the defendant, as sheriff of said county, levied on the chattels mentioned in the declaration, by virtue of an execution then in his hands, in favor of Kennett, McKee &amp; Co., and against said Clements, which, with interest and cost, amounted to the verdict ^afterward rendered herein. In the further progress of the cause, it was proved that on April 1, 1851, this court then being in session, about ten o\u2019clock a. m. the plaintiff, without the knowledge or advice of the attorney hereinafter referred to, went to the recorder\u2019s office, which is in an upper room of the west wing of the building in which the court sits, and asked for the mortgago, saying that he wanted an alteration made therein; that the recorder handed it to him, and the plaintiff took it to the court-i\u2019oom to a lawyer who had before that time been his attorney in the matter of securing his debt from Clements, and told him that the \u2018bay horse, Baldfaco,\u2019 mentioned in the mortgage, had some disease which he thought might injure the others, and he had had him sold, and wished to have inserted in lieu thereof,, one bay mare, and he desired his advice whether such an alteration of the instrument might lawfully be made, with the assent of Clements, The attorney advised that it might be done, whereupon the plaintiff went to Clements, and the instrument was altered with the assent of the parties to it, by drawing a pen through tho words \u2018bay horse, Baldface \u2019 and interlining in lieu thereof, the words \u2018one bay mare.\u2019 This alteration was made before tho levy, but the mortgage was not returned to the recorder\u2019s office, until four p. m. of that day and after the levy. Neither tho bay horse, \u2018Baldfaco,\u2019 nor the bay mare, was levied upon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">It was further proved that on Saturday, March 30, 1851, the same attorney, having in his hands a warrant of attorney given by Clements to the said firm of Kennett, McKee &amp; Co., made preparations by drawing all the necessary pleadings, to take judgment against said Clements the following Tuesday, being the first day of the then next, term of the court of common pleas for said county, and also to file a bill in chancery against the plaintiff and Clements, impeaching the mortgage for fraud, and praying, if held valid, the property might be sold, and the surplus, after satisfying Wilson\u2019s debt applied to the claim of Kennett, McKee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>&amp; </em>Go.; that for the purpose of preparing said bill in chancery, he went that ^Saturday to the recorder\u2019s office and copied from said mortgage a list of the articles, and partially wrote his bill the following Tuesday morning, and on the same afternoon he concluded to insert the entire mortgage in his bill, and after his interview with the plaintiff in the court-house, went to the recorder\u2019s office to copy said mortgage, and learned that the mortgage had not yet been returned; that he could as well have written his bill in chancery without seeing said mortgage again, as with it; that he then took his judgment, and deemed it his duty to issue execution in favor of said Kennett, McKee &amp; Co., which he did, and which was levied as before set forth. It was also in evidence that the plaintiff knew before March 30, 1851, that the said attorney had said claim of Kennett, McKee &amp; Co. against Clements in his hands for collection; and it was further proved that the said attorney intended, on Saturday, March 29, 1851, to enter up said judgment the following Tuesday, though he did not intend levying on the property in question, until he discovered that the mortgage had not been returned to the recorder\u2019s office as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">It was further proved that the property mortgaged, and now in question, was not delivered to Wilson, but remained with Clements until the said levy was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\">The court charged the jury, <em>\u201cfirst, </em>that the mortgage was void because of the lapse of time between its execution and deposit with the recorder; and, <em>second, </em>that the levy made while the mortgage was temporarily out of the recorder\u2019s office, would hold the property, notwithstanding notice to the attorney, unless the jury were satisfied that the attorney assented to its being out; and that they were to regard these instructions as governing the case, although they might be satisfied that the debts mentioned in the <em>mortgage </em>wei'e justly and fairly due from Clements to the plaintiff. To which opinions of the court the .plaintiff excepts, and prays the court to sign and seal this his bill of exceptions, and that it be made a part of -the record, which is accordingly done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-7\">*The mortgage referred to reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-8\">\u201cKnow ail men by these presents, that I, John Clements, for and in consideration of the sum of $1,000, to me paid by Matthew Wilson, Jr., have bargained and sold, and do hereby sell and convey unto the said Matthew Wilson, Jr., the following described personal property, to wit: one (1) carriage, with leather exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>sion top, trimmed with red plush; one (1) sulky; two (2) sleighs; one (1) carriage with standing top ; one (1) brown buggy with red. head lining; one (1) black buggy, trimmed with figured damask; three (3) buggies in course of construction; one (1) two-horse wagon; one (1) buggy-pole; one (1) double-seated buggy without top; two (2) pair extra shafts; one (1) dapple-gray mare (Sarah Thompson) ; one (1) light grey mare (Betsey Baker) \u2022 one gray horse (Gray Eagle); one (1) bay mare (Sarah McBride) ; one (1) bay pacing mare (Sarah Bladen) ; one (1) bay horse (Col.

In this we think the coui\u2019t erred. The statute of Ohio, of February 24, 1846, provides \u201cthat every mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels, hereafter made, which shall not be accompanied by an immediate delivery, and be followed by an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged, shall be <em>absolutely </em>void, <em>as against the creditors of the mortgagor, *and as against </em>subse<em>quent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith, </em>unless the mortgage, or a true copy thereof, shall be <em>forthwith deposited </em>as directed in the succeeding section of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">A fair construction of this statute will not make the instrument inoperative as botween the parties (mortgagor and mortgagee), although it be not forthwith deposited with the recorder. It will not be permitted to stand in the way of an execution issued at the-instance of a judgment credited', until after it shall have been deposited in the proper office. And in certain cases, undoubtedly, an. execution may hold the chattels mortgaged, even after the instrument has been placed on file in the office; as where the delay has been so great as to taint the transaction with fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">But the mere fact that the mortgagee omitted, for several days- or several weeks, to deposit his mortgage deed with the clerk of the township or recorder of the county, as the case might require, would by, no means render his security void. It would not be void as against the mortgagor, if not filed in the office at all. It would not be void as against that class of creditors who were equally remiss with the mortgagee, and took no steps to fasten upon the property for the payment of their debts. Until placed in the proper office, a mortgage of chattels, in our state, would be void as against other creditors of the mortgagor and subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>purchasers and mortgagees, <em>whose rights then attach. </em>But when filed with the clerk or recorder, the instrument becomes valid and effective against all men except those whose rights have thus previously attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The court below charged the jury that the levy made while the mortgage was temporarily out of the recorder\u2019s office, would hold the property, notwithstanding notice to the attorney, unless the jury were satisfied that the attorney assented to its being out. There is great and manifest error in this ruling of the court. The facts, as disclosed by the bill of exceptions, were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The attorney who had been consulted by Wilson, in the matter *of securing his debt by means of this mortgage, had in his hands for collection a claim in favor of Kennett, McKee &amp; Co., against Clements, with a warrant of attorney to confess judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">On Tuesday, April 1, 1851, and on the first day of the term of the court of common pleas, at about ten o\u2019clock a. m., Wilson took his mortgage from the office of the recorder, where it had been deposited since the 20th of March, to the court-room, in the same building, for the purpose of consulting this same attorney as to the propriety of striking out one of the horses mentioned in the instrument, which had become diseased, and inserting a certain bay mare in lieu thereof. The attorney advised that it might be done, with the assent of Clements, and while Wilson was absent procuring this amendment to be made, his legal adviser \u201c deemed it his duty\u201d to take judgment in favor of Kennett, McKee &amp; Co., and forthwith to take out execution, and have the same levied on a portion of the property which <em>he knew </em>was covered by the mortgage. At four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the mortgage was taken back to the office of the recorder, but <em>\u201c it was too late.\u201d </em>The trap had been sprung.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">To designate this as <em>sharp practice </em>on the part of the attornoy) will be treating his conduct with sufficient delicacy. To hold that a levy obtained through such instrumentality, should override a <em>bona fide </em>mortgage, would be preposterous. The court of common pleas ought not to sanction snch an abuse of its process.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The temporary withdrawal of the paper could not impair its force, if done with intent to return it. In contemplation of law, it was -\u201con file in the office,\u201d although out of the recorder\u2019s room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The assent of the attorney to its withdrawal was quite immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The judgment of the court of common pleas is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
