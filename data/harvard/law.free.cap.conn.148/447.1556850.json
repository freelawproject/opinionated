During the trial, the defendants unsuccessfully sought to introduce in evidence a written statement which the plaintiff had executed in the presence of her husband on May 22, 1956, and which was contradictory to her testimony. Upon objection, the trial court ruled that the statement was not admissible because it did not contain the name and address of the person who took it, as required by the 1959 Public Acts, No. 541 (General Statutes \u00a7 52-147).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In 1956, when the statement in question was taken, it complied with the statute then in force, Avhich required merely that in order for such a statement to be admissible in evidence, a copy of it had to be retained by the maker or delivered to him within thirty days. Rev. 1949, \u00a7 7870. When that statute, which became \u00a7 52-147 of the 1958 Revision, was repealed by Public Act No. 541 in 1959 and the substitute adopted, the requirement was added that the name and address of the person taking the statement had to appear on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The defendants alleged a special defense of contributory negligence. It was incumbent on them, having alleged it, to prove it. General Statutes \u00a7 52-114. The defense of contributory negligence constituted a substantive right of the defendants Avhich they were prevented from proAdng by the action of the court in giving retroactive effect to the 1959 act. Since this legislation had no specific and unequivocal language making it applicable to pending actions, it should not have been given that effect. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-1, 55-3; <em>Reese </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Reese, </em>136 Conn. 191, 194, 70 A.2d 123; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>132 Conn. 682, 684, 47 A.2d 185; <em>E.

Retrospective laws generally, if not universally, work injustice. Statutes should be construed retrospectively only when the mandate of the legislature is imperative. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>57 Pa. 209, 212; <em>Horn &amp; Brannen Mfg.
