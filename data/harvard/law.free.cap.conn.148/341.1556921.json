J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ada\">The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the denial of its application to the defendant for the approval of a cap and label for nse in the sale of skimmed milk. The court dismissed the appeal, and the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The finding, with certain corrections claimed by the plaintiff, can be stated in summary as follows: The plaintiff, a duly licensed distributor of milk and milk products, proposed to sell skimmed milk containing 2 per cent butterfat. On September 24, 1959, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22-135, it applied to the defendant for the approval of a cap and label which it intended to use in the sale of this product. The plaintiff requested that a meeting of the defendant be called if it was necessary for evidence to be offered to secure the approval. The defendant denied the application and gave as its reason that the statutes as well as its regulations made no provision for the sale of skimmed milk containing 2 per cent butterfat.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The parties agree that the issue dispositive of the appeal is whether a duly licensed dealer in, or producer of, milk or milk products can sell, or offer or possess with intent to sell, milk from which sufficient cream has been removed to reduce its butterfat content to less than three and one-quarter per cent but more than one-half of one per cent. General Statutes \u00a7 22-127 defines \u201cskimmed milk\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>or \u201cnon-fat milk\u201d as \u201cmilk from which a sufficient portion of the butter-fat has been removed to reduce its butter-fat percentage to one-half of one per cent or less.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22-152 provides that milk sold or offered for sale shall be deemed to be milk of standard quality unless it is otherwise expressly stated, and requires that milk, to meet the test of standard quality, \u201cshall contain [among other characteristics of quality not pertinent here] . . . not less than three and one-quarter per cent of butter-fats.\u201d \u201cMilk-fat\u201d or \u201cbutter-fat\u201d is, as used in the statutes, the fat of milk. \u00a7 22-127. Section 22-159, entitled \u201cSkimmed milk,\u201d prohibits the sale, or possession with intent to mix with other dairy products to be sold, of milk from which the cream or any part thereof has been removed, unless the product is plainly labeled, and allows the sale of \u201cskimmed milk\u201d in milk bottles or other approved containers if they are properly marked or tagged as skimmed milk. Section 22-135 requires a dealer to obtain approval from the defendant of the cap or labeling panel to be used by him in the sale or distribution of all of his milk products or of each milk product requiring a separate cap or label.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The defendant has interpreted the statutes to mean that the sale of milk having a butterfat content of less than three and one-quarter per cent (the standard required for a sale of milk as such under \u00a7 22-152) but more than one-half of one per cent (the percentage appearing in the definition of skimmed milk in \u00a7 22-127) is prohibited even if the product is properly labeled. The plaintiff contends that such milk can be sold if it is properly labeled. To decide between these conflicting claims, the court is called upon to determine the intent of the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>tion. Legislative intent is to be found, not in what the legislature meant to say, but in the meaning of what it did say. <em>Connecticut Chiropody Society, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>146 Conn. 613, 617, 153 A.2d 412; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>145 Conn. 355, 358, 143 A.2d 154; <em>Mad River Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>137 Conn. 680, 686, 81 A.2d 119. If the language of legislation is plain, the intent can be ascertained from the legislation itself. If the language is not plain, courts look not only to the wording of the legislation but also to its legislative history and policy. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>144 Conn. 212, 214, 128 A.2d 894, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Prior to 1957, skimmed milk was defined as \u201cmilk from which a sufficient portion of the milk-fat has been removed to reduce its milk-fat percentage to less than that of milk.\u201d Cum. Sup. 1955, \u00a71731d; Rev. 1949, \u00a7 3175. This definition had its origin in \u00a7 668i of the 1947 Supplement. Before 1947, \u201cskimmed milk\u201d had been described only in the predecessors of \u00a7 22-159, that is, as milk from which the cream or any part thereof has been removed. Sup. 1941, \u00a7 427f; Rev. 1930, \u00a72467; Public Acts 1921, c. 154; Rev. 1918, \u00a72467; Rev. 1902, \u00a72587; Rev. 1888, \u00a7 2660; Public Acts 1882, c. 145, \u00a7 3. By these statutes, the sale of slammed milk was prohibited, as it is under \u00a7 22-159, except under certain procedures designed to make the public aware that skimmed milk was being sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In 1957, the General Assembly, after the definitions statute (then \u00a7 1731d, now \u00a7 22-127) had been amended in another respect (Public Acts 1957, No. 359, \u00a71), redefined \u201cskimmed milk,\u201d or \u201cnon-fat milk,\u201d as \u201cmilk from which a sufficient portion of the milk-fat, has been removed to reduce its milk-fat percentage to one-half of 1% or less.\u201d Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Acts 1957, No. 419; General Statutes \u00a722-127. The defendant points to the legislative history of this 1957 amendment to support its interpretation of the statutes. The legislation was inaugurated by house bill 2215, which proposed to amend the section to define \u201cskimmed milk\u201d as \u201cmilk from which a sufficient portion of milk-fat has been removed to reduce its milk-fat percentage to one-half of one percenturn or less.\u201d This bill also contained a definition of \u201cnon-fat milk\u201d as \u201cmilk from which a sufficient portion of the milk-fat content has been removed to reduce the milk-fat content to one-half of one percentum or less and to which milk solids have been added from sources approved by the commissioner, provided the total milk solids in this product shall not exceed 12%.\u201d The bill stated its purpose to be \u201c[t]o delete the definition of fresh milk and to define \u2018non-fat\u2019 milk, a term commonly used throughout the industry, and to define \u2018skimmed milk.\u2019 \u201d When the bill was reported to the house from the committee on agriculture and printed for action, it had been altered to include a provision that \u201c[mjilk which contains less than 3.25% but more than one-half of 1% of milk fat shall be called \u2018low fat milk.\u2019 \u201d Sub. for H.B. 2215, 1957 Sess. (File No. 1089). The bill allowed the sale of such milk if it was labeled \u201clow fat milk\u201d and the minimum fat content was revealed clearly and prominently on the label of the container. The bill defined \u201cskimmed milk\u201d or \u201cnon-fat milk\u201d as \u201cmilk from which a sufficient portion of the milk-fat has been removed to reduce its milk-fat percentage to one-half of 1% or less,\u201d\u2014the definition presently found in \u00a7 22-127.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">When the bill came up for action in the house, an amendment was proposed which deleted the defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>tion of \u201clow fat milk\u201d and the provision for its sale. 7 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5,1957 Sess., p. 2533. It was stated that the amendment \u201celiminates a particular type of milk which would be called low-fat milk.\u201d The amendment prevailed. Ibid. Under the rules of the house, the bill as amended was referred to the legislative commissioner. When the bill came before the house for final action, it was stated on the floor that, as amended, the bill defined more clearly the term \u201cskimmed milk\u201d and established butterfat gradations for that product. Id., p. 2536. The bill was adopted. Id., p. 2537; Conn. H. Jour., 1957 Sess., p. 1375. It was then considered and adopted in the senate. Conn. S. Jour., 1957 Sess., p. 1260. There, the senator who moved the adoption stated that the amendment deleted from the bill any provision which would allow milk with less than three and one-quarter per cent butterfat to be sold. 7 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1957 Sess., p. 2858. The bill contained a provision defining \u201c[f]ortified skimmed milk\u201d or \u201cfortified non-fat milk\u201d as \u201cmilk from which a sufficient portion of the milk-fat content has been removed to reduce the milk-fat content to one-half of <em>1% </em>or less\u201d and to which approved milk solids had been added. 1957 Public Acts, No. 419; G-eneral Statutes \u00a7 22-127.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The 1957 legislation made a drastic change in the definition of \u201cskimmed milk.\u201d It, in effect, eliminated from that category, and left undefined, milk with less than three and one-quarter per cent butterfat but more than one-half of one per cent butterfat. The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 22-127 deals with definitions only and that its terms are not regulatory or prohibitory. That is true. We must look to \u00a7 22-159 for prohibitory or regulatory measures dealing with the sale of skimmed milk. That stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>nte, hereinbefore referred to, bears the heading \u201cSkimmed milk\u201d and reads as follows: \u201cNo person shall sell, or offer or expose for sale, or have in his possession with the intent to mix with other dairy products to be sold, milk from which the cream or any part thereof has been removed, unless the product is plainly labeled. Skimmed milk may be sold in milk bottles or other approved containers if properly marked or tagged as such skimmed milk.\u201d The section must be read together with the definition of \u201cskimmed milk\u201d in \u00a7 22-127. The first sentence of \u00a7 22-159 deals with \u201cmilk from which the cream or any part thereof has been removed.\u201d The second allows the sale of \u201cskimmed milk\u201d if it is properly identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">There is a possible conflict between the assumed description of skimmed milk in the first sentence of \u00a7 22-159 and the definition in \u00a7 22-127. When two statutes appear to be repugnant, it is the duty of the court to construe them so that both are operative, if that is reasonably possible. <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Local 402, </em>145 Conn. 53, 57, 138 A.2d 783; <em>Shanley </em>v. <em>Jankura, </em>144 Conn. 694, 702, 137 A.2d 536; 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3d Ed.) \u00a7 2014. Further, the court must presume that the legislature, in adopting the 1957 legislation, acted with existing relevant statutes in mind and with the intention of creating a consistent body of law. <em>Shanley </em>v. <em>Jankura, </em>supra, 704; <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Daniele, </em>143 Conn. 85, 87, 119 A.2d 732; <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 665, 103 A.2d 535. Courts are bound to accept the legislative definition of terms in a statute. <em>United Interchange, Inc. </em>v. <em>Spellacy, </em>144 Conn. 647, 654, 136 A.2d 801; <em>Danbury </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>139 Conn. 379, 384, 94 A.2d 6. Therefore, \u201cskimmed milk,\u201d as that term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>is used in \u00a7 22-159, must mean milk with one-half of one per cent of butterfat or less. The apparent conflict between \u00a7 22-159 and \u00a7 22-127 is resolved if the two sentences of \u00a7 22-159 are treated, as they should be, as dealing with different categories. The first sentence deals with the general category of milk \u201cfrom which the cream or any part thereof has been removed\u201d; the second sentence deals with the more specific category of \u201cskimmed milk\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 22-127.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We conclude that \u00a7 22-159 prohibits the sale of skimmed milk as defined in \u00a7 22-127 except under the conditions stated in \u00a7\u00a7 22-159 and 22-135. It does not prohibit the sale of milk with less than three and one-quarter per cent butterfat but more than one-half of one per cent butterfat, and an intent to prohibit such sale cannot be inferred from the mere fact that mill?: with that butterfat content is not included within the definition of skimmed milk in \u00a7 22-127. It may well be that the statements of the legislators who moved the adoption of Public Acts 1957, No. 419, defining \u201cskimmed mill?:\u201d as it is now defined in \u00a7 22-127, and the action of the legislature in adopting No. 419 show that it was intended to outlaw the sale of milk with a butterfat content of less than three and one-quarter per cent but more than one-half of one per cent by leaving such milk undefined. However, intent, as a state of mind of the members of a legislative body, is not conclusive, even where it can be ascertained. <em>Park Regional Corporation </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>144 Conn. 677, 682, 136 A.2d 785; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of </em>Appeals, 146 Conn. 70, 73, 147 A.2d 472. It is the intent expressed in appropriate language in the legislation which controls. <em>Lee Bros. Furniture Co. </em>v. Cram, 63 Conn. 433, 438, 28 A. 540; <em>Mad </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number><em>River Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>137 Conn. 680, 688, 81 A.2d 119; <em>Park Regional Corporation </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>snpra. Under some circumstances, indications of intent in the legislative history may be consulted to ascertain the meaning of ambiguous statutory language. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>143 Conn. 280, 286, 121 A.2d 630; <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>145 Conn. 355, 358, 143 A.2d 154; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Plunkett, </em>139 Conn. 491, 504, 95 A.2d 71; 2 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3d Ed.) \u00a75015. But courts cannot import an intent into legislation devoid of language fit to express it. <em>Loew </em>v. <em>Falsey, </em>144 Conn. 67, 72, 127 A.2d 67. Sections 22-127 and 22-159 cannot be construed to prohibit the plaintiff from marketing milk which has a 2 per cent butterfat content and is labeled in accordance with \u00a7 22-135.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to sustain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
