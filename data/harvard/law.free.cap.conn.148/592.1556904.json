The jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and from the judgment rendered thereon the plaintiff has appealed. Although there are four assignments of error, only two are pursued. The plaintiff claims error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>court\u2019s failure to charge the jury adequately on defective brakes and its refusal to allow the plaintiff the right to exercise a peremptory challenge on a juror already accepted but not yet sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The complaint, among ten specifications of negligence, alleges that the defendants\u2019 vehicle was operated \u201cwith defective or inadequate brakes\u201d or that the operator \u201cfailed to appy his brakes in time to avoid\u201d the collision. The plaintiff claims to have offered evidence of defective brakes through the testimony of the defendant operator and the presence of skid marks for 121 feet. The defendants claim to have offered testimony that the brakes were in good condition prior to the accident and were damaged as a result of the collision. The court charged the jury that \u201cthe operator of an automobile on the highway, must have [it] . . . under reasonable and proper control at all times, and when reasonable care requires, must reduce its speed or bring it to a stop or turn out to avoid colliding with a person or property of other persons on the highway,\u201d and that the operator \u201cmust make such reasonable use of his brakes as a reasonably prudent man would do under similar circumstances.\u201d The plaintiff claims that this charge, in view of evidence indicating defective brakes, was inadequate to guide the jury to a proper consideration of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Where, as here, a specific statute is involved, \u00a7 153 of the Practice Book requires that a \u201cwritten request to charge on the legal principle involved\u201d be filed before the beginning of the arguments and that it contain \u201ca single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated.\u201d The plaintiff did not file any request to charge, leaving it to the court to deal with the subject as it saw fit. Had the plaintiff desired particular reference to be made to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>breach of the statute concerning adequate brakes (General Statutes \u00a714-80 [a]), he should have requested a specific charge on this issue. The request should have referred to the specific statute which he claimed was violated. What is required is a request to charge \u201con the legal principle involved.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>128 Conn. 273, 275, 22 A.2d 10. The purpose of the requirements of \u00a7 153 is clear. They are intended to afford the court an opportunity to place the requests to charge in the charge in their proper relation to the rest of the charge. The court may restrict its charge to claims actually made on the trial. It is not required to deal specifically with those which might have been made. <em>Syms </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>134 Conn. 653, 656, 60 A.2d 166. It is for that reason that the rule contemplates that a request to charge will be given to the court before the commencement of the arguments. <em>Antz </em>v. <em>Coppolo, </em>137 Conn. 69, 72, 75 A.2d 36. Such a request, seasonably filed, would have given the court in the present case an opportunity to consider the contents of the request and incorporate them in the charge. See <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>148 Conn. 266, 270, 169 A.2d 888; <em>State </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">At the conclusion of the charge, the plaintiff excepted as follows: \u201cI heard no charge in relation to brakes, and if the Court didn\u2019t charge on that, I take exception.\u201d The exception was meaningless in view of the court\u2019s discussion of the subject and was not in conformity with \u00a7 153 of the Practice Book, which requires that an exception \u201cshall state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection.\u201d See <em>Maggi </em>v. <em>Mendillo, </em>147 Conn. 663, 669, 671, 165 A.2d 603; <em>DeCarufel </em>v. <em>Colonial Trust Co., </em>143 Conn. 18, 20, 118 A.2d 798; <em>Borsoi </em>v. <em>Sparico, </em>141 Conn. 366, 371, 106 A.2d 170; <em>Chapin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Popilowski, </em>139 Conn. 84, 85, 90 A.2d 167; <em>Ehrhard </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>136 Conn. 13, 14, 68 A.2d 133; <em>Albrecht </em>v. <em>Rubinstein, </em>135 Conn. 243, 246, 63 A.2d 158; <em>Greenwald </em>v. <em>Wire Rope Corporation of America, </em>131 Conn. 465, 470, 40 A.2d 748. Under the procedure which was followed here, the charge is not subject to review. The error claimed is \u201cas to the giving of, or the failure to give, an instruction,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 153. Under that section, we are not bound to consider such an error \u201cunless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken . . . immediately after the charge is delivered.\u201d Here, there was no written request to charge and no proper exception. Cases cited in the plaintiff\u2019s brief to support his claims are inapplicable because they preceded the adoption of \u00a7 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to allow him to exercise one of his peremptory challenges on a juror who had already been accepted but was not yet sworn. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-240, 51-241. The juror in question had been accepted after disclosure on the voir dire that he was acquainted with two members of the firm which included the defendants\u2019 counsel. After a court recess, the plaintiff informed the court that during the recess he had learned that the juror was a frequent \u201cletter to the editor\u201d writer and was noted for his attacks on spending and waste. The plaintiff appealed to the court\u2019s discretion to permit him to exercise his remaining peremptory challenge to excuse the juror. The court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">In <em>DeCarlo </em>v. <em>Frame, </em>134 Conn. 530, 535, 58 A.2d 846, Ave reaffirmed the rule that \u201c[w]hen the examination is on the voir dire, a party has no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>to a peremptory challenge after he has accepted a jnror upon the conclusion of his examination; but the court, where the ends of justice so require, may in its discretion permit such a challenge to be made at any time before the jury is sworn.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Taborsky, </em>147 Conn. 194, 213, 158 A.2d 239; <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>18 Conn. 166, 176; cf. <em>Bluett </em>v. <em>Eli Skating Club, </em>133 Conn. 99, 104, 48 A.2d 557. The court was faced with an issue which involved an exercise of its discretion. The plaintiff\u2019s claims that the acceptance of the juror was \u201cill advised\u201d and \u201cby standards of the trial as an art a tactical blunder\u201d are not adequate grounds on which to predicate an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. Under the circumstances of this case, that discretion was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
