Reg. 6221 (Jan. 27, 1993) <em>(\u201cFinal Determination\u201d), </em>In this consolidated action, Usinor Sacilor and Inland Steel each seek judgment upon the agency record pursuant to USCIT Rule 56.2.

Background</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">A. <em>Subject Matter of Commerce\u2019s Investigation-.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In general terms, Commerce\u2019s investigation in this case addressed various facets of a restructuring program undertaken by the government of France (\u201cGOF\u201d) beginning in the late 1970s to bolster France\u2019s steel industry and, specifically, Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors, Usi-nor and Sacilor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The period of investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d) is calendar year 1991. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6222.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Seven components of the restructuring program are at issue in this case. These components are as follows: (1) \u201cpr\u00e9ts \u00e1 caract\u00e9ristiques sp\u00e9-ciales\u201d (\u201cPACS\u201d) or \u201cloans with special characteristics\u201d received by Usi-nor and Sacilor; (2) \u201cFonds d\u2019Intervention Sid\u00e9rurgique\u201d (\u201cFIS\u201d) or the \u201cSteel Intervention Fund\u201d through which Usinor and Sacilor were able to issue bonds guaranteed by the GOF to the public; (3) the GOF\u2019s practice between 1982 and 1986 of making shareholder advances to Usinor and Sacilor to finance revenue shortfalls; (4) the conversion of Usinor\u2019s and Sacilor\u2019s PACS and FIS instruments and shareholder advances to common stock; (5) the 1990 consolidation of loans that Usinor and Saci-lor received through the GOF\u2019s \u201cFonds de D\u00e9veloppment Economique et Social\u201d (\u201cFDES\u201d); (6) the 1991 consolidation of loans that Usinor and Sacilor received through the GOF\u2019s \u201cCaisse Frangaise de D\u00e9veloppement Industriel\u201d (\u201cCFDI\u201d); and (7) the 1991 consolidation by Credit National, a financial institution controlled by the GOF, of outstanding loans held by Usinor Sacilor. <em>See Id. </em>at 6224-27. After investigating these asp\u00e9cts of the GOF\u2019s restructuring program and others not pertinent to this action, Commerce determined that Usinor Sacilor received countervailable benefits totalling 23.11 percent <em>ad </em>valorem.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For purposes of clarity, the court will set forth the relevant details of each facet of the GOF\u2019s program under review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">B. <em>Components of the GOF\u2019s Restructuring Program:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">1. <em>PACS Instruments:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The first aspect of the GOF\u2019s plan relevant to this case is the PACS instrument system. This system allowed Usinor and Sacilor \u201cto recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>stitute equity through the conversion of debt into PACS.\u201d <em>Public Record Document Number (\u201cPub. Doc.\u201d) 107, Confidential Record Document Number (\u201cConfid. Doc.\u201d) 19 </em>at 5. Such conversion enabled the companies to exchange their former obligations on loans and bonds for new obligations based on the PACS. <em>See Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224. The responses that Commerce received during the investigation indicated that the PACS instruments were \u201cakin to redeemable subordinated nonvoting preferred stock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The responses also showed that the PACS instruments</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">had the following characteristics: (1) a 0.10 percent remuneration for the first five years and 1.0 percent thereafter, (2) no schedule of reimbursement but in the event the steel companies became profitable, the PACS holders could elect to redeem their PACS or share in profits according to a predetermined formula, and (3) PACS were subordinated to all but the common stock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224. The responses further revealed that Usinor and Sacilor accounted for the PACS instruments as shareholders\u2019 equity on their balance sheets. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Between 1978 and 1991, Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors used the PACS program to refinance debt on several occasions. Specifically, \u201c[i]n 1978, Usinor and Sacilor converted 21.1 billion French francs (FF) of debt into PACS. From 1980 to 1981, Usinor and Sacilor issued FF8.1 billion of new PACS. \u201d <em>Id. </em>The companies subsequently converted \u201cPACS in the amount of FF13.8 billion, FF12.6 billion and FF2.8 billion * * * into common stock in 1981, 1986 and 1991, respectively.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Commerce\u2019s treatment of the PACS conversions depended upon Usi-nor Sacilor\u2019s equityworthiness at the time of the conversions. The rationale for this treatment stems from the ITA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cany benefits to Usinor Sacilor occurred at the point when these instruments were converted to common stock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce found Usinor Sacilor to be unequityworthy from 1981 through 1988 and therefore \u201cconsidered] the conversion of PACS to common stock in 1981 and 1986 to constitute equity infusions on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast to the 1981 and 1986 conversions, Commerce determined that \u201cthe PACS to equity conversion in 1991 was consistent with commercial considerations\u201d because Usinor Sacilor was equityworthy by that time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">2. <em>FIS Instruments:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The second GOF program at issue is the \u201cFonds d\u2019Intervention Sid\u00e9-rurgique\u201d (\u201cFIS\u201d), or Steel Intervention Fund, created by the GOF in 1983. The FIS, in conjunction with the 1981 Corrected Finance Law, allowed Usinor and Sacilor to issue convertible bonds. The companies \u201cissued convertible bonds to the FIS, which, in turn, with the .GOF guarantee, floated bonds to the public and to institutional investors.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Similar to the PACS, the FIS instruments carried \u201ca nominal 0.1% rate of return and a profit-sharing component.\u201d <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at </em>3. The bonds also \u201cestablished a fixed schedule of fifteen annual principal repayments, with the GOF agreeing to make the first one or two of the * * * repayments and the issuing company being obligated to make the remaining * * * repayments.\u201d <em>Defendant\u2019s Brief </em>at 10 (footnote omitted). \u201cIn 1983,1984, and 1985, Usinor and Sacilor issued convertible bonds to the FIS. These FIS bonds were converted to common stock in 1986 and 1988.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224. Based upon its unequityworthiness findings for the years 1981 through 1988, Commerce \u201cconsidered] the conversion of FIS bonds to common stock in 1986 and 1988 to constitute equity infusions on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">3. <em>Shareholder Advances:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The third pertinent component of the GOF\u2019s restructuring plan is the GOF\u2019s practice of making shareholder advances to Usinor and Sacilor to finance revenue shortfalls. This practice, which began in 1982, enabled the companies to receive interest free cash infusions upon request. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224; <em>see also Plaintiff s\u2019Brief at </em>3. \u201cThese shareholders\u2019 advances carried no interest and there was no precondition for receipt of these funds.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224. The GOF ended the practice in 1986 at which time the companies converted the amount of funds received through the advances to common stock. <em>Id. </em>In its <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce determined that \u201cshareholders\u2019 advances constitute countervailable grants at the time they were received as no shares were distributed in return for these advances when they were made to Usinor and Sacilor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6225.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">4. <em>FDES and CFDI Loans:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The fourth element of the GOF\u2019s plan relevant to this action is the loan program established by the Law of July 13,1978. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6225. This law \u201ccreated participative loans * * * which were by law available to all French companies. Under these loans, which were issued by the FDES and the [CFDI], the borrower paid a lower-than-market interest rate plus a share of future profits according to an agreed upon formula.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to Commerce, \u201c[t]hese loans were obtained by either Usinor, Sacilor, or their subsidiaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1990 and 1991, Usinor Sacilor consolidated the outstandingprincipal on its predecessors\u2019 FDES and CFDI loans, respectively. <em>Id. </em>Commerce determined that both the FDES and CFDI consolidated loans were new loans. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">With respect to the FDES consolidated loans, Commerce determined that they are <em>de facto </em>limited because the GOF provided insufficient information regarding the loans\u2019 specificity. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, Commerce that concluded the FDES loans \u201care countervailable to the extent that they were provided on terms more favorable than the benchmark financing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Unlike the FDES consolidation, Commerce determined that the 1991 CFDI consolidation did not provide any countervailable benefits during the period of investigation; however, the ITA also concluded that the original CFDI loans did confer such benefits. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6225. Commerce based its determination regarding the 1991 consolidated CFDI loans on the fact that Usinor Sacilor would not pay any interest on the loans until 1992 and, therefore, the new loans would not have any cash flow effect until after the period of investigation. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, the ITA determined that the old CFDI loans, which were still outstanding during a portion of the period of investigation, conferred countervailable benefits during the POI. <em>Id. </em>Commerce based this determination on its finding that the evidence adduced by Usinor Sacilor did not demonstrate that the old CFDI loans were non-specific. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the ITA concluded that the old CFDI loans are <em>de facto </em>limited and are countervailable to the extent they were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">5. <em>Consolidation of Cr\u00e9dit National Loans:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In 1991, Cr\u00e9dit National consolidated numerous loans that it had made to Usinor Sacilor. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6226. Similar to its determination regarding the consolidation of Usinor Sacilor\u2019s outstanding FDES loans, Commerce determined that the consolidated Cr\u00e9dit National loans constituted new loans because they had new terms and conditions. <em>Id. </em>In contrast to the FDES consolidated loans, however, Commerce determined that the Cr\u00e9dit National consolidated loans were not countervailable because they \u201cwere not provided to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6227.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Usinor challenges Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>on eight separate grounds. Specifically, Usinor contests Commerce\u2019s determinations that: (1) the PACS and FIS instruments received by Usinor and Sacilor were debt upon issuance; (2) Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors were not equityworthy in 1986 and 1988; (3) the countervailable benefits inuring to Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors as a result of the conversion of PACS and FIS instruments to common stock equalled the face value of the remaining principal on the instruments; (4) shareholder advances made by the GOF to Usinor and Sacilor were non-recurring grants; (5) Usinor Sacilor\u2019s consolidated FDES loans, as well as its outstanding CFDI loans, conferred countervailable benefits upon the company; (6) the benchmark discount and interest rate in the years in which Usinor Sacilor was uncreditworthy is the IMF\u2019s long-term rate for France; (7) the amortization period for the non-recurring grants and equity infusions that Usinor Sacilor received is 15 years; and (8) the sales denominator used in computing Usinor Sacilor\u2019s net subsidy must exclude sales of the company\u2019s non-French produced merchandise. Defendant and Inland Steel oppose each of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Inland Steel contests three aspects of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination. </em>Specifically, Inland Steel challenges Commerce\u2019s determinations that: (1) Usinor Sacilor was equityworthy in 1991; (2) shareholder advances made by the GOF to Usinor and Sacilor were grants; and (3) no countervailable benefit inured to Usinor Sacilor in 1991 when Cr\u00e9dit National consolidated the company\u2019s outstanding loans. Defendant and Usinor Sacilor oppose each of the challenges raised by Inland Steel to the <em>Final Determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">In reviewing a determination made by Commerce, this court must decide whether the determination is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B) (1988). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something more than a \u2018mere scintilla,\u2019 and must be enough reasonably to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cer\u00e1mica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 399, 405, 636 F. Supp. 961, 966 (1986) (citations omitted), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>5 Fed. Cir. (T) 77, 810 F.2d 1137 (1987). This court must also accord substantial weight to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers. <em>American Lamb Co. v. United States, </em>4 Fed. Cir. (T) 47, 54, 785 F.2d 994, 1001 (1986) (citations omitted). \u201cAn agency\u2019s \u2018interpretation of the statute need not be the <em>only </em>reasonable interpretation or the one which the court views as the most reasonable.\u2019\u201d <em>ICC Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>5 Fed. Cir. (T) 78, 85, 812 F.2d 694, 699 (1987) (citation omitted). Where \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984) (footnote omitted). The agency must not, however, \u201ccontravene or ignore the intent of the legislature or the guiding purpose of the statute. \u201d <em>Cer\u00e1mica Regiomontana, </em>10 CIT at 405, 636 F. Supp. at 966 (citations omitted). \u201cAs long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence on the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d <em>Id., </em>636 F. Supp. at 966 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">A. <em>Usinor Sacilor v. United </em>States:</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">1. <em>Characterization of PACS and FIS Instruments Upon Issuance:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The first issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination that the PACS and FIS instruments were debt upon issuance is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. With respect to the PACS instruments, questionnaire responses received by Commerce indicated that the instruments</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">had the following characteristics: (1) a 0.10 percent remuneration for the first five years and 1.0 percent thereafter, (2) no schedule of reimbursement but in the event the steel companies became profit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>able, the PACS holders could elect to redeem their PACS or share in profits according to a predetermined formula * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224. The FIS instruments similarly carried a 0.10 percent rate of return and a profit-sharing component. <em>Pub. Doc. 55, Confid. Doc. 3, </em>Exs. 20A, 20B. In addition, the FIS instruments established a fixed schedule of fifteen annual principal repayments, with the GOF agreeing to make the first one or two of the repayments and the issuing company being obligated to make the remaining repayments. <em>Defendant\u2019s Briefed </em>10; <em>see also Pub. Doc. 55, Confid. Doc. 3, </em>Exs. 20A, 20B.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Commerce determined that the PACS and FIS instruments were debt because they both carried repayment obligations. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6228. The ITA emphasized the fact that these obligations terminated only when the GOF and the companies converted the instruments into common stock. <em>Id. </em>Commerce noted that the instruments produced a cash flow effect while they remained outstanding insofar as they allowed the companies to pay reduced interest rates for the use of the funds. <em>Id. </em>The ITA further reasoned that upon conversion of the instruments to common stock, the cash flow effect was that of a grant. <em>Id. </em>As the methodology that Commerce employed in this investigation treats equity investments in unequityworthy companies like grants, and the ITA found Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors to be unequity-worthy when the 1981, 1986 and 1988 instruments-to-stock conversions occurred, the ITA determined that these conversions constituted countervailable grants. <em>Id. </em>at 6223, 6227-28; <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5) (A) (ii) (III) (1988) (\u201cThe grant of funds or forgiveness of debt to cover operating losses sustained by a specific industry\u201d constitutes a subsidy if provided \u201cby government action to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries ***.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Usinor opposes Commerce\u2019s characterization of the instruments as debt and maintains that Commerce should have concluded that the instruments were equity upon issuance. Usinor emphasizes the fact that the PACS \u201cwere subordinated to all other secured and unsecured credit of the Company, * * * had no fixed repayment schedule or maturity date[,] * * * [and] contained no unconditional repayment obligation \u2014 only a potential for an unlimited supplemental return and/or repayment of the face value of the PACS out of the Company\u2019s profits.\u201d <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 3 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">As for the FIS instruments, Usinor claims they represent \u201ca permanent commitment of funds by the GOF to Usinor Sacilor.\u201d <em>Id. &amp;t </em>16. Usi-nor notes that although the FIS agreements did contain nominal repayment schedules, the GOF agreed to meet the schedules until [ ]. <em>See Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 16-17. Usinor adds that \u201cthe nominal amortization schedules for the FIS instruments did not in fact create any real obligation of repayment\u201d because \u201cany repayment was tied to the uncertain prospect of improved future performance.\u201d <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply </em>Briefat 4 (emphasis omitted). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>sum, Usinor asserts that the GOF \u201cwas paying its own agency under FIS instruments issued by the Company to that agency. The only funds changing hands were within the [GOF], and the funds invested in the Company through the FIS instruments remained in the Company.\u201d <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief sA, </em>17. Finally, Usinor notes that the companies \u201cnever made any payments under the repayment schedules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Usinor\u2019s arguments fail to establish that Commerce unreasonably determined the PACS and FIS instruments were debt. Undisputed record evidence demonstrates that Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors owed repayment obligations on the PACS and FIS instruments from the date of their issuance to the time of their conversion to common stock. <em>See Pub. Doc. 55, Confid. Doc. 3, </em>at 5; <em>id., </em>Exs. 20A, 20B. Although the interest owed on the instruments was nominal and the companies\u2019 reimbursement obligations depended upon the companies\u2019 profitability, the fact remains that the companies were subject to liabilities on these instruments. <em>Cf. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare v. Davenport, </em>495 U.S. 552, 558 (1990) (noting that under the bankruptcy code a party is subject to a \u201cclaim\u201d or a \u201cright to payment\u201d whether or not such right is liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, <em>contingent, </em>matured, or unmatured). Because the companies faced such liabilities from the time the instruments originally issued, the court finds that Commerce had a reasonable basis upon which to determine that the instruments constituted debt upon issuance. In addition, because these liabilities lasted until the instruments\u2019 conversion, the contingent nature of the liabilities does not, as Usinor maintains, eviscerate Commerce\u2019s conclusion that the instruments were debt upon issuance. Accordingly, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination that the PACS and FIS instruments were debt upon issuance is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. This aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">2. <em>Usinor Sacilor\u2019s Equityworthiness in 1986 and 1988:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The next issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination that Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors were unequityworthy in 1986 and 1988 is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. Commerce determined that the companies were unequityworthy from 1982 through 1988 because they reported substantial losses; their stockholders\u2019 equity was negative in every year except 1986; and, certain of the companies\u2019 financial indicators were negative prior to their restructuring in 1986. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6222. Commerce also concluded that \u201ca prudent investor would not assess the reasonableness of investing in the newly restructured company without taking into consideration the tremendous financial difficulties of both companies prior to the restructurings or the reasons for those difficulties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Plaintiffs oppose Commerce\u2019s equityworthiness determination, claiming that Usinor and Sacilor were equityworthy by 1986. <em>Plaintiffs </em>\u2019 <em>Brief </em>at 7. As evidence of the companies\u2019 equityworthiness Usinor points to record evidence which, it maintains, shows the companies had cut costs and raised profits significantly by the time they reclassified their PACS and FIS instruments. <em>See id. </em>at 8-9. Usinor argues that the ITA ignored this evidence entirely and relied instead on the companies\u2019 financial performance in years prior to restructuring. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Moreover, Usinor faults Commerce for refusing to consider the companies\u2019 earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation (\u201cEBITD\u201d) as a measure of return on equity when record evidence showed that French investors relied upon EBITD in analyzing the equityworthiness of a company. <em>Id. </em>at 9 n.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The court finds Usinor\u2019s position untenable. First, the guidelines that Commerce ordinarily considers in ascertaining whether a company is equityworthy militate against plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that the ITA should have placed more reliance on Usinor\u2019s and Sacilor\u2019s prospective performance. These guidelines require Commerce to determine whether,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">from the perspective of a reasonable private investor examining the firm at the time the government equity infusion was made, the firm showed an ability to generate a reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time. In making this determination, the Secretary <em>may </em>examine the following factors, <em>among others:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">(i) Current and <em>past indicators </em>of a firm\u2019s financial health calculated from that firm\u2019s statements and accounts, adjusted, if appropriate, to conform to generally accepted accounting principles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">(ii) <em>Future financial prospects </em>of the firm, including market studies, economic forecasts, and project or loan appraisals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">(iii) Rates of return on equity in the <em>three years prior </em>to the government equity infusion; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">(iv) Equity investment in the firm by private investors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-10\"><em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. 23,366,23,381 (May 31,1989) (tobe codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(2)(i)-(iv)) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While Usinor does not challenge the reasonableness of the foregoing guidelines, it does assert that Commerce erred by not considering the companies\u2019 post-restructuring performance. The <em>Final Determination, </em>however, clearly indicates that Commerce did consider the firms\u2019 \u201cfuture financial prospects\u201d by analyzing a study of the firms prepared by McKinsey &amp; Company. <em>See 58 </em>Fed. Reg. at 6222. In addition, to the extent that Usinor claims the ITA should have accorded the McKinsey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>study greater weight, the court finds such a claim without merit. The ITA\u2019s decision to place greater or less weight on the evidence presented to it is clearly within its discretion as the fact finder and does not undermine the reasonableness of its determination. <em>See Negev Phosphates, Ltd. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>12 CIT 1074, 1092, 699 F. Supp. 938, 953 (1988) (\u201cThis Court lacks authority to interfere with [the agency\u2019s] discretion as trier of fact to interpret reasonably evidence collected in [an] investigation.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Second, the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>also support Commerce\u2019s reliance on Usinor\u2019s and Sacilor\u2019s economic performance in the years prior to the 1986 restructuring. The guidelines contained in the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>expressly state that the agency may consider \u201cpast indicators of a firm\u2019s financial health\u201d and, in the case of government infusions, \u201cHates of return on equity in the three years prior to the * * * infusion[s].\u201d 54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(2)(i), (iii)). Commerce\u2019s consideration of Usinor\u2019s and Saci-lor\u2019s economic performance in the years prior to the 1986 restructuring is clearly in accordance with the foregoing language. Moreover, to the extent that Usinor contends that Commerce should have placed less emphasis on the companies\u2019 past economic performance, the court rejects this challenge to the ITA\u2019s discretion as trier of fact. <em>See Negev Phosphates, </em>12 CIT at 1092, 699 F. Supp. at 953 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Third, contrary to Usinor\u2019s suggestion, the fact that the companies had cut costs and raised profits significantly by the time they reclassified their PACS and FIS instruments does not demonstrate that Commerce\u2019s determination was unreasonable. <em>See Plaintiffs\u2019 Briefed </em>8-9. The record in this case is replete with evidence which establishes that the companies were in a critical financial condition prior to and during the time of the 1986 and 1988 reclassifications, and supports a conclusion that the companies were unequityworthy. Thus, despite the fact that the evidence cited by Usinor could be interpreted to indicate that the companies experienced some recovery, the record contains substantial evidence supporting Commerce\u2019s determination that the companies were unequityworthy. <em>Cf. Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966) (\u201c[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Finally, the court finds that Commerce had a reasonable basis for not applying the return on equity methodology urged by Usinor. The EBITD methodology, which measures a company\u2019s return on equity based on the company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation, is distinguishable from the methodology employed by Commerce which examines earnings <em>after </em>interest, taxes and depreciation. <em>See Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6222. Even assuming, as Usinor argues, that French investors rely on the EBITD measure in analyzing the equityworthiness of a company, under Commerce\u2019s <em>Proposed Regu-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>lotions </em>the rate of return on equity is only one factor the ITA might consider. <em>See </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(2)). Therefore, even if the EBITD measure were to show a positive return, the critical financial condition apparent from the totality of all of the factors that Commerce considered pursuant to the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>provides a reasonable basis for Commerce\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Moreover, this court cannot discern any basis in the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>for limiting Commerce to measuring a firm\u2019s return on equity using the methodology ordinarily relied upon by investors in the country under investigation. Although the standard contained in the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>requires Commerce to examine a company from the perspective of a reasonable private investor,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the bases for measuring a company\u2019s return on equity are simply not limited to the methodologies ordinarily applied in the country under review. Rather, the ITA need only apply a methodology which reasonably effectuates the purpose of the statute under which it operates. <em>Cer\u00e1mica Regiomontana, </em>10 CIT at 405, 636 F. Supp. at 966 (citations omitted). In this investigation, Commerce declined to apply the EBITD methodology because \u201c[w]hile potential investors may consider EBITD, it is not as accurate a reflection of the potential return on an investment as a measure which is net of interest, taxes, and depreciation, i.e., net income.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6222. Usinor has not suggested any basis for finding Commerce\u2019s chosen methodology unreasonable other than the fact that French investors frequently apply the EBITD methodology. Plaintiffs\u2019 position clearly does not address the substance of the \u201cnet income\u201d methodology that Commerce adopted. Because the court finds that the \u201cnet income\u201d methodology provides a reasonable measure of the companies\u2019 return on equity, the court concludes that its application in this investigation is proper. For all of the foregoing reasons, the court holds that Commerce\u2019s determination that Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors were not equityworthy in 1986 and 1988 is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise rnaccordance with law. Accordingly, this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">3. <em>Valuation of Benefits from the Conversion of PACS and FIS Instruments:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The next issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination, that the countervailable benefits arising from the conversion of PACS and FIS instruments equalled the face value of the remaining balance on the instruments, is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. In its <em>Final Determination, </em>the ITA abandoned the rate of return shortfall (\u201cRQRS\u201d) methodology prescribed by the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>for measuring the benefit of equity investments in unequityworthy firms. <em>See Final Deiermina</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>tion, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6223. Under the RORS methodology, Commerce would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\">measure [ ] the benefit of equity investments in \u201cunequity-worthy\u201d firms by comparing the national average rate of return on equity with the company\u2019s rate of return on equity during each year of the allocation period. The difference in these amounts, the so-called rate of return shortfall (RORS), is then multiplied by the amount of the equity investment to determine the countervailable benefit in the given year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\"><em>Id.; see also Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,385 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(e)(1)). Under RORS, Commerce would also subtract from the amount of a firm\u2019s countervailable benefits any dividends paid during the year under examination that were not included in the firm\u2019s rate ofreturn. <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,385 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(e)(1)). Commerce rejected the RORS methodology in the <em>Final Determination </em>because it found that the methodology does not accurately measure the benefit of government equity investments in unequityworthy firms. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6223. Specifically, Commerce concluded that an equity investment in an unequity worthy firm is tantamount to a grant and should be valued as such without any offset for subsequent dividends. <em>See id. </em>at 6229. Commerce explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">When [Commerce] finds that a company is unequityworthy and, hence, that the government\u2019s equity investment is inconsistent with commercial considerations, we are effectively finding that the company could not attract share capital from a reasonable investor. When a company is in such poor financial condition that it cannot attract capital, any capital it receives benefits the company as if it were a grant and no earnings of the company in subsequent years should be used to offset the benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 6223. Commerce also determined that the RORS approach \u201cis inadequate because it necessarily reflects the subsequent performance of the company. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6229. According to the ITA, \u201cpotential subsidies arise from the equity investment and not what happens to that equity subsequently.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Usinor contends that the ITA erred in abandoning the RORS methodology. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 10 n.34. Usinor claims that \u201c[b]y equating an equity infusion into a supposedly unequityworthy company with a grant, the ITA has ignored the simple fact that, unlike receiving a grant, there is a cost to the firm of issuing equity, which is accurately measured by RORS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs also assert that \u201c[b]y treating equity infusions as grants, the ITA overvalue[d] the benefit to the firm\u201d by failing to account for subsequent dividends. <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. Usinor maintains that the ITA should have valued the benefits using the present value of the forgiven obligations rather than their face value. <em>Id. </em>at 11. According to Usinor, because the 1986 and 1988 reclassifications effectively eliminated contingent obligations that were worthless due to the companies\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>unequityworthiness, the elimination conferred no countervailable benefits on the companies. <em>Id. </em>at 11-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Usinor\u2019s arguments fail to establish that Commerce\u2019s valuation methodology was improper in this case. First, the court rejects Usinor\u2019s argument that Commerce should have relied on the present value of the PACS and FIS instruments rather than on the face value of the instruments\u2019 remaining principal, because it ignores the fact that the PACS and FIS instruments constituted debt upon issuance which obligated the companies to make repayments once they became profitable. Usinor simply fails to acknowledge that the contingent nature of the liabilities does not affect the conclusion that the liabilities constituted debt. <em>Cf. Davenport, </em>495 U.S. at 558. Although the PACS and FIS instruments clearly indicate that the companies\u2019 unprofitability might delay the companies\u2019 repayment obligation, such unprofitability does not <em>excuse </em>the obligations. Consequently, the extent to which the companies\u2019 unprofitability might have delayed repayment on the instruments is irrelevant to an analysis of whether and to what extent the instruments\u2019 conversions conferred countervailable benefits on the companies. The court concludes, therefore, that Commerce had a reasonable basis for determining that the countervailable benefits attributable to the conversion equal the face value of the remaining principal on the instruments. <em>See British Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 224, 240, 632 F. Supp. 59, 71 (1986) (\u201c[T]he commercial and competitive benefit of the subsidy to the recipient is the measure of the value of the subsidy. In the case of debt forgiveness, the commercial and competitive benefit to the recipient is debt extinguishment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Second, Usinor fails to establish that Commerce unreasonably focused upon the economic benefits inuring to the companies instead of on the value of the PACS and FIS instruments in the hands of the GOF. Because Commerce properly determined that the benefit of the subsidies attributable to the instruments\u2019 conversion equals the debt extinguished by the conversion, the court concludes that the ITA reasonably valued the subsidies in terms of the actual value realized by the companies from the debt forgiveness rather than the potential value foregone by the GOF.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Third, the court disagrees with Usinor\u2019s contention that Commerce\u2019s revised methodology overvalues the benefits of the investments made by the GOF, by not taking into account subsequent dividends paid by the companies to the GOF. Commerce had a reasonable basis for denying the companies an offset for such dividends because the dividends represented a return on the GOF\u2019s investment rather than a payback to the GOF for its investment. In other words, the dividends did not reduce the actual benefits the companies received from the instruments\u2019 conversion. Consequently, Commerce\u2019s methodology provides a reasonable measure of the actual commercial and competitive benefits attributable to the conversion of the PACS and FIS instruments. For all of the foregoing reasons the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the countervailable benefits arising from the conversion of the PACS and FIS instruments equalled the face value of the remaining balance on the instruments, is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. This aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">4. <em>Shareholder Advances as Non-Recurring Grants:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The next issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination that shareholder advances made by the GOF to Usinor and Sacilor were non-recurring grants is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. At the outset, the court will address Inland Steel\u2019s threshold argument that the shareholders\u2019 advances were not grants upon issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In its <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce determined that the advances constitute countervailable grants at the time that they were received because no shares were distributed in return for these advances. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6225. Commerce treated the advances as grants as of the time of receipt because it found \u201cno evidence showing that the parties contemplated that the shareholders\u2019 advances carried a repayment obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6229. Commerce\u2019s verification report for the GOF states that GOF officials informed the ITA that</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">[ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\"><em>Confid. Doc. 19 </em>at 8. Commerce\u2019s verification report for Usinor Sacilor further indicates that company officials [ ] <em>Confid. Doc. 20 </em>at 9. Notwithstanding the fact that [ ] led Commerce to conclude that the grants were not \u201cloans that were subsequently converted to equity or loans that were cancelled.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6229.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">Inland Steel contends that the advances were clearly debt and, therefore, the question of whether the advances were recurring grants is irrelevant. <em>Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Response Brief at </em>18-19. Specifically, Inland Steel points to Usinor Sacilor\u2019s statement in its questionnaire response characterizing the advances as \u201cloans\u201d that are repayable on demand. <em>Id. </em>at 18 (quoting <em>Pub. Doc. 68, Confid. Doc. 6, </em>at 7). Inland Steel also relies on the fact that Usinor treated the advances as liabilities in its financial statements and tables compiled for Commerce. <em>Inland Steel\u2019s R.56.2 Brief at </em>24 (citing <em>Pub. Doc. 68, Confid. Doc. 6, </em>Exs. H, M). Moreover; Inland Steel maintains that the advances could not have been equity when issued because they were converted into common stock in the 1986 restructuring. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25 (citing <em>Pub. Doc. 108, Confid. Doc. 20, </em>at 9-10; <em>Pub. Doc. 55, Confid. Doc. 3, </em>Ex. 27 at 2; <em>Pub. Doc. 107, Con-fid. Doc. 19, </em>at 9). Therefore, according to Inland Steel, it was unnecessary for Commerce to decide whether the advances were recurring. <em>Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Response Brief at </em>18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>The items of record cited by Inland Steel fail to establish that Commerce did not base its determination upon substantial evidence on the record. As noted, Commerce concluded that the advances were not loans upon issuance after determining that the record failed to show that the parties contemplated that these shareholders\u2019 advances carried a repayment obligation. The items upon which Inland Steel relies provide only some conflicting evidence of a repayment obligation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Compare Pub. Doc. 71, </em>Ex. M. at 10-11 (translated audited 1982 consolidated financial statement for Sacilor noting that the advances were \u201cfor the purpose of a subsequent capital increase\u201d) <em>with Pub. Doc. 68, Confid. Doc. 6, </em>at Ex. H (Usinor Sacilor group\u2019s condensed balance sheet [</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">]). When record evidence gives rise to conflicting inferences, both of which are supported by substantial evidence, the decision as to the credibility of the evidence and the inference to be drawn therefrom lies with the fact finder. As fact finder in this case, the decision is well within the province of Commerce and this court will not disturb it. <em>See Timken Co. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 955, 962, 699 F. Supp. 300, 306 (1988), <em>aff\u2019d after remand, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 29, 893 F.2d 337 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The court now turns to the question of whether the shareholders\u2019 advances were recurring. Under Commerce\u2019s past practice, the question of whether a particular program is recurring is relevant for purposes of deciding whether to allocate the benefit arising from the program\u2019s payments to the year of receipt or over time. <em>Live Swine and Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork Products from Canada, </em>50 Fed. Reg. 25,097, 25,101 (June 17, 1985) (final determination) <em>(\u201cLive Swine\u201d) </em>(\u201cIn the case of recurring programs, [Commerce] would allocate the benefit to the year of receipt; in non-recurring programs, [Commerce] would allocate the benefit over time.\u201d <em>Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Commerce generally considers three factors in determining whether a program confers recurring benefits. These factors are: (1) whether the program providing the benefit is exceptional; (2) whether the program is of long standing; and (3) whether there is any reason to believe that the program will not continue into the future. <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,376 (citations omitted). In order to decide whether a program is \u201cexceptional,\u201d the ITA will ascertain whether the program has been established for a period of years, or was designed as a \u2018\u201conetime, shot-in-the-arm\u2019 subsidy program.\u201d <em>Live Swine, </em>50 Fed. Reg. at 25,101.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>In the instant investigation, Commerce examined the availability of the shareholders\u2019 advances. Specifically, the ITA noted that Usinor and Sacilor received the advances from the GOF from 1982 until 1986, at which time the GOF and the companies converted the advances to common stock. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224. Commerce also indicated that the advances carried no interest and that the GOF did not place any preconditions on their receipt. <em>Id. </em>As noted, [ ] <em>Confid. Doc. 19 </em>at 8. Commerce ultimately determined that the advances \u201cshould be treated as non-recurring grants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6229. The ITA provided the following rationale for its determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">Although Usinor and Sacilor received shareholders\u2019 advances on a regular basis during the years 1982 through 1986, each advance required specific shareholders\u2019 approval. Moreover, these shareholders\u2019 advances were made to cover operating losses. Repeated shareholders\u2019 advances made to keep a company from dissolving are \u201cexceptional\u201d events, within the meaning of <em>[Live Swine, </em>50 Fed. Reg. at 25,101]. Therefore, under the Department\u2019s methodology, we are treating the shareholders\u2019 advances as non-recurring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\"><em>Id. </em>Commerce thus determined that the advances \u201cconstitute counter-vailable grants at the time they were received as no shares were distributed in return for these advances when they were made to Usinor and Sacilor. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6225. In accordance with its conclusion that the advances were non-recurring, Commerce allocated the advances over a 15-year period and did not allow the company to expense the advances in the year of receipt. <em>See id. </em>at 6230 (describing the 15-year allocation period which Commerce applied to the subsidies at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Usinor contends that the advances were recurring grants under Commerce\u2019s usual methodology for testing grants. Specifically, Usinor claims that the advances \u201cwere not exceptional because they were provided repeatedly to cover losses regularly incurred.\u201d <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 18. Usinor also points to the fact that [ ]. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Confid. Doe. 19 </em>at 8). Plaintiffs further maintain that the advances \u201cwere longstanding, as they were provided for five consecutive years,\u201d and were likely to continue into the future due to the company\u2019s poor economic performance. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. In light of these attributes, plaintiffs charge that Commerce had no basis for concluding the advances were non-recurring. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Usinor\u2019s arguments fail to establish that Commerce did not base its determination upon substantial evidence on the record. Although the evidence cited by Usinor clearly indicates that the advances lasted for five years and, therefore, may have been longstanding, other record evidence amply supports Commerce\u2019s determination that the grants were exceptional. This evidence establishes that the GOF provided the advances on an essentially <em>ad hoc </em>basis, and was under no obligation to provide such advances. The <em>ad hoc </em>nature of the grants is apparent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the fact that provision of the grants depended upon the monthly losses realized by the companies and the approval of the Bureau Chief of the French Ministry ofTreasury. <em>See Pub. Doc. 107, Confid. Doc. 19, </em>at8 <em>;cf. New Steel Rail, Except Light Rail, From Canada, </em>54 Fed. Reg. 31,991, 31,996 (Aug. 3, 1989) (final determination) (Canadian government\u2019s provision of grants found to be exceptional in part because the government likely would have discontinued the grants if the recipient were to turn a profit). In sum, although the GOF may have provided the advances over a somewhat lengthy period of time, the conditions under which the companies received the advances provides a reasonable basis for concluding that the advances amounted to a series of \u201cone-time, shot-in-the-arm\u201d subsidies.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In addition, although the record contains conflicting evidence as to whether the GOF and the companies had an agreement pertaining to the advances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the extent such an agreement may have existed, it appears only to have created a mere <em>expectation </em>that the companies would receive the advances. <em>See Pub. Doc. 107, Confid. Doc. 19, </em>at 8 (indicating GOF officials told Commerce verifiers that the companies and the GOF had an agreement pursuant to which the companies [ ]). Despite the statements by the GOF which might support a different interpretation, the court finds that the totality of the record evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that the grants were exceptional. For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination that shareholder advances made by the GOF to Usinor and Sacilor were non-recurring grants is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. This aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">5. <em>FDES Consolidated Loans and Outstanding CFDI Loans Conferred Countervailable Benefits:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The next issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination that the consolidation of Usinor Sacilor\u2019s FDES loans conferred a countervailable benefit upon the company, as did outstanding CFDI loans during the period of investigation, is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. As noted, beginning in approximately 1978, Usinor, Sacilor, or their subsidiaries obtained \u201cparticipative\u201d FDES and CFDI loans. These loans carried below market interest rates and required borrowers to pay a share of future profits. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6225. In 1990, the outstanding principal on FDES loans to Usinor and Sacilor was consolidated into multiple long-term loans. <em>Id. </em>In 1991, outstanding CFDI loans to Usinor Sacilor were similarly consolidated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Commerce determined that the consolidated FDES loans were coun-tervailable after concluding that the loans were <em>de facto </em>limited. <em>Id. </em>The ITA reached this conclusion upon finding that the information submitted to it pertaining to the availability of the consolidated loans was deficient. Specifically, Commerce states that the GOF</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">provided the total distribution of participative FDES loans for 1981 through 1990. It does not appear that the new 1990, consolidated loans for Usinor Sacilor are included in this information. The information provided only seems to relate to participative loans rather than the types of loans obtained by Usinor Sacilor in 1990. Indeed, the information provided indicates that the consolidated amounts exceeded the total amount of FDES loans distributed to all sectors of the economy for the years 1987, 1988, and 1989 combined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><em>Id. </em>Because it lacked information as to whether the loans were limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries, Commerce concluded that the loans were <em>de facto </em>limited. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Commerce\u2019s determination with respect to the CFDI loans differed. First, the ITA determined that consolidation of the CFDI loans produced no cash flow effect during the period of investigation and, therefore, did not provide any countervailable benefits during that time. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6225. In contrast to the consolidated CFDI loans, however, Commerce did find that Usinor Sacilor\u2019s old CFDI loans created a potentially countervailable cash flow effect during the POI. <em>Id. </em>After determining that such a cash flow effect existed, the ITA considered whether the CFDI loans were limited to a specific enterprise and, therefore, countervailable. Commerce determined that the CFDI loans were <em>defacto </em>limited to a specific enterprise because the evidence adduced by plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the loans were non-specific. <em>Id. </em>As a result, Commerce concluded that the CFDI loans are <em>de facto </em>limited and \u201care countervailable to the extent that they were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The specificity inquiry that Commerce undertook in the instant investigation arises from 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5). This statutory provision directs Commerce, in considering whether a domestic subsidy exists, to \u201cdetermine whether the * * * subsidy in law or in fact is provided to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5)(B) (1988). This provision also indicates that \u201c[njominal general availability, under the terms of the law, regulation, program, or rule establishing a * * * subsidy, of the benefits thereunder is not a basis for determining that the * * * subsidy is not, or has not been, in fact provided to a specific enterprise or industry, or group thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This standard \u201cfocuses on the <em>defacto </em>case-by-case effect of benefits provided to recipients rather than on the nominal availability of benefits.\u201d <em>Cabot Corp. v. United States, </em>9 CIT 489, 498, 620 F. Supp. 722, 732 (1985), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>4 Fed. Cir. (T) 80, 788 F.2d 1539 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Usinor challenges Commerce\u2019s specificity determinations concerning the GOF\u2019s provision of the old CFDI loans and the consolidated FDES loans. With respect to the consolidated FDES loans, Usinor argues that the ITA erroneously found these loans to be <em>de facto </em>specific because the consolidation did not materially alter the terms of the original loans. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 21-22. In support, Usinor states that \u201cthe ITA verified that the terms of the consolidated loans were designed to match, on average, the maturity and interest rates on the original loans. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. According to plaintiffs, because \u201cthe consolidation did not materially alter the terms of the original loans, the only reasonable method of determining whether the FDES loans were <em>de facto </em>specific would have been to compare the amounts of the loans originally granted to Usinor Sacilor with those contemporaneously granted to other sectors of the French economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21-22 (footnote omitted). Such a comparison, contend plaintiffs, \u201cdemonstrates that the loans to Usinor Sacilor were not <em>de facto </em>specific, as they comprised a small fraction of the loans granted to other sectors of the economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Plaintiffs also argue that Commerce\u2019s specificity determination must fail because Commerce improperly compared the availability of consolidated FDES loans with the availability of the original FDES loans. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Brief </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Upon review, the court finds Usinor\u2019s arguments unavailing. Usinor\u2019s assertions, while ultimately attacking the validity of Commerce\u2019s specificity determination, target the ITA\u2019s assumption that the consolidated loans were new loans that <em>may </em>constitute countervailable subsidies. <em>See Confid. Doc. 16 </em>at 9 ([ ]). By arguing that this assumption is invalid, Usinor effectively shifts the focus away from Commerce\u2019s specificity determination and toward the more fundamental question of whether a subsidy <em>could have </em>arisen by virtue of the consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Simply put, the record in this case belies Usinor\u2019s position. It is clear that the terms of the consolidated FDES loans differ from the terms of the original FDES loans. <em>See, e.g., Confid. Doc. 6 </em>at 6 ([ ]); <em>see also id., </em>Ex. D at 1 (noting that the original loans were [ ]). Furthermore, although Commerce\u2019s verification report indicates that GOF officials stated that the consolidated loans had terms <em>designed </em>to match those of the original loans, this does not demonstrate such matching <em>actually </em>occurred. Neither GOF officials nor Usinor sought to demonstrate through calculations or otherwise that the terms of the consolidated loans actually matched those of the original loans. Thus, even assuming that the matching of terms was intended, such an assumption does not negate Commerce\u2019s conclusion that the consolidated loans did in fact have new terms and, therefore, should be regarded as new loans. Accordingly, the court rejects plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the consolidated FDES loans did not contain new terms, and finds that Commerce\u2019s determination that the consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>loans could have conferred subsidies upon Usinor Sacilor is reasonable and is supported by substantial record evidence. This aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is therefore sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The court finds Usinor\u2019s challenge to Commerce\u2019s specificity determination equally without merit. Usinor premises its challenge on a misapprehension of the facts. In short, Usinor claims that Commerce should have addressed only the availability of the original FDES loans because, in its view, the 1990 consolidated loans were not new loans and, consequently, could not have conferred any countervailable subsidy. <em>See Plaintiffs\u2019 </em>Briefat 21-22. As noted, however, the record in this case supports Commerce\u2019s conclusion that the 1990 consolidated loans were new loans. Thus, because the 1990 consolidated loans formed the basis of Commerce\u2019s FDES inquiry, Commerce properly considered data relating to the consolidated loans, including data pertaining to the availability of such loans. As a result, the court concludes that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that Commerce\u2019s determination that the consolidated FDES loans were specific and, therefore, countervailable, is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record or not otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">With regard to the old CFDI loans, Usinor contends that the record clearly establishes that these loans were not <em>de facto </em>specific. <em>Plaintiffs </em>\u2019 <em>Brief Sit 22. </em>Specifically, plaintiffs point to a letter written by the president of CFDI which indicates that the CFDI loans were not limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Confid. Doc. 20, </em>Ex. 31). Plaintiffs maintain that this letter amply demonstrates that the loans were not <em>de facto </em>specific, and thus precludes the conclusion reached by Commerce that Usinor failed to provide adequate evidence to establish the character of the loans. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs also fault Commerce for assuming that the CFDI loans were <em>de facto </em>specific based on Usinor Sacilor\u2019s failure to provide additional evidence demonstrating that the loans were generally available. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Upon review, the court finds plaintiffs\u2019 arguments unavailing. In their submissions to this court, plaintiffs cite two items on the record in support of their position. The first item is a listing of outstanding CFDI loans transferred to Usinor Sacilor. <em>Pub. Doe. 68, Confid. Doc. 6, </em>Ex. D at 36. This listing, however, simply does not indicate whether CFDI loans were generally available throughout the French economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The second item, a letter from the president of CFDI to plaintiffs\u2019 former counsel, is equally uninstructive. The pertinent translated portion of this letter reads: [ ] <em>Confid. Doc. 20, </em>Ex. 31. The general nature of this lone statement clearly renders it an inadequate basis for determining whether the CFDI loans were non-specific. Indeed, the letter is devoid of any factual support for plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the CFDI loans were generally available and, therefore, non-specific. Accordingly, the court finds that Commerce reasonably concluded that this letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>failed to substantiate Usinor\u2019s position regarding the availability of the CFDI loans. For the foregoing reasons, the court rejects plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Commerce was provided with evidence which demonstrated that the loans were generally available and, therefore, non-specific. The same reasons also compel the court to find that plaintiffs have failed to establish that Commerce improperly assumed the CFDI loans were <em>de facto </em>specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Finally, the court finds plaintiffs\u2019 claim, that Commerce lacked substantial evidence for its determination, similarly without merit. In the instant investigation, Commerce noted that plaintiffs failed to submit information \u201con the terms of [Usinor Sacilor\u2019s old CFDI loans] or whether these loans were limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries.\u201d <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 42,979. In the absence of such information, Commerce determined it would apply best information available (\u201cBIA\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in the <em>Final Determination, </em>Commerce determined that the CFDI loans were <em>de facto </em>specific based on a lack of supporting evidence from plaintiffs regarding the availability of the loans. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6225. It is apparent from both the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>and the <em>Final Determination </em>that Commerce sought but did not receive information bearing on the availability of the old CFDI loans and that the absence of such information prompted the ITA to conclude these loans were <em>de facto </em>specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">While it is unclear whether Commerce intended to reaffirm its reliance on BIA in the <em>Final Determination, </em>the rationale underlying the BIA rule unquestionably supports Commerce\u2019s CFDI determination. BIA is a rule of adverse inference which allows Commerce to avoid \u201crewarding the uncooperative and recalcitrant party for its failure to supply requested information.\u201d <em>Allied-Signal Aerospace Co. v. United States, 11 </em>Fed. Cir. (T) _, _, 996 F.2d 1185, 1192 (1993). This rule exists in recognition of the fact that \u201cthe ITA cannot be left merely to the largesse of the parties at their discretion to supply the ITA with information* * *. Otherwise, alleged unfair traders would be able to control the amount of * * * duties by selectively providing the ITA with information.\u201d <em>Olympic Adhesives, Inc. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 69, 76, 899 F.2d 1565, 1571-72 (1990) (citations omitted). Commerce\u2019s application of the rule \u201cfairly places the burden of production on the importer, which has in its possession the information capable of rebutting the agency\u2019s inference.\u201d <em>Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v. United States, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) 61, 67, 899 F.2d 1185, 1190-91 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">In this case, plaintiffs failed to provide Commerce with sufficient information pertaining to the availability of the old CFDI loans. The language of the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>clearly placed plaintiffs on notice of the need to submit information in this regard: <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 42,979. Rather than argue no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>information existed, plaintiffs responded by submitting the items previously discussed, i.e. the listing of CFDI loans and the letter from the CFDI president. These items, however, could not reasonably be expected to satisfy the submission deficiency that Commerce identified in the <em>Preliminary Determination. </em>Because plaintiffs failed to provide Commerce with information that was materially probative of whether the old CFDI loans were industry non-specific, when plaintiffs were in the best position to do so, the ITA had a reasonable basis for inferring that such information would have demonstrated that the loans were <em>de facto </em>specific. <em>Cf. Rhone Poulenc, </em>8 Fed. Cir. (T) at 67, 899 F.2d at 1190 (the ITA\u2019s presumption that the highest prior dumping margin was the best information of current margins \u201creflects a common sense inference that the highest prior margin is the most probative evidence of current margins because, if it were not so, the importer, knowing of the [BIA] rule, would have produced <em>current </em>information showing the margin to be less\u201d). As a result, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination that the old CFDI loans were <em>de facto </em>specific and, therefore, coun-tervailable, is supported by substantial evidence on the record and otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\">6. <em>The IMF Long-Term Rate for France as the Benchmark Interest and Discount Rate:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The next issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination to use the IMF\u2019s long-term rate for France as the benchmark interest and discount rate in the years in which Usinor Sacilor was uncreditworthy is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Commerce decided to use the IMF rate as the benchmark interest and discount rate and added a risk premium to measure the benefits the company received from the GOF\u2019s grant programs because the company \u201cdid not report its actual cost for long-term, fixed-rate debt.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224. The ITA determined that it would apply the highest annual interest rate published by the IMF pursuant to its <em>Proposed Regulations </em>and based on its finding that Usinor Sacilor was uncreditworthy in the years in which the GOF approved all of the company\u2019s grants. <em>Id.; see Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(b)(6)(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Commerce\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations </em>describe the manner in which the ITA generally measures countervailable benefits arising from governmental loans and grants. These regulations indicate that \u201c[a] loan provided by a government confers a countervailable benefit to the extent that the amount paid by a firm for the government loan is less than what the firm would pay for a benchmark loan.\u201d <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,380 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(b)(1)). For gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>eminent long-term loans,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the benchmark prescribed by the regulations varies depending upon whether the company under investigation is creditworthy. Proposed \u00a7 355.44(b)(4) sets forth the benchmark rates for creditworthy companies while proposed \u00a7 355.44(b) (6) (iv) describes the rates for uncreditworthy companies. <em>See id., </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,380-81. The latter provision requires Commerce, in relevant part, to \u201ccalculate the benchmark interest rate for a long-term government loan by taking the sum of 12 percent of the prime interest rate in the country in question and * * * [t]he highest long-term fixed interest rate commonly available to firms in the country in question. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(b)(6)(iv)(A)(l)).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Once Commerce determines the amount of countervailable benefits flowing from a government loan, the ITA then allocates the benefits over time and, specifically, to the period of investigation. The methodology that Commerce will employ for allocating long-term government loans appears in proposed 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(c)(1). <em>See id., </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,384-85. Specifically, Commerce will use the following three-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">(i) Determine the grant equivalent for the loan by calculating the present value, in the year the loan is received, of the difference between the amount that the firm is to pay under the government loan and the amount that the firm would have paid under the benchmark loan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">(ii) Assign a discount rate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">(iii) Construct a benefit stream.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-8\"><em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,385. The discount rate that Commerce will assign under the second step of the allocation process is \u201cthe benchmark interest rate for the loan in question determined pursuant to \u00a7 355.44(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the ITA selected the IMF long-term rate for France as the benchmark interest rate pursuant to \u00a7 355.44(b)(6)(iv), the IMF rate became the discount rate assigned under \u00a7 355.49(c)(1), (c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The <em>Proposed Regulations </em>prescribe similar treatment for government grants; Commerce will measure the countervailable benefits from the grants and allocate a portion of the benefits to the period of investigation. With respect to measuring the amount of countervailable benefits attributable to such grants, the regulations provide that \u201ca countervailable benefit exists in the amount of the grant. <em>\u201d Id., </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,380 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(a)). In addition, the allocation that Commerce will undertake for grants entails virtually the same three-step process as that for loans. Specifically, the ITA will: (1) determine the amount of the countervailable benefit pursuant to \u00a7 355.44; (2) assign a discount rate; and (3) construct a benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>stream. <em>Id., </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,384 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(b) (1) (i)-(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The methodology that the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>prescribe for assigning discount rates to governmental grants diverges, however, from that provided for governmental loans. Instead of using the benchmark interest rate as the discount rate, as is the case with governmental loans, the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>set forth the following three options from which Commerce may assign a discount rate, in order of preference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">(i) The cost of long-term, fixed-rate debt of the firm in question, excluding loans found to confer a countervailable subsidy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">(ii) The average cost of long-term, fixed-rate debt in the country in question; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">(iii) A rate which the Secretary considers to be most appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\"><em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,384 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(b)(2)(i)-(iii)). Notwithstanding this hierarchy, in numerous investigations Commerce has used the benchmark interest rate as the discount rate where the company under review was <em>uncreditworthy </em>at the time when the government approved or provided the grants. <em>See, e.g., Certain Steel Products From France, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37,304, 37,313-14 (July 9, 1993) (final determination); <em>Certain Steel Products From Spain, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37,374, 37,384-85 (July 9,1993) (final determination); <em>New Steel Rail, Except Light Rail, From Canada, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 31,994 (final determination); <em>Certain Carbon Steel Products From Brazil, </em>52 Fed. Reg. 829,831 (Jan. 9,1987) (final results of admin, review). Consistent with its practice in the aforementioned investigations, Commerce used the IMF long-term rate for France as the discount rate for Usinor Sacilor\u2019s grants in the years in which the company was uncreditworthy. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6224.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Plaintiffs oppose Commerce\u2019s determination for several reasons. Plaintiffs assert that the benchmark interest and discount rate adopted by Commerce were punitive and mark a departure from the agency\u2019s past practice. <em>See Plaintiffs\u2019Brief at </em>23-24. Specifically, plaintiffs fault Commerce for adding a risk premium to the discount rate used to allocate the benefits of the grants that Usinor Sacilor received. <em>Id. </em>at 23 n.83. Plaintiffs also suggest that the ITA improperly ignored information submitted by both petitioners and plaintiffs pertaining to the applicability of lower, OECD interest rates. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. Finally, as a factual matter, Usinor claims the ITA erroneously determined that the IMF rate was a long-term lending rate as record evidence establishes that this rate applied to short-term and medium-term financing. <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The court finds plaintiffs\u2019 arguments unavailing. To the extent that plaintiffs contend the discount rate assigned in the instant case is punitive, plaintiffs place undue reliance on the fact that the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>do not provide for a risk premium for discount rates. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,384 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(b)(2)(i) \u2014 (iii)). As noted, Commerce developed its practice of assigning discount rates that match the benchmark interest rates for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>uncreditworthy companies both before and after publication of the <em>Proposed Regulations. See Certain Steel Products From France, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,313-14 (1993 determination using the benchmark interest rate as the discount rate); <em>Certain Steel Products From Spain, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,384-85 (1993 determination using the benchmark interest rate as the discount rat <em>e);New Steel Rail, Except Light Rail, From Canada, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 31,994 (1989 determination using the benchmark interest rate as the discount rate); <em>Certain Carbon Steel Products From Brazil, </em>52 Fed. Reg. at 831 (1987 determination using the benchmark interest rate as the discount rate).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The addition of a risk premium to the benchmark rate conforms Commerce\u2019s methodology for assigning discount rates for grants to its methodology for assigning discount rates for loans. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (indicating Commerce will calculate the benchmark rate for a government long-term loan \u201cby taking the sum of 12 percent of the prime interest rate in the country in question and * * * [t]he highest long-term fixed interest rate commonly available to firms in the country in question\u201d) (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(b)(6)(iv)(A)(l)); <em>id., </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,385 (the discount rate for allocating the benefits from a governmental loan is \u201cthe benchmark interest rate for the loan in question determined pursuant to \u00a7 355.44(b)\u201d) (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(c)(3)). If Commerce did not add a risk premium to the \u201chighest long-term fixed interest rate\u201d in assigning a discount rate for government grants, the uncreditworthy recipient company would completely avoid the additional \u201c12 percent of the prime interest rate\u201d that Commerce would have applied if the company were to have received a governmental loan. Commerce\u2019s practice of using the \u201chighest long-term fixed interest rate\u201d in addition to a risk premium is reasonable because it creates uniformity in the ITA\u2019s treatment of government loans and grants and allocates benefits in a manner that better corresponds to commercial reality than does a creditworthy discount rate or a rate that does not contain a risk premium. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 85-86 (1979), <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.C.C.A.N 381, 471-72 (emphasizing the need to develop reasonable methods of allocating subsidies received' over time in a manner that reflects the subsidies\u2019 commercial and competitive benefit to the recipient). While it is unclear from the record how the risk premium added to the IMF rate for the grants\u2019 discount rates compares with the additional \u201c12 percent of the prime interest rate\u201d that Commerce ordinarily adds to the benchmark rate for purposes of assigning a discount rate for government loans, the risk premium clearly enables the ITA to treat grants and loans more similarly. For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that the ITA has a reasonable basis for using the benchmark interest rates for uncreditworthy companies, plus a risk premium, as the discount rates for such companies. The reasonableness of Commerce\u2019s methodology, coupled with the fact that Usinor Sacilor was uncredit-worthy at the time when the GOF approved the grants at issue, convince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the court that the discount rate that Commerce assigned to Usinor Saci-lor was not punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The court also rejects plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Commerce\u2019s addition of a risk premium to the discount rate represents a departure from past practice. As noted, in at least two prior unrelated investigations, Commerce added a risk premium to the applicable interest rate in calculating the discount rate which the ITA used to allocate countervailable benefits over time. <em>New Steel Rail, Except Light Rail, From Canada, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 31,993-94; <em>Certain Carbon Steel Products From Brazil, </em>52 Fed. Reg. at 831. These investigations also compel the conclusion that Commerce has not limited its use of a risk premium to instances in which the particular subsidy at issue is a loan. The court, therefore, disagrees with plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that Commerce\u2019s determination to use a risk premium in this case is a \u201cnovel practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Commerce should have used the OECD rates is similarly without merit. Plaintiffs base their claim on the fact that both petitioners and plaintiffs submitted these rates to Commerce in the instant investigation, and that Commerce used these rates in prior investigations involving merchandise from France. Notwithstanding the fact that both petitioners and plaintiffs submitted OECD rates to Commerce, the IMF rates are clearly a matter of public record and Commerce adequately explained its reliance upon the IMF rates in the instant case. <em>Cf.0 Ipsco, Inc. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 1128, 1130, 701 F. Supp. 236, 238 (1988) (\u201cIf ITA wishes to apply information gleaned from public documents it may do so, as long as it relates such information to the facts of the case before it. \u201d). In addition, the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>demonstrates that information pertaining to IMF rates was before the ITA and that plaintiffs had an opportunity to raise whatever objections they may have had to the ITA\u2019s use of such rates. <em>Preliminary Determination, 57 </em>Fed. Reg. at 42,978 (noting Commerce\u2019s use of the IMF rates in the instant investigation). Consequently, the fact that both petitioners and plaintiffs submitted OECD rates to Commerce does not establish that Commerce improperly applied the IMF rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Commerce\u2019s earlier investigations of French companies is also misplaced.- Whereas the companies under review in those previous cases were creditworthy in the years for which Commerce applied the OECD rates, Usinor Sacilor was uncreditworthy in the years for which the agency has applied the IMF rates in this case. The former investigations cited by plaintiffs, therefore, do not demonstrate the unreasonableness of Commerce\u2019s application of the higher IMF rates in this case. The court also observes that the <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>promulgated approximately seven years after the investigations cited by plaintiffs, expressly indicate that Commerce will use \u201c[t]he highest longrterm fixed interest rate commonly available to firms in the country in question\u201d to calculate the benchmark interest rate for uncreditworthy firms. 54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(b)(6)(iv)(A)(l)). Commerce\u2019s current practice accords with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>this approach. <em>Certain Steel Products From France, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,313-14; <em>Certain Steel Products From Spain, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 37,384-85; <em>New Steel Rail, Except Light Rail, From Canada, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 31,994. For all of the foregoing reasons, the court finds that the earlier investigations upon which plaintiffs rely do not mandate the use of the lower OECD rates in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Finally, the court also rejects plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the IMF rates are not long-term rates. To demonstrate that the IMF rates are not long-term rates, plaintiffs point to a passage in the International Financial Statistics Yearbook (\u201cYearbook\u201d) published by the IMF which indicates that the lending rates at issue \u201c\u2018meet the short-and medium-term financing needs of the private sector.\u2019\u201d <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 24 (citation omitted). The foregoing passage is not probative of whether the IMF rates do not apply to loans that, under Commerce\u2019s definition, are long-term. As noted, Commerce uses the term \u201clong-term loan\u201d to describe loans, \u201cthe terms of repayment for which are greater than one year.\u201d <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,379 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.41(j)). Nothing in the passage cited by plaintiffs clarifies the meaning of the terms used and, specifically, whether the IMF rates apply to loans the terms of repayment of which are <em>less than </em>one year. Consequently, the court concludes that the Yearbook does not demonstrate Commerce improperly regarded the IMF rates as long-term rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second argument is similarly unavailing. According to plaintiffs, \u201ca simple comparison of the IMF lending rates to the OECD rates * * * makes it obvious that the IMF rate was far closer to the rates charged to individuals for short-term loans and to businesses for overdrafts and advances than to medium-and long-term rates charged to businesses.\u201d <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 24 (footnote omitted). The comparison urged by plaintiffs simply does not demonstrate that Commerce erroneously relied on the IMF rate as a long-term rate. The mere fact that the IMF rates may correspond to what the OECD has determined to be the rates for individuals\u2019 short-term loans and for businesses\u2019 overdrafts and advances does not establish that the IMF rates are inapplicable to long-term loans as defined by Commerce\u2019s <em>Proposed Regulations. </em>The inference derived from the comparison urged by plaintiffs, i.e. that the higher IMF rates are not long-term rates for businesses, is premised upon the definitions used by, and the accuracy of, the OECD. However, plaintiffs have not directed the court to any record evidence identifying the duration of the loans underlying the OECD rates. Nothing in the OECD tables defines the terms short-term, medium-term, and long-term. <em>See Pub. Doc. 55, Confid. Doc. 3, </em>Ex. 38. The meanings of these terms as employed by the OECD are thus unclear on the record. In addition, as suggested by Inland Steel, it would appear that \u201cthe [OECD] rates are merely reference rates from which lending institutions derive their final financing terms.\u201d <em>Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Response Brief at </em>29. During verification, French bank officials informed Commerce that banks will \u201cadd a few percentage points to the [OECD] rate to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the final lending rate.\u201d <em>Pub. Doc. 107, Confid. Doc. 19, </em>at 15-16. The accuracy of the OECD rates cited by plaintiffs, therefore, is also uncertain. As a result, although the comparison advanced by plaintiffs may indicate a disparity between the OECD and IMF rates, such a disparity does not establish that Commerce lacked substantial evidence on the record for concluding that the IMF rate was a long-term rate. For all of the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination to use the IMF\u2019s long-term rate as the benchmark interest and discount rate in the years in which Usinor Sacilor was uncreditworthy is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, the court sustains this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">\n<em>7.15-Year Amortization Period:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The next issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination to use a 15-year amortization period for allocating the countervail-able benefits resulting from the non-recurring grants and equity infusions that Usinor Sacilor received is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Commerce based this determination on its finding that the 15-year period reflects \u201cthe average useful life of assets in the steel industry.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6223-24 (citing <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,384 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(b)(3))). The proposed regulation cited by Commerce states that the agency will use \u201cthe average useful life of a firm\u2019s renewable physical assets (equipment), as set forth in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\u2019s 1977 Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System\u201d (\u201cIRS Tables\u201d) as one component in the calculation of the recipient firm\u2019s benefit stream. <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,384 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.49(b)(3)). The benefit stream, in turn, is one aspect that Commerce considers in allocating grants and equity infusions over time. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The ITA\u2019s arbitrary reliance upon the IRS Tables has previously been addressed and rejected by this Court. <em>See, e.g., British Steel, </em>Consol. Court No. 93-09-00550-CVD, Slip Op. 95-17 at 87-101 (CIT Feb. 9, 1995). The <em>British Steel </em>court observed that \u201c[t]he legislative history of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 clearly sets forth Congress\u2019 intent with respect to allocating benefits of subsidies over time.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Slip Op. 95-17 at 89. In particular, the legislative history emphasizes that \u201carea-sonable [allocation] period <em>based on the commercial and competitive benefit to the recipient </em>as a result of the subsidy must be used.\u201d S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 85-86 (1979), reprinted in 1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. 381,471-72 (emphasis added); <em>see also British Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 224, 236, 632 F.

It is axiomatic that \u201c[p]ost-hoc rationalizations of agency actions first advocated by counsel in court may not serve as the basis for sustaining the agency\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>U.H.F.C. Co. v. United States, </em>9 Fed. Cir. (T) 1, 13, 916 F.2d 689, 700 (1990) (citing <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). Nothing on the record in this case shows that Commerce considered the \u201ceconomic reality for Usinor Sacilor\u201d in arriving at its decision to use a 15-year amortization period.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">To the contrary, the record discloses that Commerce simply adhered to its past practice of using the IRS Tables to derive an amortization period. <em>See, e.g., Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6223-25 (summarily noting the ITA\u2019s reliance upon the average useful life of assets in the steel industry as set forth in the IRS Tables to determine the amortization period for Usinor\u2019s grants and equity infusions). Commerce\u2019s exclusive reliance on the IRS Tables also appears in its response to plaintiffs\u2019 and petitioners\u2019 comments on the amortization issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">While the Department has indicated its willingness to consider a ten-year allocation period generally * * * nothing that the parties have argued leads us to conclude that we should depart from the 15-year standard for this investigation. Therefore, we have continued to use the 15-year allocation period based on the 1977 IRS depreciation table, as amended in 1985, covering renewable assets for steel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\"><em>Id., </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6230. The <em>Final Determination </em>unequivocally demonstrates that Commerce invoked the amortization methodology set forth in the <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>which in turn is based upon the IRS Tables rather than on the actual economic experience of the recipient company. Although the record indicates that Usinor Sacilor furnished Commerce with information pertaining to the useful life of its assets, nothing on the record suggests that the ITA relied on this information in making its allocation determination. <em>See Pub. Doc. 108, Confid. Doc. 20, </em>at 25-26. Indeed, the record reflects that Commerce made no attempt to assess the extent to which the 15-year useful life period prescribed by the IRS Tables actually reflects the commercial and competitive benefits accruing to Usinor Sacilor as a result of the non-recurring grants and equity infusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Consequently, because Commerce failed to base its decision to employ a 15-year amortization period on the actual commercial and competitive benefits of the subsidies to Usinor Sacilor, the court cannot sustain Commerce\u2019s determination as to this issue; defendant\u2019s post-hoc ratio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>nalization that the useful life set forth in the IRS Tables coincides with the company\u2019s \u201ceconomic reality\u201d is simply unavailing. For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that the amortization methodology employed by Commerce in this case is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record and otherwise not in accordance with law. The court therefore remands this issue to Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Upon remand, Commerce is directed to identify what record evidence, if any, demonstrates that the amortization methodology employed in this case reasonably reflects the commercial and competitive benefits of the subsidies provided to Usinor Sacilor. Should Commerce determine that its amortization methodology does not reasonably reflect the commercial and competitive benefits of the subsidies provided to Usinor Sacilor, Commerce is directed to amend its determination accordingly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court emphasizes that, in remanding this issue, it does not seek to afford Commerce an opportunity to rearticulate non-record reasons for using the 15-year amortization period, or to supply the court with post-hoc rationalizations for why the IRS Tables reasonably reflect Usinor\u2019s economic experience. Rather, the court\u2019s sole purpose is to determine whether substantial record evidence exists to support Commerce\u2019s choice of a 15-year amortization period in this case, and, if not, to provide Commerce with an opportunity to employ an appropriate amortization methodology in its stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">8. <em>The Exclusion of Usinor Sacilor\u2019s Non-French Production from the Sales Denominator:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The next issue before the court is whether Commerce\u2019s determination to exclude sales of the company\u2019s non-French produced merchandise from the sales denominator used in computing Usinor Sacilor\u2019s net subsidy is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. In analyzing this issue, the court will first review Commerce\u2019s decision to employ a \u201ctied\u201d analysis. The court will then turn to an examination of whether Commerce\u2019s implementation of that methodology may be sustained in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The computation of a firm\u2019s net subsidy requires the ITA to divide: (1) the benefits attributable to subsidies received by the firm, less any offsets, by: (2) sales of the firm\u2019s products which benefit from such subsidies. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,383-84 (tobe codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47). The sales reflected in the denominator will vary depending upon whether Commerce determines the countervailable benefits at issue are \u201ctied\u201d to particular products marketed by the firm under investigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, if the ITA finds that a countervail-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>able benefit is tied to the production or sale of a particular product or products, it will allocate the benefit solely to that product or products. <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,383 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47(a)). In such circumstances, the sales denominator will contain the \u201cfirm\u2019s total sales of the product or products to which the benefit is tied.\u201d <em>Id., </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,384 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47(a)(1)). Where, however, Commerce determines that counter-vailable benefits are \u201cnot tied to the production or sale of a particular product or products, * * * the Secretary will allocate the benefit to all products produced by a firm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47(c)(1)). To effect the allocation for untied benefits, the sales denominator consists of the \u201cfirm\u2019s total sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47(c)(l)(i)).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In this case, Commerce was faced with a respondent whose total sales included sales of both domestically produced merchandise as well as merchandise produced in other countries. Commerce first determined that the subsidies were tied to domestic production because the GOF specifically bestowed the subsidies \u201cto benefit domestic production.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6230-31 (citation omitted). The ITA reached this determination \u201cafter reviewing the programs from which the subsidies at issue arose[;] * * * considering the GOF\u2019s contemporaneous controlling ownership position in Usinor Sacilor[;] [and concluding that] the GOF was seeking to promote domestic social policy and domestic economic activities and therefore to encourage domestic production.\u201d <em>Id., </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6231. Commerce therefore allocated Usinor\u2019s countervailable benefits \u201cfully to domestic production.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Plaintiffs challenge Commerce\u2019s determination to exclude Usinor Sacilor\u2019s non-French sales from the sales denominator on several grounds. First, plaintiffs argue that Commerce\u2019s methodology in this case represents an abrupt departure from its longstanding practice of treating equity infusions as untied benefits and allocating them over a firm\u2019s total sales, based upon the principle that money is fungible and that a subsidy, regardless of the underlying intent or its actual use, frees up money for other purposes and thus provides a general benefit to the firm. Commerce responds by arguing that this investigation presented an issue that previously had not been directly addressed, i.e. determining the appropriate sales denominator to be used in subsidy calculations when a respondent\u2019s total sales include not only sales of domestically produced merchandise, but also sales of merchandise produced in one or more foreign countries. Commerce argues that the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>do not squarely address this issue, <em>see Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6230, and that its rejection of the fungibility approach is reasonable based upon the record in this case. Usinor replies that the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>do not include an exception for firms with multinational production, but rather provide generally that equity infusions are to be treated as untied benefits which are to be allocated to all products pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>duced by a firm. <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,375, 23,383-84 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47(c)(1), (c)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The court begins by noting that ordinarily an agency may revise its interpretation of the statutory requirements it enforces and enjoy deference from the courts. <em>Rust v. Sullivan, </em>500 U.S. 173, 186 (1991). Such deference, however, is predicated on a finding that the agency revised its interpretation with a \u201creasoned analysis.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 187 (citing <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 42-43 (1983)). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim, that the ITA had a longstanding practice of treating equity infusions as untied benefits and allocating them over a firm\u2019s total sales, is undermined by the fact that in at least one prior investigation Commerce did in fact exclude a firm\u2019s sales of non-domestically produced merchandise from the sales denominator.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In any event, the court finds that Commerce has articulated a reasoned basis for analyzing this issue via a \u201ctying\u201d inquiry. Commerce is presumably in the best position to determine whether an issue has been addressed by <em>Proposed Regulations </em>which the agency itself promulgated. Although the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>provide that Commerce will treat equity infusions as untied benefits, the language employed clearly permits the conclusion that the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>do not speak directly to the issue of allocating the benefits of countervailable equity infusions across sales for a respondent with multinational production. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,383-84 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47). Commerce\u2019s reading of proposed 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.47(c) thus appears reasonable. Furthermore, to the extent that Commerce\u2019s methodology does represent a departure from past practice, the court finds that Commerce\u2019s decision to engage in a \u201ctying\u201d inquiry was based upon reasoned analysis. <em>See Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6230 (rejecting either of the extremes posited by petitioners and respondents). This aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is therefore sustained.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The court now turns to consider whether Commerce properly implemented its tied analysis in this case. Commerce indicates that it first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>undertook a factual inquiry to determine whether the subsidies at issue were tied to domestic production. After concluding that they were, Commerce then allocated the benefits of these tied subsidies to sales of the tied merchandise, i.e. domestic production. Commerce determined that the subsidies at issue were tied to Usinor\u2019s French production based upon: (1) protocols between the GOF, the French steel companies and their creditors, which were designed to make the French steel industry internationally competitive and to get it back into shape so that it could then develop normally using normal resources;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (2) press statements made by French President Mitterand in 1984 addressing, among other issues, the problems created by the steel industry crisis to the \u201cworkers who live it, to the regions where they live, and to the entire country\u201d and identifying specific regions in France particularly affected by the crisis;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (3) cabinet meeting minutes from 1984 which reflect discussion of the government\u2019s restructuring plans for the steel industry and which reference the modernization, construction, consolidation, and reindus-trialization efforts undertaken in specific towns and regions in France;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (4) the McKinsey study discussing the planned restructuring of the French steel industry and, with respect to Unim\u00e9tal, generally calling for various plant closings, plant modernization or expansion, and labor reductions;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (5) the GOF\u2019s contemporaneous controlling ownership position in Usinor Sacilor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Defendant\u2019s Brief at </em>29-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The foregoing items unquestionably provide a reasonable basis upon which to conclude that the GOF intended to aid the French steel industry. The court notes, however, that \u201cthe countervailing duty law concerns itself not with the government\u2019s purpose or intent in a particular program, but whether the government\u2019s funds give the country\u2019s exports an unfair competitive advantage. \u201d <em>British Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>9 CIT 85, 95, 605 F. Supp. 286, 294 (citing <em>G.S. Nicholas &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 34 (1919); <em>Downs v. United States, </em>187 U.S. 496 (1903)). This principle flows from the premise that \u201cit is the economic result of the foreign government\u2019s action which controls.\u201d <em>United States v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>64 CCPA 130, 138-39, 562 F.2d 1209, 1216 (1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>437 U.S. 443 (1978). In addition, the legislative history to the Tariff Act of 1979 reflects Congress\u2019 intent that Commerce ascertain which products are likely to have benefited from countervailable subsidies in determining how it will allocate the value of such subsidies. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 249 at 85, <em>reprinted in </em>1979 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 471 (\u201cReasonable methods of allocating the value of * * * subsidies over the production or exportation of the products benefitting from the subsidy must be used.\u201d); H.R. Rep. No. 317, 96th Cong. 1st Sess. 75 (1979) (\u201c[I]n calculating the <em>ad valorem </em>effect of non-recurring subsidy grants or loans, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>reasonable methods of allocating the value of such subsidies over the production or exportation of products benefitting from them will be used.\u201d). Thus, Commerce\u2019s traditional \u201ctied\u201d analysis entailed an assessment of the <em>likely </em>effect of a countervailable subsidy; this analysis did not, however, require Commerce to determine the <em>actual </em>effect of a subsidy, either during the period of investigation or at any time after the subsidy\u2019s bestowal. <em>See Industrial Nitrocellulose from France, </em>52 Fed. Reg. 833, 834-35 (Jan. 9, 1987) (final results of admin, review).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Plaintiffs stress that the critical issue in determining whether a subsidy is tied or untied is not the breadth of the recipient\u2019s operations, but whether the subsidy\u2019s nature and effects were to benefit a specific part of those operations. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019Brief </em>at 32. Commerce maintains that it retained its traditional approach in the tied analysis it employed in the instant case, i.e. allocating the benefits inuring to Usinor based upon its determination of the likely effect of the subsidies bestowed. Plaintiffs, however, challenge Commerce\u2019s consideration of the GOF\u2019s intent in bestowing the subsidies at issue. Commerce responds by arguing that the GOF\u2019s intent is simply one of several relevant criteria to be considered in making this determination. <em>Defendant\u2019s Brief </em>at 85-86. Although the court agrees that clear evidence of an intent on the part of the subsidizing government to benefit only domestic industry, coupled with evidence of that government\u2019s controlling ownership interest in the subsidized firm, may, <em>inter alia, </em>provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the subsidy at issue is likely to be tied to the firm\u2019s domestic production because the subsidizing government is in a position to effectuate its intent, the court finds that in this case Commerce reached its conclusion based upon a record rendered incomplete due to procedural unfairness on the part of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Plaintiffs submit that Commerce failed to conduct a proper investigation into whether the subsidies at issue were tied to domestic production. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief </em>at 44-45. Specifically, plaintiffs claim that Commerce did not request any information relating to the likely effect of the subsidies at issue and that the failure to request such information demonstrates the ITA conducted an inadequate investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 45. Commerce disputes plaintiffs\u2019 claim that it never sought information on the \u201ctied\u201d issue. According to defendant, Commerce asked Usinor Saci-lor numerous questions pertaining to the subsidy programs which \u201csought broad and detailed information.\u201d <em>Defendant\u2019s Brief </em>at 88. Although Commerce never employed the term \u201ctied\u201d in any of its questions, defendant argues that the broad scope of the questions contemplated any matters that might have some bearing on the \u201ctied\u201d issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Upon review, the court finds that Commerce failed to notify plaintiffs that it lacked the information necessary to assess the likely effects of the GOF\u2019s subsidies. Significantly, in its <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>Commerce allocated the subsidies at issue over Usinor\u2019s worldwide sales; furthermore, the record is devoid of subsequent information requests on the part of Commerce pertaining to the likely effects of the GOF sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>sidies, either at the hearing or at verification. On the facts of this case, Commerce\u2019s failure to provide plaintiffs with notice pertaining to the absence of information that would have allowed the ITA to ascertain the likely effects of the GOF\u2019s subsidy programs deprived plaintiffs of their right to participate in the investigation below, and renders Commerce\u2019s determination unsupported by substantial evidence and otherwise contrary to law. <em>See Creswell Trading Co., </em>13 Fed. Cir. (T) at _, 15 F.3d at 1062 (\u201cCommerce is presumably in the best position to know what it means by its own requirements and what evidence will satisfy these requirements. \u201d). The fact that Commerce might have sought broad and detailed information pertaining to the subsidy programs, as defendant claims, does not discharge the ITA from its obligation to put parties on notice as to the deficiencies in their responses. Commerce\u2019s failure either to advise the parties of the deficiencies in their submissions or to indicate its inability to ascertain the likely effects of the GOF\u2019s subsidy programs in the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>or elsewhere compels the conclusion that the ITA\u2019s \u201ctied\u201d determination was procedurally unfair. <em>See Creswell Trading Co., </em>13 Fed. Cir. (T) at _, 15 F.3d at 1062. As a result, the court finds that remand is warranted in order to afford Commerce the opportunity to reopen the record to redress this deficiency in its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In sum, the court has reviewed the various arguments raised by the parties pertaining to Commerce\u2019s exclusion of non-French sales from the sales denominator, and finds that Commerce\u2019s decision to employ a \u201ctied\u201d analysis is supported by substantial evidence on the record and in accordance with law. The court also finds, however, that Commerce failed to apprise respondents of this issue, and failed to afford respondents an opportunity to present evidence tending to show that the likely benefits of the subsidies were not tied to domestic production. For the foregoing reasons, the court remands this issue to Commerce with instructions that it reopen the record in this case to afford plaintiffs an opportunity to present evidence, if any, tending to show that the subsidies at issue were not tied to domestic production. Commerce shall then review the entirety of the record, as amended, and render its determination accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">B. <em>Inland Steel v. United States:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">1. <em>Usinor Sacilor\u2019s Equityworthiness in 1991:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The first issue presented in <em>Inland Steel v. United States </em>is whether Commerce\u2019s determination that Usinor Sacilor was equityworthy in 1991 is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Although Commerce preliminarily determined that Usi-nor Sacilor was unequityworthy in 1991, the ITA revised its position in the <em>Final Determination </em>after concluding that the firm \u201cwas capable of generating a reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6232. Commerce based its determination on two separate items: a comprehensive evaluation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>company performed by Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, and a report prepared by an independent Swiss consulting firm on behalf of the EC (\u201cSFS Report\u201d). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Inland Steel challenges this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>on various grounds. First, Inland Steel argues that Commerce improperly based \u201cits decision entirely on a single unsubstantiated report performed by a consulting firm on behalf of the EC,\u201d and that by relying on the SFS Report, Commerce abandoned its normal practice of \u201cmak[ing] findings on the basis of feasibility studies only when the enterprise being investigated had no operational history to examine.\u201d <em>Inland Steel\u2019s R.56.2 Brief at </em>13-14 (footnote and emphasis omitted). The court disagrees. As noted, the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>set forth Commerce\u2019s existing practice as of the time the agency published notice of the regulations. <em>See Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,366 (\u201cThese regulations codify much of the Department\u2019s existing practice with respect to the identification and measurement of subsidies under the [countervailing duty] law.\u201d). The practice described in the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>for examining a firm\u2019s equityworthiness indicates that the ITA will determine whether,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">from the perspective of a reasonable private investor examining the firm at the time the government equity infusion was made, the firm showed an ability to generate a reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time. In making this determination, the Secretary <em>may </em>examine the following factors, <em>among others:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">(i) Current and past indicators of a firm\u2019s financial health calculated from that firm\u2019s statements and accounts,. adjusted, if appropriate, to conform to generally accepted accounting principles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">(ii) Future financial prospects of the firm, including market studies, economic forecasts, and project or loan appraisals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">(iii) Rates of return on equity in the three years prior to the government equity infusion; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">(iv) Equity investment in the firm by private investors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-10\"><em>Proposed Regulations, </em>54 Fed. Reg. at 23,381 (to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e)(2)(i)-(iv)) (emphasis added). The plain language of the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>unequivocally demonstrates that the factors enumerated are non-exclusive. It is thus clear that Commerce\u2019s practice, as reflected in the foregoing guidelines, does not preclude consideration of a report such as the one prepared by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fiduciaire Suisse. Furthermore, the SFS Report is clearly probative of the \u201c[f]uture financial prospects of the firm\u201d and, as such, is reasonably within the guidelines\u2019 express provisions. <em>Id. </em>(to be codified at 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 355.44(e) (2)(ii)). Finally, to the extent Inland Steel relies on investigations that Commerce undertook approximately four and five years before publishing notice of the <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>the court does not find these investigations probative of the ITA\u2019s \u201cnormal practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Second, Inland Steel argues that the ITA failed to explain adequately its reasons for reversing its preliminary determination that Usinor Sacilor was not equityworthy in 1991. <em>Inland Steel\u2019s R.56.2 Brief </em>at 20-21 (citations omitted). The court finds this argument without merit. In contrast to the reversal addressed in <em>Ad Hoc Comm. of AZ-NM-TX-FL v. United </em>States, 16 CIT 115, 117-18, 787 F.Supp. 208, 211 (1992) <em>(\u201cAd Hoc\u201d), </em>the ITA supplied a reasoned basis for changing its preliminary determination in the instant case. <em>Cf. Ad Hoc, </em>16 CIT at 117, 787 F. Supp. at 211 (ordering a remand because the ITA supplied <em>no explanation </em>as to why it reversed its preliminary determination on a level of trade issue). It is readily apparent from the <em>Final Determination </em>that Commerce\u2019s reversal stemmed from the fact that the ITA obtained a complete copy of the SFS Report only after it had published notice of the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>and, based on its review of the complete report, determined that Usinor Sacilor \u201cwas capable of generating a reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6223,6232. The ITA thus set forth the basis for its departure from its preliminary determination. Accordingly, the court rejects Inland Steel\u2019s assertion that Commerce failed to explain adequately why it reversed its preliminary determination as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Third, Inland Steel contends that Commerce abandoned its traditional standard for measuring equityworthiness. <em>Inland Steel\u2019s R.56.2 Brief </em>at 14-17. Specifically, Inland Steel maintains that under its usual standard, Commerce should have concluded that Usinor Sacilor was not equityworthy because the firm\u2019s 1991 operating profit was nearly a third of its profit two years earlier, and resulted in \u201c an overall net loss for the year of FF 3.1 billion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15 (citing <em>Pub. Doc. 117, Confid. Doc. 23, </em>at Ex. 2). Inland Steel notes that certain financial data for Usinor Sacilor were worse in 1991 than in 1988 and 1989, years in which the ITA deemed the company uncreditworthy and unequityworthy, respectively. <em>Id. </em>at 17. In addition, Inland Steel argues that the measures that Commerce ordinarily applies to assess a company\u2019s economic health, such as rate of return on assets and equity, quick ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio, all indicate that Usinor Sacilor was in poor financial condition. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16 <em>(citingPub. Doc. 117, Confid. Doc. 23, </em>at Ex. 2). Inland Steel also asserts that the record is replete with evidence demonstrating that the economic forecast for the French steel industry as a whole in 1991 was extremely pessimistic, as was that for Usinor Sacilor individually. <em>Id. </em>at 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The court finds Inland Steel\u2019s position untenable. The crux of Inland Steel\u2019s argument is that Commerce misinterpreted the evidence before it. As noted, however, this court will not reweigh record evidence or second guess the conclusions reached by Commerce so long as substantial evidence on the record supports the ITA\u2019s conclusions. The following record evidence convinces the court that the ITA based its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>determination on substantial evidence: (1) [ ];<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (2) [ ];<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (3) [ ];<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (4) [ ];<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (5) [ ];<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and (6) Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, which purchased a 20 percent interest in the company in 1991, concluded that its investment would produce a reasonable return.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The foregoing evidence, which appears both in the SFS Report and elsewhere on the record, clearly provides a reasonable basis upon which to conclude that Usinor Sacilor was equityworthy in 1991. The mere fact that Inland Steel can point to conflicting record evidence does not so detract from the evidence relied upon by Commerce that the agency\u2019s determination is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record. <em>See Consolo, </em>383 U.S. at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Finally, Inland Steel contends that the SFS Report upon which Commerce relied in making it equityworthiness determination is defective. <em>Id. </em>at 17-20. First, Inland Steel maintains the SFS Report is biased in favor of Usinor Sacilor. <em>Id. </em>at 17-18. Second, Inland Steel asserts that the consulting firm did not prepare the report from the perspective of a reasonable private investor and, therefore, did not meet the standard that Commerce ordinarily applies. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. Third, Inland Steel argues that the financial data included in the report simply do not support Commerce\u2019s conclusion that Usinor Sacilor would have attracted investment from a reasonable private investor in 1991. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The court finds that Inland Steel has failed to establish that the SFS Report is defective. With regard to Inland Steel\u2019s claim that the SFS Report is biased in favor of Usinor Sacilor, Inland Steel has pointed to nothing on the record that substantiates such a claim. Instead, Inland Steel relies on [ ]. <em>Inland Steel\u2019s R.56.2 Brief </em>at 18 n.42. With regard to Inland Steel\u2019s assertion that the SFS Report is inadequate because it does not apply the reasonable private investor standard, the court finds that the record is replete with evidence that demonstrates the report did in fact employ such a standard. <em>See Confid. Doc. 21 </em>at 1-2; <em>id. </em>at 9 ([ ]). Finally, the court finds that Inland Steel\u2019s contention, that the financial data contained in the SFS Report do not support Commerce\u2019s determination, must also fail, as it would require this court to reweigh the evidence presented to Commerce \u2014 a task that this court will not undertake because, as noted, the record in this case provides substantial evidence for Commerce\u2019s conclusion. For all of the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination that Usinor Sacilor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>was equityworthy in 1991 is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">2. <em>Characterization of Shareholder Advances as Grants:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The next issue raised by Inland Steel is whether Commerce\u2019s determination that the shareholder advances received by Usinor Sacilor were grants is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. The court has already discussed this issue in part II.A.4 of this opinion. For all of the reasons previously noted, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination that the shareholder advances were grants is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">3. <em>Cr\u00e9dit National Loan Consolidation:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The final issue raised by Inland Steel is whether Commerce\u2019s determination that Cr\u00e9dit National loans were not specific to the steel industry is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. As noted, Commerce treated the 1991 Cr\u00e9dit National loan consolidations as new loans \u201cbecause they carried new terms and conditions.\u201d <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6226. In its <em>Preliminary Determination, </em>Commerce found that although the consolidated Cr\u00e9dit National loans could not have conferred subsidies during the POI because they had no cash flow effect during that time, the old loans which were outstanding during the POI could have conferred a counter-vailable benefit. <em>See Preliminary Determination, </em>57 Fed. Reg. at 42,979. Commerce further stated that because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">[n]o information was submitted on the terms of these \u201cold loans\u201d or whether these loans were limited to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries!,] * * * we are applying [BIA].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">To calculate the benefit arising from these loans during the POI, we have assumed that no interest was paid and have compared this to the rate from the OECD Financial Statistics publication \u201cTypical Short-term Interest Rates\u201d as our benchmark rate. On this basis, we calculated an estimated net subsidy rate of 0.67 percent <em>ad valo-rem </em>for \u201cold\u201d Cr\u00e9dit National * * * loans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\"><em>Id. </em>In its <em>Final Determination, </em>however, Commerce made no mention of the specificity of the old Cr\u00e9dit National loans; instead, Commerce examined only the distribution of Cr\u00e9dit National loans issued in 1991, in order to determine whether Usinor\u2019s consolidated Cr\u00e9dit National loans were specific. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 6226-27; <em>Defendant\u2019s Brief </em>at 60. After examining Cr\u00e9dit National\u2019s <em>Annual Report </em>for 1991, Commerce found that the institution provided loans to numerous sectors of the French economy and did not make a disproportionate amount of loans to the steel industry. <em>Final Determination, </em>58 Fed. Reg. at 6227. Commerce also verified that an independent committee composed of experts from various industries evaluates loan applications and, using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>neutral criteria, makes recommendations to Cr\u00e9dit National with respect to their viability. <em>Id. </em>Based upon this process of independent evaluation and the information provided in Cr\u00e9dit National\u2019s <em>Annual Report </em>for 1991, Commerce determined that \u201cthe consolidated 1991 loans from Cr\u00e9dit National were not provided to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries, and, therefore, are not countervailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Significantly, it appears that Commerce applied the results of this specificity inquiry to the old Cr\u00e9dit National loans and the consolidated Cr\u00e9dit National loans alike. <em>See Defendant\u2019s Brief </em>at 62 n.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Inland Steel opposes Commerce\u2019s determination on two separate grounds. First, Inland Steel argues that Commerce erred by \u201cbasing its <em>de facto </em>specificity determination on an unsubstantiated lending breakdown found in Cr\u00e9dit National\u2019s 1991 <em>Annual Report.\u201d Inland Steel\u2019s R.56.2 Brief at </em>30 (citation omitted). Inland Steel maintains that this lending breakdown cannot alone support Commerce\u2019s specificity determination because Cr\u00e9dit National administers loans for numerous governmental and parastatal organizations and, as a result, the loan table may be overly broad and reflect lending pursuant to other government programs, apart from steel programs. <em>Id. </em>at 31. Inland Steel charges that Commerce never confirmed whether the consolidated loans to Usi-nor Sacilor were included in lending figures for the chemicals, energy and metals sector; Inland Steel therefore considers Commerce\u2019s reliance upon this data to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. Finally, Inland Steel asserts that Commerce erred by failing to compare the terms of Usinor Sacilor\u2019s consolidated loans with those provided to other Cr\u00e9dit National borrowers. <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The court finds Inland Steel\u2019s various arguments unavailing. In short, nothing on the record in this case suggests that the data contained in the 1991 <em>Annual Report </em>are inaccurate or otherwise unreliable. Instead of directing the court to record evidence that demonstrates deficiencies in <em>the Annual Report\u2019s </em>figures, Inland Steel merely characterizes the information as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and potentially \u201coverly broad.\u201d Because Inland Steel has failed to substantiate its contentions with record evidence which detracts substantially from the credibility of the information underlying Commerce\u2019s determination, this court will not second-guess Commerce\u2019s investigation and assessment of the evidence presented on the record. <em>See Timken Co., </em>12 CIT at 962, 699 F. Supp. at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The court also rejects Inland Steel\u2019s contention that Commerce erred by not comparing the terms of Usinor Sacilor\u2019s consolidated loans with loans provided by Cr\u00e9dit National to other borrowers. The absence of a comparison between the terms of Usinor Sacilor\u2019s consolidated loans and loans made to other of Cr\u00e9dit National\u2019s borrowers does not establish that Commerce\u2019s determination was unsupported. The material contained in the Cr\u00e9dit National <em>Annual Report </em>and other information submitted by plaintiffs provided Commerce with a reasonable basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>upon which to determine that the 1991 consolidated loans were not <em>de facto </em>specific and, therefore, not countervailable. <em>See Pub. Doc. 107, Confid. Doc. 19, </em>at 11-13 (indicating Credit National officials provided Commerce\u2019s verifiers with information concerning the provision of loans to industry and interest rate calculations). In sum, the court concludes that Commerce\u2019s determination that the consolidated Credit National loans were not specific to the steel industry is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with law. Consequently, the court sustains this aspect of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Second, Inland Steel argues that Commerce focused upon the wrong program by examining the specificity of Credit National loans in 1991, the year of consolidation, rather than the years in which the original loans were issued. Inland Steel maintains that because Commerce preliminarily found that the outstanding loans could have conferred a countervailable benefit, Commerce should have examined the pattern of lending by Credit National at the time that these original loans were issued. <em>Inland Steel\u2019s R.56.2 Brief </em>at 29. In response, the defendant merely states that \u201cCommerce\u2019s specificity discussion reflects an assumption that * * * it was proper to analyze loan distribution at the time of the consolidation, 1991.\u201d <em>Defendant\u2019s Brief at </em>62 n.95.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The court finds that Commerce has failed to articulate a reasonable explanation for why it assessed the specificity of the government loans in question, i.e. those Credit National loans that were outstanding in 1991 (prior to their consolidation), by analyzing loan distribution in 1991, the year of consolidation, rather than the years in which the original loans were issued. <em>See Defendant\u2019s Brief at </em>60-62. Commerce has also failed to articulate the reasons for its departure from the specificity determination rendered in its <em>Preliminary Determination. </em>Upon review, the propriety of Commerce\u2019s underlying assumption is not readily apparent to the court. For the foregoing reasons, the court finds that Commerce\u2019s determination that the old Credit National loans were not specific to the steel industry is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record. The court therefore remands this issue in order to afford Commerce an opportunity to reexamine its methodology. Should Commerce decide that, with regard to the specificity of the old Credit National loans, it is proper to analyze loan distribution at the time of the consolidation, Commerce must clearly articulate the reasoning which supports such a methodology. If, however, it should find fault with this methodology, Commerce shall amend its determination accordingly, reopening the record if necessary in order to render a decision supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Upon consideration of all of the parties\u2019 arguments and submissions, the court holds that the following aspects of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>are supported by substantial evidence on the record and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>otherwise in accordance with law: (1) the PACS and FIS instruments received by Usinor and Sacilor were debt upon issuance; (2) Usinor Saci-lor and its predecessors were not equityworthy in 1986 and 1988; (3) the countervailable benefits inuring to Usinor Sacilor and its predecessors as a result of the conversion of the PACS and FIS instruments to common stock equalled the face value of the remaining principal on the instruments; (4) shareholder advances made by the GOF to Usinor and Sacilor were non-recurring grants; (5) Usinor Sacilor\u2019s consolidated FDES loans, as well as its old CFDI loans (prior to consolidation), conferred countervailable benefits upon the company; (6) the benchmark discount and interest rate in the years in which Usinor Sacilor was uncreditworthy is the IMF\u2019s long-term rate for France; (7) identification of the sales benefitting from the subsidies at issue warranted a \u201ctied\u201d analysis; (8) Usinor Sacilor was equityworthy in 1991; and (9) the consolidated Cr\u00e9dit National loans were not specific to the steel industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The court further holds that the following aspects of Commerce\u2019s <em>Final Determination </em>are not supported by substantial evidence on the record and are not otherwise in accordance with law: (1) the amortization period for the non-recurring grants and equity infusions that Usi-nor Sacilor received is 15 years; (2) the sales denominator used in computing Usinor Sacilor\u2019s net subsidy must exclude sales of the company\u2019s non-French produced merchandise; and (3) the old Cr\u00e9dit National loans were not specific to the steel industry. The court remands this action to Commerce with instructions that Commerce address the deficiencies identified herein. The court\u2019s order shall enter accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Schedule of Consolidated Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">1. <em>Inland Steel Bar Company v.

Instead, the court regards the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>\u201cas merely published notice of [Commerce\u2019s] intent to codify those provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the court will assess whether the ITA has properly based its decision on the facts presented by this particular case. <em>See Ipsco, Inc. v.

Supp. 614, 626 (1988) <em>(\"Ipsco I\u201d) </em>(In the absence of a final regulation that it has promulgated, the \u201cITA must explain the basis for its decision based on the facts of [the] case.\u201d). Apart from those instances in which plaintiffs challenge a particular methodology embodied in the <em>Proposed Regulations, </em>the court will not scrutinize the validity of the methodologies. Instead, the court will ascertain whether Commerce properly applied the <em>Proposed Regulations </em>based on the record evidence in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\"> 54 Fed.

Because the evidence relates entirely to the manner in which the companies <em>characterized </em>the advances, such evidence neither establishes that the companies and the GOF agreed these advances would carry repayment obligations, nor does it preclude the conclusion that they did not agree such obligations .would attach to the advances. In short, the items are merely probative of how the companies characterized the advances for financial accounting purposes and for this investigation. The evidence pertaining to the 1986 conversion is similarly unpersuasive because its probative value also depends upon the characterization of the advances rather than on an express agreement between the GOF and the companies. Consequently, even though the record items citedby Inland Steel may provide apparent support for finding there was a repayment obligation, the court concludes that such evidence does not so detract from the evidence relied upon by Commerce (in reaching the conclusion'that the advances were grants upon issuance) that its determination is rendered unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\"> <em>Compare </em>Verification Report for Usinor Sacilor, <em>Pub.

In the present case, the ITA treated the equity and other capital infusions paid to Usinor Sacilor as being \u201ctied\u201d to Usinor\u2019s French production only, and therefore allocated the benefits over Usinor\u2019s French sales rather than over its consolidated worldwide sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\"><em> Final Determination, </em>58 Fed.

Specifically, in the <em>General Issues Appendix </em>appended to <em>Certain Steel Products fromAustria, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 37,217, 37,225 (July 9,1993) (final determination), Commerce stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">TUlnder [Commerce\u2019s] refined \u201ctied\u201d analysis, [Commerce] will begin by presuming that a subsidy provided by the government of the country under investigation is tied to domestic production. However, this presumption is not irrebuttable. A party may rebut this presumption by presenting evidence tending to show that the subsidy was not tied to domestic production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 37,231. Commerce\u2019s refined \u201ctied\u201d analysis was challenged in <em>British Steel PLC v. United States, </em>Consol. Court No. 93-09-00550-CVD, Slip Op. 95-17 at 126-51 (CIT Feb, 9,1995). In remanding the matter, the <em>British Steel </em>court held that Commerce failed to afford respondents in that consolidated action an opportunity to comment upon Commerce\u2019s adoption of a rebuttable presumption that subsidies are tied to domestic production, and that Commerce failed to afford respondents an opportunity to submit evidence to rebut the presumption erected by the agency. <em>British Steel, </em>Slip Op. 95-17 at 145. In contrast to the presumption employed in <em>British Steel, </em>Commerce\u2019s instant determination (i.e. that the equity infusions Usinor received were tied to French production), was based solely upon the record compiled as a result of its investigation in this particular case. Having sustained Commerce\u2019s decision to employ its \u201cunrefined\u201d tied analysis in this case, the court need address only whether Commerce\u2019s implementation of that analysis is supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law.
