United States, </em>17 CIT 1425 (1993) <em>(Duty Free I). </em>Duty Free International, Inc. (Duty Free), operators of a duty-free store near the Canadian border in New York State, seek revocation of Customs\u2019 approval of Git-N-Go\u2019s (GNG) application to establish a duty-free store in the same vicinity. Duty Free alleges that GNG\u2019s approved delivery procedures do not comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements for a bonded warehouse, and renews its motion pursuant to USCIT R. 56.1 for judgment upon an agency record. The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Duty Free operates a duty-free store on the East Service Road of Interstate Route 87 (1-87) in Champlain, New York. The store is immediately opposite Exit 43, the last exit and on-ramp off 1-87 south of the Canadian border. A vehicle has no legal alternative but to proceed into Canada once it has entered the northbound on-ramp of 1-87 from the East Service Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">GNG\u2019s duty-free operation is an unspecified distance south of Duty Free\u2019s store on the East Service Road. Under GNG\u2019s approved delivery procedures, a bonded cartman, an employee of GNG, transports the purchased merchandise from the store to the purchaser. Delivery is then made at a point between Duty Free and GNG\u2019s stores, approximately 2/10 of a mile south of the entrance to 1-87, and approximately 9/10 of a mile south of the Customs inspection building at the Port of Champlain. The cartman advises the purchaser that the merchandise is only for export into Canada, and then watches the purchaser\u2019s vehicle until it enters the northbound ramp of 1-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Duty Free filed this action seeking to set aside Customs\u2019 approval of GNG\u2019s application to establish a duty-free bonded warehouse. Duty Free and the United States cross-moved for summary judgment. The court denied the parties\u2019 cross motions, and remanded the action to the Customs District Director to submit a more complete agency record and provide an explanation for the approval of GNG\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">In particular, the court directed the District Director to seek internal advice from Customs Headquarters regarding: (1) whether a \u201cpractical alternative\u201d to exiting the United States exists for a purchaser of duty-free merchandise at GNG\u2019s delivery location, where the purchaser has the ability not to depart the United States; and (2) whether a cartman\u2019s vehicle falls within the meaning of a \u201cmerchandise storage location,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(3)(F)(ii)(I) (1988). <em>Duty Free I, </em>17 CIT at 1432-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Duty Free contends that GNG\u2019s delivery procedures fail to meet the statutory standard governing delivery of duty-free merchandise, as delivery does not take place \u201cat or beyond the exit point.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(3)(F) (ii)(I). Further, Duty Free contests Customs\u2019 finding that GNG delivers merchandise to its customers at a \u201cmerchandise storage location,\u201d <em>id., </em>and provides \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of exportation, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(3)(A). According to Duty Free, Customs\u2019 actions therefore must be set aside as \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The court reviews an action under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i) as provided in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. Pursuant to section 706, the court shall hold unlawful and set aside Customs\u2019 decision if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>see Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971) (holding court must examine whether there was clear error of judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Further, review of an agency decision on a motion for judgment upon an agency record mandates a careful inquiry into the facts of a case, but the search must be narrow and \u201cplainly deferential to the determinations, findings and conclusions of the agency * * *. [T]his court is not permitted to itself weigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the agency * * * .\u201d <em>Jeannette Sheet Glass Corp. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 10, 14, 654 F. Supp. 179, 182-83 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\n<em>1. Applicable Statute and Regulation:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The statutory provision governing the establishment of duty-free stores, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b), provides that duty-free merchandise shall be delivered \u201cat or beyond the exit point,\u201d unless Customs approved the location before enactment of the Omnibus Trade Act of 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b) (3) (F) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The statute defines \u201cexit point\u201d as \u201cthe area in close proximity to an actual exit for departing from the customs territory.\u201d. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(8)(F). Customs implementing regulation further defines \u201cexit point\u201d as \u201cthe point at which a departing individual h\u00e1s <em>no practical alternative </em>to continuing on to a foreign country or to returning to Customs territory by passing through a U.S. Customs inspection facility.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.35(d) (1994) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">A. <em>\u201cAt or Beyond the Exit Point\u201d:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Duty Free contests Customs\u2019 finding that the location of GNG\u2019s. store is \u201cat or beyond the exit point.\u201d Duty Free, while conceding that \u201cexit point\u201d is imprecisely defined in the statute, asserts the statutory design and the common meaning of the term indicates an area \u201cimmediately near\u201d an <em>actual exit </em>is required. (Pl.\u2019s Br. for J. upon Agency R. at 2l.) Duty Free contends a site nearly one mile from the actual border, and nearly a quarter mile from the interstate highway entrance, which permits opportunities to return to the United States, is not \u201cimmediately near.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Duty Free further argues that this court\u2019s prior opinion, <em>Duty Free I, </em>17 CIT 1425, and Customs\u2019 own implementing regulation, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.35(d), mandate a stricter standard for exit point. These provide that an exit point must be a location at which there is \u201cno practical alternative\u201d but to continue to a foreign country. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.35(d); <em>see also Duty Free I, </em>17 CIT at 1429 (requiring \u201cfeasible way to assure that the goods are exported.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Duty Free points to methods by which GNG patrons may avoid exporting their purchases. A GNG customer may turn around on the service road instead of entering the highway; alternatively, GNG\u2019s customers can drive into the parking lot of Duty Free\u2019s store \u2014 located farther down the road \u2014 turn around and exit proceeding south, without departing the United States. Nothing prevents a GNG store patron from taking such action; GNG possesses no police power to mandate exportation. Finally, Duty Free contends that GNG has not implemented procedures providing \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of exportation of duty-free merchandise from the Customs territory. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Customs recognizes the existence of these alternatives to exportation. Customs contends \u201c[e]ven though there are possible alternatives to vehicles proceeding to Canada * * * we are of the opinion that there is a <em>low probability </em>that the duty free merchandise sold by GNG would not be exported.\u201d HQ Reply to Internal Advice Req., HQ 225176, at 4 (Feb. 23, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Accordingly, the issue before the court is whether Customs\u2019 finding of a \u201clow probability\u201d that duty-free merchandise would not be exported from the Customs territory conforms with regulatory and statutory mandates. These provisions require that there be \u201cno practical alternative\u201d to exportation of such merchandise, 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.35(d), that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>GNG\u2019s delivery location be at or beyond \u201cthe area in close proximity to an actual exit for departing from the Customs territory,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(8)(F), and that the duty-free store implement procedures providing \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of exportation. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Customs\u2019 interpretation of its regulation is permissible. Whether an alternative is \u201cpractical\u201d depends upon how the term is defined. A \u201cpractical alternative\u201d may be one that is available, as plaintiff contends, or one that is in practice or probable, as Customs suggests. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1780 (unabr. 1981 ed.) (defining \u201cpractical\u201d as \u201c[2]b: being such in practice, conduct, effect, or essential character: VIRTUAL\u2019 and alternatively as \u201c3: available, usable or valuable in practice or action: capable of being turned to use or account: USEFUL\u201d). Under the definition employed by Customs, the low probability of an alternative\u2019s occurrence would preclude the alternative from being labeled practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">While Customs\u2019 definition of \u201cpractical\u201d is not one the court would adopt in the first instance, the mandates of judicial deference to an agency\u2019s construction of a regulation bind the court. <em>See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) (noting agency\u2019s construction of statute need only be permissible). As the Federal Circuit has noted, \u201c[t]o survive judicial scrutiny, an agency\u2019s construction need not be the <em>only </em>reasonable interpretation or even the <em>most </em>reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>12 Fed. Cir. (T) _, _, 36 F.3d 1565, 1570 (1994) (citation omitted). The court\u2019s deference to the agency reaches its highest point where, as here, the court reviews an agency\u2019s construction of its own administrative regulation. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1964). The administrative interpretation is controlling \u201cunless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 413-14 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Customs\u2019 interpretation of its regulation is also consistent with the dictates of the statute. The broad language of section 1555(b) merely requires that the delivery location of duty-free merchandise be within \u201cclose proximity to an actual exit,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(8)(F), and that the duty-free enterprise implement procedures providing \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that duty-free merchandise will be exported from the United States. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Customs\u2019 approval of a location approximately 9/10ths of a mile from the actual exit is not an arbitrary or capricious interpretation or application of the statutory requirement of \u201cclose proximity. \u201d Congress did not specify a maximum distance, and this court does not find that a distance of under a mile is an impermissible interpretation of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Moreover, Customs\u2019 finding \u2014 based upon its review of GNG\u2019s delivery procedures and location \u2014 that there was a \u201clow probability\u201d that duty-free merchandise would not be exported from the United States, satisfied the statutory requirement that GNG\u2019s delivery procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>provide \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of exportation. As the term \u201creasonable assurance\u201d does not equate with an absolute guarantee of exportation, Senate Comm, on Finance, Omnibus Trade Act of 1987, S. Rep. No. 71, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. iy at 231 (1987), Customs did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The court, based upon Customs\u2019 premise that there is a \u201clow probability\u201d of repatriation of duty-free merchandise, upholds Customs\u2019 determination that GNG\u2019s duty-free merchandise delivery location is \u201cat or beyond the exit point\u201d and that the procedures employed provide \u201creasonable assurance\u201d of exportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">B. <em>Customs\u2019 Finding of \u201cLow Probability\u201d:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Duty Free further challenges Customs\u2019 factual determination that there exists a \u201clow probability\u201d duty free merchandise would not be exported. Customs, in approving GNG\u2019s application, reasoned \u201cconsideration was given to the relatively short distance between [the] proposed delivery site and Exit 43, * * * that the delivery site was within view of Customs\u2019 office at the Port of Champlain, and that their delivery procedure would be-comparable [to] a previously approved procedure for [Duty Free].\u201d Internal Advice Req., Jan. 31, 1994, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Duty Free contends these considerations did not provide reasonable assurance that the duty-free merchandise sold at GNG\u2019s facility would be exported. Duty Free notes that GNG\u2019s delivery location is nearly one qu\u00e1rter mile from the on-ramp on a public access road. According to Duty Free, there is nothing preventing a purchaser of duty-free merchandise from passing the freeway entrance or entering Duty Free\u2019s parking lot, and turning around.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Duty Free also argues the fact that the delivery point is within view of the Customs\u2019 Port of Champlain facility is misleading, as GNG\u2019s delivery location is still nearly one mile from the Customs\u2019 port building. According to Duty Free, it is doubtful that someone with normal eyesight would be capable of observing transactions with specificity at that distance. In any case, Duty Free contends, there is no indication that Customs officials at the Port are even watching.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Finally, Duty Free challenges Customs\u2019 comparison of GNG\u2019s facility to its own duty-free enterprise. Duty Free contends any such comparison would be erroneous, as the two stores were approved for operation under different criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Congress has not specified with certainty the exact relationship between an \u201cactual exit\u201d from a Customs territory and an \u201cexit point.\u201d <em>See </em>19U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(8)(F); <em>see also </em>S. Rep. No. 71 at 231 (noting exact procedures required to provide reasonable assurance of exportation depend on number of factors including location, and physical and geographical surroundings). \u201c[E]xit point,\u201d rather, is loosely defined. Customs, as the administering agency, possesses the discretion to determine whether the distance between the point of delivery and entrance to the on-ramp permits feasible and utilized alternatives to exportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Duty Free has also failed to point to any significant differences between the regulatory standards in effect before the enactment of section 1555 and those imposed afterwards. The legislative history of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 suggests such differences are negligible. See S. Rep. No. 71 at 233 (noting delivery methods at preexisting duty-free stores provided sufficient assurance of exportation). In fact, plaintiff claims standards imposed on stores before enactment of the statute may have been stricter. <em>(See </em>PI. \u2019s Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at 44) (citing directives prior to implementation of section 1555 defining \u201cexit point\u201d as point where failure of exportation is \u201cpractical impossibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">It appears Congress had a different purpose in mind when enacting the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 \u2014 to unify standards, not necessarily raise them. The Senate Report to the applicable provisions begins \u201cthis section would establish, for the first time, a comprehensive statutory framework for the regulation and operation of duty-free [stores].\u201d S. Rep. No. 71 at 229. Consistent with the above language, and in light of the relative proximity and similarity of both facilities, Customs could properly compare the two duty-free enterprises in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Customs compared GNG\u2019s application to Duty Free\u2019s facility and comparable location (the two facilities are less than l/5th of a mile apart) and found GNG\u2019s existing delivery procedures and location provided reasonable assurance of exportation. <em>(See </em>Def.\u2019s Mem. Opp\u2019n Pl.\u2019s Mtn. Summ. J., App., Mem. from Nat Aycox, Office of Cargo Enforcement and Facilitation, U.S. Customs Service, June 25,1991, at 1) (noting delivery locations of the two duty-free facilities \u201care extremely close to each other and provide approximately the same degree of assurance that duty-free goods are exported\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Plaintiffs experience shows delivery near the entrance to 1-87 virtually ensures exportation. Of a large number of sales made by Duty Free, very few instances were observed where duty-free merchandise was not exported from the United States. (Pl.\u2019s Mem. Supp. Summ. J., Ex. F, Pl.\u2019s Resps. to Def.\u2019s First Interrogs., No. 5.) Indeed, duty-free merchandise was exported 99.989 percent of the time. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Further, GNG\u2019s procedures reinforce exportation. GNG advises its customers on two separate occasions that the duty-free purchases are only for export to Canada: when the customer originally purchases the goods in GNG\u2019s facility, and when the cartman delivers the purchases. <em>(See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mem. Supp. Summ. J., Ex. G, Letter from GNG to District Director of Customs, July 16,1990.) Once delivery is made, the cartman observes the vehicle entering 1-87. <em>Id. </em>It appears that the particular GNG employee delivering the merchandise to the vehicle is also responsible for monitoring the vehicle until it enters 1-87, <em>id., </em>thus the cartman knows which vehicles contain duty-free merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Although conditions may not always permit Customs to observe delivery and conduct spot checks, the court may not substitute its judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>for that of the agency in determining whether \u201cany pattern of diversion by purchasers from immediate exportation would be readily apparent to Customs Officers at the port and investigated.\u201d Internal Advice Req. at 3. Further, the court will not supplant the agency\u2019s findings, merely by identifying alternative conclusions, even though the evidence may support more than one interpretation. <em>See Arkansas v. Oklahoma, </em>112 S. Ct. 1046, 1060 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The court finds the totality of factors \u2014 (1) the nature and location of the delivery point; (2) the short distance between the delivery point and the actual exit, permitting the cartman to monitor the vehicle until it enters the on-ramp; (3) the similarities with Duty Free\u2019s previously approved facility; and (4) GNG\u2019s delivery procedures \u2014 provide a reasonable basis for Customs\u2019 finding of a low probability that duty-free merchandise purchased from GNG would evade exportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">2. <em>\u201cMerchandise Storage Location\u201d:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Besides delivery \u201cat or beyond the exit point,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1555(b)(3)(F)(ii)(I), the statute further requires that a duty-free store deliver its merchandise \u201cat a merchandise storage location.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Customs found that the cartman\u2019s vehicle used to transport duty-free merchandise to the delivery point was a \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a mobile crib, and [fell] within the meaning of \u2019a merchandise storage location\u2019 as provided in the statute.\u201d HQ Reply at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Duty Free challenges Customs\u2019 finding. According to Duty Free, a merchandise storage location, and similarly a crib, are facilities where merchandise is retained and stored for an extended period, rather than ones in which goods are merely transported and delivered. Duty Free further contends these facilities must be located beyond the exit point at delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Duty Free does not contest that a crib may be a merchandise storage location. The regulations provide that a Class 9 warehouse with crib locations will be treated as a merchandise storage location. 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.35(c) (1994). Accordingly, a crib may also constitute such a location.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The court determines, therefore, whether GNG\u2019s delivery vehicle may be analogized to a \u201ccrib.\u201d Section 19.37(a), title 19, Code of Federal Regulations, defines \u201ccrib\u201d as \u201ca bonded area * * * for the retention of a small supply of articles for delivery to persons departing from the United States.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.37(a) (1994). Further, a crib may be \u201ca mobile facility * * * periodically moved * * * beyond the exit point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>GNG\u2019s cartman\u2019s vehicle falls into this definition, as it retains duty free merchandise for delivery. The regulations do not require retention of merchandise for an extended time, as Duty Free contends; temporary storage of merchandise during transfer to the duty-free purchaser is sufficient. The main inquiry in approving a merchandise storage location is the delivery location \u2014 whether it is at or beyond the exit point \u2014 rather than the delivery method. The court has already addressed and approved Customs\u2019 determination as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Customs\u2019 interpretation of a cartman\u2019s vehicle as a merchandise storage location does not appear to frustrate the statutory purpose, nor is Customs\u2019 analogy of the cartman\u2019s vehicle to a crib unreasonable. Due to an agency\u2019s discretion in interpreting its own regulations, Customs\u2019 construction is permissible. <em>See generally Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Customs\u2019 approval of GNG\u2019s application to operate a duty-free store is upheld. The court finds Customs properly determined that there was no practical alternative to the exportation of duty-free merchandise from GNG\u2019s delivery location, and that Customs\u2019 finding of GNG\u2019s cart-man\u2019s vehicle as a merchandise storage vehicle was proper. Plaintiffs motion for judgment on the agency record is denied.
