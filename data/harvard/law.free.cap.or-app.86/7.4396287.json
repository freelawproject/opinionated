The robberies occurred on May 31 and June 2, 1985, and arose out of separate transactions. Defendant had also been convicted of a third robbery committed on June 2, 1985, which is also entirely separate from the other two and is not directly involved in this appeal. The trial court originally imposed a minimum sentence for use of a weapon pursuant to ORS 161.610 in each case to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed, and we remanded for resentencing, because the court could impose only one minimum sentence. <em>See State v. Haywood, </em>73 Or App 6, 697 P2d 977 (1985). On resentencing, the court imposed a single minimum sentence under ORS 161.610 and ordered the sentences to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for the unrelated June 2, 1985, robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Defendant contends that the court, on resentencing, had no authority to impose any minimum sentence under ORS 161.610, because he had received a minimum sentence from another judge on the unrelated robbery charge. The state concedes that. <em>State v. Wells, </em>82 Or App 283, 728 P2d 533 (1986). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that the court has no authority to impose consecutive sentences. He is incorrect. <em>State v. Jones, </em>250 Or 59, 440 P2d 371 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Minimum sentence imposed in case number C8508-33370 vacated; both cases remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
