Defendant did not except to the instruction or otherwise properly raise the issue which he now argues. We decline to consider the assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">In case number 85-0579, defendant was convicted of attempted assault on Peterson and burglary of Peterson\u2019s residence with intent to commit assault. The court \u201cmerged\u201d the convictions for sentencing purposes. Defendant argues, and the state concedes, that the convictions should have been merged into one conviction for burglary in the first degree. We agree. <em>State v.

In that crime and the assault of Peterson, he used a gun. The court imposed a five-year minimum sentence in each crime for use of a gun pursuant to ORS 161.610 to be served concurrently. The state concedes, and we agree, that only a single mandatory minimum sentence under ORS 161.610 may be imposed. <em>State v. Hardesty, </em>298 Or 616, 695 P2d 569 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In case number 85-0579, judgment on conviction for assault reversed; in case number 85-0393, five-year minimum sentence for assault vacated; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
