The object and purpose of an injunction is to preserve and keep things in the same state or condition, and to restrain an act which, if done,, would be contrary to equity and good conscience, and is the appropriate \u201e relief when the remedy at law is subsequent' to the injury, and the effect cannot bo adequately compensated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-7\">A To support a motion for an injunction,,.the bill- should set forth a case of probable right, and a probable danger that the- right will be defeated' without the interposition of the Court. It interposes between the complainant and the injury he fears or seeks to avoid. If the injury be already done, the writ of injunction can have no application, for it cannot be applied correctively so as to remove it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-8\">3. Under the prayer for \u201cgeneral relief,\u201d such relief may bo afforded to the complainants as is <em>consistent </em>with the case made in the bill, provided the relief granted does not conflict with that specifically prayed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-9\"><em>\u00a3 </em>A Court will not suffer a defendant to be taken by surprise and permit a plaintiff to neglect and pass over the special prayer he has made for relief and take another decree, even though it be according to the case made by his bill.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-10\">5. The plaintiff\u2019Cannot desert specific relief prayed, and under the general prayer' ask special relief of another description.. Under the general prayer the plaintiff shall have such other relief as is <em>consistent </em>with the case made and the special prayer, and no more.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-11\">6. The exception to this general rule is, when there is an <em>obstruction </em>to the Court\u2019s granting the particular relief prayed. In sueh cases the plaintiff may take a different decree under the general prayer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-12\"><em>t-. </em>The insolvency of the debtor is never a sufficient reason of itself for the exercise of the extraordinary power of the Court by way of injunction. There must be some other equitable ground combined with insolvency.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-13\">8. To- authorize the interposition of the Court to stay waste it must appear to the satisfaction of the Court that,-unless its aid is given, irreparable-injury will be done to the complainant or his property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-14\">9. The existence of a \u201clien\u201d on behalf of the complainant, will not entitle-him to an injunction to restrain the defendant in the free use and enjoyment of his property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>10. In cases of lien, to \u00abntitle a complainant to tlieaid of an injunction, he must show that the free enjoyment of the property hy defendant will, in all probability, tend to its injury or-destruction to an extent that will impair its value as a security for his demand 'and peril its ultimate payment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">Appeal from Columbia Circuit Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">This case was decided at Tallahassee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\">A statement of the ease is contained in the opinion of the \u25a0Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-8\"><em>J.

Every essential fact necessary to obtain the relief granted to the complainant must be stated in the bill, that the defendant may properly prepare his defence. The decree rendered in this cause by the Judge Below, is. not sustained by any -of the allegations of the bill of complainants, or by any proofs in the cause ; and is founded on facts not put in issue by the pleadings, and for that cause the judgment of the court below should be reversed. Story\u2019s Eq. Plead., \u00a7257 and 257 a; Banks vs. Carneal, et al., 10 Wheat., 181, 189; Crockett vs. Lee, 7 Wheat., 522; Stuart vs. Mech. &amp; Farmer\u2019s Bank, 19 Johns., 496; Robson vs. Harwell and wife, 6 Geo., 596. Even an admission in the answer will not cure the want of the charge in the bill. Story\u2019s Eq. Plead., \u00a7263, 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-10\">II. An injunction will not be granted under the prayer for general relief unless it is agreeable to the case made by the bill; and the complainant cannot desert the specific relief prayed for in the bill, and under the prayer for general relief obtain other specific relief inconsistent with the prayer in the bill for specific relief. Story\u2019s Eq. Plead., \u00a740, 41, 42 and 43; Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Bank vs. Early et al., R. M. Charlton\u2019s Rep., 280; Hiern vs. Mill, 13 Vesey, 119; Wilkin vs. Wilkin, 1 Johns., Ch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>115, 117; Butler et al. vs. Durham, 2 Kelly, Geo.

But it xnajr be said that it lies in the discretion of the Chancellor to grant the injunction or not. What does this term discretion of the Chancellor mean <em>% </em>It is not the arbitrary will of the Judge, but it is a sound and reasonable discretion, based upon established precedents and regulated upon grounds which make it judicial. 1 Fonblanque\u2019s Eq., 4th Am. Ed., 10, 20, 21, 30 and 40; Seymour vs. Delancy, 3d Cowen, 505; 2d Story Eq. Juris,, \u00a7769; Mathews vs. Terwillinger, 3 Barb., S. C. R,, 55; Rex. Wilkes, Burrows\u2019 Rep. 2,539.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-6\">But it may be urged that the decree granted in this cause, is such a decree as the Chancellor might reasonably grant to prevent waste, although not directly sustained by the allegations of the bill. This view of the case leads to the inquiry, whether, under the allegations and statements of the Bill and answers, any such decree could be properly made under any aspect of the cause at bar. I contend that it could not for the reasons :</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-7\">I. The injunction should not be granted on this bill, as it no where appears on the face of the bill that the running of the cars of defendant over the road will so- impair its value that the property will not he sufficient to respond to any judgment the .complainants may obtain ; this allegation should appear with certainty. Story\u2019s Eq. Plead., Sect. 240, 241, 242, 248, 249, 250. The answer in this case alleges exactly the contrary, even if the fact was in the bill directly alleged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-8\">II. The complainants have no lien, legal or equitable, upon the railroad of defendants. First : Because it appears by the bill that complainants contracted with the Confederate States of America, and contracting with a <em>Government, </em>could not obtain a <em>lien </em>against tlio <em>Government </em>/ a lien presumes a legal right with a legal and judicial remedy. Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ernment cannot be sued, there can be no lien against Government, and ergo no lien against the defendants holding under Government. Second : Because railway contractors do not take or have mechanic\u2019s lien on road for their work. 1st Redfield on Railways, page <em>4Ai, </em>section XX ; Dunn vs. North Missouri R.

Injunction should not be granted to restrain a mere trespass where the injury is not irreparable.

And if the bill alleges that the <em>defendant claims title adverse </em>to the <em>complamamt, </em>the <em>complaincmt states himself out of </em>Court. Eden on Inj., 2d Am. Ed., 229 to 235; Storm vs. Mann, 1 Johns., ch. 21; Story Eq. Juris., sec. 918; Pillsworth vs. Hopton, 6 Vesey, 51.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">IY. An injunction will never be granted to stay waste when defendant is in possession, claiming and holding adversely. Nevitt vs. Gillispie, 1 Howard Miss., 108; Storm vs. Mann, 4 Johns., ch. 21; Pillsworth vs. Hopton, 6 Vesey, 51; Lansing vs. North River Steamboat Co., 7 Johns. ch. 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">Y. Injunction will not be granted where the complainant is guilty of Laches. Story\u2019s Eq. Juris., sec. 959a; Southard et al. vs. Morris Canal Co., Saxton, ch. N. J. Rept., 518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\">YI. Where the right of the complainant de|&gt;ends on the legal effect of a covenant, no injunction will be granted until the legal effect o\u00ed the covenant be settled, (legality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>contract here denied) and where the loss on the one side can be ascertained, but on the other could not, if the injunction issued, the court will dissolve the injunction and put the parties on terms. In this case the complainants have given no bond of indemnity for granting the injunction. Rigly vs. The Great Western R. R., 4th Eng. R. R. cases, top page 365, marg. 491; Hartridge et al. vs. Rockwell et al., R. M. Charlton\u2019s, 260, 266; Story Eq. Juris., sec. 959a, 959b; 28 Geo. 803, Weaver vs. Garner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">YII. A Court of Equity will not restrain by injunction an insolent debtor from transferring his property before judgment. 1 Hopkins, ch. 365, Moron vs. Dawes; Wiggins et al. vs. Armstrong et. al., 2 Johns., ch. 144; Bellamy vs. Bellamy, admr., 6 Fla. Repts., 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">YIII. An injunction will be dissolved on the coming in of the answer denying the equities of the bill. Cowles vs. Carter, 4 Iredell Eq., 106; 5th Iredell Eq., 26; 6th Iredell Eq., 225; 8th Iredell Eq. 296.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-7\"><em>M. Pcvpy </em>on the same side :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-8\">For appellants it is maintained that the order granted by the court below is not sustained by the allegations or prayer of the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-9\">First. There is no special prayer for the order granted, and under the general, prayer specific relief cannot be granted, unless such relief is agreeable to the case made in the bill. Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., See. 41; English vs. Foxhall, 2 Peters, 229, and authorities cited by Mr. Lovell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">The rule is, that if the bill contains charges putting facts in issue that are material, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which those facts will sustain under the general prayer, but he cannot desert specific relief\" and under the general prayer ask specific relief of another description, unless the facts and circumstances charged by the bill will consistently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>with the rules of court, maintain the relief. Lord Erskine, in Hern. vs. Miles, 13 Vesey, 118, [119;] Blount vs. Hay, <em>&amp; </em>Sanford Ch. R., 362, and cases cited by Mr. Lovell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-5\">Second. The injunction ordered was not necessary for the protection of the alleged rights or claims of the complainants, because the property on which the alleged lien is said to exist was abundantly ample to respond to any decree that could be made, and was a fixture that could not be removed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">Third. In order to support a motion for an injunction, the bill should set forth a case of probable right and a probable danger that the right would be defeated without the special interposition of the court. 1 Randolph, 206, Mitford\u2019s Pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">In this case there is not even a possibility of danger by any human calculation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">The mere allegation of a complainant that irremediable danger or irreparable mischief will insue is not sufficient, but to entitle a party to an injunction the facts must be stated to show that the apprehension of injury is well founded. Ansley vs. Lukeep, 9 Gill <em>&amp; </em>John., 468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-9\">Fourth. The order granted by the court below is a decision upon the merits by anticipation, for it is only after a final. decree that the court would, in any event, be justified in impounding the revenues of the road. The object of an injunction before answer is to preserve all things in their then condition, not to determine any by anticipation or to undo or restore any thing. Thebeaut vs. Canova, 11 Fla. R., 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-10\">The injunction is a preventive remedy. If the injury complained of be already done, the writ can have no operation, for it cannot be applied correctively (as it is. attempted in this case,) so as to remove it. It is not used for the purpose of punishment <em>or to oompel persons to do </em>right, but simply to prevent them from doing wrong. Att\u2019y Gen\u2019l vs. N. J. R. R. Transportation Co., 2 Green\u2019s Ch., 136.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Ail injunction is a secondary process, and must- be asked in aid of some primary equity, which must be disclosed in the same bill that prays it. Hilliard on Inj., 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-6\">Fifth. The complainants object to the lease of the road and make that the basis of the order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-7\">First. It is not made in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">Second. They are not the parties to make it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-9\">In Arthur vs. Commercial &amp; Railroad Bank, 9 Smedes &amp; Marsh., 430, the court say : The question as to the power of the corporation (to assign away the railroad and the franchise annexed to it,) need not now be considered. That is \u2022a matter between the State and the Corporation, with which third persons have nothing to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-10\">If the lease to the A. &amp; G. Co. is <em>ulfra vires </em>and void, so was necessarily that to the Confederate government, through which complainants\u2019 alleged claim is said to have arisen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\">Sixth* There is no lien legal or equitable. There was no contract between complainants and defendants. There was no fraud, and none is alleged, not even mistake. Tide authorities cited by Mr. Lovell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-12\">Seventh. A lien for meliorations is only where a party makes them on the supposition that he is the owner and is not aware of a defect in his title, and the true owner stands by without disclosing his title. Story, \u00a7 388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-13\">In all these cases the doctrine proceeds upon the ground of fraud or what is akin to it. Story\u2019s Eq., \u00a7 391, 1238.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-14\"><em>J. </em>P. <em>Sanderson </em>for Appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-15\">The statement of the case has already been sufficiently presented to the court by the counsel who have preceded me, and I shall, therefore, proceed to the discussion of such points as seem to me important in the elucidation of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-16\">In doing so, I shall briefly call the attention of the court to such parts of the record as are material for my purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>I propose, therefore, to consider together exceptions 2d, \u20223d and 4th, and lay down the following proposition as governing the case: When the bill sets forth a probable right and a probable danger that the right would be destroyed, an injunction will be granted. Reed, et al. vs. Dews, et al., R. M. Charlton, 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">The -second, third and fourth exceptions present but one \u25a0question for the consideration of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">2d.

See, on this point, Story\u2019s Eq. Pld., p. 43, \u00a7 40 and n. and \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">It is usual to pray for specific relief, but it has been held unnecessary that, under a prayer for general relief, without a specific prayer for the particular relief complainants think themselves entitled to,-will be sufficient, and the particular relief may be prayed for at bar. Welford\u2019s Eq. Pld., 106; Wilkinson vs. Beal, 4 Madd., 408; Grimes vs. French, 2 Atk., 141; Beaumont vs. Boultres, 2 Vesey, 494; Heine vs. Hill, 13 Vesey, 119; Barbour\u2019s Ch. Pr., vol. 1, 37; 1 Dall. Ch. Pr., p. 437.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">Other relief may be granted under a prayer for general relief, than that particularly prayed for, provided it be agreeable to the case made by the bill. English vs. Foxhall, 2 Peters, [612,] 8 condensed, 229.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-9\">There is a special prayer for an injunction as required where such relief is sought by the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-10\">The decree made is agreeable to the nature of relief sought, and sustainable under the prayer for general relief, without the aid of the prayer for injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-11\">In this case no injunction was granted. It is true the decree operates as an injunction, in some respects, in a modified form, but not inconsistent with the general prayer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-12\">If the court should construe the decree in the nature of an injunction, though different from the one prayed for, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>is the province of the court to mould or modify it, in its discretion, so as to attain the object sought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\">Defendants have no cause of complaint for want of notice. They had notice of an application for an injunction to restrain therii from operating the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">Where a hill prays for a particular relief, and other relief, the orator can have no other relief inconsistent with that prayed for, hut otherwise when the prayer for relief is in the disjunctive: 1 Ed.

B. B. Co., then owning the por- \u25a0 tion of the Boad in controversy, having left it in an unfinished condition, entered into some agreement with the Confederate Government, by which said Government was to complete the road-bed, &amp;c., and place thereon the iron. That complainants were placed on said Boad by the Confederate Government, and employed to do everything necessary to place the road-bed and track, including culverts and bridges, in a fit condition to be used and operated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>That this was done with the knowledge and approbation of the Pen. &amp; Ga. Co. That complainants did this work, and furnished the materials to the amount charged in the bill, of about $38,000. That they are professional Eail Eoad contractors and builders, and as such performed the work and furnished the materials used. That they were in possession of said Eoad, upon which they had expended their means and labor, and that the P. &amp; G. E. E. Co. knew they were so possessed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">The bill specifically sets forth the nature, extent, amount and value of the labor performed and materials furnished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">The bill also alleges, that during the time they were performing this work and labor, a wrar was existing between the Confederate States and the United States, and that in 1865 the war ceased, and that complainants were in possession of said Eoad at the time, and had not surrendered their possession of their work, labor and materials, to the Confederate Government; and that the Confederate Government had never accepted or received said Eoad or paid complainants therefor; and that complainants were never legally divested of their possession of the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">Bill alleges that complainants-have a lien upon said road, for the work and labor thereon by them performed, and for the materials by them furnished therefor, and distinctly charges that they have a lien on each and every part of said Eoad therefor, and that it has never been lost or surrendered, and that they cannot be divested thereof, until the same is satisfied and paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\">It charges an illegal dispossession of complainants by defendants, and refusal to pay them, and that defendants had knowledge of complainants3 lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-9\">It charges that defendants, one or both, have taken possession of their labor, work and materials, and are enjoying the same, and have not paid therefor, to complainants3 injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>It charges b\u00a9th defendants with endeavoring to defeat complainants\u2019 lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">It charges insolvency of P. &amp; G.

E. E. Co., and that said company has the benefit, use and enjoyment thereof, and have paid nothing therefor; that this improvement was made with their knowledge and approbation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-11\">The bill, therefore, shows that the P. <em>\u25a0&amp; </em>G. Co. are debtors-for so much as the work and labor and materials are reasonably worth, and that the work, labor and materials were of that character which constitutes an equitable lien upon the road-bed and materials by them placed thereon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-12\">The first question to ascertain is, are complainants creditors of the P. &amp;. G. E. E. Co. ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-13\">It is admitted by defendants\u2019 answer that the Confederate Government was to put the Eoad in running order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>have the use of it during the war, free of charge, and at the close of the war the Pen. <em>&amp; </em>Ga. R. R. Co. were to have the privilege of purchasing the superstructure and improvements placed thereon from the Confederate Government. They were not, therefore, to have the benefit of the capital expended on the Road without making compensation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">The bill shows that the Confederate Government neither paid for the improvements, or had the use or benefit of them. The war closed before the Confederate Government used or operated the Road, and the P. &amp; G. Co. took possession and have enjoyed the fruits of complainants\u2019 labor and capital.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">Will not equity, then, substitute complainants to the rights-the Confederate Government would have had, if it had continued a Government, and exact payment thereon <em>%</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">The P. <em>&amp; </em>G.

Co. seek to set up a breach of the understanding had with the Confederate Government as a bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-12\">The court properly disregarded this, for when a new equity is set up by the answer the court will not regard it on a motion to grant or dissolve an injunction.

S. at its own expense, and to use the road for its own benefit, except so far as by the constitution and the laws compensation was required to be-made to defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"268\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-10\">That it was the design of the agent of the Confederate-States to' avoid, if they could, the payment of compensation as required in all cases of seizure or impressment, and to-that end various propositions and terms were made and offered, <em>\u201c </em>and finally it was agreed that the Confederate States should have the use of the road-way on said branch road, together with such cross-ties as this defendant had provided for that purpose, free of any charge, owing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>war, at the conclusion of which this defendant was to have the privilege of purchasing the superstructure laid by the \u2022Confederate States upon said road-way, and bridges, &amp;c.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"269\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">&gt;&amp;a., and if the parties could come to no terms as to price, the Confederate States was to have the right to remove the same.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"270\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">Tire answer' next alleges a certain agreement entered into through the attorney and agent of the C. S. with the Florida Railroad Co., relative to taking so much iron, and chairs, and spikes, from the Florida Railroad, and completing the branch road, and after the establishment of peace, providing for the same to be replaced on the Florida Railroad at the cost of the C. S., and they file as exhibit \u201cA\u201d a copy of' said agreement, which is made a part of the answer. And that as soon as if was informed of the said agreement, which was a few days thereafter, it objected thereto, and at once informed .the agent and attorney of the C. S. of \u201cits opposition to the sa\u00edne, as conflicting with the agreement entered into with this defendant,\u201d and that if the Confederate States proceeded thereunder, if would regard it as in violation of its right under the agreement made with it, and protested against the taking possession of the branch road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"271\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">That the C. S. by its agent, proposed another agreement with defendant, but it was refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"272\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">That notwithstanding the protest of this defendant as aforesaid, and notwithstanding the violation of -the contract made with it as aforesaid, the said Confederate States and its agents proceeded to use the branch road aforesaid, and to retain the possession thereof; and did lay down on the track the iron <em>it </em>had obtained from the Florida Railroad Company under the agreement aforesaid. That although this defendant was not bound longer by said agreement, it had no means to <em>\u201c </em>regain the possession of said road, which had been taken and then was in possession of the C. S.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"273\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">The answer next alleges that the complainants were well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>advised of the policy of seizure and impressment that had been adopted by the C. S.</p>\n<p data-order=\"274\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">That in all such cases and \u201c where the use of property was permitted to the Confederate government, all expenses and cost of repair or completion were borne by the C. S, without liability on the part of the owner, and without expectation on the part of contractors,, workmen or others, that any person other than the C. S. was liable for or would pay for work performed or materials furnished.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"275\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">That in this case the defendant had no authority or power to prevent the complainants from executing the contract they had made with the Confederate States through their agent with respect to this branch, and if it had attempted it the complainants would not have heeded it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"276\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">That the complainants looked only to the C. S. for pay' for work performed and materials furnished by them on said branch road; that the same was provided for by contract between them as to mode and amount; that the continuing in the possession of said branch road was ip violation of the rights of defendant, and nqt in conformity to the contract it had agreed to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"277\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">The answer next says that there was no responsibility from defendants to complainants }n any form, and denies that the failure of the O. S. to pay the complainants gives, them any right in law or equity to assert and maintain their claim against defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"278\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">That on their contract they gave credit to the C. S. with the full knowledge that at the end of the war the road, whether held under the contract with defendant or against it, and notwithstanding the protest as aforesaid, would come back and be received by defendant, without any responsibility in law or equity for any obligation which might have been incurred by the C. S.</p>\n<p data-order=\"279\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">That complainants in fact and in law assumed all the risks of being paid by the O. S., and did not suppose or act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>on the supposition that defendant was liabie to them, or that there existed a lien on said branch road against defendant ; and denies that the possession of said branch road was delivered to complainants by the O. S.; and denies positively that it had knowledge of any such possession being delivered to them; and says it is not customary to deliver possession of road to contractor, whose work is limited to something short of complete construction, and especially was it not necessary in this case, because the defendant had completed the grading and trestling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"280\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">That the C. S. had no lawful authority to deliver possession to complainants or to any person, so as to impair or defeat the right of this defendant to the possession of said road at the end of the war, or in any way to prevent it from discharging its duty to the public by operating said road according to the requirements of its charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"281\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">That before tlre end of the war, and before the surrender of the C. S. and its armies, the said C. S. were, in fact, in the complete occupancy and possession of the branch road, and had run their own trains of cars over the same, without objection, murmur or dissent from complainants or either of them, so far as defendant ever heard, and without the assertion of a right on their behalf to interpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"282\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">That upon the surrender, the United States authorities took possession of said branch road as captured property, liable to confiscation, and retained possession for some two months or more, when the road and this branch were turned over to defendant. It therefore denies that it took possession of said road and deprived the complainants thereof; but asserts \u201cthat complainants never had legal possession, (or actual possession, so far as was necessary to enable them to perform their contract with the Confederate States.\u201d)</p>\n<p data-order=\"283\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">That defendant did not, in fact, deprive complainants of the possession, but in fact received the same from the authorities of the United States, without the remotest idea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>.at the time, that it was or would be considered by complainants liable to pay what they had agreed to take from the C. S., and from whom alone they expected payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"284\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">That the United States, on the application of the Florida Railroad Company, authorized the removal of the iron that had been placed on the branch Road, the Florida Railroad Company being entitled to the same under its contract with the C. S., and that the defendant offered no objection, but facilitated the tearing up and removal of the rails from the branch road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"285\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALX\">That upon the surrender of the C. S., it had the legal right to enter upon and take possession of its said branch, without responsibility to complainants for whatever work might have been done while in possession of the C. S.; that the posses-\u00abion was transferred by the United States to defendant, the \u00abame having been in actual occupancy by the C. S. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"286\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">That there was no lien, express or implied, in favor of complainants, n'or did the C. S., or its agents,, or officers, have the legal right to create a lien in. favor of the complainants ; [and defendant denies that it liad any notice of such pretended lien until the filing of the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"287\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-8\">Defendant answers \u2014 that on the termination\u2019 of the war, its means being crippled, and its resources curtailed for want \u25a0of means, it concluded to dispose of said branch road to the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Railroad Company, so- as\u2019 to complete the connection at an early day between the main lines of road in Georgia and Florida, and thus secure to the public the benefits intended by the law. That the defendant in last July concluded an agreement with said Atlantic &amp; Gulf Railroad Company for the sale Or lease- of said branch road, which has been consummated so far as to deliver said branch road to said Atlantic <em>&amp; </em>Gulf Railroad Company, and annex the agreement as exhibit \u201c B,\u201d and make it a part of the .answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"288\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-9\">That at the time of making the agreement the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>had no notice of the alleged lien of the defendant, and never imagined that any legal claim existed ag'ainst it for said work or materials, and therefore denies that it had attempted to defeat the said pretended lien by the transfer of the branch road,, or that the same does, in fact, affect any legal claim which complainants have against it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"289\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">The answer denies that the running or operating of the branch road by th\u00a9 defendants in any wise impairs or affects injuriously th\u00a9 pretended claim of complainants. And as the road has been graded and trestled at the cost of defendant, before th\u00a9 C, S. got possession -thereof, and as to the road bed so as aforesaid constructed, there exists no shadow of pretense of a lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"290\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">That the iron was procured- and laid on the track at the cost and expense of the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Eailroad, and as to that there is no pretense of lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"291\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">That if there is- any lien or claim existing against the defendant, no injury or damage can arise to complainants by the continued operations of said branch road, hut great damage would result to the said Atlantic &amp; Gulf Eailroad, and great inconvenience to the public, without any benefit to the complainants, if the running of the road were to be enjoined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"292\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-8\">Answer insists that the pendency of the suit in Leon Circuit Court is in abatement of these proceedings, and that the same should be dismissed.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"293\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-9\">That the value received by it for the branch road did not exceed, if indeed it reached, the actual cost to- the defendant of the branch road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"294\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-10\">That the defendant knows nothing of the pretended claims of complainants, or wetber they did or did not receive any compensation from the O. S., except what they derive from the allegations and statements of complainants, and insist that full proof should be required of them; but in no event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>does it admit that in law or equity it is responsible for the same.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"295\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">And for further answer \u2014 \u201c That the office of this defendant, and tire residence of its President, is in Leon county, in the Middle Circuit of Florida; that the larger part <em>of </em>said branch road lies in the Middle Circuit aforesaid; that this defendant is by law suable only in the county of Leon aforesaid, and that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the Middle Circuit is ample for all the purposes set forth in the complainants\u2019 bill of complaint; defendant therefore insists upon its right secured by the laws of this State, and insists upon the facts aforesaid, by way of plea to the further maintainance of this suit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"296\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">That the complainants at the time, or shortly after, of the agreement for the sale or lease of the said branch road to the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Rail Road Company, that they should have asserted their claim to be enforced by a sale of Road before the Atlantic <em>&amp; </em>Gulf Rail Road Company incurred the' expense of purchasing the iron rails and laying them down on the track and before the transfer was fully consummated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"297\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">That neither of the defendants had any knowledge of the pretended lien or that such lien would be asserted, and that the failure to assert their lien should stop them from doing so now. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"298\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">That their standing by and suffering said transfer to be made and the expense of buying and laying down the iron on said Branch Road to be incurred without asserting their lien, and to permit it now <em>to </em>be maintained would operate as a fraud upon the rights of both the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"299\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-9\">That the running and operating of said road is a public benefit and in compliance with the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"300\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-10\">That the using of the road necessitates its being kept in good order and repair, which would not be the case if left without supervision and unattended to. That it would be in a better condition to respond to any decree complainants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>may obtain by its use than by stopping its operations. That tlie injunction is not necessary to protect any right of complainants ; that an injunction ought not and cannot rightfully be granted in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"301\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">That Daniel Callahan; one of the complainants, in 1866, and not long before the agreement with the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Railroad Company was made with one Sims, sought to make an arrangement with both the defendants by which they should become possessed of the said Live -Oak connection, embracing that part in Georgia as well as the part in Florida, but the terms proposed were not accepted. That during the negotiations no suggestion was made by Calkhan of the pretended claim asserted by complainants, and no intimation of the said pretended lien was made or notice thereof was given to defendant, and that the complainants should now be stopped from asserting the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"302\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">And lastly, that by the agreement with the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Railroad Company, it was to receive for said branch road the actual cost of the same in stock of said A. &amp; G. Ri R. Co. at par. That the said consideration has been received by this defendant and -the same has been disposed of by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"303\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">And on the same day, to-wit: on the 18th day of April, 1867, was filed the separate answer of the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Railroad Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"304\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-9\">The answer admits that the Pensacola &amp; Georgia R. R-. Co. was authorized by its charter to construct the branch road as alleged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"305\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-10\">That defendant knows nothing of the condition of said branch road when complainants took possession under said alleged contract with the C. S., and prays strict proof thereof. ' *</p>\n<p data-order=\"306\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-11\">That it knows nothing of any contract or agreement between the Pensacola &amp; Georgia R. R. Co. and the C.

S. in regard to the work, and labor,, and material on said branch road,, and prays strict proof thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"308\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">And avers, that if any such contract was- made as alleged in complainants\u2019 bill, \u201c that such contract was made for the purpose of aiding and assisting the said Confederate States-in carrying on war, and in their rebellion against the government of the United States, and therefore was and is illegal and void <em>ab </em>initio, and cannot be enforced by this court;; and that such contract being contrary to law and illegal, the said complainants ought not to have and cannot have a lien upon the said branch road for the payment of the amount they claim to be due them thereon, if such amount is duo thereon from said late Confederate- States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"309\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">That it appears from complainants-\u2019 bill \u201c that the work,, labor and materials which they expended upon and furnished to said branch road were- so- done and furnished under a contract between, them and Minor Merriweather, a Major of Engineers in the military service of the Confederate States of America, acting for said Confederate States in carrying on war against the United States Government and for no other purpose, as this defendant avers and alleges, and that by the-laws of the United States such contract was and is void and illegal and of no force, and cannot and should not be enforced in- any court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"310\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">The- defendant knows nothing of the labor and materials laid out by complainants on said branch road, and prays they may be held to strict proof thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"311\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">That by complainants\u2019 bill it appears, that they went into the possession solely under the authority of the late Confederate States, and were solely employed by the C. S., and avers that neither of the defendants were parties to said act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>of possession. That the contract was made by complainants solely .with the late Confederate States and not with either\u2019 of defendants. That the possession was received by complainants for an unlawful purpose; that the complainants never were in lawful possession, and all such right, if any such right they ever had, ceased and ended with the power and existence of said late Confederate States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"312\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">That complainants never did acquire any lawful lien upon .said branch road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"313\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">That the defendant is informed, and believes and avers, that on or about June, 1865, the said branch road was left by said complainants to the possession of the forees of the .army of the United States,and was entirely abandoned by said complainants, and so remained until on or about the month &lt;of September, '1865, when the Pensacola <em>&amp; </em>Georgia R. R. Co. re-took possession of the branch road as its own property, abandoned by the late Confederate States, and all persons claiming under it, and at that time the said branch, road was not in either the actual or constructive possession of complainants, and it was daily coming tp loss and detriment and daily becoming impaired in value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"314\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-6\">That it entered into a contract with the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad Co. for the lease of said road for ninety-nine years, and is now in possession and running its ears over the same under said contract. That possession commenced on the 17th day of July, 1866, the date of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"315\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-7\">That the defendant has paid the Pensacola &amp; Georgia R. R. Co. in part consideration for said lease, the sum of $134,-600 in the capital stock of this company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"316\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-8\">That no lease or \u00bfleed has yet been executed between this defendant and the Pensacola <em>&amp; </em>Georgia Railroad Company, but claims to hold the branch road under said contract, which is annexed and made a part of the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"317\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-9\">That since it went into possession under the contract it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>lias expended upon said road, in work and materials, more than $220,000 \u2014 has increased the value of the road -to that \u25a0extent, and its responsibility to answer to complainants for any lien they may have thereon for the payment of their claim of $37,879 GO-100 as is alleged in their bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"318\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">It denies that the use of the road by defendant will impair its value, but avers that while the trains of defendant are running over said branch road and carrying mails of the United States, passengers and freight, it is necessary for defendant to keep the same in good running order and repair, and thus keep up and sustain the security to complainants for the payment of any lien they may have or judgment or decree they may obtain against said branch road. That if injunction is granted/ it would weaken the security to complainants as it would not be necessary for it to keep said road in repair, and denies that tbe use of the road by defendant can in any way decrease its value ; that there will not he ample and sufficient property therein to respond or \u25a0pay any judgment or decree which complainants may obtain \u25a0for their aforesaid claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"319\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">That neither of defendants ought to be bound to pay to complainants, if in the judgment of this court the defendants or either of them, are under any obligation to make payment .therefor, to a greater amounftlian the actual value of said labor, work and materials, when the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Railroad Company took possession of the same, and that they should in no wise he held for the original cost, but only for the actual value as it came into tbe possession of defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"320\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">And upon information and belief the complainants have been paid by the Confederate States large amounts of money for work, labor and materials, which they allege toliave laid \u25a0out and expended on said branch road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"321\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">And it denies that any lease or conveyance by tbe said Pensacola &amp; Georgia R.

R. Co., alleging that the Leon Circuit Court has jurisdiction, because the residence of the President and the office of that Company is in Leon county, and the greater paid of said branch road lies in the Middle Circuit. That defendant is by law suesfble only in the county of Leon, and that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for the Middle Circuit is ample for all the purposes set forth in complainants\u2019 bill.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"326\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\">It is contended on behalf of complainants that this court has jurisdiction, and that it is the proper circuit wherein the same should be brought, to-wit: in the Suwannee Circuit Court in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"327\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-10\">The defendant, the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. R. R. Co., insist that under and by statute of this State, See. 3, Thomp. Digest, page 328, the suit should have been commenced in Leon Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\u25a0Court- \u00a5e contend that said statute has no application to this case for the following reasons:</p>\n<p data-order=\"328\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">1st. That this is a court of general equity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"329\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">2d. The defendant, the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Pailroad.Company is a foreign corporation, whose agent and office is in Suwannee county, therein residing and having the office of said Company, as alleged in the bill of complainants, and sworn in the return of the Sheriff upon the subpoena in Suwannee county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"330\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">3d. The result of the plea, if sustained, would be to require two causes in equity to be brought \u2014 one in the <em>Leon </em>Circuit against the Pensacola &amp; Georgia P. P. Co., and one in the Suwannee Circuit against the Atlantic &amp; Gulf P. P. Co., thus multiplying suits about the same subject matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"331\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">The position of the defendant, the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. P. P. Co., might be well taken if it was the <em>sole </em>defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"332\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">The plea sets forth facts which constitute only a question of privilege in the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. P. P. Co. to be sued in Leon Circuit Court.\u2014See Russ, adm\u2019r of Gorrie, vs. Mitchell, XI Florida Peports, 80.</p>\n<p data-order=\"333\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">But in case of several defendants, as in the ease at bar, the plea will not hold good.</p>\n<p data-order=\"334\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-11\">Story in his Equity Pleadings, Sec. 715, says: i- \"When the suit is brought in a superior court of general equity jurisdiction, nothing will be intended to be out of its jurisdiction except what is shown to be.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"335\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-12\">And again he says, speaking of the plea \u2014 \u201c In point of substance it is necessary to entitle the particular jurisdiction to exclusive cognizance of the suit, that it should be able to give a complete remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"336\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-13\">And the same author, at page 727, \u00a7 715, lays down the rule which complainants hold decides this plea of the P. &amp; G.

How do they respond to that notice? They file their answers; they deny that complainants have any equity; they set up a new equity, which they say exists, to defeat the complainants; they disclose an agreement under which title is claimed as a purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice so as to. defeat complainants; they? by their answers, bring up the whole merits of the cause $ they put the whole cause at issue; they disclose a cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>which, wc say* makes out our claim to the interposition of this court; they, by their own course in putting in the answers, require the court to hear all the equities in the same. They do all this. They appear and argue the whole cause fully by solicitors for both defendants, as is shown of record by the decree of the court, on a motion that injunction do issue according to the prayer in the bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"354\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\">What was that prayer ? For an injunction to issue restraining them, their servants, &amp;c., from running, using or removing locomotives and ears over said branch, or any part thereof, or in any way or manner using the branch road, until the further order of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"355\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">This prayer for an injunction they resisted by their answers, and because the court, by its decree, modified the relief prayed for specially, by permitting them to continue to use the road, and to report to him the receipts and expenditures, and forbid the Florida corporation, that, by its own admission, was insolvent, to turn over the proceeds of this road to a foreign corporation and allow it to go beyond its jurisdiction. In a word, because the court in that part of its decree allowed them to use the road until his further. order, under such terms as the court imposec], instead of restraining them from using the road in any way. They say this was surprise; we had no notice. This is to say the <em>major </em>does not include the <em>minor.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"356\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">Is it surprise that the court allowed the continued use of the road on terms until his further order, instead of preventing the defendants from in any way using the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"357\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">Was it surprise that the court decided that it had jurisdiction when they themselves do not even call its decision into question, or their appeal as to that point ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"358\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-9\">Was.it surprise that the court enjoined the execution of the agreement which was disclosed by them, for the first time, upon the discovery prayed for in complainants\u2019 bill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and when disclosed by them, on it they relied to destroy the equity of the complainants\u2019 bill, and which instrument was a fraud upon and hindrance to complainants\u2019 rights, and was in violation of law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"359\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">Was it surprise to prevent them from fully completing an illegal act partially performed and claimed as a title ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"360\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">Most assuredly they could not have been surprised to their injury by that part of the decree which ordered them to show cause why a Receiver should not be appointed, because they appealed and obtained a supersedeas before the time came for them to show cause, hence that part of the decree has never been determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"361\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">The 9th objection this court will not nor cannot inquire into; it would simply raise a question of veracity; if it is to be enquired into we say \u2014 the court must have evidence as to what constituted the questions of argument below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"362\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-8\">We say the motion was made at the bar to get the court, if it refused the specific injunction prayed for, to grant the order and decree made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"363\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-9\">II.

This the court enjoins, thus to that extent granting the injunction as to that particular use being made of the road. Therefore we hold, that the injunction enjoining the' execution of the contract or agreement is embraced in that part of the special prayer for injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"374\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">Next, we hold the orders of the court and the interlocutory decrees are embraced in the prayer for general relief.

S. to avail themselves of it, and not the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"424\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-10\">The right of Spratt &amp; Callahan to their retention and possession of such road could, were this be true, be only taken from them by the judgment of a court of the U. S., for aiding and assisting the rebellion, under the acts of Congress. That judgment could not be obtained, because Spratt &amp; Callahan have been pardoned, which pardon is on file in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"425\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-11\">But it is contended, that until the complainants are de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>prived of their property, to-wit: the work, and labor, and materials expended on the road, by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in favor of the IT. S., the complainants cannot be estopped by that defense from relief in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"426\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-4\">Further, it is contended that complainants did have a legal right to make such contract at the time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"427\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">The leading ease on this subject, determined by a full bench of the Supreme Court of the U. S. in 1862, (see Prize Cases, 2 Black, <em>U. </em>S. S. C. Reports, page 635,) established the doctrine. (See page 669.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"428\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">1st. That it was civil war and not rebellion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"429\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-7\">2d. That a civil war is never publicly proclaimed <em>eo nomine </em>against insurgents \u2014 its actual existence is \u25a0 a fact in our domestic history, which the court is bound to notice and to know.</p>\n<p data-order=\"430\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-8\">3d. <em>Civil war existed </em>and hostilities might be prosecuted on the same footing as if thos\u00e9 opposing the government were foreign enemies invading the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"431\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-9\">1th. Each party is deemed a belligerent nation, having the sovereign rights of war.- \u2014 2 Brown, U.

C, 4 vol., \u00a777. See the authority in Yattel above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"433\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-11\">Hence, we contend that the C. S. had belligerent rights, and that the C. S. were empowered to do all acts in conformity to civil war, has been solemnly determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, and is a full answer to that part of defendant\u2019s answer, and proves that the contract alleged in complainants\u2019 bill was a legal contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"434\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>But suppose that it was not the c\u00e1se, then we hold that there is an <em>implied contract </em>created by law between the Pensacola &amp; Georgia R. R. Co., they having received the use and benefit 'of complainants\u2019 skill, work, and labor, and materials, furnished and expended in the improvement and and enhancing the value of said branch road by complainants\u2019 labor. The law raises an implied promise on their part, to pay to the complainants the just compensation for said benefit received by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"435\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">Again, even if this were not so, we hold the rule to be this: That in equity, the genei\u2019al maxim of <em>pari </em>delicto, &amp;e., does not always prevail, circumstances of the <em>parU </em>case often form exceptions, and when it is necessary relief will be granted.\u2014Bellamy vs. Bellamy, 6 Fla., 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"436\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">Eastbrook vs. Scott, 3 Vesey, Jr., 156.

So if the true owner stands by and suffers improvements to be made on an estate, without notice of his title, he will not be permitted in equity to enrich himself by the loss of another; but the improvements will constitute a lien on the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"445\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">The maxim, <em>\u201cjure natura equm est, nemimem cum alterius detrimento et injuria 'fim </em>loowplet/um.\u201d See also 2 Story, \u00a71239.</p>\n<p data-order=\"446\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-11\">It is laid down as a general doctrine of the civil law, <em>\u201c </em>that those whose money has been laid out on improve \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ments of an estate, such as making a plantation, or erecting buildings upon it, or augmenting the apartments of a house, or for other like cause, have by civil law a privilege upon those improvements, as upon a purchase with their own money.\u201d See 2 Story, \u00a71236, as to money expended by one of joint purchases for money expended in repairs and improvements, having therefore a lien on the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"447\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">I use the language of Judge Law, counsel for plaintiff in error in Collins vs. The Central Bank, 1 Kelly, 152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"448\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5j\">\u201c It was our work, labor, money and materials which conferred its value on the road.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"449\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">\u201cReceiving the benelits of these improvements, they are bound equally with the owners to pay for them.

Judge Warner in delivering the opinion in Collins vs. The Central Bank, 1 Kelly, at page 458, says : \u201c It was not intended to violate that principle of <em>natural justice </em>which exists in favor of those whose labor constructed the road and who furnished materials and equipments therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"452\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-11\">Courts of equity treat the lien as a <em>natural equity, </em>having its foundation in the earliest principles of courts of equity. 2 Story, \u00a71220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"453\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-12\">Now, the answers do not deny the work and labor and materials furnished, as alleged in complainants\u2019 bill; and the statements are proven in this respect to be true, by the evidence of the engineer of the C. S., J. M. Fairbanks, and by that of Mr. Wells, the superintendent of Spratt &amp; Callahan, who had charge of the work, and under whose personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>superintendence it was done, both give the value and depose as to its correctness. The chief engineer of the Atlantic <em>&amp; </em>Gulf R. R.

'</p>\n<p data-order=\"455\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">The insolvency of the Pensacola &amp; Georgia Bailroad Co. is not denied by the answer, not that the complainants are without relief, unless the demands for compensation shall be satisfied out of said branch road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"456\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">This is not a case where the defendant has a right to prefer creditors, hence the authorities where a court of equity refused an injunction on the ground of insolvency, has no application to this case, as they are all predicated on the right of the defendant to prefer creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"457\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">In the case of Yonge vs. Bryan, 6 Fla., 369, where the court granted a writ of injunction to enjoin the collection of the purchase money of land, on the ground of defective title after the vendee had possession, one of the grounds in that case was, <em>\u201c </em>that defendant is insolvent and unable to respond to damages in case of recovery of warranty.\u201d The court there say, <em>\u201c </em>the defectiveness of title to part of the property, and the inability of defendant, through insolvency, to compensate the deficiency on the grounds of equity set forth by complainants, and are sufficient of themselves to entitle them to the injunction,\u201d although the answer in that case alleged \u201c that they are sufficiently protected by warranty.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"458\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">The defendant attempts to evade the equities of complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ants\u2019 bill by setting up a lease, and say tlie Atlantic &amp; Gulf R.

We do not claim there is any statutory lien. The court decided that justly, but it did not decide the question at bar. The equitable right to restrain the possession until compensation is made for the work and labor ; to decree adversely to this would be, as we have already shown, to decree against a right founded in natural justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"474\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">The statements of the bill that defendants had notice is. sustained by the affidavit of Joseph B. Stone, who says : <em>\u201c </em>he was then chief engineer of the Atlantic &amp;' Gulf Bail-road Company,\u201d (one of the defendants) <em>\u201c </em>and that while acting as such engineer he had the means of knowing that said connection Bailroad was built by Daniel Callahan &amp; James W.

R. R. Co. on an implied promise to pay for the work and labor on this very portion of the branch road for tho recovery of that claim herein applying to be enforced and on the like contract seeking relief in equity. See second count in the declaration in exhibit A, in complain-, ants\u2019 bill, and 3d and 4th in--for the wrongful conversion. Tho doctrine of <em>\u201c Us pendens\u201d </em>applies here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"477\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">And it will be remembered that this suit was brought and was <em>pending p^dor </em>to the meeting of the General Assembly .of 1866, at which tho Pen. <em>&amp; </em>Ga. R. R. Co. attempted to have their charter amended to enable them to carry out their <em>seer el agreement </em>with the .Atlantic &amp; Gulf R. R. Co:, and which was denied by the legislature, but was amended and shaped .into the present statute above quoted, for the amendments hereto made by the Senate of Florida. See Senate Journal 1866, p. 161, 154, 181, 195.</p>\n<p data-order=\"478\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-9\">Again, the answer of the Pen. Ga. R. R. Co. wherein it alleges th\u00a9 -various matters between, it and the agent of the C. S. relative to the Fla. R. R. Co., proves they had notice. The law is laid down in Soule vs. Downes, 7 Cal., 575, cited in annual Digest, 1859, vol. 19, page 453, that \u2022\u00a3\u00a3 those dealing with property during the progress of building on it are charged with notice of tho builder\u2019s lien.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"479\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-10\">And again, in the answer of the Pen. &amp; Ga. R. R. Co. whore they attempt to avoid complainants\u2019 rights by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>saying \u201c <em>that in case defendant had no authority or power </em>to prevent the complainants from executing the contract they had made with the Confederate States, through their agent, with respect to this branch, and if it had attempted it, the complainants would have heeded its remonstrances or objections as much as the Confederate States heeded its objection to the contract with the Floridas Railroad Company and their using the branch road under said contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"480\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">Herein the Pen. &amp; Ga. R. R. Co. not only admits they knew complainants were executing said contract and performing work and labor and furnishing materials in the improving and completing of said road, but that the defendant, the Pen. &amp; Ga. R. R. Co., stood by and made no objections thereto, nor made any remonstrances to Spratt <em>&amp; </em>Callahan, but gave an excuse for their silence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"481\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">We hold that in that part of their answer they had admitted the allegation of complainants\u2019 bill, and by their own admission of remaining silent while complainants were making repairs and improvements, they show their responsibility to compensate complainants for said work and labor and materials, from which they have derived great benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"482\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-7\">The owner who stands by and sees work done for another on his land without disclosing his interest, is subject to the mechanics\u2019 lien.\u201d Donaldson vs. Holmes, 23 Ill., 85, cited in U. S. D., 21, page 355, and see 2 Story Eq. Juris., \u00a7388 and 385. But on the other hand it is shown in the answers themselves that complainants did not have notice of the unlawful agreement sought to be entered into by the defendants. The exhibit shows it to be an agreement entered into between the Presidents of the Pen. &amp; Ga. R. R. Co. and the Atlantic &amp; Gulf R. R. Co. at Savannah : the law required three months\u2019 notice to amend the R. R. Charter, that public notice required by the constitution, made before the act of 1866, amending the Pen. &amp; Ga. R. R. Co. Charter, showed complainants that they did not have at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>any such power; but that they would apply for such power, and the act shows what the legislature authorized them, the defendants, to do. The complainants call upon them to discover what they have done. The agreement is disclosed by the answers, as they were compelled to do, and there is discovered the illegal contract under which the Atlantic <em>&amp; </em>Gulf R. R. C o. claims, and by virtue of which defendants .attempt to .deprive complainants of that equitable relief .to wich .they\u2019 are entitled: to enforce their right to be compensated out of the branch road for the money, work, labor and materials .expended thereon by them, and to prevent the defendants from completing the fraud attempted upon the rights of complainants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"483\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">Hence, the nature of this case we contend is such that required the Chancellor, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to grant the suit prayed for, and enjoin the defendants from continuing the irreparable injury and mischief to complainants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"484\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">The authorities relative to a refusal to grant injunctions in eases of doubtful title are not applicable to the case at bar. All these cases are predicated on tbe principle that a court of equity will not enjoin waste alleged by one whose title is doubtful to the property upon which the waste is alleged to be committed. That before the chancellor will grant an injunction to stay waste, the complainant must first exhibit a title in himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"485\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">But this is not a case of waste, nor is it a case of doubtful title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"486\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">The complainants allege no title in themselves, on the contrary they disclaim it and call upon the court to make the property respond to their claim, be tbe owner whoever he may. They allege no title in themselves, but'a right to possess and retain the branch road until compensation is made for the money, work and labor and materials expended by them in its repair, erection and imparting an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Value to the road, and call upon a court of equity to enforce that right to compensation by preventing the defendants from using or molesting- or interfering with said road until they are paid; and this right founded in natural justice, to-wit: to be compensated for their work and labor shall be satisfied by those to whom benefit has accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"487\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">The answers exhibit the necessity for the exercise of the power of the chancellor to prevent defendants from not only using the road and depriving complainants of the right of retention until compensation is made, but to prevent them from completing a contract in violation of the law of the land, and the rights of complainants and in fraud of their equitable lien or right to compensation out of the product of their labor to which only they can look for compensation, owing to the insolvency of the Pen. &amp; Ga.

Spratt and Daniel Callahan, asking, among other things, that the Chancellor would grant an injunction to restrain the defendants, the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. R. R. Co. and the A. &amp; G. R\u00a1 R. Co., from running locomotives and cars over the branch road from Live Oak Station to the Georgia and Florida boundary line, or any part thereof, or committing waste thereon, or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>any way or manner using the said branch road from Live Oak Station to the Georgia and Florida boundary line, until the further order of the court. The complainants also pray an account maybe taken of the amount due them for work and labor and materials,, and that the court would decree a sale of the said branch road to satisfy their claim and demand, when ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u25a0 There is also a prayer for such further or other relief as the nature and circumstances of the case may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The material statements in the bill necessary now to b\u00a9 considered are:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> That the said branch road from Live Oak Station, in Monday to- the Georgia boundary lmer was placed in the1 possession of the complainants by the- military authorities of the .Confederate States for the purpose \u00a9f altering,, improving and repairing the same, under am agreement between the Pensacola <em>&amp; </em>Georgia Eailroad Company and the Confederate States,</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">This statement is denied by the answer of the P. &amp; G.

B. B. Co., one of the defendants, under a contract between the P. <em>&amp; </em>G, B, B. Co. and the Confederate States.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">This allegation is denied in the answer of the P. &amp; G. B'\u201e B. Co., one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> That the complainants entered into the possession of said road under their contract with the Confederate States,, and performed certain work and supplied materials to the amount of $37,379.60..</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>To this allegation of complainants the- .defendants say \u201c they know nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><bracketnum>4.</bracketnum> The bill further states, that the complainants have a lien on each and every portion of said branch road for the payment of said sum of $37,379 60-100, and that the said lien has never been lost or surrendered by complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">This lien is denied in the answers of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\"><bracketnum>5.</bracketnum> That the P. &amp; G. R. R. Co., without the consent of, and in violation of the rights and lien of complainants, took possession of said branch road and refused to pay the claim of complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">To this allegation the defendants reply, denying that they took possession of said road, but that the same was turned over to them by the military, authorities of the United States, after-the close of the late civil war, and that the United States took possession of it as captured and abandoned property.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\"><bracketnum>6.</bracketnum> That since the P. &amp; G.

Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">' There ar\u00e9 many other statements and allegations in the bill, which at this time and for the purpose of deciding the questions properly raised, it is unnecessary to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The argument at bar took a wide range, embracing questions proper to be considered on a final hearing, and was characterized, both for complainants and defendants, by marked ability and learning. If the case was before us on final hearing, we should feel it our duty to consider and decide all the points raised by the bill and answer and argued at bar. In the present condition of' the case, the record presents an appeal from an interlocutory order of the court below from granting an injunction, and to the propriety of granting an injunction we shall chiefly direct our inquiries, leaving other questions to be settled when they properly arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The object and purpose of an injunctionis to preserve and keep things in the same state or condition, and to restrain an act, which if done, would be contrary to equity and goad conscience ; and it is the appropriate relief when the remedy at law is subsequent to the injury, and the effectp cannot be \u2022adequately compensated. Jeremy\u2019s Eq. Juris., 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In order tq support a motion for an injunction, the bill should .set forth a ease of probable right, and a probable danger that the right would be defeated without the interposition of the court. I.t is not enough that a complainant shall allege in his bill that the injury will occur to himself or property, but he must show facts to enable the court to judge jf the injury will be of the character stated, before he will be entitled to the interposition of the court. 1 Randolph, 206; 11 Ela. Rep., 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Ip th.e ca.sg .of the Attorney General vs. New Jersey Rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>road &amp; Transportation Co. the court say, \u201c the injunction is a preventive remedy. It interposes between the complainant and the injury he fears or seeks to avoid. If the injury be already done, the writ can have no operation, for it cannot be applied correctively so as to remove it.\u201d 2 Green\u2019s New Jersey Rep., 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It is objected on the part of the defendants that the injunction in this case is used correctively and as a punishment ; that the relief granted by the chancellor is inconsistent with the special relief prayed for in the bill, and for this and other reasons the injunction should be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">To this it is replied on behalf the complainants, that if the court shall find that the bill contains no prayer for specific relief, corresponding\u2019 to the relief decreed, yet under the prayer for general relief the court may grant any other relief, though inconsistent to the relief specially asked, provided it be agreeable to the case made by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Many authorities have been cited for and against the positions assumed, but we shall only refer to a few of the leading ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In the case of English vs. Eoxhall, the Supreme Court of the IJ. States held, <em>t( </em>that under a general prayer for relief, only relief consistent with the case made in the bill can be granted. The same court decided the same point in the case of Hobson vs. McArthur, and the citati\u00f3ns from Story\u2019s Eq. are to the same effect. 2 Peter\u2019s Sup. Ct. Rep., 223; 8 Cond. Rep. Sup. Ct., 229; 16 Peter\u2019s Sup. Ct. Rep., 195; Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., \u00a740, 41, 42, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">On examination it will be found that these authorities do not decide the question raised in this case; they decide that under the prayer for general relief, such relief may be afforded as is consistent with the case made in the bill, thong]\u00bb not specially prayed for; but they do not decide that relief may be granted inconsistent with the relief specially asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">In the case of Hiern vs. Mill, decided by Lord Chancellor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Erskine, lie said: <em>\u201c </em>If the bill contains charges, putting facts in issue that are material, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which those facts will sustain under the general prayer; but he cannot desert specific relief prayed and under the general prayer ask specific relief of another description, unless the facts and circumstances charged by the bill will, consistently with the rules of the court, maintain that relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">It is important to ascertain what were the rales of the English Courts of Chancery on this subject, in order rightly to understand the import \u2019 of this ruling of the Chancellor. Formerly the chancellors prescribed rules governing the practice of that court in all matters, even to the manner in which bills should be framed ; and this was so up to the 15 and 16 Tide., ch. 86, sec. 10, when Parliament passed an act to amend the practice of the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The length of a bill, with its charging part, and its pretences, was found to be inconvenient and unnecessary, and this act was passed in order to render the practice simple and easy in the preparation of bills and answers. \u201c This statutory direction, says Mr. Daniel, does not alter the rules in force previously. That rule was, that when the prayer did not extend to embrace all the relief to which the plaintiff might at the hearing show a right, the defect in the relief might be supplied under the general prayer, provided that such relief waa consistent with that specifically prayed, as well as with the case made by the bill, for the court would not suffer a defendant to be taken by surprise, and permit a plaintiff to neglect and pass over the prayer he had made, and take another decree, even though it were according to the case made by his bill.\u201d Daniel\u2019s Ch. PI. and Prac., 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">From this it will be seen that when Lord Chancellor Erskine said, \u201cthat the plaintiff cannot desert specific relief prayed and, under the general prayer, ask specific relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>of another description, unless the1 facts and circumstances charged by the bill will, consistently with the rules of the court, maintain the relief,\u201d he must be understood as declaring that the rules of the court would not allow the plaintiff to ask specific relief of one kind and get special relief of a different and inconsistent kind from that asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In the case of Butler et al. vs. Durham, it was held by the Supreme Court of Georgia \u201c that if there be a prayer for specific relief and also a prayer for general relief, the complainant shall have such other relief, under the general prayer, as is consistent with the case made and the special prayer and no more.\u201d 2 Kelly\u2019s Ga, Rep., 420; R. M. Charlton\u2019s Rep., 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In the case of Stone vs. Anderson and Treadwell vs: Brown, it was held by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire \u201cthat, under the prayer for general relief, the plaintiff may have such relief as he is entitled to, without regard to any defect in the prayer for special relief, provided it does not conflict with that specially prayed for.\u201d 6 Foster\u2019s Rep., 506; 44 New Hamp. Rep., 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The court, under the general prayer\u2019 for relief, will grant such relief only as the case stated in the bill and sustained by the proofs will justify. The frame and straeture of the bill in this case is for an injunction to restrain the defendants from running, using or removing locomotives and cars over the road or any part thereof, or committing waste thereon, or in any way, manner\u2019 or form using the said road, to the detriment in value of the same, by wearing out the same ; and for an account of the indebtedness of the plaintiffs to the defendants, and for a sale of the road to satisfy the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">There is nothing in this bill looking to the impounding the revenues of the road, and requiring its officers to make monthly returns of its earnings and expenditures to the court. No such decree was either necessary or proper to preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the property so that it might be forthcoming to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 lien when asserted.. If the facts would justify a prayer or decree for any such relief, the bill should liaw been framed with that Adew. This bill is not so framed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The relief granted by the Chancellor is not the special relief asked for by the complainants, and if the decree made in this case is to be sustained, it must be under the general prayer for relief in the close of the bill. As to the relief to be given under a general prayer, we have seen the rule to be, that it must be agreeable to the case made by the bill, and not inconsistent with the relief specifically prayed for. Chalmers vs. Chambers, decided by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, 6 Harris <em>&amp; </em>Johnson\u2019s Rep., 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In this case the relief asked is for an injunction to restrain the defendants from running, using or removing locomotives and ears over the road, or any part thereof, or in any manner using the said road, and also for an account and sale of the road, to satisfy the debt and claim of the <em>complainants; </em>and a general prayer for such relief as to the court should seem meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The relief granted by the decree of the Chancellor is, <em>\u201c </em>that the defendants be enjoined from executing or in any wise carrying into effect the agreement entered into between the President of the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. E. E. Co. and the President of the A. <em>&amp; G. </em>E. E. Co., relative to the sale or lease of said branch road, and that the A. &amp; G-. E. E. Co\u00a1 be enjoined from paying over to the P. &amp; G. E. E. Co, any sums of money growing out of the consideration upon which the aforesaid agreement, contract, or attempted sale or lease ivas madej</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">2d. That the A. &amp; G. E. E. Co. be enjoined, until the further order of the court, from disposing in any manner whatsoever of any of the incomes and earnings of said branch road, except in the payment of the necessary repairs and the necessary expenses of running and operating said road.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>3d. That the defendant, the <em>A. &amp; </em>G. R. R. Co., do make to this court a monthly report showing the gross amounts of its receipts from the said, branch road, extending from Livo Ohk Station \u2022 to the Georgia boundary line, and also the amount expanded for repairs and the expenses of operating said road.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">4th. \u201c The same order as the above, against the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. E\u00bb E. Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">5th. <em>\u201c </em>That the defendants do appear before tlio Chancellor, at his Chambers at Lake City, on Friday, the 15th day of May, 1867, to show cause, if any they have, why a Eeceiver shall not be ap]3ointed in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\"><em>We </em>are now called upon to decide if the relief granted is agreeable to the case made by the bill, and not inconsistent with that specifically asked. The statement of the special prayer for relief and the relief granted answers the question,for it would be difficult to conceive anything in Chancery proceedings more inconsistent than the prayer for specific relief in this case, and the decree rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The complainants ask that the defendants be l'estrained from running their cars and locomotives over the road to its injury and their detriment: The decree responds to this prayer of the complainants by permitting the defendants the free use of the road, but impounds the revenues arising from its use. The relief asked for is refused, but something else, wholly inconsistent, and to the great injury of the defendants, is granted. Was there any obstruction to the court\u2019s granting the particular relief prayed ? If not, the plaintiffs could not abandon that asked and take a different decre\u00e9 under the general prayer. Allen vs. Coffman, 1 Bibb R., 469; Thompson vs. Smithson, 7 Peters\u2019 Rep., 144; Read vs. Cramer, 1 Green. Ch. Rep., 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">In this case we can see no obstruction to the granting by the Chancellor the particular relief asked, if it was proper to issue an injunction at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The complainants charge in their bill the insolvency of the defendant, (P. <em>&amp; </em>G. R. R. Co.,) and on the argument this was urged as a good ground for issuing the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The insolvency of the debtor is never a sufficient reason of itself for the exercise of the extraordinary power of the court by way of injunction, and courts have never acted upon the suggestion of insolvency in the debtor unless there was some other equitable ground for its interposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The case of Yonge &amp; Bryan vs. McCormick, cited from 6 Fla. Rep., 370, is not in opposition to this recognized principle of equity. In that case the facts were as follows ; The complainants had purchased from the defendant a tract of land, had paid a part of the purchase money and given their notes for the balance. The title to a part of the land was found to- be in the wife of the- defendant and not in himself. The bill was filed to restrain the defendant from collecting the balance of the purchase money for which the- notes had been given, and it sets forth the failure of consideration because of the defect of defendant\u2019s title to the land, and also the insolvency of the defendant. Baltzell, Ch. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says: <em>\u201c </em>The. defectiveness of the title to a part of the property, and the inability of defendant, through insolvency, to compensate the deficiency, are the grounds of equity set. forth by complainants, and are sufficient of themselves to entitle them to the injurietion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">It will be seen, from an examination of this case, that the court do not place their decision on the ground of the insolvency of the vendor, but upon that of a failure of consideration and the insolvency of the vendor combined; and that it would be inequitable to allow the vendor to recover from his debtor a sum of money for property to which he had no title, and which, if paid, he, <em>ex cequo ei </em>bono, ought to refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>It is urged in argument that the injunction was properly Issued to restrain the defendants from committing waste by Injury to or destruction of tfee property. To authorize the Interposition of the court on this ground, the bill must set forth such a statement of facts as will warrant the exercise of this extraordinary power. To do this, it must appear to \u00abthe satisfaction of the court that unless its aid is given irreparable injury would be done to the complainants, and these facts must appear in the bill to enable the court to judge if the injury will be of the character charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In the present case the answer of one of the defendants (the A. <em>&amp; </em>G. R. R. Co.,) alleges that the value of the road has been greatly enhanced by the expenditure of large sums of money in improvements and repairs, and the court must be presumed to know that railroads, over which passengers .and freights are dally transported, do not usually fall into decay, and .are not liable to that irreparable injury from waste, whieh alone will authorize the granting an injunction to stay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In the case of Thebaut <em>&amp; </em>Glazier vs. Canova et als., decided by this court at the last term, it is laid down that courts with great reluctance interfere with the free use and enjoyment of property by its owner, as his taste or his inclination may direct; and it is only in a case where it is clearly made out that this use and enjoyment is prejudicial and injurious to the rights of others, that it will lend its aid to restrain and abridge this free enjoyment. They should ponder long and consider well, when their aid is invoked for this purpose, before they act.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The complainants claim that they have a lien on the road for the work done and the materials furnished'; that it is an equitable lien, and they are therefore entitled to the injunction granted. The existence of a lien will, it is true, authorize their going into a Court of Equity to enforce it, and will give to the court 'jurisdiction, but it does sot follow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>because they may have a lien for the security of the ultimate payment of their claim, that they are therefore entitled to an injunction to restrain the defendants in the free use and enjoyment of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">If it was made clearly to appear to the court that the complainants had an unquestioned lien on the road for the payment of their demand, yet before they would entitle themselves to the interposition of the court, by way of an injunction, they must allege and show that the use of the' road by the defendants would in all probability tend to its injury or destruction to an extent that would impair its value as a security for their demand, and peril its ultimate payment, when their lien shall come to be enforced in the courts by decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The facts contained in the record do not warrant the court ip coming to the conclusion that such would be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The road is within the jurisdiction of the court and cannot be removed. The answer of the A. &amp; G. R. R. Co., one of the defendants, alleges, .that by the\u201elarge sums of money expended and. laid out in repairs and improvements, the value of the road has been doubled, and that it is greatly more than sufficient to respond to the demand of complainants, if it shall be adjudged that they have a lien on it for the payment .of their claim. Whatever lien the complainants may have cannot be lost or impaired by the action of the defendants, unless such action should result in injury to, or destruction of, the property to such a degree as to reduce its value below the amount claimed by the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">No sale or- transfer of the property pending this suit can convey a title that would defeat any lien they may have, and if the defendants were to attempt to impair its value by any act of waste or wanton destruction of the subject matter, to an .extent that would render inadequate the complainants\u2019 security, it would be their right to apply for and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>receive the aid of a court of equity to restrain the defendants until they could assert their claim by a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">It is urged in argument that there is no equity in the bill, and that the complainants have a plain and adequate remedy at law. In the present condition of the cause, we do not feel called upon to decide the point made by the objection. This is an appeal from an interlocutory order of the chancellor granting the injunction to restrain the defendants from the use of their road. The bill sets up an equitable lien on the part of the complainants, which is denied by the defendants in their answers. From the record we do not clearly see that any such lien exists or is established, yet as it may be in the power of complainants to establish the existence of a lien on their part, the bill will not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">For the reasons herein set forth, we think the injunction in this case was improvidently granted, and that it must be dissolved at the cost of complainants and the case remanded to the Circuit Court of Suwannee Circuit for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"507\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b109-7\">BAKER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"As\">delivered the following opinion :</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">I fully concur in the judgment of the court, and adopt the reasons given for the reversal of the chancellor\u2019s order granting the injunction. I do not, however, concur in the expression op intimation of any opinion on the question of complainants\u2019 lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The case presented by the record being an appeal from an interlocutory order, the judgment rendered settles all the questions properly presented for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">It is true that the counsel on both sides elaborately argued the merits of the case before us, asking a decree under the provisions of the statute authorizing this court, in cases of appeal, to make such <em>\u201c </em>decree as the court below ought rto have given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The question, is here presented : Ought the chancellor t\u00a9 shave given any final decree in this case ? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The complainants were not entitled to a decree on their <em>xx parte </em>testimony, filed for the purpose of securing the writ of injunction, which might possibly be explained or rebutted by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Neither could the bill have been dismissed, unless it failed to set forth any equitable claim. A denial in the answer of all the equities would net be sufficient to sustain such decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">If, therefore, the condition of the ease was such that it did not become the duty of the chancellor to give a decree, this court would .ceriaiflalj exceed its powers in doing so. Taking this view .of the case, I do not consider it proper to express or intimate any opinion on the equitable lien claimed, which might possibly influence the chancellor in his decision or in .any way embarrass this court, should the question hereafter be properly presented for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The following dissenting opinion was delivered by Judge PUTNAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">I am unable to concur in opinion with the majority of the \u2018Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The bill shows that appellees entered upon the portion of road belonging to the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. R. R. Co., lying between the Live Oak station and the line dividing the States of Florida and Georgia in the month of April, ,1864, under a contract made between the Pensacola <em>&amp; </em>Georgia It. It. Co. and the Confederate Government, by which the latter was to put the x\u2019oad-bed over that portion of the line in \u201c fit and proper condition to x\u2019eceive the track,\u201d to place thereon the iron, for which, -as more fully appears by answer of the Pen. &amp; Georgia It. It. Co., the Confederate Government was to have the use during the continuance of the then existing war, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>and at its close was to be paid therefo\u00ae by the Pen. &amp; Ga. E. E. Co. if they could agree upon the value; failing in this, the Confederate Government was to remove the superstructure. The bill also alleges that appellees were placed in possession of said \u201c branch road with the lull knowledge of the P, &amp; G. E. E. Co., and that they have, as professional railroad builders, expended in work and labor by them performed, and in materials by them provided and furnished, the sum of $37,379.60, in improvements upon said branch road, and for which they have not received compensation. The bill also alleges that at the close of the wav appellees were still in possession of said road; that they have never delivered possession thereof to the Confederate Government, but were dispossessed by the military forces of the United States. It also alleges that they have an equitable lien thereon for their compensation; that the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. E. E. Co. has received substantial benefit from their said improvements, and have paid nothing for them, and are insolvent, having no other property out of which satisfaction for their demand can be made; and it further alleges that said company has disposed, or is about disposing of said branch road to the Atlantic &amp; Gulf E. E. Co., a foreign corporation, for the purpose of defeating their lien, and prays- account, discovery, injunction and relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The. answer of the Pen. &amp; Ga. E. E. Co. does not deny any of the material allegations of the bill, except notice, but sets up an alleged violation of the agreement on the part of the Confederate Government, and claims that the improvements were made by appellees for the Confederate Government and not for defendants. There is no pretence that the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. E. E. Co. ever gave any notice to complainants of the breach aforesaid, or at any time notified them that the P. <em>&amp; </em>G. E. E. Co. would not pay for their repairs and improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>. The answer also claims that this defendant was placed in possession of this portion of their road by the military forces of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The A. &amp; G. B. B. Co. set up in their answer the illegality of the contract under which the repairs and improvements were made, and alleges that it is a purchase for valuable consideration without notice, and sets out an agreement under which it claims and admits it is a [foreign, corporation. The bill alleges that the A. <em>&amp; </em>G. B. B. Co. had notice both of the repairs and iiftprovements, and of their lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In applying certain recognized principles of equity jurisprudence to the case, as thus presented by the record, the first question for consideration is, have appellees made a case which entitles them to an equitable lien for compensation? Second, the propriety, under the showing, of granting the injunction? Mr. Justice Story, in his excellent treatise on equity jurisprudence, sec. 1217, says: \u201cthere are Mens recognized in equity, whose existence is not known, or obligation enforced at law, and in respect to which courts of equity exercise a very large and salutary jurisdiction.\u201d Again, in sec. 1236, \u201c the doctrine of contribution in equity is larger than at law,' and -in many cases repairs and improvements will be held to be, not merely a personal charge, but a lien upon the estate itself.\u201d In section 1237, the same author says: \u201c Courts of equity: have not confined the doctrine of compensation, or lien, for repairs and improvements, to cases of agreement or joint purchasers, but have extended it to other cases, where the party making the repairs and improvements has acted <em>bona fide </em>and innocently, and there has been a substantial benefit conferx-ed on the owner, so that <em>excequo et </em>bono, he ought to pay for such benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Yiewing this case in the light. of the doctrine above laid down, the conclusioix is irresistible, that the appellees ar\u00e9 entitled to their equitable liexx for compensation as agaixxst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the P. &amp; Gf. E. E. Co. The company has been subs tarn tially benefited by the repairs and improvements placed upon its road by complainants, and for which they have paid nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The answer of this defendant shows that the company had knowledge of the improvements being made, for it alleges a protest made :to the agent of the Confederate Government for an alleged violation of contract, yet the company gave no notice to complainants, nor did it forewarn them against proceeding with their work, but stood by and suffered the improvements to be made upon their property, whereby it is greatly enhanced in value. To permit the company thus to enrich itself at the expense of complainants, would be contrary to every principle of equity and justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The contract set up by the P. &amp; Ga. E. E. Co. in their answer with the Confederate authorities under which these repairs and improvements were made by complainants, so far Implicates this defendant as privy thereto, as to attach the equities of complainants and to entitle them to an enforcement of their lien for compensation .out of the property in the hands of the P. &amp;. G. E. E. Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Nor can I perceive that the answer of the defendants in any particular entitles them to any modification of these equitable doctrines in their application to this case. The Well settled principle, delido, estops them from making it available for their relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The agreement set up Was for repairs and improvements to be placed upon the property of one of the parties, the P-. <em>\u2019&amp; </em>G. E. E. Co., to be compensated in part by use and enjoyment, the balance upon tbe happening of an event in money, by the owner, the P. &amp; G. E. E. Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">In the case of Woodward vs. Lively, 36 Pennsylvania State Eeports, 437, cited at bar, it Was held by the court 'that \u201c although, in one aspect an improvement lease, \u00f1\u00e9v<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ertheless, as to <em>meoTicvmas and material men, </em>to- be a contract for the erection of the buildings, payable partly in money and partly out of the profits ot the land, and the estate of the lessor is bound by the lien.\u201d Here the lien was held to attach to the estate which had been enhanced in value by the improvements placed thereon, and I am unable to perceive any distinction in the cases which should change the rule there laid down in its application to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Whether the- defence set up by the A. <em>&amp; </em>Gr. R. R. Co. can avail to relieve the property in their hands from the operation of the lien, is a question more properly to be considered on the final hearing of the cause. Without expressing an opinion as to the validity of the contract between the two defendants touching the sale or lease of the road, it is sufficient that the bill, answers and exhibits disclose such a state of facts as eminently to justify the chancellor in the court below in his action in holding the questions presented for further consideration when the case should be submitted upon the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Having thus disposed of the question of lien, it only remains to inquire whether, agreeably to the case made by the record,, the chancellor in the court below erred in gi\u2019anting the ox-der from which an appeal has brought the case before this COUX\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">This court, in the case of the city of Apalachicola vs. the Apalachicola Land Co., 9 Florida Reports, authorizes the chancellor*, on a xnotion for an injunction, to go into the consideration of the merits as disclosed in the bill and which are intrinsic and dependent upon its express allegations and chai\u2019ges.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In the spirit of this decision, in a case where the answers of the defendants are filed, it would be the duty of the chancellor*, fox* the same purpose and to the same extent, to consider the merits of tJxe case as presented by the entire record. <em>?.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The case made by the bill, upon which the correctness of the action of the court below is to be tested, may be briefly stated as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">1. The bill alleges permanent repairs and improvements upon the property of one of the defendants, with notice, and without objection, by which that defendant has been essentially benefitted, and for which complainants have received no compensation, and asserts an equitable lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">2. It alleges the pendency of a suit at law for the recovery of the demand; that the P. &amp; G. P. P. Co. is insolvent and has no other property than that by complainants improved, out of which compensation can be had, and that unless their lien is enforced upon that specific property, they are without remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">8. It alleges an attempted disposition of the property to the other defendant, the A. <em>\u25a0&amp; </em>G. P. P. Co., a corporation having its existence without the jurisdiction of this court,' with notice of the existence of lien, for the purpose of defeating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">4. That complainants are professional railroad contractors; that the repairs and improvements are of a character requiring mechanical experience and skill in their construction, and that they have never been legally dispossessed of their work upon said road.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The answer of the P. &amp; G. P. P. Co. does not deny any of the material allegations of the bill, except the existence of the lien, and notice of the performance of the work by complainants, but sets up a breach of contract on the part of the Confederate Government, yet does not bring home to complainants notice of the alleged breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The answer of the A. <em>&amp; </em>G. P. P. Co. sets up illegality of the contract, denies notice of the lien, and alleges that they are purchasers without notice and consideration paid, and makes exhibit of the contract under which they claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">On application for injunction after answer, the court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>look only to the facts that are responsive to the bill and will presume against defendant w\u2019hen he has not answered what he ought to have answered, and will disregard new equities set up to avoid those set up by the bill. The P. <em>&amp; </em>G. <em>R. </em>R. Co. does not deny the insolvency charged, nor that the repairs and improvements were made by complainants, nor that they had disposed of the property in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Insolvency has been held by this court a sufficient ground for granting an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Willard on Injunctions says, page 22, that an injunction may be granted where the defendants, against whom there is otherwise a good remedy at law, is insolvent or about to abscond. On page 100, the same author declares, \u201cthat it is not error to refuse to dissolve an injunction where the <em>insolvency </em>of a party, on whom the equity of the case largely depends, is charged positively upon knowledge and belief in the bill and positively denied in the answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">While the court will abstain from committing itself to points or questions which will arise on the final hearing, it will examine into them sufficiently to enable it to determine whether the injunction should be granted or refused. The court will then balance the facts as alleged by the respective parties to enable it to come to a correct conclusion. In doing this, if complainants have made a case showing a <em>probaable </em>dcmgev, the right may be defeated and an injunction may be granted. Read et al. vs. Dews et al., R. M. Charlton\u2019s Repts., 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The present cas\u00e9is much stronger. As against the P. &amp; G, R. R. Co. there can be no question as to the propriety of the action of the court below in granting the injunction ; and in the .case .of the other defendant, the A. G. R. R. Co., it is equally clear to my mind that the facts justify the action of the .chancellor. I.t is a non-resident corporation, in possession of the property, using it to the detriment of complainants, holding by at least a questionable claim and withdrawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the earnings of the road from the jurisdiction of the court. The granting and continuing an injunction rests in the discretion of the court, to be governed by the nature of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The order in this case is not inconsistent with the ease made by the record; and it seems carefully to guard the rights of all parties, with little or no hardship or injury to either. Nor do I perceive anything in the frame of the bill inconsistent with the rules of pleading or rendering it liable to the exception urged by appellants. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the injunction granted by the chancellor should not be dissolved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
