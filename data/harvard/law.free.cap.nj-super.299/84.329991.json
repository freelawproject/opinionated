Note 4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">In the A-l, A-2, A-3 and AG zone[s], if the length of the principal building, projected on the front lot line, exceeds 90 feet, the required front, each side, and rear yard requirements shall be increased one foot for each foot the building projection exceeds 90 feet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Robert A. Damurjian (plaintiff) owned a parcel of land in the A-1 zone on which he sought to build a single-family residential dwelling with an attached garage. The defendant contended that the \u201clength\u201d of his proposed dwelling, \u201cas projected on the front lot line, would be approximately 127 feet,\u201d including the garage as attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">In January 1994 plaintiff applied to the Board of Adjustment of the Township of Colts Neck (Board), requesting (1) a determination that the \u201cenhanced setback provisions\u201d in Note 4 did not apply to his property, or (2) a dimensional or bulk variance, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70(c)(2) of the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), from the \u201cenhanced minimum rear yard and side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>yard provisions\u201d of Note 4. The Board denied both his interpretative application and his variance application.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Plaintiff then filed a two-count complaint in lieu of prerogative writ against defendant Colts Neck and the Board. In the second count, plaintiff demanded a judgment declaring Note 4 null and void. On October 19,1995 the judge rendered a decision declaring \u201cArticle Seven, Section 711, Note 4, invalid,\u201d based on his conclusion \u201cthat the method of determining the front lot line projection bears no real and substantial relationship to the stated goals ... for which Article Seven, Section 711, Note 4 was enacted.\u201d On November 18,1995 the judge entered judgment in plaintiffs favor on the second count of his complaint, \u201cinvalidating the provisions of Article 7, Section 711, Note 4.\u201d From this judgment, and only this judgment, defendant appeals. Plaintiff does not appeal from the denial of his variance application.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On appeal defendant primarily contends that the judge erred because Note 4 is a \u201cvalid enactment under the Municipal Land Use Law and the New Jersey and United States Constitutions.\u201d We disagree and affirm. The judge did not fatally criticize either the \u201cconcept of enhanced setback requirements\u201d or the \u201cenhanced setback requirements\u201d embraced in Note 4. Rather, the judge was careful to decide \u201conly that the method of determining the front line projection, which triggers Article 7, Section 711, Note 4, is invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">We agree with the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion. This section of the ordinance is invalid because there are no definitions of terms and no actual method for determining the front lot line projection in Note 4 or anywhere else in the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The ordinance contains no definitions for these terms used in Note 4:(a) \u201clength of the principal building,\u201d (b) \u201cprojected,\u201d (c) \u201cfront lot line,\u201d and (d) \u201cbuilding projection.\u201d Nor does the ordinance describe the method in which the projection should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>determined. Oral argument revealed the critical nature of these elements, especially where the lots are odd-shaped and not rectilinear; the streets are curved; cul-de-sacs exist, and the structures are customized and not uniform in configuration, or canted or angled to the street, or indeed all of the these conditions exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Glenn Gerken, defendant\u2019s township engineer since 1980, testified that Note 4 was first adopted on October 2, 1990. Gerken said that he had \u201cdeveloped the procedure that [he] utilize[d]\u201d to determine \u201cwhether the provisions of Note 4 apply to a particular property and a particular dwelling.\u201d Gerken testified that this procedure was not \u201cset forth in Note 4\u201d and that, while his procedure was the \u201conly procedure [he] use[d]\u201d to decide Note 4 questions submitted to him, he did not know if anybody else who reviewed Note 4 questions used a \u201cdifferent technique\u201d to determine \u201cwhether Note 4 applies or does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Gerken said that the multi-step procedure he had developed was primarily based on \u201ccommon sense,\u201d and had been developed over time by \u201ctrial and error.\u201d Gerken was then asked to explain his procedure. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">Q: What\u2019s the first step that you would do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">A: All right. What we would do is take the side lot lines and extend them out so they intersect at the street line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">A: Now I realize street line is not defined in the ordinance. But I consider the lot line along the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">Q: Okay. So ... that in your way of thinking, the front lot line is the street line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-13\">A: No question about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">ijs # is H* # * H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-15\">THE COURT: \"What\u2019s the next step you do? After you get to the front line, what\u2019s the next step that you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-17\">THE WITNESS: You take a straight line and connect it from the two points of intersection along the street line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-18\">BY MS. HEFFERNAN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-19\">Q: What\u2019s your third step?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>A: Third step is we establish ... perpendicular line[s] created in step two, just like a pair of dividers, and we moved those lines till it touches the two extreme portions of the lot [sic; house] which projects towards the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">Q: And your fourth step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">A: Measure the distance along the line created in step two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">Q: And what does that give you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">A: Projected length.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">THE COURT: Projected length of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">THE WITNESS: Correct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">The judge then asked Gerken to explain the rationale behind his measuring procedure, and Gerken explained that the \u201crationale is what does somebody who is going along that street see of that house from the street.\u201d Gerken also explained that, by projected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>length of the house, he meant the length between the \u201cmost extreme limits of the house\u201d as projected \u201calong the street line.\u201d Finally, Gerken explained that he took the \u201cstraight line distance rather than a curve or linear distance along the street\u201d in order to give the \u201cbenefit of the doubt to the applicant in every ease\u201d because, otherwise, \u201cyou\u2019d always end up with a much longer distance.\u201d According to Gerken, the primary purpose of Note 4 was \u201caesthetics.\u201d The objective of Note 4 was to ascertain \u201chow much [of the house] is facing the street line\u201d from the visual perspective of \u201csomebody who is going along that street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">William Queale, Jr., a professional planner, also testified on defendant\u2019s behalf. Queale expressed that the principal purpose of Note 4 was to reduce the \u201cperception of overcrowding\u201d by reducing the \u201cperception of a wider building\u201d as viewed from the street line. In other words, the \u201cmajor thrust\u201d of Note 4 was to reduce the \u201cvisual impact that a wider house might have versus a [more] narrow house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Richard DiFolco, an engineer and planner, testified on plaintiffs behalf. DiFolco thought that Note 4 was \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cnot clear,\u201d because in Note 4 \u201c[t]here is not [a] sufficient or a developed standard way of measuring the length or defining things such as the projection, which way you measure a projection, in order to come up with a uniform answer all of the time.\u201d Because under Note 4 the \u201cactual length\u201d of the house did not necessarily equate with the \u201cprojected length\u201d of the house \u201cas it\u2019s measured at the street line,\u201d DiFolco also said that \u201cinvocation of the enhanced setback requirements\u201d of Note 4 was, in some cases, \u201cdependent on something in addition to the [actual] length of the house,\u201d namely, on the \u201cangle the house makes with the property line at the street.\u201d As DiFolco explained, solely by changing the angle of the house in relation to the front lot line, a house that was less than ninety feet in actual length could be rotated to project more than ninety feet on the front lot line, and a house that was more than ninety feet in actual length could be rotated to project less than ninety feet on the front lot line. Thus while neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>footprint size nor the height of the house would change, such maneuvering would trigger the enhanced setback requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">On cross-examination, Queale acknowledged the accuracy of this proposition. However, because the primary purpose of Note 4 was to improve the \u201cvisual environment\u201d by reducing the \u201cvisual impact that a wider house might have versus a [more] narrow house,\u201d Queale saw no legal relevance to this fact. In other words, Note 4 was not concerned with the angle of the house to the street per se, but rather with the perceived length of the house \u201cwhen projected onto the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">While the judge noted that \u201cthe purpose of Article Seven, Section 711, N\u00f3te 4 was to maximize the appearance of open spaces,\u201d he concluded that \u201cthe method of determining the front lot line projection bears no real and substantial relationship to the stated goals ... for which Article Seven, Section 711, Note 4 was enacted.\u201d Therefore, he held \u201conly that the method of determining the front lot line projection, which triggers Article 7, Section 711, Note 4, is invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The judge explained his holding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">Cross-examination of Mr. Queale explains the court\u2019s determination, keeping in mind the stated goal of the enhanced setback requirements. On cross-examination, Mr. Queale testified that a dwelling with a length of 90 feet, when parallel to the street, would have a projected length of 90 feet. If, however, you rotate the same dwelling a few degrees, the dwelling will have a projected length in excess of 90 feet. The structure has exactly the same dimensions, and the amount of unused land remains the same; however, the enhanced setbacks would be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">Assuming one proposed a building with an actual length of less than 90 feet, by merely rotating the building, this same structure would <em>trigger </em>the enhanced setback requirements, even though the structures are identical, and the open spaces surrounding these structures are identical. Accordingly, the method used to determine the projected front line bears no real and substantial relationship to the desire for open spaces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">*$$***$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-12\">As noted above, merely rotating a structure alters the front line projection. Accordingly, there appears to be no real and substantial nexus between the front line projection and the amount of open space upon a piece of property. This conclusion is supported by the testimony adduced at trial. This finding does not invalidate the concept of enhanced setback requirements. What it requires is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>method of determining the front line projection that bears a real and substantial relationship to the amount of open space present, and to the actual length of the building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">A zoning ordinance enjoys a presumption of validity. The party attacking the ordinance bears the burden of overcoming this presumption. <em>Riggs v. Long Beach Tp., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>601, 610-11, 538 A.2d 808 (1988). To be valid, the ordinance \u201cmust advance one of the purposes of the Municipal Land Use Law as set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 538 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Two purposes of the MLUL set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-2 are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">c. To provide adequate light, air and open space;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">i. To promote a desirable visual environment through creative development techniques and good civic design and arrangement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">For this reason, <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-65(b) specifically states, in material part, that a zoning ordinance may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">Regulate the bulk, height, number of stories, orientation, and size of buildings and the other structures; lot sizes and dimensions; and for these purposes may specify floor area ratios and other ratios and regulatory techniques governing the intensity of land use and the provision of adequate light and air____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">A zoning ordinance may \u201caccommodate aesthetic concerns,\u201d and the \u201c[c]oncern with aesthetics\u201d is subsumed within the purposes enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2(e) and \u20142(i). <em>State v. Miller, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>402, 409-10, 416 A.2d 821 (1980). The \u201cconsideration of aesthetics\u201d in municipal land use law and planning is frequently termed \u201caesthetic zoning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409-11, 416 A.2d 821. The Supreme Court has observed that \u201caesthetic qualities are best maintained through the use, <em>inter alia, </em>of lot size, setbacks, side yards, lot coverage ratios, topographical and landscaping requirements.\u201d <em>Home Builders League of South Jersey, Inc. v. Berlin Tp., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>127, 145-46, 405 A.2d 381 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">While \u201caesthetics is certainly a legitimate aim of zoning,\u201d it is an aim that \u201cmust be accomplished within clearly defined limits.\u201d This is not always easy because the \u201cquestion of aesthet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ics is both abstract and subjective.\u201d <em>Diller &amp; Fisher Co. v. Architectural Review Bd. of Bor. of Stone Harbor, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 371-73, 587 A.2d 674 (Law Div.1990). Because of this, legislative attempts to \u201cquantify\u201d the concept of aesthetics and to establish \u201cstandards\u201d can be, at best, \u201cirksome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373; 587 A.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">A court must decide not only whether a proper legislative goal is sought by the zoning ordinance, but also whether that goal is \u201cachieved in a manner reasonably related to that goal.\u201d The means used to attain the legislative end must be reasonably related to it. <em>Home Builders League, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 138-39, 405 A.2d 381. The ordinance \u201cmust comport with constitutional constraints on fhe zoning power, including those pertaining to due process.\u201d <em>Riggs, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 611, 538 A.2d 808. In determining the validity of a zoning ordinance, the question is not whether the ordinance will accomplish its goal in every circumstance, but whether there are conceivable circumstances under which it will accomplish its goal. <em>Zilinsky v. Zoning Bd. of Adj. of Verona, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>363, 368, 521 A.2d 841 (1987). If the rational relationship between the means chosen to achieve the legitimate zoning purpose is \u201cat least debatable,\u201d the ordinance must be sustained. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 521 A.2d 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">After correctly noting that \u201cthe purpose of Article Seven, Section 711, Note 4 was to maximize the appearance of open spaces,\u201d the judge invalidated the \u201cmethod of determining the front lot line projection,\u201d because it bore no real and substantial relationship \u201cto the <em>amount </em>of open space present, and to the <em>actual </em>length of the building.\u201d We disagree to an extent with the judge\u2019s reasoning. Because the purpose of Note 4 is to maximize the appearance of open space around a budding, Note 4 is not concerned with the amount of actual open space around the building or with the actual length of the building. The budding itself does not change size and wdl always conform to the maximum lot coverage requirement. Note 4 is only concerned with the perceived length of the budding as \u201cprojected on the front lot line.\u201d If the \u201cbudding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>projection\u201d on the front lot line \u201cexceeds 90 feet,\u201d the enhanced setback requirements of Note 4 are triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The judge also observed that \u201cthere appears to be no real and substantial nexus between the front lot line projection and the amount of open space upon a piece of property.\u201d This is true, but not particularly relevant because the purpose of Note 4 is to \u201cmaximize the appearance of open spaces,\u201d especially from the street, of developed property, not to increase \u201cthe amount of open space upon a piece of property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The judge concluded \u201conly that the method of determining the front lot line projection, which triggers Article 7, Section 711, Note 4, is invalid,\u201d because it bore no real and substantial relationship \u201cto the desire for open spaces,\u201d or \u201cto the amount of open space present, and to the actual length of the building.\u201d Again, this proposition is basically true, but not particularly relevant because the purpose of Note 4 is only to maximize the appearance of open spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The judge was correct in his ultimate conclusion that the \u201cmethod of determining the front line projection\u201d is invalid. Note 4 is invalid because it is \u201cimpermissibly vague and ambiguous.\u201d Note 4 itself \u201cprovides no definitions, standards or criteria for calculating a \u2018projection\u2019 on a \u2018front lot line\u2019.\u201d The balance of the ordinance is no more helpful in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">A zoning ordinance must meet the \u201ctest of certainty and definiteness.\u201d <em>Morristown Road Associates v. Mayor and Common Council and Planning Bd. of Borough of Bernardsville, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 67, 394 A.2d 157 (Law Div.1978). If the ordinance fails this test, it must be \u201cinvalidated as impermissibly vague and indefinite.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 394 A.2d 157. <em>See J.D. Construction Corp. v. Board of Adj. of Freehold Tp., </em>119 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 149-50, 290 A.2d 452 (Law Div.1972) (\u201czoning ordinance must be clear and explicit in its terms, setting forth adequate standards to prevent arbitrary and indiscriminate interpretation and application by local officials\u201d; zoning ordinance must be invalidated if \u201crequirement[s.l <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of clear terms and adequate standards\u201d not met). <em>See also Lionshead Woods Corp. v. Kaplan Brothers, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>545, 548-51, 595 A.2d 568 (Law Div.1991) (\u201claw is well settled that a zoning ordinance must be clear and explicit in its terms, setting forth sufficient standards to prevent arbitrary and indiscriminate interpretation or application by local officials\u201d). In <em>Lionshead Woods </em>the ordinance \u201cdid not specify\u201d the procedure to be used in determining the number of permitted midrise units and allowed local zoning officials to \u201cindiscriminately\u201d devise their own procedure. The ordinance was held \u201cimpermissibly vague because it lacks clear standards to guide either an applicant for development or the local officials who must administer it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Lack of definition and standards for application is the basic problem with Note 4. As noted, the zoning ordinance does not define any of the material terms used in Note 4:(a) \u201clength of the principal building,\u201d (b) \u201cprojected,\u201d (c) \u201cfront lot line,\u201d and (d) \u201cbuilding projection.\u201d No objective and precise method for determining the front lot line projection is set out in Note 4, or anywhere else in the ordinance. The method or methods of determination used by defendant\u2019s local engineer or zoning officials, though presumably in good faith, are simply methods formulated by those officials based on their \u201ccommon sense\u201d and their \u201ctrial and error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Defendant retorts that the \u201cterms contained in the Colts Neck Ordinance ... are completely clear,\u201d because the \u201ccalculations necessary for applying Note 4 are done in consistent fashion by a set procedure\u201d formulated \u201cby the Township Engineer.\u201d This does not render the \u201cprovisions of Note 4\u201d completely clear. Somewhat inconsistently, defendant also contends that there is a \u201cset method\u201d in Note 4, in that there are \u201cexplicit provisions in the ordinance which tells the official how the measurement [on the front lot line] is to be done.\u201d The township engineer, however, testified to the contrary and we find no such provisions in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Because there is <em>no </em>\u201cmethod of determining the front lot line projection\u201d <em>in </em>Note 4, we agree with the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the \u201cmethod of determining the front lot line projection, which triggers Article 7, Section 711, Note 4, is invalid.\u201d We make no suggestion that defendant is forbidden from regulating the perception of an oversized improvement by use of an enhanced front setback requirement. The defendant may rationally require that the longer the building is, as perceived from the street, the deeper the front yard must be. But the ordinance so commanding must be in clear terms, either by precise definition or common understanding, and set forth an objective and uniform method of calculating the setback required. The municipality cannot simply leave the entire process in the hands of its agents, no matter how well intentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">There is nothing improper about municipal concern with aesthetics. \u201cCreation of a desirable visual environment is a zoning purpose specified by N.J.S.A 40:55D-2(i) [\u2018to promote desirable visual environment through creative development techniques and good civic design and arrangements\u2019] and municipalities have ample authority under the MLUL to work toward that purpose.\u201d <em>Cox, New Jersey Zoning &amp; Land Use Administration </em>\u00a7 34-8.6 (1996). But municipalities must do so with reasonable precision and without blanket delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Finally, defendant contends that plaintiff \u201cshould not have been permitted to challenge the constitutionality\u201d of Note 4 \u201csince the challenge was well beyond the statute of limitations\u201d and the judge erred in \u201cholding that the time restriction for bringing an action in lieu of prerogative writs should be relaxed in this case.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Note 4 was adopted on October 2, 1990; plaintiff filed his complaint in lieu of prerogative writs on April 7, 1994, over three years later. However, this action was filed within 45 days of the date the Board\u2019s ruling under Note 4 affecting plaintiffs property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>became final. In general, no action in lieu of prerogative writs \u201cshall be commenced later than 45 days after the accrual of the right to the review, hearing or relief claimed.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:69-6(a). The court may enlarge this time period \u201cwhere it is manifest that the interest of justice so requires.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:69-6(c). The judge here so found, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">Moving briefly to defendant\u2019s contention that this court not reach the constitutional question posed, as such is time barred. <em>Rule </em>4:69 \u2014 6(c) provides for enlargement of the 45 day time period where \u201cit is manifest that the interest of justice so requires.\u201d The within matter requires the time limit to be enlarged, as the issue before this Court affects all properties located within the A-l, A-2, A-3 and AG zones of the township.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>R. </em>4:69-6(c) (formerly <em>R.R. </em>4:88-15(c)) was \u201cmerely an attempt to restate^] in the form of a generalized standard, decisional exceptions which had already been engrafted upon the rule.\u201d <em>Schack v. Trimble, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>40, 48, 145 A.2d 1 (1958). These implicitly included exceptions \u201cincluded cases involving (1) important and novel constitutional questions; (2) informal or <em>ex parte </em>determinations of legal questions by administrative officials; and (3) important public rather than private interests which require adjudication or clarification.\u201d <em>Brunetti v. Borough of New Milford, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>576, 586-87, 350 A.2d 19 (1975). <em>Accord Reilly v. Brice, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>555, 558, 538 A.2d 362 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Cases decided subsequent to the adoption of paragraph (e) in 1957 \u201cconfirm that consideration of substantial constitutional questions warrants relaxation of the time limits of <em>R. </em>4:69-6 \u2018in the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brunetti, supra, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>at 587, 350 A.2d 19. <em>See Catalano v.

Extend the minimum side yard set back on each side to intersect the front lot line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-19\">2. Connect the two intersecting points created by No. 1 above with a straight line and extend beyond the intersection points as needed for No. 3 below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-20\">3. Project at 90\u00b0 angle to the line created in No. 2, a new straight line on each side of the structure and position it so that it touches the outer most portion of the structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-21\">4. Measure at right angles the distance between the two lines created in No. 3 above. THIS IS THE LENGTH OF THE PRINCIPAL BUILDING PROJECTED ON THE FRONT LOT LINE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-22\">The above procedure works well for most situations, even for irregular lots on outer and inner radius: On cul-de-sac lots which wrap around the bulb, where the side setback line never intersects the street lines, some modifications are required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-23\">There are five examples of different lot configurations attached hereto which shows the above procedure.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
