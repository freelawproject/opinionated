We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">Petitioner was injured on July 28, 1994 when he fell from a narrow, eighteen-foot high scaffold in the course of assembling a metal roof on a tractor trailer. Respondent sought to resist petitioner\u2019s claim on the statutory ground that intoxication was the natural and proximate cause of the accident. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7. The judge of compensation concluded that respondent failed to demonstrate that petitioner\u2019s intoxication was the sole cause of the accident and his injuries and entered judgment in favor of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">The relevant facts follow. The scaffold on which petitioner was working consisted of a bridge supported by \u201ctwo sides.\u201d The bridge spanned the tractor trailer as it rested in the assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>area at the workplace, allowing workers to \u201cgo from one side to the other.\u201d The record reflects that the walkway of the bridge was only two feet wide and cluttered with work materials. To position the bridge on the side supports so that a trailer could properly fit in the assembly area, the bridge had to be fastened to a crane which then would move the assembly apparatus. On the day of the accident, petitioner reported to work at 7:00 a.m. after having spent the prior evening and the early morning hours of July 28, 1994 drinking vodka. During that period, petitioner consumed one-half gallon of alcohol. Additionally, on the day of the accident, petitioner drank two beers at his 10:15 a.m. morning break. The accident happened at about 1:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">At the compensation hearing, petitioner testified that he fell from the scaffold while he was attempting to fasten a crane hook to the bridge in order to move the assembly apparatus. Apparently, the bridge was missing an \u201ceye hook\u201d to which the crane could be fastened. Petitioner described the occurrence as follows: I hooked the bridge up to the crane, which didn\u2019t have an eye hook in it, which it should have.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">I went to kick it into place because it wouldn\u2019t set right. And when I kicked it, the crane slid \u2014 the hook on the crane slid and I just fell off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">[Again,] ... I hooked it up to the crane. I took it all the way down. And, like I said, when I kicked it, to get it into place because it had these like ... two ... lips on each side and to get it into place, I had to kick it. When I kicked it, the crane slid and I just ... fell right off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">During the hearing, petitioner\u2019s co-worker testified that the scaffolding area was very unstable, that another individual had previously fallen from the scaffold, and that he was reluctant to even go up on the bridge. In addition, petitioner\u2019s co-workers testified that petitioner had not acted \u201cunusual\u201d on the date of the accident, stating that he \u201clooked and acted normally.\u201d Respondent offered no proof in opposition to that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Respondent grounded its case on the intoxication defense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7. Dr. Richard Saferstein, an expert in forensic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>science and blood alcohol analysis, relying on extrapolation evidence, testified that petitioner\u2019s blood alcohol reading must have been .29% at the time of the fall, and that a person with such a high reading \u201ccould not have properly performed any basic task on [the scaffolding] due to the ... extremely high alcohol intoxication.\u201d Therefore, Dr. Saferstein concluded that petitioner\u2019s intoxication \u201cwas the sole and proximate cause of the accident.\u201d Dr. Saferstein stated, however, that he was primarily concerned with petitioner\u2019s consumption of alcohol, and \u201cnot the details of how the accident occurred,\u201d indicating that \u201c[t]he only thing he could tell ... about the accident itself is that it involved a fall and [that petitioner] was on some sort of ... a fairly narrow surface____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The workers\u2019 compensation judge found that petitioner fell when he \u201cattempted to connect a crane hook to the bridge in order to move the scaffold\u201d; that the \u201ccrane would not set right,\u201d and, therefore, petitioner tried \u201cto kick it into place,\u201d and \u201c[a]s he did so, the crane slid causing petitioner to fall.\u201d Based upon these findings, the judge concluded that the respondent had failed to sustain its burden of proving that petitioner\u2019s intoxication \u201cwas the sole cause of the accident____\u201d In so ruling, the judge commented that although Dr. Saferstein testified that petitioner was intoxicated at the time of the accident, that opinion \u201cdoes not explain how that [intoxication] solely caused the accident, [noting] [t]here was no evidence presented that the petitioner was staggering, falling, unable to keep his balance or any other indicia of an inability to do his job.\u201d Rather, the judge noted that the testimony indicated that petitioner looked and acted \u201cnormal\u201d during the entire period prior to the accident. The judge then concluded that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s description of the events that led to his fall was not contested or contravened in any way.\u201d Accordingly, the judge entered judgment in petitioner\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On appeal, respondent contends that the judge incorrectly evaluated the circumstances of petitioner\u2019s fall, leading to the erroneous conclusion that petitioner\u2019s intoxication was not the sole and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>proximate cause of petitioner\u2019s fall. Next, respondent contends that the judge should have employed a \u201csliding-scale\u201d standard to determine whether the employee\u2019s intoxication was the sole proximate cause of the accident and injury, arguing that when, as here, \u201coverwhelming evidence of intoxication\u201d exists in the record, it alone is sufficient to preclude a finding of other concurrent causes of injury. Finally, respondent contends that the appropriate standard for determining whether an intoxication defense has been established requires \u201ca showing of natural and proximate, ... not sole[ ] cause\u201d of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A, </em>34:15-1 to - 128, is the exclusive remedy afforded an employee injured in the course of employment. <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8. The Act expressly requires an employer to pay compensation to an employee injured or killed as the result of an accident \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d except where intoxication is \u201cthe natural and proximate cause\u201d of the injury or death. <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">New Jersey decisional law interprets section 7 to require an employer to demonstrate \u201cby the greater weight of the evidence that the employee\u2019s injury was produced solely by his intoxication\u201d if the employer is to defeat a compensation award. <em>Olivera v. Hatco Chemical Co., </em>55 <em>N.J.Super. </em>336, 350, 150 A.2d 781 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Kulinka v. Flockhart Foundry Co., </em>9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 505, 75 A.2d 557 (Cty.Ct.1950), <em>aff'd sub nom Bujalski v. Flockhart Foundry Co., </em>16 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 84 A.2d 468 (App.Div.1951), <em>certif. denied, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>505, 86 A.2d 321 (1952)). <em>See White v. Atlantic City Press, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>128, 137 n. 1, 313 A.2d 197 (1973), <em>certif. denied, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>557, 154 A.2d 449 (1959). <em>See generally </em>1A Arthur Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 34.35 (1996). Hence, the employer must exclude other probable, contributory or concurring causes of injury or death. <em>See Bujalski, supra, </em>16 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 250, 84 A.2d 468; <em>Kulinka, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 507, 75 A.2d 557. As was stated in <em>Kulinka, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 505, 75 A.2d 557:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>[T]he employment must supply no more than the setting, the stage, the situation in which the fall occurred; it can be no more than an inactive condition as distinguished from a moving cause. If the hazards or risks which are incidental to the employment concur with the employee\u2019s insobriety in producing the fall or if the hazards or risks contribute efficiently to the production of the fall, compensation cannot be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\"><em>Accord, Anslinger v. Wallace, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 187-88, 305 A.2d 797 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>552, 310 A.2d 467 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">In this case, the judge concluded that the sliding crane contributed to petitioner\u2019s fall. That finding is amply supported by the record, <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965), and was not based on a misapprehension of petitioner\u2019s testimony. Moreover, relying upon the testimony of petitioner\u2019s co-workers that petitioner \u201clooked and acted normal\u201d from 7:00 a.m. until 1:30 p.m., and the evidence that petitioner was able to perform his duties prior to the accident, the judge reasonably determined that the sliding crane, was a concurring cause of the accident. Hence, he rejected respondent\u2019s contention that petitioner\u2019s kicking motion made while he was intoxicated was the sole producing cause of the fall. Notably, petitioner was working in a very narrow, cluttered area eighteen feet in the air on a scaffold which was not secured in any manner and which was missing an \u201ceyehook.\u201d The record amply supports the conclusion that the \u201chazards or risks ... incidental to [his] employment concurred] with [his] insobriety in producing the fall.\u201d <em>Kulinka, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 505, 75 A.2d 557. Accordingly, respondent failed to meet its burden of proving intoxication as <em>the </em>sole cause of petitioner\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We reject respondent\u2019s effort to impose a hard and fast rule that \u201coverwhelming evidence of intoxication,\u201d as reflected by petitioner\u2019s grossly elevated blood alcohol level of .29%, automatically precludes a finding of other concurrent causes underlying an otherwise compensable injury. As we have noted before, \u201c[t]he effect of any given percentage of alcohol to blood in terms of aberration from normal behavior concededly varies in individuals,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Olivera, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 355, 150 A.2d 781 (Conford, J.A.D., concurring); hence, a <em>per se </em>rule precluding a finding of other concurrent causes, based solely upon a high blood alcohol reading, would unnecessarily expand the scope of the intoxication defense to prevent individuals, whose injuries result to some material degree from a specific employment hazard, from recovering benefits to which the Legislature has declared them entitled. Such a result would most certainly contravene the liberal construction traditionally given to the Act. <em>See generally Wilson v. Faull, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>105, 116, 141 A.2d 768 (1958) (\u2018Workmen\u2019s compensation laws were designed to provide an expeditious and certain remedy for employees who sustain work injuries----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Our holding in <em>Anslinger, supra, </em>124 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 188, 305 A.2d 797 is not to the contrary. There, the intoxicated employee drove \u201cinto and under a tractor trailer truck proceeding in the same direction as petitioner\u2019s on a multi-lane highway.\u201d In those circumstances, we concluded that the petitioner\u2019s employment merely provided a stage or setting for the injury such that the accidental occurrence could not be said to exist for the sober as well as the intoxicated. Accordingly, we agreed that the employee was properly denied workers\u2019 compensation benefits. But where, as here, the specific hazards of the job clearly existed for the sober and intoxicated alike, the intoxication defense was unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Our decision in <em>Cellucci v. Bronstein, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 523, 649 A.2d 1333 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>441, 655 A.2d 444 (1995), is not necessarily inconsistent with this conclusion. <em>Cellucci </em>was a legal malpractice case. Plaintiff alleged his <em>attorney had been </em>negligent in recommending that he settle his workers\u2019 compensation claims because it was likely that the compensation judge would conclude Cellucci\u2019s level of intoxication was the sole cause of his injuries and bar any recovery. Cellucci had a .322% blood alcohol reading when he dove into the shallow end of a lake at a recreational event at which he had been working as a bartender. Cellucci was familiar with the shallowness of the lake, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>had knowledge of water safety and was aware of the dangers created by mixing drinking and diving in the lake. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 649 A.2d 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In that context, we observed that \u201coverwhelming evidence of intoxication ... precludes a finding of other concurrent causes\u201d because \u201cthe specific hazards giving rise to [Cellucci\u2019s] injury did not exist for a sober [Cellucci] as they did for an intoxicated [Cellucci].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 649 A.2d 1333. Hence, to the extent our decision in <em>Cellucci </em>may suggest, as respondent contends, that overwhelming evidence of intoxication precludes a finding of other concurrent causes, we reject that assertion as too broadly conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Finally, respondent urges us to reject the \u201csole and proximate cause\u201d test and adopt a \u201csliding scale\u201d approach to interpreting the statutory intoxication defense. Since <em>Kulinka, supra, </em>the courts have employed the \u201csole\u201d cause test as the standard for determining whether an employee\u2019s intoxication negates an award of compensation. As was stated there, \u201c[i]f the Legislature intended intoxication [to be viewed] as a concurrent or contributory cause of an injury to effect a deprivation of the benefits of the statute, it would have been a simple matter to have said so.\u201d <em>Kulinka, supra, </em>9 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 505, 75 A.2d 557. This is especially true in view of the Legislature\u2019s revisions of the Act in 1979 which left section 7 intact. Finally, respondent\u2019s contention that our highest court has not directly addressed the standard is not entirely accurate. <em>See White, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 137, 313 A.2d 197 (expressly recognizing \u201cthe sole cause\u201d interpretation); <em>Patton v. American Oil Co., </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>382, 383, 185 A. 35 (E. &amp; A.1936) (affirming the compensation commissioner\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s intoxication was \u201cthe sole and proximate cause of the accident\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
