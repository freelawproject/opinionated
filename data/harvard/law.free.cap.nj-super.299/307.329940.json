The motion judge held that NJM was not required to participate under its automobile insurance policy in underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage arbitration for an injury to Marshall incurred during the operation of his motorcycle. The appeals are consolidated for the purpose of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Universal sought declaratory judgment against NJM and Marshall, claiming he was insured by both companies and requesting that NJM participate on a <em>pro rata </em>basis in any potential award to Marshall under UIM coverage. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the judge concluded that \u201cfrom the totality of all of the circumstances\u201d there was no coverage under Marshall\u2019s personal automobile policy issued by NJM. On review of both Universal\u2019s and NJM\u2019s policies and in light of the appropriate legal principles, we disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On August 3, 1994, Marshall was injured in an motor vehicle accident on West Canal Road in Franklin Township when Bartel Scheckinger crossed the road\u2019s center line and hit Marshall, who was riding his motorcycle. Scheckinger\u2019s automobile insurance carrier, Maryland Casualty Insurance Company (MCIC), settled with Marshall for its policy limit of $15,000. Marshall asserts that his medical expenses exceed that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Marshall had a \u201cMotorcycle Policy\u201d with Universal insuring his 1993 Harley Davidson motorcycle, and providing liability and UIM coverage of $100,000 each and $300,000 per accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, Marshall owned a 1987 Jeep and 1992 Plymouth automobile insured by NJM with a UIM limit of $500,000. The NJM policy expressly excludes any liability coverage \u201cfor the ownership, main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tenance or use of: [a]ny motorized vehicle having fewer than four wheels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Our function in construing the provisions of an insurance contract is to give effect to the parties\u2019 intent as evidenced by the terms used by them. <em>Sinopoli v.

That page indicates that the policy provides him $500,000 in UIM coverage. It is undisputed that Marshall was injured in an automobile accident with an underinsured motorist.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> NJM\u2019s underinsured motorist provision defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>an underinsured motor vehicle as a \u201cland motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which a liability ... policy applies at the time of the accident but its limit is less than the limit of liability for this coverage____\u201d UIM coverage extends to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">compensatory damages which an Insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an ... underinsured motor vehicle where such coverage is indicated as applicable in the Declarations because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">1.

The UIM provisions of Part C of Universal\u2019s policy, as amended by endorsement,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABm\">We will pay damages which a covered person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle where such coverage is indicated as applicable in the Schedule or Declarations because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">1.

Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 415, 638 A.2d 924; <em>American Reliance Ins. Co. v. American Cas. Co., </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 240, 683 A.2d 205 (App.Div.1996). In <em>Royal Ins., </em>the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident with an underinsured motorist in a vehicle owned and insured with Royal Insurance Company by her employer, and providing UIM coverage of $500,000. Plaintiff was permitted to drive the automobile as part of her work compensation, but was required to contribute $25 per month toward insurance. Additionally, plaintiff and her husband owned two other vehicles insured by Rutgers Casualty with $300,000 in UIM coverage. The Rutgers\u2019 \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision specifically provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">any insurance we provide with respect to a <em>vehicle you do not own, </em>or a vehicle owned by you or your family member which is not insured for this coverage under this policy, <em>shall be excess </em>over any other collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\"><em>[Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 415, 638 A.2d 924].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">We held that because plaintiff was injured in a car she did not own, under the express terms of the Rutgers policy, it only provided excess insurance to the Royal policy. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 638 A.2d 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Universal concedes UIM coverage under its policy, and that Marshall is underinsured. It contends, however, that NJM\u2019s policy provides concurrent coverage and should bear a <em>pro rata </em>share of the liability. Universal\u2019s argument has merit. NJM\u2019s \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">If there is other applicable similar insurance under more than one policy or provision of coverage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">1. Any recovery for damages for property damage or bodily Injury sustained by an Insured may equal but not exceed the higher of the applicable limit for any one vehicle under this insurance or any other insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>2. Any insurance we provide with respect to a <em>vehicle you do not own </em>shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">3. We will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits, [emphasis added],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">NJM\u2019s policy is distinguishable from the Rutgers policy because NJM\u2019s policy does not contain the exclusionary language \u201ca vehicle owned by you ... <em>which is not insured for this coverage under this policy, shall be excess </em>over any other collectible insurance.\u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 415, 638 A.2d 924 (emphasis added). NJM\u2019s policy provides excess insurance only for vehicles not owned by the insured. Because Marshall owned his motorcycle, paragraph three of NJM\u2019s \u201cOther Insurance\u201d provision applies and NJM must share in the loss on a <em>pro rata </em>basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In summary, since NJM\u2019s policy provides UIM coverage for injuries sustained by an insured in an accident with an underinsured motorist, regardless of whether the vehicle the insured is occupying is insured under its policy, and NJM by its policy terms agrees to share in the loss if other insurance is applicable, NJM must participate in the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">This result is consistent with our decision in <em>Watson v. Agway Ins. Co., supra, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>417, 677 A.2d 788, a declaratory judgment case where plaintiffs wife was fatally injured in an automobile accident. Plaintiff settled with the tort-feasor for its policy limits of $100,000. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 677 A.2d 788. Plaintiffs wife had her own UIM insurance and he had a business automobile policy with his partnership as the named insured. Both policies had a UIM limit of $500,000, but the partnership policy had excess UIM coverage with a $1,000,000 limit. The trial court decided that both policies were available for UIM coverage and each afforded $200,000 in coverage,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with the partnership\u2019s policy providing $1,000,000 in excess insurance. In affirming, we reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>that the partnership policy insured not only the named insured (the partnership), but also the individual partners. Thus, under that policy\u2019s express language, plaintiffs wife was covered as a member of his family and both carriers were required to share in the loss. <em>Id. </em>at 421, 677 A.2d 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">NJM makes the technical argument that because its policy excludes from any liability coverage an accident arising from the use of a motorcycle, the insurance statutes bar recovery under the underinsured motorist section of its policy. For this proposition, NJM relies on <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-l.lb<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides that a policy\u2019s UIM coverage cannot exceed its liability coverage. NJM argues that the exclusion of motorcycles contained in the liability section of its policy produces a liability limit of zero ($0), and, therefore, it concludes that recovery under its UIM coverage should be capped at $0 by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">To support this argument, NJM relies upon the step-down analysis discussed in <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>397, 658 A.2d 1246. Plaintiff in <em>Aubrey </em>was using a car on loan from an automobile dealer, insured by the dealer with a UIM limit of $1,000,000, when she was involved in an accident. At the time, plaintiff had her own automobile insurance with a UIM limit of $15,000. Plaintiff recovered $40,000 from the tort-feasor in the accident, and since this amount exceeded her own policy limits, she could not recover UIM benefits under it. Consequently, she attempted to recover as an insured under the car dealer\u2019s insurance policy. The Supreme Court concluded that plaintiffs personal selection of UIM insurance with a $15,000 limit capped her recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 658 A.2d 1246. To allow her recovery under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the dealership\u2019s $1,000,000 UIM insurance \u201cwould distort the meaning of an insured\u2019s \u2018reasonable expectations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 658 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The Court also concluded that Aubrey was not underinsured under the terms of the auto dealer\u2019s garage policy issued by The Harleysville Insurance Companies (Harleysville) with UIM coverage limit of $1,000,000. The policy\u2019s liability section excluded the auto dealership\u2019s customers from coverage. However, the policy contained a \u201cstep-down\u201d clause which provided customers with liability coverage up to the statutory minimum if they held less insurance. The policy\u2019s UIM endorsement did not contain the step-down clause but covered any person \u201coccupying a covered auto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 658 A.2d 1246. The Court concluded that it had to determine \u201cwhether Aubrey\u2019s right to recover, if any, would extend to the $1,000,000 limit of the UIM clause or would be limited, because of the parity provision and the step-down clause, to $15,000.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">This court had concluded that the step-down clause did not apply because it was not contained in the UIM section. <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 241, 243, 643 A.2d 1043 (App.Div.1994). We reasoned that the step-down clause could not be applied against Aubrey because she had the statutory minimum insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 241, 643 A.2d 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In deciding this issue, the Supreme Court disagreed and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae7\">To determine whether Aubrey is \u201cunderinsured\u201d under the Harleysville UIM endorsement, we turn to the Harleysville step-down clause, which defines an insured to include a customer who has liability insurance, but only for the \u201camount by which the compulsory or financial-responsibility law limits exceed the limit of Tthe customer\u2019s liability! insurance.\u201d Thus, the step-down clause limits liability coverage for a customer to the statutory minimum, $15,000. <em>Under the parity provision of N.J.S.A 17:28-l.lb, Aubrey\u2019s right to recover underinsured benefits would be limited to that amount. </em>Aubrey\u2019s own policy, moreover, meets the statutory minimum by providing $15,000 of liability coverage. Consequently, the $15,000 statutory minimum does not \u201cexceed\u201d Aubrey\u2019s liability limits. Aubrey, therefore, is not covered under the liability section of the Harleysville policy. Her $40,000 recovery from the other drivers would exceed the $15,000 available to her under the Hai-leysville policy. In sum, Aubrey is not \u201cunderinsured\u201d and is not entitled to recover under the Harleysville policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>[Aubrey v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 406, 658 A.2d 1246 (emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Despite NJM\u2019s somewhat sophisticated argument employing the statutory parity provision of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-l.lb to bar coverage, the cited statute merely stipulates that an insured cannot purchase more UIM coverage than the liability coverage that has been purchased. It does not affect the applicability of the UIM coverage. Additionally, NJM\u2019s suggested technical application \u201cwould distort the meaning of an insured\u2019s \u2018reasonable expectations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 658 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u201cGenerally speaking, courts construe insurance policies consistent with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.\u201d <em>Aubrey, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 404, 658 A.2d 1246; <em>Clegg v. New Jersey Automobile Full Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>634, 639, 604 A.2d 179 (App.Div.1992). Since Marshall purchased UIM coverage with NJM in the amount of $500,000, he \u201ccould reasonably expect UIM coverage in that amount.\u201d <em>Aubrey, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 404, 658 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This is a critical distinction between Marshall's policy and the policy in <em>Aubrey, </em>because the NJM policy was Marshall\u2019s \u201cown\u201d policy. <em>See Taylor v. Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>593, 674 A.2d 634 (App.Div.1996) (holding employee had a reasonable expectation to recover UIM benefits under employer\u2019s policy as a named insured despite having other UIM coverage on family held policy). The plaintiff in <em>Aubrey </em>was not a named insured nor an insured under the express terms of the Harleysville policy, but only became an insured by incorporation of the policy's step-down clause. In contrast, Marshall purchased the NJM policy in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">To defeat this reasonable expectation of coverage, a motorcycle exclusion from NJM\u2019s UIM coverage, if permissible, would have to be clear and unambiguous. <em>Cf. Lehrhoff v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 638 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1994); <em>Watson v. Agway Ins. Co., supra, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 423, 677 A.2d 788 (\u201cIf the controlling language of an insurance policy supports two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>interpretations, one favorable to the insurer and the other favorable to the insured, courts are obligated to adopt the interpretation supporting coverage.\u201d). In <em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., supra, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 638 A.2d 889, Lehrhoff was designated as a driver on a policy with Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) which insured his father\u2019s automobile and provided uninsured motorist (UM) and UIM coverage. While in California, Lehrhoff was injured in an accident with an unidentified motorist and claimed benefits under the policy. Aetna denied the claim based upon the policy\u2019s definition of a family member as \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption <em>who is a resident of your household.\u201d Id. </em>at 345, 638 A.2d 889 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">We held that boilerplate exclusions could not be used to defeat coverage implied from the express terms of the declaration page. <em>Id. </em>at 347, 638 A.2d 889. In reaching this conclusion, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">A personal automobile insurance policy is a bulky document, arcane and abstruse in the extreme to the uninitiated, unversed and, therefore typical policyholder. We are persuaded, therefore, that a conscientious policyholder, upon receiving the policy, would likely examine the declaration page to assure himself that the coverages and their amounts, the identity of the insured vehicle, and other basic information appearing thereon are accurate and in accord with his understanding of what he is purchasing. We deem it unlikely that once having done so, the average automobile policyholder would then undertake to attempt to analyze the entire policy in order to penetrate its layers of cross-referenced, qualified, and requalified meanings. Nor do we deem it likely that the average policyholder could successfully chart his own way through the shoals and reefs of exclusions, exceptions to exclusions, conditions and limitations, and all the rest of the qualifying fine print, whether or not in so-called plain language. We are, therefore, convinced that <em>it is the declaration page, the one page of the policy tailored to the particular insured and not merely boilerplate, which must be deemed to define coverage and the insured\u2019s expectation of coverage.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 346-347, 638 A.2d 889 (emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">It is the reasonable expectations created by the declaration page that are controlling and, therefore, cannot be defeated \u201cunless the declaration page itself so warns the insured.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 347, 638 A.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co. </em>was premised in large measure on <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 170 A.2d 22 (1961), where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">When members of the public purchase policies of insurance they are entitled to the broad measure of protection necessary to fulfill their reasonable expectations. They should not be subject <em>to technical encumbrances or to hidden, pitfalls </em>and their policies should be construed liberally to the end that coverage is afforded \u201cto the full extent that any fair interpretation will allow.\u201d [Id. at 482, 170 A.2d 22 (citations omitted) (emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Court also noted \u201c[w]here particular provisions, if read literally, would largely nullify the insurance, they will be severely restricted so as to enable fair fulfillment of the stated policy objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 170 A.2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">To accept NJM\u2019s argument would defeat its insured\u2019s reasonable expectation where Marshall is listed on NJM\u2019s declaration page as an insured with UIM limits of $500,000 as coverage for an accident caused by an underinsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The trial judge accepted NJM\u2019s argument that an objective purchaser of automobile insurance could not expect underinsured motorist coverage for an accident incurred on a motorcycle. The linchpin of NJM\u2019s argument is the liability exclusion of NJM\u2019s policy for accidents incurred through \u201cownership, maintenance or use of: [a]ny motorized vehicle having <em>fewer than four wheels.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In accepting NJM\u2019s argument, the motion judge grafted liability qualifications on to underinsured motorist provisions and thereby undermined the overall purpose of UIM coverage. \u201c[U]nderinsured motorist coverage is first-party coverage insuring the policyholder and others who have the status as \u2018insureds\u2019 under the policy against the possibility that they will be injured or suffer property loss in an accident caused by a motor vehicle where the liability insurance covering <em>that other vehicle </em>is insufficient to pay their full losses.\u201d Craig &amp; Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 26:1 (1997). The focus is on \u201cwhether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>individual tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle </em>is underinsured, not whether <em>the claimant or the claimant\u2019s vehicle </em>is underinsured.\u201d Craig <em>&amp; </em>Pomeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 27:4-1 (1997). \u201cCoverage is linked to the injured person, not the covered vehicle.\u201d <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 403, 658 A.2d 1246; <em>Fernandez v. Selected Risks Ins. Co., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>236, 241, 412 A.2d 755 (1980); <em>see also Clegg v. New Jersey Automobile Full Underwriting Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 638, 604 A.2d 179 (explaining that UIM \u201ccoverage is linked to the insured rather than to the covered vehicle\u201d); <em>Nikiper v. Motor Club of America Cos., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>393, 399, 557 A.2d 332 (App.Div.) (stating that \u201c[t]he purchaser decides the amount of the coverage; the number of tortfeasors does not\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>139, 564 A.2d 863 (1989). UIM coverage is optional, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(b), providing \u201c \u2018as much coverage as the insured is willing to purchase for his or her protection subject only to the owner\u2019s policy liability limits for personal injury and property damages to others.\u2019\u201d <em>Aubrey v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., supra, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>at 403, 658 A.2d 1246 (quoting <em>Prudential Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>251, 259-260, 624 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Other jurisdictions have construed UIM coverage provided in automobile insurance policies to cover motorcycle accidents where the motorcycle was not insured under the policy, but the accident was caused by an underinsured motorist. <em>See e.g., Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. v. LaRose, </em>919 P.2d 915, 917 (Colo.Ct.App.1996); <em>Watts v. General Accident Ins. Co. of America, </em>102 <em>Ohio App.</em>3d 359, 657 <em>N.E.2d </em>320, 323 (1995); <em>Bass v. North Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>332 <em>N.C. </em>109, 418 <em>S.E.2d </em>221, 223 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Watts v. General Accident Ins. Co. of America, supra, </em>102 <em>Ohio </em>App.3d 359, 657 <em>N.E.2d </em>320, a motorcyclist was involved in an accident with an underinsured motorist and sought recovery of UIM benefits under an automobile insurance policy taken out on his pickup truck. The plaintiff insured his motorcycle without UIM coverage under a separate policy with another insurer. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>appeal, the automobile insurer made essentially the same argument now advanced by NJM, that if plaintiff wanted UIM benefits for an accident involving his motorcycle, he should have obtained it under the motorcycle\u2019s policy; since he did not, he could not reasonably expect to recover under his auto policy. <em>Id. </em>at 362-363, 657 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 322. The Ohio court rejected this argument, holding that the motorcyclist could recover under the UIM coverage purchased in his automobile policy, reasoning that \u201cunderinsured motorist coverage once purchased follows the insured and not the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 657 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Similarly in <em>Bass v. North Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., supra, </em>332 <em>N.C. </em>109, 418 S.E.2d 221, a motorcyclist recovered under his automobile policy insuring his car and truck which included UIM coverage, although his motorcycle was insured under a policy which did not include UIM benefits. The North Carolina Supreme Court held that the motorcyclist was \u201centitled to UIM benefits under his automobile/truck policy regardless of whether he [was] riding in the insured vehicles or on his motorcycle, or just walking down the street.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 418 S.E.2d at 223 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Consistent with the interpretation of underinsured motorist coverage in <em>Aubrey, </em>North Carolina recognizes that \u201cliability insurance is essentially vehicle oriented, while UM/UIM insurance is essentially person oriented.\u201d <em>Smith v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>328 <em>N.C. </em>139, 148, 400 <em>S.E.2d </em>44, 50 (1991). These cases make clear that it is improper to incorporate a policy\u2019s liability exclusions, which are vehicle oriented, into the underinsured motorist provisions because the two sections provide entirely separate and distinct types of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Marshall could reasonably expect to have UIM coverage available under his automobile policy, despite purchasing UIM coverage under Universal\u2019s motorcycle policy. The determining factor under the NJM policy is whether Marshall, as the insured, was underinsured in relation to Seheekinger\u2019s (the tort-feasor) vehicle. Whether Marshall was on a motorcycle or walking down the street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>is of little significance. He could reasonably expect to be insured under both policies as a named insured paying premiums to insure against bodily injury caused by an underinsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> Universal appeals in Docket No. A-4514-95T2 and Marshall appeals in Docket No. A-4796-95T5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\"> Universal\u2019s UIM coverage also provided $25,000 coverage for property damage, subject to a $250 deductible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-8\"> As noted, Scheckinger, the culpable party, paid his policy limits of $15,000 to Marshall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-14\"> A motor vehicle is by statute underinsured when the \"sum of the limits of liability ... available to a person <em>against whom recovery is sought </em>... is, at the time of the accident, less than the applicable limits for underinsured motorist coverage afforded under the motor vehicle insurance policy <em>held by the person seeking that recovery.\" NJ.S.A. </em>17:28-1.le (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b343-15\"> Language in the Universal policy, which was replaced by the endorsement, had indicated that the policy\u2019s UIM provisions were extended only to an accident involving the insured\u2019s motorcycle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> Decedent\u2019s husband collected $100,000 from the tort-feasor\u2019s insurer, resulting in decedent being underinsured in the amount of $400,000.

It is true that the New Jersey Manufacturers\u2019 policy provides UIM coverage for bodily injuries sustained if caused by an accident with an underinsured motorist. In my view, UIM coverage for this motorcycle accident should be found, but only by reason of the ambiguity and possibility for policyholder confusion inherent in the NJM policy language. The NJM policy says it will provide UIM coverage to an insured for \u201cdamages ... caused by an accident with an underinsured motor vehicle ...\u201d As the majority opinion points out however, NJM\u2019s policy also excludes any liability coverage for accidents arising from use of certain vehicles such as motorcycles. The significance of this absence of liability coverage for a motorcycle accident lies in the statutory limitation of UIM coverage in an automobile policy to the amount of liability coverage provided in the policy. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.lb. NJM argues that it did not and would not provide liability coverage for the more dangerous motorcycle exposure (at least, by inference, not at automobile rates), and that Marshall\u2019s UIM coverage arising out of motorcycle use cannot exceed the non-existent motorcycle liability coverage by reason of section 28-l.lb.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">This is an eminently fair argument. In effect, Marshall may have succeeded in buying UIM coverage for motorcycle accidents at regular automobile rates, without the knowledge of the automobile liability carrier. Unfortunately, neither Section 28-l.lb (quoted in the majority opinion) nor the language of the NJM policy address this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">Objectively, however, an ordinary insured could reasonably read the NJM policy to provide UIM coverage for any kind of motor vehicle accident. It is interesting to note that, prior to endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ment, the Universal policy contained a clause which expressly limited its UIM coverage to accidents involving the insured\u2019s motorcycle, i.e., to accidents for which liability coverage also exists. Subject to compliance with applicable law, a similar UIM limitation might have been clearly and unambiguously expressed in the NJM policy. As it was not, I concur with the result reached by the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
