We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The decedent, Bruce Money, was employed by respondent Coin Depot Corporation as an armored truck security guard. The decedent was required to carry a handgun while performing this job. On August 17, 1989, the decedent was assigned with two other guards to one of respondent\u2019s armored trucks. As the three men were driving along a highway carrying a load of money, the decedent pulled out his gun, put a bullet in the cylinder, spun the cylinder, placed the gun against his chin, and pulled the trigger. The gun did not discharge. The decedent then spun the cylinder again, placed the gun back against his chin, and pulled the trigger a second time. This time the gun fired, killing him instantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The decedent\u2019s widow, petitioner Babette Money, subsequently filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim petition, seeking dependency benefits from respondent. After a four day hearing which took nearly a year and a half to complete, the judge of compensation issued an oral opinion which concluded that the decedent died in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The judge found that the decedent \u201cdid not intend to kill himself.\u201d The judge also found that respondent was aware of \u201cMoney\u2019s propensity to play Russian Roulette.\u201d Relying upon cases which hold that when an employer requires its employees to use a dangerous instrumentality such as a gun, an accident resulting from that instrumentality may be found to arise out of the employment, <em>see, e.g., Diaz v. Newark Indus. Spraying, Inc., </em>35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>N.J. </em>588, 592, 174 A.2d 478 (1961), the judge concluded that even though \u201cMoney\u2019s gun play may have been a deviation from his employment,\u201d the deviation was \u201cminor in nature\u201d and therefore the accident was compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">To be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to -142, an accident must \u201caris[e] out of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-7. The phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 employment refers to the \u201ccausal origin\u201d of an accident and the phrase \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment refers to \u201cthe time, place, and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 288, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986) (quoting 1 A Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 6.10 (1985)). To be found to have \u201caris[en] \u2018out of the employment,\u201d the risk of an accident \u201cmust be of such nature\u201d that it \u201cmight have been contemplated by a reasonable person when entering the employment, as incidental to [that employment].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting <em>Rafferty v. Dairymen\u2019s League Coop. Ass\u2019n, </em>16 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>363, 366, 200 A. 493 (Dep\u2019t Labor 1938)). \u201cA risk is incidental to the employment when it belongs to or is connected with what a workman has to do in fulfilling his contract of service.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Applying this basic test, the Supreme Court has identified three categories of risks which may result in an accident arising out of an employment: risks \u201cdistinctly associated\u201d with the employment, such as an employee\u2019s fingers getting caught in a machine; \u201cneutral\u201d risks, such as an employee getting struck by lightning while on the job; and risks that are \u201cpersonal\u201d to an employee, such as a non-work related heart attack suffered while on the job. <em>Id. </em>at 290-92, 520 A.2d 1341. The Court has described \u201cpersonal risks\u201d as including those which arise from the \u201cpersonal proclivities\u201d of the employee and that consequently have a \u201cminimal\u201d connection to the employment. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 85, 135 A.2d 161 (1957)). Accidents resulting from risks which are \u201cdistinctly associated\u201d with the employment or \u201cneutral\u201d are com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pensable, but accidents resulting from \u201cpersonal\u201d risks are noneompensable. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 200 A. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We conclude that the decedent\u2019s self-infliction of a fatal gunshot to his head resulted from a risk which was \u201cpersonal\u201d to him. The decedent\u2019s game of Russian Roulette was not a normal incident of his employment. It was a purely personal activity which was inimical to his employer\u2019s interests. It also was an activity which decedent, who kept guns in his house and regularly shot handguns at a shooting range, could just as easily have engaged in while drinking in a local bar or riding in his own automobile with friends. Moreover, even assuming decedent had no intention of taking his own life, his game of Russian Roulette was highly aberrant conduct which created a substantial risk of personal injury totally unrelated to the risks inherent in the normal conduct of the employer\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The circumstances of decedent\u2019s accident were significantly different from the \u201chorseplay\u201d cases relied upon by the judge of compensation. For example, in <em>McKenzie v. Brixite Mfg. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>1, 166 A.2d 753 (1961), the petitioner \u201cplayfully touched\u201d one of his coemployees between the buttocks. This touching caused the coemployee to tura around suddenly with a hot scraper, which accidentally struck the petitioner. Under these circumstances, the Court concluded that the horseplay was \u201can incident of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 166 A.2d 753. Similarly, in <em>Diaz v. Newark Indus. Spraying, Inc., supra, </em>the petitioner, who was cleaning window frames with a water hose, twice playfully squirted water on a coemployee\u2019s legs. In retaliation, the coemployee turned around and threw the contents of a pail which he thought contained water but which in fact contained lacquer thinner. As a result, a nearby open flame caused the lacquer thinner to ignite, severely injuring the petitioner. Although the employer was not aware of this activity, the Court held the accident to be compensable, adopting the view that accidents resulting from horseplay on the job may be found to \u201carise out of employment\u201d so long as the \u201cdeviation\u201d from the normal course of employment \u201ccan be considered minor.\u201d 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 591, 174 A.2d 478. In contrast, the decedent\u2019s personal game of Russian Roulette, from which his coemployees attempted to dissuade him, constituted a major deviation from the normal course of employment which created a substantial and extraordinary risk of physical harm to petitioner and his coemployees. Therefore, the decedent\u2019s accident did not \u201carise out of\u2019 his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">This case is similar to <em>Gibbs v. Orange County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>149 <em>A.D.2d </em>845, 540 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>35 (App.Div.1989), in which our counterparts in New York reversed an award of workers compensation to the survivors of a deputy sheriff who fatally wounded himself while playing Russian Roulette at work. The court concluded that this activity constituted such a substantial deviation from a law enforcement officer\u2019s ordinary performance of his duties that it was not compensable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">Decedent well knew that the gun was not empty when he intentionally pulled the trigger. Thus, his conduct in playing the highly dangerous game of Russian roulette cannot be described as merely a common playful prank or trifling act of foolery, which decedent could have considered harmless on the facts as he then believed them to be. Nor can decedent\u2019s manifestly dangerous conduct be characterized as a momentary, reasonable exercise of one\u2019s curiosity during a period of idleness in employment duties. Absent here also was any evidence that decedent\u2019s conduct was engaged in by other employees before this tragic event or that it had been a common practice, which might support the inference that his activity had become, in effect, an incident of his employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 847, <em>540 N.Y.S.2d </em>35 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\"><em>We </em>add that <em>Gibbs </em>and this case differ significantly from the out-of-state cases relied upon by petitioner, in which police officers were injured or killed when they discharged guns accidentally while putting on their uniforms or cleaning their weapons, which were clearly work-related activities. <em>See, e.g., Neel v. State Distribs., Inc., </em>105 <em>N.M. </em>359, 732 P.2d 1382 (1986), <em>cert. quashed, </em>105 <em>N.M. </em>358, 732 P.2d 1381 (1987); <em>Town of Davenport v. Richardson, </em>447 P.2d 755 (Okl.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Finally, there is no competent evidence to support the judge of compensation\u2019s finding that respondent acquiesced in the decedent playing Russian Roulette on the job. Armando Laureano, whose testimony the judge relied upon to support this finding, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>testified that there were rumors within the company that the decedent would sometimes play Russian Roulette and that he assumed management was aware of those rumors. Laureano could not identify any specific management representative who was made aware of those rumors or how this information would have come to management\u2019s attention. Because Laureano\u2019s testimony regarding this subject was pure speculation, it did not provide an adequate foundation for the judge of compensation\u2019s finding. Therefore, we have no occasion to decide whether an accident resulting from an employee playing Russian Roulette while on the job would be compensable in the improbable event that an employer actually acquiesced in such a dangerous activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
