We are required to review (1) the propriety of the Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority\u2019s (the Authority) acceptance of an offer to extend a contract for one year beyond its authorized term after it rejected bids for a new contract to provide the services covered by that contract; and (2) the propriety of the Authority\u2019s rejection of all bids on grounds of excessive cost. The trial court ruled the extension invalid on the ground it contravened the public bidding law. The court also invalidated the bid rejection and ordered the Authority to award a contract to plaintiff PENPAC, Inc. We now affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">In a September 21,1993, agreement, the Authority acquired two transfer stations. In that contract, the Authority hired Morris County Transfer Station, Inc. (MCTS) to operate the transfer stations and to transfer waste. Under the 1993 agreement, MCTS received $30 per ton to operate the stations and $17 per ton to transfer the waste. The agreement provided for a one time adjustment in January 1996, which resulted in a total cost of $38.65 per ton. The 1993 agreement had a December 31, 1996, termination date but provided the Authority \u201cin its sole discretion [was] entitled to extend, upon three (3) month\u2019s prior -written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>notice to MCTS, MCTS\u2019s obligations pursuant to [the agreement] for two (2) individual six (6) month terms at the rates, [payable] for the calendar year 1996____\u201d The Authority did not exercise the option in accord with the contract terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">On June 24, 1996, while its agreement with MCTS was still in force, the Authority filed a verified petition with the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) seeking approval for a rate reduction in the tariff charged by the Authority for the disposal of solid waste at its transfer stations on an interim basis. That reduction was sought, according to the petition, in anticipation of the implementation of a new contract to be awarded through the public bidding process. The Authority stated it foresaw that a new contract would result in substantially reduced costs from the current contract \u201cdue to prevailing market conditions and the recent experience of other New Jersey counties and solid waste implementing agencies.\u201d The reduction was to be implemented immediately. On July 30, 1996, the DEP accepted the proposed tariff rates on an interim basis. Until the reduction was actually realized through a new contract, the reduced tariff rates were subsidized through Authority funds held for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">On September 23, 1996, the Authority advertised for bids in connection with the operation of the two transfer stations and for transportation of solid waste to designated disposal sites. Bids were requested based on a contract duration of three consecutive years beginning in 1997 and cancelable by the Authority \u201cwithout penalty or cause.\u201d Alternatively, bids were sought for the same years but with a provision to include an option whereby the Authority could extend the contract for two individual years. All bids were to be submitted by November 25, 1996. At that time, they were to be publicly opened and read aloud. The Authority reserved the right to reject \u201cany and all bids\u201d and to waive any informality in the bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">In response to the advertisement, bids were submitted by Geological Reclamation Operations and Waste Systems, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>(GROWS), PENPAC, and MCTS. According to the Authority, the price per ton by all bidders for both operation of the transfer stations and transportation of solid waste was higher than projected. The bidding process for the affected years and their total costs, as represented by the Authority, are:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">BIDDER 1997</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">GROWS $33.74</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">PENPAC $34.46</p>\n<p id=\"Ate\">MCTS $32.78</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">1998 1999</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">$34.22 $34.71</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">$35.48 $36.54</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">$38.78 $44.78</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">TOTAL ESTIMATED COST</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">$25,667,500</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">$26,620,000</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">$29,085,000</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">The Authority\u2019s pre-bid estimates were $24.60 per ton in 1997, $25.22 in 1998, and $25.85 in 1999, for a total cost of $18,917,500. Thus, the Authority found GROWS\u2019s bid exceeded their estimate by $6.7 million, or 36%, and PENPAC by $7.7 million, or 41%. The Authority adopted a resolution on December 11, 1996, rejecting all bids. The Authority based its rejection on its projection that prevailing market conditions should have produced significantly lower bids. While all bids were rejected, GROWS\u2019s bid was also rejected for bidder failure to demonstrate it possessed a current Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26H-1.6(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">Prior to rejecting all bids but after all the bids were read publicly as scheduled, the Authority received a letter from MCTS. MCTS offered to extend the operating arrangement with the Authority as set forth in the 1993 agreement. There is no dispute the proposed extension offered did not conform with the 1993 agreement\u2019s option period allowed to the Authority. In its proposal, MCTS indicated that it would waive compliance with the three-month notification provision. It offered a reduced rate of $29.70 per ton for operation and transportation. Consequently, the rate not only undercut the bids submitted but also was at a figure lower than that of the 1993 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">On December 11, 1996, when the Authority rejected all bids, it simultaneously, by resolution, extended the 1993 agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>MCTS as per the terms proposed by MCTS. In accepting MCTS\u2019 offer, the Authority noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">Such a rate is lower than the rates submitted by ail the bidders who submitted bids in response to the Notice Bidders dated September 23, 1996 and, based upon the amount of solid waste to be processed in 1997, represents a total annual savings to the customers of the [Authority] of approximately one million dollars compared to the lowest bid submitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On December 17, 1996, the Authority and MCTS executed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">PENPAC and one of its principals, Raymond Barbiere, filed the complaint in lieu of prerogative writs giving rise to this appeal. The complaint challenged the extension and the rejection of bids. The trial court ruled the extension contravened the underlying purposes of the public bidding law. It also concluded, with some reservation, that even though the Authority had a \u201cplausible\u201d \u201cgood faith\u201d basis for rejecting all bids, the \u201cfundamental distortion of the bidding statutes by MCTS ... had an incredibly strong capacity to skew and distort the whole judgment process on the part of the Authority\u201d in its decision to reject all bids. Consequently, it ordered the Authority to award the contract to PEN-PAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Defendants, on an emergent basis, appealed the ensuing judgment and sought a stay. We granted the stay pending resolution of the appeal due to the public interest involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Defendants argue the trial court erred when it voided the contract extension. They rely on <em>Palamar Constr., Inc., v. Township of Pennsauken, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 482 A.2d 174 (App.Div.1983). We conclude that where, as here, an existing contract to provide services to a public agency has expired due to the failure of the agency to exercise an option on terms consonant with the contract, a subsequent extension of the contract containing a change in its material terms contravenes the purposes undergirding the public bidding law and is void. Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Palomar </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The purpose of public bidding laws is to provide the public with the \u201c\u2018benefits of unfettered competition.\u201d\u2019 <em>Meadowbrook Carting Co. v. Borough of Island Heights, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>307, 313, 650 A.2d 748 (1994) (quoting <em>Terminal Constr. Corp. v. Atlantic Cty. Sewerage Auth., </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>403, 410, 341 A.2d 327 (1975)). The goal is that through competitive bidding the public interest in achieving the most economic result will be best served. <em>Township of River Vale v. R.J. Longo Constr. Co., </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>207, 215, 316 A.2d 737 (Law Div.1974). \u201cThe statutes authorizing competitive bidding accomplish that purpose by promoting competition on an equal footing and guarding against \u2018favoritism, improvidence, extravagance and corruption.\u2019\u201d <em>Meadowbrook Carting Co., supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 313, 650 A.2d 748 (quoting <em>Township of Hillside v. Sternin, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>317, 322, 136 A.2d 265 (1957)). All bidders must be equally situated in their competition for a public contract. <em>Ibid. </em>Since competitive bidding is for the benefit of the public, \u201cany private agreement which tends to prevent or restrict competition, or any scheme which has the effect of promoting favoritism, circumvents the statute and is contrary to ... public policy----\u201d <em>Hanna v. Board of Educ. of Wicomico, </em>200 <em>Md. </em>49, 87 A.2d 846, 849 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Here, the award had the effect not only of promoting favoritism but also of tilting the bidding field in favor of MCTS and against its competitors. It afforded MCTS, after vying with its competitors on new bids and losing, a right not contained in the 1993 agreement to extend that contract on materially new terms. The opportunity to privately negotiate an agreement violated the recited goals of the competitive bidding requirements of the statute. We consequently agree with the trial court that the extension of the 1993 contract is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The substantial change in material terms beyond the scope of the about-to-expire 1993 contract invoked by the contractor is what makes <em>Palamar </em>inapposite here. In <em>Palomar, </em>we sustained the municipality\u2019s imposition of a post-bid condition on a newly bid contract. There, the bids did not require construction supervision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and the municipality, with the new bidders\u2019 acquiescence, altered the terms of the award to require supervision. We concluded, because the imposed post-bid condition did not disadvantage the competitor bidders and at the same time was \u201cmore onerous\u201d to the successful bidder, the purposes of the bidding laws were not undermined. <em>Palamar, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 251, 482 A.2d 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Here, the extension award was beyond the terms of the 1993 agreement and at a substantially lower price than called for by that agreement. Moreover, it was effectuated not at the instigation of the public agency but at the impetus of the contractor. So, the extension award not only disadvantaged the bidders by not allowing them the opportunity to submit similar proposals, but also materially changed the 1993 agreement in a manner far beyond the municipally invoked and significantly lesser change in <em>Palamar. </em>Under these circumstances, <em>Palamar </em>offers no support for overriding the trial court\u2019s voiding of the extension agreement. We note decisions of other jurisdictions lend support to our holding. <em>See City of Baltimore v. Bio Gro Sys., </em>300 <em>Md. </em>248, 477 A.2d 783 (1984); <em>Browning-Ferris Indus. v. City of Oak Ridge, </em>644 <em>S.W.2d </em>400 (Tenn.App.1982); <em>Miller v. State, </em>73 <em>Wash.2d </em>790, 440 P.2d 840 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">We now turn to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s invalidation of the bid rejection. A municipality has a well-recognized right to reject all bids received for a public contract. <em>See Bodies by Lembo, Inc. v. County of Middlesex, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 307, 669 A.2d 254 (App.Div.1996); <em>Cardell, Inc. v. Township of Woodbridge, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>442, 450-51, 280 A.2d 203 (App.Div.1971), <em>certif. denied, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>236, 287 A.2d 733 (1972); <em>George Harms Constr. Co. v. Borough of Lincoln Park, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 379, 391 A.2d 960 (Law Div.1978); <em>see also N.J.S. </em>A 40A:ll-24(a) (specifying that a \u201ccontracting unit shall award the contract or reject all bids within such time as may be specified in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>invitation to bid\u201d). This is especially so where, as here, the right is reserved in the bidding solicitation. <em>Princeton Disposal Serv. v. Township of N. Brunswick, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>488, 490, 381 A.2d 1220 (App.Div.1977), <em>certif. denied, 75 N.J. </em>608, 384 A.2d 838 (1978); A <em>&amp; D Constr., Inc. v. Vineland, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 404, 418 A.2d 1319 (Law Div.1980). The right to reject promotes competitive bidding in that it \u201cserves as a strong inducement to bidders to keep their bids as low as circumstances permit.\u201d <em>Cardell, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 450-51, 280 A.2d 203. The right is a \u201cdiscretionary privilege\u201d but one \u201cnot without limit.\u201d <em>Bodies by Lembo, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 308, 669 A.2d 254; <em>see also Marvec Constr. Corp. v. Township of Belleville, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 288, 603 A.2d 184 (Law Div.1992) (\u201cawarding authority has considerable discretion to reject all bids\u201d but that discretion \u201cis not unfettered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The decision to reject all bids must not be \u201carbitrary or capricious and it must be free from fraud, collusion and bad faith.\u201d <em>Marvec Constr. Corp., supra, 254 N.J.Super. </em>at 288, 603 A.2d 184. It is sustainable where motivated by good faith without consideration of eliminating an \u201cunfavored bidder.\u201d <em>Princeton Disposal Serv., supra, </em>154 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 490, 381 A.2d 1220. Moreover, where all \u201cbids have already been opened and each bidder\u2019s competitive position has been exposed, rejection of all bids should only occur for cogent or compelling reasons.\u201d <em>Marvec Constr. Corp., 254 N.J.Super. </em>at 288, 603 A.2d 184 (quoting Cushman &amp; Doyle, <em>Construction Bidding Law </em>\u00a7 1.7 (1990)); <em>see also Bodies by Lembo, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 309, 669 A.2d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>Cardell, </em>we explained when a municipality may reject all bids. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">Suffice it to say that when a municipal governing body concludes in good faith that the purposes of the public bidding statute are being violated, it may reject all bids submitted and in its discretion order a readvertising of the contract. Furthermore, <em>should the lowest bid, substantially exceed the municipality\u2019s cost estimate </em>or its appropriation for the job, or should circumstances arise which might cause the municipal governing body to abandon or substantially revise the project, then a total rejection of bids might well be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\"><em>[Cardell, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 451, 280 A.2d 203 (emphasis added) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>These principles must be considered in the context of a court\u2019s scope of review when assessing the validity of bid rejections. In <em>Palomar, </em>we defined that scope. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">A reviewing court cannot overturn the decision of a municipal body unless it finds that the decision was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. \u201cEven when doubt is entertained as to the wisdom of the action, or as to some part of it, there can be no judicial declaration of invalidity in the absence of clear abuse of discretion by the public agencies involved.\u201d It is not the function of a reviewing court to substitute its judgment for that of the municipality\u2019s governing body and it is bound by the record before the governing body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\"><em>[Palamar, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 250, 482 A.2d 174 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The decision of the Authority is entitled to the same respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Applying all of the foregoing principles, we are satisfied from our review of the record that the trial court improvidently invalidated the Authority\u2019s rejection of all bids. The Authority concluded all the bids substantially exceeded the Authority\u2019s estimated bid. The trial court concluded the Authority acted in good faith when it rejected the bids for that reason. The credible evidence in the record supports that good faith finding. <em>Meshinsky v. Nichols Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>464, 475, 541 A.2d 1063 (1988). However, we can find no similar evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion the rejection was a consequence of MCTS\u2019s offer or that it had \u201cthe strong capacity to skew and distort\u201d the Authority\u2019s whole judgment process in rejecting the bids. Since there are no facts in the record from which to reasonably infer that the Authority was motivated by MCTS\u2019s conduct rather than by the bids substantially in excess of the Authority\u2019s estimate, and particularly in light of the good faith finding, we reject the trial court\u2019s conclusion the bids\u2019 rejection was improper. <em>See C. B. Snyder Realty v. BMW of N. Am., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 69, 558 A.2d 28 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>165, 564 A.2d 883 (1989) (where the focus of the dispute on appeal is not on credibility but rather the alleged error in the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the underlying facts and the implications to be drawn therefrom, the appellate function broadens beyond the pale of the conventional credible evidence scope of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The trial court\u2019s determination on this issue amounted to a substitution of judgment in an instance where there was no abuse of discretion by the Authority. The court\u2019s finding of good faith establishes the predicate that the Authority acted properly and within the scope of its authority when it rejected all bids consonant with the reservation in the instructions to bidders.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">There is no support in law for the premise that a bidder\u2019s unilateral, unsolicited conduct serves as a basis for invalidating a local agency\u2019s good faith exercise of its considerable discretion. Nor can there be. The bidding laws are all designed to obviate the promotion of any conduct that could lead to favoritism, improvidence, or corruption. By eradicating the Authority\u2019s good faith exercise of its discretion based upon the uncontrollable conduct of a bidder, the court vitiated that bidding law design. It took from the Authority its broad discretion to reject all bids exercised for the cogent and compelling reason that the bids' substantially surpassed the Authority\u2019s cost estimate. The unilateral, improvidential, and uncontrollable conduct of MCTS did not, as a matter of law or fact, invalidate the Authority\u2019s good faith rejection of the bids. The Authority\u2019s rejection of the bids promulgated the public interest; it was not subject to invalidation in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">While the extension agreement is void, a condition of our invalidation is that MCTS provide the waste operation and transport services for the duration of the bidding process consonant with that agreement\u2019s terms. <em>See Meadowbrook Carting Co., supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 326, 650 A.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The Authority shall advertise for new bids to be received within 120 days. The performance of the new contract should begin promptly after the contract has been awarded. <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The judgment under appeal is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
