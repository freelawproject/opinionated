The trial court, based on the proofs before the jury, then convicted defendant of a related offense of possessing burglary tools, a disorderly persons offense, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-5. The trial court committed defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections (Commissioner) for five years with a two-year period of parole ineligibility, assessed a $50 Violent Crimes Compensation Board (VCCB) penalty and a $75 Safe Neighborhood Services Fund (SNSF) assessment for the attempted burglary conviction. In addition, the trial court committed defendant to the custody of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the Commissioner for a concurrent term of six months and assessed a $50 VCCB penalty and a $75 SNSF assessment for the possession of burglary tools conviction. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">According to the State\u2019s proofs, at approximately 12:30 a.m. on August 26, 1994, Nuno Domingos, the owner of the Red Parrot Restaurant located on Broad Street in Elizabeth, New Jersey, was closing his establishment for the night. As he was turning off the lights in the upper level of the restaurant, Mr. Domingos heard a barmaid call to him from the downstairs area. Mr. Domingos went downstairs to investigate noise coming from the back kitchen door. The kitchen door from which the noise was emanating opens into a fenced-in, patio-like \u201cbeer garden\u201d in the back of the restaurant used for dining, barbecues, parties, and other similar events. Mr. Domingos testified that he heard \u201ca loud noise\u201d coming from the door which sounded \u201clike somebody hitting the door.\u201d He believed somebody was trying to break into the restaurant and immediately dialed \u201c911.\u201d Mr. Domingos, who was afraid, then ran out of the front door of the restaurant and waited on Broad Street for the police to arrive.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Elizabeth police officers Alexandria Araujo and Jorge Hildalgo soon arrived and-saw Mr. Domingos waving at them. Mr. Domingos then led the officers through the restaurant to the back kitchen door. As they opened the door, the officers saw a man, later identified as defendant, standing in the beer garden. Officer Araujo testified that when she entered the beer garden shouting \u201cPolice!\u201d, she noticed defendant raise his hands in the air and heard something fall to ground. Officer Araujo said that the something turned out to be a hammer. Officer Hidalgo also testified that when he entered the beer garden, he saw a hammer in defendant\u2019s hand, which defendant dropped when he put his hands up. The officers then placed defendant under arrest. While checking the area, the officers found pry marks on the side of the kitchen door facing the beer garden. The pry marks were fresh, as evidenced by the exposed wood on the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Defendant, on the other hand, denied that he had used the hammer in an attempt to pry open the door, and denied that he had intended to break into the restaurant to steal money or liquor. He testified that on the night in question, he had been in another bar, and when he left that tavern, an unidentified man followed and then chased him. At some point, he ran from the man, who was a half block behind, and entered the beer garden area of the Red Parrot Restaurant. To enter the beer garden, defendant scaled a six foot, barbed wire fence. When he reached the beer garden, defendant began banging on the back door with his hand to get help but was not heard. Defendant then found the hammer and began using it to bang on the door to get attention. Defendant testified that he \u201cwas in fear of [his] life,\u201d and stated that eventually the person who was chasing him also sealed the fence and entered the beer garden. Defendant noted, however, that when the police arrived, the other man fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">At the conclusion of the proofs, the jury found defendant guilty of attempted burglary. The trial court then found defendant guilty of possession of burglary tools. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Defendant, for the first time on appeal, contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during summation on his (defendant\u2019s) post-arrest silence violated his Fifth Amendment rights as well as his rights under State common law, thus requiring a reversal of his convictions and a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">On direct examination, defendant, in response to his counsel\u2019s questions, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">Q: Did either of the two officers that arrested you ever ask what your version of the stray was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">A: No, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 no, sir, they didn\u2019t. I tried to explain it to them, but they just didn\u2019t want to hear what I had to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-14\">Q: What happened after you were cuffed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">A: They just put me in the police ear and took me to the police headquarters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">Q: Now, after you were arrested, where were you brought?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>A: Brought to Elizabeth police station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">Q: And how long were you there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">A: I was there until four o\u2019clock, until I was transferred to Union County Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">Q: Did there ever come a time that any member of the Elizabeth Police Department or a detective or anyone ever attempted to take a statement from you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">A: No, they did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Defendant\u2019s counsel also asked the following questions of Detective Kevin O\u2019Leary, the Elizabeth police officer who conducted the follow-up investigation of the incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">Q: Now, as part of your investigation follow[-]up into the crime, when a crime occurs, one of the things you can do is attempt to speak to someone in custody, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">A: Correct!]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">Q: In this case, you were unable to speak to Mr. Jenkins because he had been brought to the county jail; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-14\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">Defendant\u2019s counsel in summation made the following remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa7\">[A] review of the evidence from the police officers and the detectives indicate that Mr. Jenkins was never allowed to provide an explanation as to why he was there at the scene. He was never asked by the police officers and he was never given an opportunity to provide a statement to the detective O\u2019Leary at a future date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-16\">The prosecutor then made the following comments in summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-17\">Do you think it\u2019s odd that a person who is arrested in the back dark secluded closed premises of a restaurant with a hammer in his hand eight months ago and the only reason he\u2019s there is because he is afraid, he\u2019s been chased, there\u2019s someone stalking him and startled all 200 pounds of him, all six feet of him. <em>He ... never once talks to the Prosecutor's Office. He never once t\u00f1es to explain until he\u2019s here in front of you. </em>I don\u2019t believe it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-18\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-19\">In <em>State v. Deatore, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>100, 109, 358 A.2d 163 (1976), our Supreme Court announced that the State\u2019s cross-examination of a defendant concerning his/her post-arrest silence was improper. The <em>Deatore </em>Court explained that \u201c[w]e reach that conclusion as a matter of state law and policy, as to which we may impose standards more strict than required by the federal Constitution, which standards will control regardless of the final outcome of the question in the federal sphere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 358 A.2d 163 (citation omitted). The Court based its decision on principles of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>law and on the privilege against self-incrimination derived from New Jersey\u2019s common law. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 358 A.2d 163. With respect to the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">There can be no doubt that the right of an accused or a suspect to remain silent when in police custody or under interrogation has always been a fundamental aspect of the privilege in this state____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">The practical effect of the privilege to remain silent is, as we held a decade ago, \u201cthat when a defendant expressly refused to answer, no inference can be drawn against him under the doctrine of acquiescence by silence or any other concept,\u201d <em>State v. Ripo, supra, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 204, 212 A.2d 22, and no comment thereon may be made to the jury, <em>State v. Lanzo, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>560, 563, 210 A.2d 613 (1965), following <em>Griffin v. California, supra[, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>609, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965)]. This being so, it should certainly follow that a defendant is under no obligation to volunteer to the authorities at the first opportunity the exculpatory story he later tells at his trial and cannot be penalized directly or indirectly if he does not____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 114-15, 358 A.2d 163.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The Court in <em>Deatore </em>also noted that its holding applied to a defendant whether or not that defendant had received his/her <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 117 n. 10, 358 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Later in 1976, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>610, 619, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2240, 2245, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>91, 98 (1976), held that \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of [a defendant\u2019s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violate[s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d The United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">Despite the importance of cross-examination, we have concluded that the <em>Miranda </em>decision compels rejection of the State\u2019s position. The warnings mandated by that case, as a prophylactic means of safeguarding Fifth Amendment rights require that a person taken into custody be advised immediately that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says may be used against him, and that he has a right to retained or appointed counsel before submitting to interrogation. Silence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous because of what the State is required to advise the person arrested. Moreover, while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>[Id. at 617-18, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2244-45, 49 L.Ed.2d at 97-98 (footnotes and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">An important distinction between the prohibition on the use of post-arrest silence set forth by our Court in <em>State v. Deatore, supra, </em>and the prohibition announced by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, supra, </em>is that New Jersey\u2019s rule applies to all post-arrest silence while the <em>Doyle </em>Court\u2019s holding was limited to post-arrest silence following a <em>Miranda </em>warning. <em>See Fletcher v. Weir, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>603, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1309, 71 L.Ed.2d 490 (1982) (permitting the prosecutor to impeach a defendant with the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence when the defendant had not been given a <em>Miranda </em>warning). New Jersey courts have extended <em>Deatore </em>not only to a prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination impeachment of a defendant, but also to a prosecutor\u2019s use during summation of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Aceta, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 28, 537 A.2d 1317 (App.Div.1988) (holding that a prosecutor\u2019s use of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, which included comments on the silence during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, violated the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent). <em>See also State v. Lyle, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>403, 409-11, 375 A.2d 629 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the present matter concerning defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence ordinarily would be improper. Here, however, defendant \u201copened the door,\u201d <em>see, e.g., McGautha v. California, </em>402 <em>U.S. </em>183, 213, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1454, 1470, 28 <em>L.</em>Ed.2d 711, 730 (1971), to this otherwise protected area, justifying the prosecutor\u2019s comments on defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">On direct examination, defendant initially testified that he tried to explain to the police what happened but that they ignored him. Then defendant declared that after he was arrested, no police official asked him for his version of the events. Defendant was explaining his post-arrest silence, apparently attempting to show that his story was not the result of a recent fabrication. Yet, in doing so, defendant necessarily raised the issue of his post-arrest silence. Further, in his summation, defense counsel declared that defendant was never permitted to explain to the State what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>occurred behind the Red Parrot. Again, these comments raised the issue of defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In light of the foregoing testimony and summation, the prosecutor had a right, if not a duty, in the presentation of the State\u2019s case to comment on defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence and to offer the State\u2019s version as to why defendant was silent. In sum, the prosecutor\u2019s comments on summation concerning defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence did not constitute error, let alone plain error, requiring a reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We agree, however, with defendant that the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of acceptable prosecutorial conduct by injecting her personal beliefs, during her summation, as to defendant\u2019s credibility. Although it is well settled that a prosecutor enjoys wide discretion during summation, we have on occasion expressed concern over the increasing frequency of prosecutorial excesses. <em>See, e.g., State v. Acker, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>351, 355, 627 A.2d 170 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>485, 634 A.2d 530 (1993); <em>State v. Watson, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 362-63, 540 A.2d 875 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>620, 546 A.2d 537, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>983, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>535, 102 L.Ed.2d 566 (1988). In <em>State v. Goode, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 91-92, 650 A.2d 393 (App.Div.1994), we emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">Those entrusted with the responsibility of representing the State at criminal prosecutions must never forget their fundamental obligation is not to convict but to see that justice is done. <em>State v. Marshall, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>1, 586 A.2d 85 (1991); <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 293 A.2d 176 (1972). If fairness and justice are forgotten in the pursuit of a guilty verdict, the integrity and authority of our criminal justice system is challenged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">We have consistently recognized trials do not occur in a vacuum and a courtroom is not a classroom. Chief Justice Wilentz has noted \u201c... rhetorical excesses ... invariably attend litigation.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>393, 456, 550 A.2d 1172 (1988). Thus, prosecutors are afforded considerable leeway in their remarks to the jury. <em>State v. Purnell, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>518, 540, 601 A.2d 175 (1992). This recognition, however, cannot obscure the fact that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">\u2018----because the prosecutor represents the government and people of the State, it is reasonable to say that jurors have confidence that he will fairly fulfill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>his duty to see that justice is done whether by conviction of the guilty or acquittal of the innocent.\u2019 <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 105 [293 A.2d 176] (1972). His comments during opening and closing carry the full authority of the State. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>489, 511 [158 A.2d 11] (1960). Hence, we cannot sit idly by and condone prosecutorial excesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">[Quoting <em>State v. Spano, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>566, 568, 319 A.2d 217 (1974) (alterations and omissions in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Here, the prosecutor, during her summation, repeatedly expressed her personal opinion as to defendant\u2019s credibility. For example, she said of defendant: \u201cI don\u2019t think he was credible, and I don\u2019t think you should buy his story because I don\u2019t buy it[;]\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it[;]\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t buy it. I don\u2019t think you should buy it[;]\u201d and \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the sign of someone who\u2019s trying to get away from somebody. That\u2019s the sign of a thief. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d It is clearly improper for a prosecutor to give a jury his or her personal opinion regarding a case. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hinds, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 18, 650 A.2d 350 (App.Div.1994), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>540, 674 A.2d 161 (1996). The reasons such opinions are improper are because the jury may view it as an invitation from the prosecutor to rely on him/her as a crime expert and because the jury may imply that the prosecutor\u2019s judgment is based on evidence not presented at trial. <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). In addition, and building upon the first reason, the jury may adopt the prosecutor\u2019s view without applying its own independent judgment due, in part, to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cofficial and personal influence!/]\u201d <em>State v. Thornton, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>380, 398, 185 A.2d 9 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 <em>U.S. </em>816, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1710, 10 <em>L. Ed </em>2d 1039 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">While a prosecutor has the right to call to the jury\u2019s attention discrepancies in a defendant\u2019s testimony and then argue that the defendant was not truthful, a prosecutor cannot express a personal opinion regarding the credibility of a defendant\u2019s testimony, as the prosecutor repeatedly did here. In our view, it was improper for the prosecutor to inject her personal opinions as to defendant\u2019s credibility in this matter, and the State concedes as much. However, the State argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were harmless and did not prejudice defendant\u2019s right to a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>trial. While such remarks may be harmless in other circumstances, the repetitive nature and the cumulative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks here had a clear capacity to prejudice defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>See State v. Rose, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>454, 523-24, 548 A.2d 1058 (1988); <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>125, 129-30,106 A.2d 541 (1954); <em>State v. Acker, supra, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 358, 627 A.2d 170. We, therefore, are constrained to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand the matter for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Since the matter must be retried, we deem it appropriate to caution the trial court that defendant\u2019s prior probation violation may not be used to impeach his credibility. The trial court here properly held, following a hearing pursuant to <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 386 A.2d 378 (1978), and <em>State v. Brunson, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>377, 625 A.2d 1085 (1993), that the State could impeach defendant\u2019s credibility with evidence of his prior convictions if defendant took the stand. The trial court explained that the State could either offer defendant\u2019s prior robbery conviction but not his burglary conviction and not sanitize the robbery conviction or offer both convictions and sanitize them pursuant to <em>State v. Brunson, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 394, 625 A.2d 1085. The trial court further ruled that if the State chose the latter approach, it could elicit the indictment numbers of the offenses, the grades of the offenses, and the dates on which defendant was sentenced. Yet, the trial court, relying on <em>State v. Epps, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>266, 612 A.2d 391 (Law Div.1992), also held that the State could \u201cget into the fact that the defendant was sent away to State prison and received a five-year term ... after violating probation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">When defendant took the stand he admitted in response to his counsel\u2019s questioning that he had been convicted of two prior crimes and had previously violated his probation. Thereafter, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>cross-examination, the following exchange took place between the prosecutor and defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">Q: Mr. Jenkins, on October 5th of 1984, you were sentenced to indeterminate to seven years on a second-degree offense; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">A: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">Q: And then on July 19th, 1991, you were given 364 days in the county jail, three years probation on a third-degree offense; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">A: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">Q: And subsequently about a year later, August 21st of \u201992, you were resentenced on a violation of probation to four years in state prison; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">A: Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">In summation, the prosecutor made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">Ladies and gentleman, this is the defendant who has had two past convictions. He shows that he has not abided by the law in this state and that he was sentenced on a violation of probation to four years in the state prison. Do you believe he would be credible when he puts his hand on the Bible and takes the oath and swears to tell the truth the same way a law abiding citizen would be \u2014 would? That\u2019s up for you to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-14\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>609 sets forth the rule on impeaching a witness with a prior conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-15\">For the purpose of affecting the credibility of any witness, the witness\u2019 conviction of a crime shall be admitted unless excluded by the judge as remote or for other causes. Such conviction may be proved by examination, production of the record thereof, or by other competent evfdence.2</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-16\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>609, which follows the provisions contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-12, as interpreted by <em>State v. Sands, supra, </em>applies only to criminal convictions. <em>Cf. </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>609 (1996-97) (referring only to criminal convictions in explaining the purview of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>609). This is abundantly clear, as appears from the following excerpt from the 1991 Supreme Court Rule Committee Comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-17\">2 The New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice defines \"prior conviction of a crime\" in the following manner: \"An adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction that the defendant committed a crime constitutes a prior conviction, although sentence or the execution thereof was suspended, provided that the time to appeal has expired and that the defendant was not pardoned on the ground of innocence.\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-4b.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>While this rule draws no distinction between crimes of dishonesty or false statement and other crimes, it is clear that it applies only to indictable offenses which are the subject of valid convictions. Neither evidence of arrests for or charges of crimes are admissible under this rule. <em>See, e.g., State v. McBride, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 267, 517 A.2d 152 (App.Div.1986). Neither are convictions of disorderly persons offenses or traffic violations. <em>See, e.g., State v. Rowe, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>293, 302, 271 A.2d 897 (1970). Nor are adjudications of juvenile delinquency. <em>See State in Interest of K.P. </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 293-94, 400 A.2d 840 (App.Div.1979), <em>certif. denied, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>394, 434 A.2d 1075 (1981). And, it has been held, uncounselled convictions are inadmissible. <em>State v. Rios, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>11, 15, 382 A.2d 82 (Law Div.197[7]). <em>See also State v. Koch, </em>119 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 290 A.2d 738 (App.Div.1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">A probation violation is distinguished from a criminal conviction even though a custodial sentence may result from such a violation. While a probation revocation proceeding is a step in the corrections process that involves a potential loss of liberty and requires due process, the probation violation itself does not constitute a criminal conviction. In <em>State v. Reyes, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 134-37, 504 A.2d 43 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>499, 511 A.2d 671 (1986), we recognized the differences between a criminal prosecution and a probation violation proceeding and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">Revocation of probation is not a stage in a criminal prosecution, but, rather, a part of the corrections process____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">A violation-of-probation hearing is summary in nature. That was plainly expressed in the repealed N.J.S.A 2A:168-4 and is implicit in the current <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3a(4). In both <em>Gagnon [v. Scarpelli </em>] (involving probation), and <em>Morissey [v. Brewer] </em>(involving parole), the [United States] Supreme Court stressed the informal and flexible nature of revocation hearings and the lack of need or justification for the range of protections available to defendants in criminal trials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">New Jersey has not imposed stricter state constitutional standards on probation violation hearings than the United States Constitution demands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">By what standard is a court to be \u201csatisfied\u201d that a violation occurred? Proof of violation beyond a reasonable doubt is not constitutionally required as it is in criminal trials____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">... We hold, therefore, that a court may not find a violation of probation unless defendant has been convicted of another offense or the court is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>In <em>State v. Lavoy, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>594, 600, 614 A.2d 1077 (App.Div.1992), we again noted the differences between a criminal prosecution and a probation violation proceeding, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">[a] charge of a violation of probation is not a criminal prosecution but rather \u201ca part of the corrections process.\u201d <em>State v. Reyes, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 134, 504 A.2d 43 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>499, 511 A.2d 671 (1986). Therefore, a defendant accused of violating the terms of probation is not entitled to indictment or trial by jury, <em>State v. Zachowski </em>53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 440, 147 A.2d 584 (App.Div.1959), and he may be found guilty by a simple preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Reyes, supra, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 134-37, 504 A.2d 43. Furthermore, a violation of probation may be based on hearsay evidence which would be inadmissible in a criminal trial. <em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 504 A.2d 43.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 600, 614 A.2d 1077.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Other courts have also determined that a probation violation is not equivalent to a prior conviction for impeachment purposes. For instance, in <em>Cross v. State, </em>586 S.W.2d 478, 481 (Tex.Crim.App.1979), the Texas court determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">revocation of probation is not a conviction____ [Probation revocation proceedings are not trials. Probation revocation proceedings are administrative in nature. A violation of probation conditions need be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt (as is required for a conviction, a suspended sentence, or a judgment granting probation). Its value as proof of prior misconduct is correspondingly lower. Because of these differences, a probation revocation does not fall within the \u201cconviction exception\u201d to the general rule forbidding proof of prior acts of misconduct [to impeach.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\"><em>See also Favor v. State, </em>389 So.2d 556, 559-60 (Ala.Crim.App.1980) (determining that \u201ca probation violation is not a \u2018crime\u2019 of any kind,\u201d and was thus <em>per se </em>inadmissible to impeach a witness as a prior conviction); <em>State v. Anonymous (1978-1), </em>34 <em>Conn.Supp. </em>656, 384 A.2d 386, 389 (1978) (\u201cA violation of probation is not a crime which could be introduced to impeach a witness.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Roberts, </em>423 <em>Mass. </em>17, 666 N.E.2d 475, 478 (1996) (\u201cAlthough convictions ... may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s character for truthfulness, probation violations may not be so used.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Ford, </em>397 <em>Mass. </em>298, 490 N.E.2d 1166, 1168 (1986) (holding that it was error to admit extraneous material, which included violations of probation, with records of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions to impeach him). <em>But see State v. Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>kins, </em>34 <em>N.C.App. </em>392, 238 S.E.2d 659, 663-64 (1977) (finding that it was not an abuse of discretion for a trial court to permit a witness to be cross-examined concerning the witness\u2019s prior probation violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Since a probation violation is not a criminal conviction, it cannot be used for impeachment purposes under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>609. However, the ultimate sentence that a defendant may have received for a prior conviction as a result of a subsequent probation violation may be used to impeach the defendant under the rule. The admission of such sentencing information is particularly appropriate where, as here, the prior conviction has been sanitized pursuant to <em>State v. Brunson, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 394, 625 A.2d 1085. <em>See State v. Hicks, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>301, 309-10, 661 A.2d 1300 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>327, 670 A.2d 1068 (1996). Consequently, in the event that defendant testifies on retrial and his prior burglary conviction is used to impeach him, the trial court may, in its discretion, admit evidence of any sentence imposed upon defendant for his probation violation without reference to the violation itself. We disapprove of <em>State v. Epps, supra, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 272-73, 612 A.2d 391, to the extent that it would also permit the probation violation or the facts underlying that violation to be used for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s convictions and the sentences imposed thereon are vacated and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> The probation violation occurred while defendant was on probation for his prior burglary conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
