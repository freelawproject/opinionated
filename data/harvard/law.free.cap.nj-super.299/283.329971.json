During these five consecutive employments, Goldberg\u2019s cumulative days of absence from work totaled 362.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">On April 27, 1995, the Board voted simply not to renew Goldberg\u2019s annual contract. No disciplinary action was taken. The Association then filed a grievance on behalf of Goldberg, contending that \u201cthe termination of employment is in violation of her contractual rights guaranteed in Section One, Article IV, Employee Rights, H. among other contractual violations,\u201d seeking thereby to convert the failure to renew into a disciplinary matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The collective negotiation agreement between the Board and the Association provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-13\">[Section One, Art. I, CJ</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-14\">4c. The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to add to, subtract from, change or modify any of the terms of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-16\">[Section One, Art. IV, <em>Employee </em>Rights.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>H. No employee shall be disciplined without just cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">[Section One, Article VI, <em>Management </em>Rights.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">B. The exercise of the foregoing powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities by the Board, <em>the adoption of policies, </em>rules, regulations and practices in furtherance thereof, and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith <em>shall be limited only by the specific and expressed terms of this agreement </em>and then only to the extent such specific and expressed terms hereof are in conformance with the Constitution and the laws of the State of New Jersey, and the Constitution and laws of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The Board\u2019s policy number 4210, implemented July 1, 1990, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\"><em>It is the policy of this district that transportation, </em>cafeteria, eustodial/maintenance, cafeteria aides, instructional aides, and library aides personnel <em>be employed on an annual contract basis with the proviso that annual renewal is a prerogative of the board. </em>It is not the intent of the board to provide tenure status to any employees in these categories nor to any other employee for whom tenure provision is not made in law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">The grievance procedure is governed by Section One, Article III, of the collective negotiation agreement and consists of four levels. The final level is binding arbitration. Goldberg sought reinstatement \u201cat a job fitting the positions she left at [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">After Goldberg\u2019s assertion of a grievance was rejected by both the school superintendent and the Board, the Association filed a request for arbitration with the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC). An arbitration was scheduled by PERC for March 1996, but was postponed by reason of the Board\u2019s initiation of this suit to restrain the arbitration by an \u201cOrder to Show Cause\u201d in the Chancery Division. The Board contended that the grievance was not arbitrable inasmuch as the contract \u201cdid not confer the right of reemployment to bus drivers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">By order entered May 13, 1996, the Chancery judge dismissed the Board\u2019s complaint seeking to restrain arbitration, citing \u201ca wide open argument which the Arbitrator can listen to\u201d concerning whether \u201cjust cause\u201d is necessary to dismiss an at-will employee. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Our <em>review of </em>the parties\u2019 collective negotiation agreement confirms that it provides no provision which, expressly or by inference, converts annual appointments of bus drivers into de facto tenured employments. Indeed, the Board policy unambiguously states that the annual renewal of employees similarly situated to Goldberg is \u201ca prerogative of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The circumstances of the present case are markedly different from those we addressed in <em>Hunterdon Central Regional High School Bd. of Ed. v. Hunterdon Central Bus Drivers Ass\u2019n, </em>21 <em>NJPER </em>\u00b6 26030 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>277, 658 A.2d 301 (1995). There, a bus driver was suspended for disregarding work rules and warned that any further infraction would result in her dismissal. Subsequently, the employee was reprimanded for violation of another work rule. The Board then reviewed the charges, and terminated her employment effective at the expiration of her contract. In other words, a disciplinary action was alive at the time for contract renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In affirming PERC\u2019s decision that the bus driver\u2019s grievance following her termination was arbitrable, we noted that \u201ca school board may agree to extend contractual tenure to a non-professional employee such as a bus driver by a promise to continue his or her employment absent just cause for termination or renewal.\u201d <em>Hunterdon, supra. </em>We concluded therefore, that the question of whether the Board negotiated job security was one for the arbitrator. <em>Id. </em>In the present case, the contract (Section Five, Art. XXXIV, C) and the Board policy expressly incorporated by the contract clearly indicate that a bus driver\u2019s employment may be ended without cause, subject to notification before April 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The Board here did not purport to discipline Goldberg, nor is there any reason so to characterize its decision not to rehire her. It merely exercised a clearly enunciated contractual right not to renew, an issue we do not regard as arbitrable in these circumstances. We decline to insert judicially a tenure provision into a contract when it was not negotiated by the parties. <em>See Standard Refinery Union v. Esso Standard Oil Co., </em>31 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>548, 552, 107 A.2d 513 (App.Div.1954)(\u201c[C]ourt will not write a new contract for the parties or vary, enlarge, alter or distort its terms for the benefit of one to the detriment of the other under the guise of judicial interpretation.\u201d). However, even if we deemed this to be a disciplinary termination, the rights of a similarly situated disciplinee should rise no higher than those of a faultless employee who had no right to reemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">At oral argument, the Association sought to invoke the holding in cases such as <em>Branti v. </em>Finkel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, 445 <em>U.S. </em>507, 512 n. 6, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1287, 1291-1292 n. 6, 63 L.Ed.2d 574, 587 n. 6 (1980) and <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>347, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) to support a holding that there is no difference between a termination and nonrenewal of contract of an at-will employee. These must be understood in the context of the First Amendment settings in which they arose. This is not a case in which it is asserted that Goldberg was not reappointed because of her political affiliations or lack of political affiliation. <em>Compare Battaglia v. Union Cty. Welfare Bd., </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>48, 55-63, 438 A.2d 530 (1981), <em>cert. den. </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>965, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2045, 72 L.Ed.2d 490 (extermination or refusal to re-appoint an at-will public employee does not give rise to a cause of action, unless it fits the <em>Branti-Elrod </em>pattern.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Reversed and remanded for entry of an order precluding arbitration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-17\"> 20.5 days in 1990-1991; 69 days in 1991-1992; 13.5 days in 1992-1993; 76.5 days in 1993-1994; and 183 days (the entire school year) in 1994-1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> Cited in <em>Hunterdon, supra. </em>This case, and the more recently decided U.S. Supreme Court decision in <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. </em>Umbehr,-U.S.-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>2342, 135 L.Ed.2d 843 (1996) and <em>O\u2019Hare Truck Service v.
