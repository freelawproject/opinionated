It is, therefore, a question of great public importance, and a speedy decision of this court thereon would prevent much litigation and expense.</p>\n<p id=\"A5A\">\u201c Although the money in dispute was not actually paid into court by the plaintiffs in error, yet it was in fact treated as though it had been done under the following agreement, between the said H. T. Hoffman, treasurer of Lebanon county, of the one part, and the plaintiffs in error and twenty-three other dealers in liquor, resident in said Lebanon, of the other part, viz: That each of said parties of the second part should pay the sum of five hundred dollars demanded for their licenses by the said treasurer of Lebanon county, upon the express condition that he, the said treasurer of Lebanon county, would, in case the judgment of this cou-rt fixed a less amount, refund the excess so paid.</p>\n<p id=\"ATz\">\u201c Hon. J. B. McPherson, A. L. J., before whom the above case-stated was argued in the court below, authorizes us to state to this court that the above case-stated is founded upon an actual dispute and contention; that it was not entered into by collusion of the parties; that it involves a question of great public importance and that he is ready and willing to certify to said state of facts, if this court so desires.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">\u201c The delay in the filing of these reasons in support of the motion for a re-argument of the above case, was caused by the absence from home of said Hon. J. B. McPherson, A. L.

Appeal quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">In Gray <em>v. </em>McFall, 1 Mona. 176, a case-stated was framed between a landlord and the sheriff, the landlord claiming, from a fund realized by a sheriff\u2019s sale, a year\u2019s rent due by the defendant in the execution ; it did not appear that the money was paid into court or that there was an agreement to treat it as so paid. To the case-stated is added this agreement (noted in the syllabus but by an oversight omitted from the report), signed by the execution plaintiff : \u201c The foregoing statement is admitted to be correct for the purpose of having the question in above case decided.\u201d The court below entered judgment for the plaintiff The supreme court quashed an appeal, saying that no case was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"AJu\">In Frailey\u2019s Ap., decided Feb. 25, 1890, the supreme court reversed the judgment of the court below and quashed the defective case-stated, the defect being an amendment objected to by one of the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
