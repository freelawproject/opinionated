The evidence was objected to on the ground that the agency could not be proved by the declarations of the agent, and was excluded. Another party was offered as a witness, who testified that he was the agent of the company defendant and another company, that his duties were about the same in both, that the defendant company was not organized until after the date of the transaction with the alleged agent, that he employed the alleged agent, with whom plaintiffs contracted, to procure rights of way, and that the proceeds of the rights of way go to the defendant company. Plaintiff then offered to testify as to the contract with the alleged agent, the subject of the suit, but was rejected. The court directed a verdict for defendant. <em>Held, </em>that-the judgment should be affirmed.</syllabus>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b70-12\">March 19, 1889.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aj0\">Error, No. 339, Jan.

McCollum and Mitchell, JJ., absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The declaration, after the common counts, averred a verbal contract made, on Dec. 7, 1881, between one Clark, a duly authorized agent of the defendant, a foreign corporation, and the plaintiffs, whereby the plaintiffs were to render certain services in securing a right of way for the defendant, for which services they were to receive $500. The defendant pleaded non assumpsit, payment, payment with leave and set off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">Plaintiffs proposed to prove as follows, by H. R. Mehrling, at the trial, before Cummin, P. J. :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">That William A. Clark came to him to engage him to take the right of way to lay the pipe line for a certain oil company; that Mr. Mehrling asked him to tell him, before he would engage with him, what company he was to labor with; that he said he was to labor for the National Transit Oil Company, the defendant in this case. That, in pursuance of that agreement, he was engaged; with that understanding, he was engaged by William A. Clark, and he went to work and took the right of way for the National Transit Company; and, after his labors were all over, he was referred to John B. Barbour and received a check or draft of the National Transit Company for his pay. This to show the authority of William A. Clark to act for the National Transit Company in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">Defendant\u2019s counsel objected:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">.1. That, in order to avail the plaintiff in this case, and before they can give any evidence of the declarations of William A. Clark in order to effect the National Transit Company, they must first prove that William A. Clark was an agent of the defendant, and the nature and extent of his agency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-10\">2. That the declarations of William A.

That the nature of the evidence is not admissible in this case to bind the defendant or make him liable, unless there be proof of the appointment of the agent by the Company, and the nature and extent of his authority to bind the principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-12\">4. That the offer does not pretend to show that William A. Clark was the agent of the defendant, except by his declarations, and lastly, because it is irregular and incompetent. And, further, that any acts done by the alleged agent are not proof of his authority to act for his principal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-13\">Objections sustained and exception.
