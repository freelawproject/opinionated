It appeared further by the auditor\u2019s report that the testator\u2019s estate consisted almost wholly of obligations due him by his children. By his will he bequeathed <em>$1,000 </em>to one son for testator\u2019s \u201ckeep,\u201d and further directed \u201cthe several amounts due me by my children and their husbands, for which I hold bonds and notes at the time of my decease, shall be deducted from the amounts which shall be coming to them from my estate.\u201d He further provided for an equal division of his household goods and his residuary estate among all of his children. There was also evidence before the auditor that, at the time the will was drawn, testator requested new bonds to be executed by his children. <em>Held, </em>that the court below properly directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</syllabus>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b51-10\">February 20, 1889.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aop\">Error, No. 275, Jan.

Bank of $1,400 [it is stated that the auditor\u2019s report shows that this was almost a total loss, in 1876, two years before the making of the will], and cash amounting to $84.76.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\"><em>\u201c </em>At the time that Bittle executed his will, he had Morgan Reed draw up, ready for execution, bonds for John, William, Andi'ew and J\u00e1cob Bittle and Gabriel Krown, to be executed respectively by them. These bonds he left with Reed and sent word to the several obligors to go and sign them. John and Andi'ew Bittle and Gabriel Krown did sign the bonds intended for them. William and Jacob declined to sign bonds intended for them, declaring that they did not owe the money claimed in the bonds. William admitted before the auditor owing $150, and Jacob Bittle has paid the executor $300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-8\">\u201cWhen Jacob Bittle, the decedent, was informed that his sons William and Jacob would not sign their bonds, he sent word for Mr. Reed to come and change his will.

He took bonds for the amounts due, some of them due in his life-time, some to draw interest after maturity, some not at all. He endeavored to obtain from every one of his children evidences of their respective debts to him just prior to his death, at time of execution of his will, and long after the older bonds were given. He made certain provisions in his will which he knew could not be carried out unless the bonds held against his children wex-e collected. The very wording of the will shows that he intended these bonds should be collected. \u201c The several amounts due me by my children and their husbands, for which I hold bonds and notes, shall be deducted from the amounts which shall be coming to them from my estate.\u201d The act of Jacob Bittle, Jr., in paying $300 to the executor, partly on account of one of these very notes; testator\u2019s statement to Morgan Reed when the will was drawn; all these facts show that Jacob Bittle, Sr., regarded his children as owing him the money for which he held their obligations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-9\">The bonds and notes mentioned by Jacob Bittle, Sr., in his will, ai-e as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-10\">One bond from Isaac Berger to Jacob Bittle, Sr., dated April 1, 1853, payable April 1, 1855, for $800, without interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-11\">One bond from Isaac Ehley to Jacob Bittle, Sr., dated Mai'ch 13, 1857, payable six months after the death of Jacob Bittle,Sr., without interest, for $800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-12\">Also, one bond from Isaac Ehley to Jacob Bittle, Sr., dated May 1, 1861, payable one year after the death of said Jacob Bittle, Si'., without intei'est, for $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-13\">One bond from Gabriel Krown to Jacob Bittle, Sr., date blank, payable one year after the death of Jacob Bittle, Sr., for $850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-14\">One bond from Gabidel Krown to Jacob Bittle, Sr., dated Nov. 12, 1878, payable one year after the decease of the said Jacob Bittle, Si'., without interest, for $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-15\">One bond from John Bittle to Jacob Bittle, Sr., dated Nov. 12, 1878, payable one year after the decease of the said Jacob Bittle, Sr., without intei'est, for $1,300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-16\">One bond from Andi'ew Bittle to Jacob Bittle, dated Nov. 12, 1878, payable one year \u00e1fter the decease of the said Jacob Bittle, Si'., without interest, for $1,178.17.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-17\">One bond from Jacob Bittle, Jr., to Jacob Bittle, Sr., dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>March 23, 1864, payable April 1, 1869, without interest until due, for $200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">Also, one bond from same to same, dated April 1,1861, payable one year after the decease of the said Jacob Bittle, Sr., without interest, for $1,300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">Also, one note from same to same, dated July 26,1866, payable nine months after date, for $205.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">Bond William Bittle to Jacob Bittle, Sr., for $850.
