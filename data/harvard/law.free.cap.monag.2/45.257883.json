Upon this note, judgment was entered by Mrs. Moeller, Sept. 2, 1885. Mrs. Moeller died Oct. 9, 1885, having previously intermarried with one Henry Sanwald. On Oct. 30, 1885, her death was suggested upon the record and her administrator, Otto A. Seidel, was substituted as plaintiff. On Aug. 23, 1886, an attachment sur judgment was issued by the administrator against the Redemptorist Fathers of Pennsylvania et ah, as garnishees. Whereupon the judgment debtor, Philip Maier, paid the amount of the judgment with interest, amounting in all to $440, to the counsel for Seidel. On Aug. 27, 1886, the attachment was discontinued. The money loaned to Maier by Mrs. Sanwald was drawn by her, for that purpose, from St. Bonifacius\u2019 Church, where it was deposited in her own name. Witnesses called by the plaintiff testified that the decedent, Mrs. Sanwald, had, in her life-time, made the following declarations:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">To Philip Maier: \u201cThe money [which she offered to loan Maier] was in the Church for the boy. It was left for him by his father, Mr. Moeller.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-12\">To Margaret Remmert: \u201cIt [the money loaned Maier] belonged to the boy. The boy\u2019s father left $2,000 when he died. The $400 was from his. father.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-14\">To Anton Remmert: \u201cShe said it [the $400] belonged to the boy.

Was left by his father to him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">Upon this testimony, the plaintiff rested his case. The defendant offered no evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">The defendant submitted the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">\u201c 1. There is no evidence in this case to show that the defendant ever had and received any money for or on account of the plaintiff or of his ward; and, under the pleadings filed, without such evidence, the plaintiff cannot recover. <em>Ans. </em>Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-10\">\u201c 2. The evidence presented by the plaintiff is insufficient to establish a trust by the decedent in the judgment from which the fund in controversy arises. <em>Ans. </em>Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-11\">\u201c 3. The fund in controversy, having been paid to and received by the defendant as administrator of the decedent under a claim of right thereto, the said administrator is responsible for such fund to the creditors of the decedent and to those entitled to take from her under the intestate laws of this Commonwealth, and to them only; and therefore the present action cannot be maintained against him in his representative capacity. <em>Ans. </em>Refused. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-12\">\u201c 4. The evidence in this case shows no privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, and, without such privity being shown, the plaintiff, in an action of assumpsit, cannot recover. <em>Ans. </em>Refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-13\">\u201c 5. Under all the evidence, the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant. <em>Ans. </em>Refused.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-14\">The court charged as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-15\">\u201c If you believe, under the evidence in this case, that the money belongs to this boy, I think he has a right to recover in this suit. This was the case of a mother who had married again, and she had on hand $400, which she said belonged to her son. Then this gentleman who borrowed the money came to her and she told him specifically she let him have the $400, because she had that amount in the Church and it belonged to her son, who had no use for it, and on the faith of that he took it. The note was taken in her name and could not be paid to anybody else, but [if you believe the evidence here that it was the son\u2019s money she had invested for him, he is entitled to it, and therefore your verdict should be for the plaintiff.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-16\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified, x \u2014 5, the action of the court in declining defendant\u2019s points, quoting them; and, 6, the portion of the charge within brackets, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-17\"><em>James C.

For money, so received, he might be liable personally, but not as administrator. Griers. Huston, 8 S. &amp; R. 402; Beeson <em>v. </em>McNabb, 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Pa. 422; Solliday <em>v. </em>Bissey, 12 Pa. 347; Seip <em>v. </em>Drach, 14 Pa. 352.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-4\">The proof of the alleged trust rested entirely upon the declarations of the decedent to or in the presence of four persons. She did not say who the boy was to whom she referred,' nor was there any evidence to show how it was left, nor how it had come into her hands. It was deposited in her individual name in the Church, whence it was drawn to be loaned to Maier, again in her individual name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">While a trust in personalty may be proved by parol, the evidence required is of the higest degree, and great caution is used that the proof shall be clear and positive.

Not only must the declarations be clear and preponderating, but they must be corroborated. Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 77; Reed on Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">The defendant found, among the assets of his intestate, this judgment, standing in her individual name, and, as his duty re-, quired, proceeded to collect it by process of law. The money was claimed by him as assets of the estate, and, under this claim of right, was paid to and received by him. Having been so received, he is accountable for it to creditors and distributees, and. to them only. As administrator, he can be called to account by no one else.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-8\">Moreover, the money having thus been collected by him under a claim of right, there being no mistake as to the facts, it cannot be recovered back.

Co. <em>v. </em>Allegheny, 101 Pa. 250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-9\">There was no privity of contract between the plaintiff and defendant. Without such privity, an action of assumpsit cannot be maintained.

Knittel, </em>for defendant in error, not heard.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKQ\">This is substantially a claim against decedent\u2019s estate for money received by her in her life time to the use of the minor, and not a claim arising from any wrongful act of the administrator. He collected the money, and, when he had so collected it as administrator, it was clearly his duty to act in the place of decedent and pay the same on demand of the guardian of the equitable owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-11\">Grier <em>v. </em>Huston, and Solliday <em>v. </em>Bissey, were on promises made by the administrator after the death of the intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-12\">In Beeson <em>v. </em>McNabb, the suit was against the person who had been the acting executor of the estate, who received the money to pay the widow by order of the orphan\u2019s court.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AMD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Jan. 18, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">In Seip <em>v. </em>Drach, it was decided that no judgment de bonis testatoris could be obtained against an executor on a count for money-had and received by him as executor, to and for the use of the plaintiff, because there was nothing in the count to indicate that the action was brought to recover a debt due by the decedent. But, as the case in hand is substantially a claim against the decedent\u2019s estate, for money received by her in her lifetime to the use of the minor, the omission to allege the same in the common counts and the bill of particulars is cured by the verdict and judgment. Act of March 14, 1872, \u00a7 1, P. L. 25, Purd. 94, pi. 7; Jones <em>v. </em>Freyer, 33 W. N. C. 365.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">A declaration by a person, on investing money on a mortgage, \u201cthat a security was to be made in the name of his brother Job, as he intended the mortgage to be for his benefit, and that it would then be his,\u201d has been considered sufficient. And, in like manner, a trust was decreed on a verbal declaration, that an investment of stock was in trust for four children equally.
