T., 1888, to C. P. No. 3, Phila. Co., to review the action of the court in refusing to open a judgment by Louis Lang against Henry Drummond. Trunkey, Green and Williams, JJ., absent:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-6\">The affidavit for the rule by the appellee averred that the appeal was taken merely for purposes of delay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-7\">The printed statement of counsel for the rule asserted that, after the judgment in this case was entered on a warrant, defendant gave security for one year\u2019s stay from Sept. 4, 1886. At the time this stay was about to expire, the appellant, after paying over $200 on account of the debt, retained other counsel and took this rule to open the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b809-8\">The affidavit of the appellant denied that the appeal was taken for purposes of delay, but asserted that the rule to open the judgment was argued in the court below Nov. 27, 1887, and discharged the same day; that this appeal was perfected forthwith and made returnable to the first Moneay of January, 1888, that, by great exertion, appellant\u2019s paper-book was completed and the case argued Jan. 27, 1888, as soon as reached. [Reported in n Cent. 626; 12 Atl. 658.] The case was next to the last on the list, and the delay of a single day, perhaps, on the part of appellant in perfecting his appeal, would have postponed this appeal until March, 1888.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b809-9\"><em>Edward F.
