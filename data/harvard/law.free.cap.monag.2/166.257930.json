After his death, a notice was issued, signed with the firm name, announcing the death of the decedent and stating that, in accordance with the directions of the will of the deceased partner, his estate and interest in the firm and its property would remain as before, and the business be conducted under the same firm name by the surviving partners and the executors of the deceased partner. One of the executors, who was the deceased partner\u2019s widow, knew nothing of the notice, nor did she take part in the conduct of the business ; but she received from the firm the same weekly allowance which her husband had received. In an action against the surviving partners and the executors individually, in order to fix an \u25a0individual liability on the part of the executors, the court entered a non-suit on the ground that the parties had not been proved to constitute a partnership. Held, not to be error.</syllabus>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b200-6\">Feb. 15, 1889.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqWY\">Error, No. 66, Jan. T. 1889, to C. P. Chester Co., to review a judgment of non-suit in an action of assumpsit by the National State Bank of Camden, against Charles E. Pennock, Wm. Pennock, John S. Pennock, Annie E. Pennock, and John C. Bradley, lately trading as C. E. Pennock &amp; Co., at Jan. T. 1888, No. 106.

J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">The firm of C. E. Pennock &amp; Co., immediately prior to July 11, 1887, was composed of Chas. E. Pennock, Joseph L. Pennock, William Pennock and John S. Pennock. On that date, Joseph L. Pennock died, leaving a will, in which he provided as follows: \u201c I direct my executors to continue my interest in the firm of C. E. Pennock &amp; Co. for five years from the 1st of January next succeeding my decease, and for such further period as my executors, or a majority of them, may deem proper.\u201d Of Mr. Pennock\u2019s will, Annie E. Pennock, Charles E. Pennock and John C. Bradley were executors, and were duly qualified and assumed the duties incident to their office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">The business of the firm was continued under the old firm name until August 29, 1887, when an assignment for the benefit of creditors was made. On July 22, 1887, the following circular, signed with the firm -name, was sent to the firm\u2019s customers and to banks with which they had had dealings :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">\u201c It becomes our painful duty to announce the death of Mr. Joseph L. Pennock, a member of our firm. In accordance with the directions of the will of the deceased, his estate and interest in the firm and its property will remain as heretofore, and the business be conducted under the same firm name by the surviving partners and the executors of deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-11\">The notes in suit were discounted with the bank plaintiff by Robert Hare Powel &amp; Co., of Phila. The firm of C. E. Pennock &amp; Co., since about 1854, was a customer, each year, to a large amount, with Robert Hare Powel &amp; Company. The firms of Robert Hare Powel &amp; Co. and C. E. Pennock &amp; Co. were accustomed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to exchange their negotiable \u2018paper for their mutual accommodation. It was admitted by Charles E. Pennock, one of the .defendants, who was called by way of cross-examination, that a copy of the notice of July 22, 1887, was sent by them to Robert Hare Powel &amp; Co. Mr. Bradley, one of the executors, was a member of the firm of Robert Hare Powel &amp; Co. The notes in suit were dated July 11, July 18, July 23 and Aug. 5, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">It did not appear that Mrs. Annie E. Pennock knew of the notice of Sept. 22, 1887. Nor did it appear that she or Mr. Bradley took any part in the management of the business of the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">The division of the profits of the business was the same after as before Joseph L. Pennock\u2019s death, his widow, Annie E. Pennock, one of the executors, receiving the share received by her husband before his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, counsel for defendant moved for the entry of a non-suit, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury, from which they would be justified in finding that the\u2019surviving partners and the executors of the deceased partner were liable as a firm on the notes in suit. The court entered the non-suit, and subsequently refused to take it off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\"><em>The assignments of error </em>specified the action of the court, 1, in entering the non-suit; and, 2, in refusing to take it off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-10\"><em>R.

Under the will, the executors were bound to leave their testator\u2019s interest in the firm, without any control on their part, and the old firm would continue as before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-10\">Articles of partnership which simply provide that, on the death of one partner, his capital shall be left in the business until the end of the partnership term, do not require the admission of the executor of a deceased partner in the management or control of the business, and if he does not personally engage in the business he will not be personally liable for debts, though he leaves the testator\u2019s capital in the business. In- such cases, creditors becoming such after the death of one of the partners, have only the liability of the surviving partner by whom the business is carried on, and the security of the capital of the deceased partner which is left in the business.

Her husband received that sum weekly, and on that account it was paid her. It was not received by her under any ageeement to receive it as profits, which is the essence of liability by virtue of a receipt of profits. It was not paid her on account of profits, and no inference can be drawn from it prejudicial to her without it is shown that she knew it was on that account and received it as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-12\">Mrs. Pennock was not consulted about the issuance of the circular dated July 22, 1887, and never knew of it until after the failure. She cannot be visited with any of the consequences that might flow \u25a0 from its publication. It does not prove a partnership. It purported to be issued by the late firm, and necessarily bound no one but the surviving partners. Schull\u2019s Appeal, 115 Pa. 141.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aci\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Feb. 15, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">The only effect it can have is by way of estoppel. As she had no knowledge of it and had no part in its circulation, she is not estopped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">It is difficult to perceive how any knowledge the payees of the notes had of the circular could avail the plaintiff, to whom they passed the notes, and no reason is suggested for the position. If it were otherwise, however, Mr. Bradley, as a member of the firm of Robert Hare Powell &amp; Co., to whom the notes were given, knew that no new firm had been formed, and that neither Mrs. Pennock nor himself were personally engaged in the management. His knowledge was that of his firm, and there consequently was no misleading as to them. And, if the payees were suing, they could not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">The only inference from the notice would be that the executors would take part in the conduct of the business to the extent directed in the will, and all parties in interest would be bound to look to the terms of the will to see the extent of their power in so conducting the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">Parties who deal with an executor, exercising his power of disposition of the personal assets of the estate in his hands, to raise money, not for the estate or the settlement of its affairs, but for the business of a commercial firm, are bound to look into his authority, and are held to a knowledge of all the limitations which the will, as well as the law, puts thereon.
