The arbitrator made an award in favor of the plaintiff for $287. Upon exceptions filed thereto, and upon examination of the figures shown by the evidence before the arbitrator and by him attached to his award, the court below was convinced that the arbitrator had made an error in his methods of calculation, and entered judgment on Oct. 13, 1888, in favor of the defendant for $129.91 and costs. By the specification of error filed, the judgment refered to is the error complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b697-11\">\u201c But it also appears, by the record on file in this court, that, on Dec. 7, 1888, the court struck the said judgment from the record and entered a decree in the following language: \u2018 And now, Dec. 7, 1888, it appearing that the .decree of this court, made Oct. 13, 1888, after argument of the exceptions filed to the award of the referee, ordering judgment to be entered in favor of the defendant and against plaintiff, in the sum of $129.91, was improvidently entered as to the form of the finding of the court, it is now ordered that said judgment be stricken off, and it is further ordered and decreed that the second exception of defendant to said award is sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>tained, it plainly appearing to the court that defendant has overpaid said plaintiff to the amount of $112.96, and the said award is directed to be returned to said William Grew, Esq., arbitrator for amendment and correction in accordance herewith.\u2019</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsUI\">Jan. 19, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-5\">\u201cWherefore, by the records now in this court, it appears there is no definitive judgment upon which this court may act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-6\">\u201cWherefore, the defendant prays the said writ of error may be quashed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b698-7\">The writ of error in this case was taken Nov. 26, 1888.
